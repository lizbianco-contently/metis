Mr. President, this morning I have the honor of meeting \nwith Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jafari. The Prime Minister is in \nthe United States to meet with President Bush and other Washington \nleaders to discuss the next steps in Iraq's transition to a free and \ndemocratic society. I have not yet met the Prime Minister. I look \nforward to doing so in the next couple of hours.\n  The Prime Minister deserves great praise for his leadership. He has \nworked hard as Prime Minister to reach out across ethnic and religious \nlines. Because of his efforts, Iraq is led by a transitional government \nthat includes ministers from each of Iraq's ethnic and religious \ngroups.\n  The Prime Minister's steady leadership has been inspiring. Next \nTuesday, 5 days from now, June 28, will mark the 1-year anniversary of \nthe transfer of sovereignty from the Coalition Provisional Authority to \na sovereign Iraqi Government. Since then, Iraq has fought the \ninsurgency with determination as it has undergone truly remarkable \nchanges. Perhaps none was more remarkable than the elections on January \n31. On that day, 8 million Iraqis cast their votes for the first \ndemocratically elected national assembly in more than 50 years. They \ncame on foot, they came by car and some even came by wagon. They defied \nall manner of terrorist threat and terrorist intimidation.\n  It was truly extraordinary. No one who saw the images of those brave \ncitizens emerging from the polling stations, holding aloft those \nstained, blue-inked fingers, could help but be moved and inspired. \nWhile the task of forming\n\n[[Page S7204]]\n\na government has taken much longer than any of us would have hoped, the \nIraqi people now turn to the task of drafting a constitution and laying \nthe groundwork for a new round of elections at this year's end.\n\n  Last week, leaders of the 55-member committee charged with drafting \nthe new constitution reached a compromise with the Sunni Arab groups. \nTogether, they decided on the number of Sunni representatives to serve \non that committee. This was a major step forward and a significant \neffort on the part of the majority to reach out to the Sunni \nleadership. It was also significant because of the impact it could have \non the ground.\n  As we have seen political progress slow, we have watched \nunfortunately the violence increase. Building and sustaining momentum \nin the political process is clearly linked to undermining the \nterrorists and their support. During their low turnout in the January \nelections and the current spate of violence, the Sunnis realized they \ncannot achieve their aims by standing outside the process or by failing \nto face down the insurgents.\n  Like all Iraqis, they have a tremendous stake in the success of Iraq \nbecoming a peaceful and prosperous democracy. They know the best way to \nensure the outcome and to ensure their rightful place is to work \nconstructively with their fellow Iraqis. I am heartened by the efforts \nof the Shi'a and Kurd leaders to include the Sunnis in the political \nprocess.\n  These are difficult times, and they require thoughtful leadership. \nThe efforts of all parties to reach out and be inclusive deserves our \npraise and our steadfast support, as do the brave Iraqis who have \nstepped forward to defend and protect their country. The Iraqi forces \nhave suffered more deaths and casualties than coalition forces. Despite \nrepeated direct attacks on their ranks, every day thousands of young \nIraqis continue to volunteer for service. The Defense Department \nreports that, as of June 8, more than 160,000 Iraqi security forces \nhave been trained and equipped.\n  Yes, many of them have much experience to gain and much more to learn \nbefore they will be able to act independently, but this will take time \nas we strive to get 270,000 Iraqis in uniform by July 2006.\n  Progress is being made. Two or three months ago, I had the \nopportunity to travel to Jordan and visited one of the Iraqi-Jordanian \npolice training academies. They are on the ground. One can see the \nprogress that is being made in Iraq and with the Iraqi police recruits. \nOne can see their commitment to seeing the job through.\n  It is all a difficult task, and it is going to take a lot of \ndetermination, but I am confident the Iraqi forces will continue to \nimprove and continue to demonstrate their bravery in the days ahead.\n  As Iraqis assume a greater responsibility for their own defense, the \npace of Iraq's reconstruction should also gain speed. After decades of \ncorruption and mismanagement by Saddam's regime, many of Iraq's towns \nand cities were in shambles, sewage in the streets, tumbled-down \nschools, unreliable electricity and unreliable and unpotable water. \nCoalition forces have been working hard to help the Iraqis rebuild and \nretool.\n  We are also helping the Iraqis strengthen the rule of law, a civil \nsociety, and private enterprise. A strong economy means more \nopportunities, better jobs, more jobs and a brighter future. Opinion \npolls show a majority of Iraqis remain optimistic about their economic \nfuture despite ongoing security concerns. It is all hard work, and it \nis made much harder by foreign interference.\n  The State Department reports that while Syria has taken some steps to \nimprove border security, supporters of the terrorists continue to use \nSyrian territory as a staging ground. On the Iranian front, Secretary \nof Defense Rumsfeld and CIA Director Goss report that Iran has sent \nmoney and fighters to proteges in Iraq. The fact is, some of Iraq's \nneighbors fear a large, prosperous democracy on their borders. They \nfear that a democratic Iraq will export freedom and liberty to their \nlands. But fear will not stop freedom's progress. Iraq will succeed and \nwill become a beacon of hope throughout the region and throughout the \nworld.\n  We have already seen the beginnings in the Cedar Revolution in \nLebanon. Freedom is on the march, and the Iraqi people are leading the \nway.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to continue to offer our steadfast \nsupport. This is an extraordinary opportunity to change the course of \nhistory and bring peace and stability to the heart of the Middle East. \nSuch steadfastness will not be easy and will not be without cost, but \nwe must succeed. We cannot allow the terrorists to win, and we cannot \nallow Iraq to fall into chaos, sectarian violence or the rule of \nextremists. This is going to take a lot of time. It is going to take a \nlot of money. It is going to take a lot of patience.\n  The American people need to understand that we will be in Iraq for \nsome time to come. It is vital to the Iraqis that we be there. It is \ncritical to the region that we be there. It is essential to our own \nsecurity that we be there. Our time line will be driven by success and \nour exit will depend on the security situation. It will depend on \ndemocracy's advance and the wishes of a sovereign Iraq.\n\n  It is clear to me that as Iraqis are able to stand up and provide \ntheir own security, without coalition assistance and without foreign \nintervention, we should be able to begin withdrawing personnel from \nthat region.\n  When I meet with the new Iraqi Prime Minister later this morning, we \nwill discuss all of these pressing matters. I will let him know America \nis fully committed to Iraq's success. I will also tell him we expect \ncontinued progress on security, on reconstruction, and the formation of \na functioning democracy.\n  In the end, Iraq, the region, and the United States will be more safe \nand more secure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time just consumed be counted \nagainst the majority's allocated time prior to the cloture vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/23/senate-section/article/S7204-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I understand we have 30 minutes; is that \ncorrect?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. First, I thank my friend and the ranking member, Senator \nLeahy, for permitting me to go first so we can attend in an appropriate \nway the Armed Services Committee and Secretary Rumsfeld. It is typical \ncourtesy on his part.\n  I yield myself 9 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                         supreme court vacancy\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we all know, a major debate may soon \nbe underway in the Senate and the country if there is a vacancy on the \nSupreme Court. It is clear that the Bush administration is well along \nin choosing its nominee for the vacancy, and the Senate must be well-\nprepared as well.\n\n[[Page S7205]]\n\n  The initial major question is whether, for the highest judicial \nposition in the land, President Bush will choose consultation and \nconsensus or confrontation and conflict. I urge the President not to \ncede this important constitutional responsibility to a narrow faction \nof his own party--and to groups so extreme they have called for the \nimpeachment of six of the current nine Justices because those Justices \nrefuse to make the law in accord with the groups' wishes.\n  In the landmark May 23rd agreement, the bipartisan group of 14 \nSenators spoke clearly for this body on two vital points. First, we \nintend to remain the world's greatest deliberative body, where the \nrules, not raw power, prevail, and where the rights of the minority are \nrespected--not silenced. Second, the agreement sent a strong reminder \nto the President that the Constitution requires him to obtain both the \nadvice and consent of the Senate before appointing judges, and that we \nexpect him to do so in good faith.\n  When the Framers of the Constitution adopted our system of checks and \nbalances 218 years ago, they focused intently on the process for \nselecting judges. They wanted judges to be independent, so they gave \nthem lifetime positions and prohibited any reduction in their \ncompensation.\n  Initially, they were so concerned that Presidents might abuse the \npower to select judges that they gave the Senate the sole power to \nappoint Federal judges. But some delegates argued for a Presidential \nrole, and they debated the issue at length.\n  Benjamin Franklin, always ready with new ideas, pointed to the \nScottish system, where the lawyers themselves selected the judges. \nInvariably, he said, the best and smartest candidates were selected as \njudges, because the other lawyers wanted to remove their toughest \ncompetitor and divide his business among themselves.\n  In fact, in three separate votes in July 1787, the Framers refused to \ngive the Executive any role in judicial selection, because they did not \nbelieve the President could be trusted with that responsibility. They \nagain placed the entire appointment power in the Senate.\n  Later, as the Constitutional Convention was ending in September, they \nagreed to a compromise, based on the procedure that Massachusetts had \nused successfully for over a century. To get the best possible judges, \nthe President and the Senate would have to agree on appointments to the \nFederal courts. The President was powerless to appoint judges without \nconsidering the Senate's advice and obtaining its consent.\n  For over two centuries that system has worked well. At the Supreme \nCourt level, Presidents have nominated 154 Justices. Most of them were \nconfirmed by the Senate, but some 20 percent were not. Some could not \nget Senate consent because the Senate did not feel they were qualified \nfor the job, some because they were selected for reasons of politics or \nideology with which the Senate did not agree, and some because they \nwere perceived as being too close to the President to be independent.\n  A few of us who have been here in the Senate for all of the \nconfirmations of the current nine Justices know that most of them were \nconsensus choices. Seven of them--including all six whom the right-wing \nwants to impeach--were confirmed with such strong bipartisan support \nthat no more than nine Senators voted against them, and, of those, four \nreceived unanimous Senate support.\n  We learned many things from past debates. One of the most important \nis that there are large reservoirs of excellent potential nominees \namong the many capable judges and lawyers in the United States, and \nthat, if they are chosen for the High Court, they will receive \noverwhelming support in the country and in the Senate. Presidents who \nhave listened to the Senate's advice and selected such candidates have \nhad no problem obtaining Senate consent. President Bush can do that, \ntoo. If he takes our bipartisan advice, he will have no trouble \nobtaining our bipartisan consent.\n  Presidents who have had the most trouble with the confirmation \nprocess are those who listened to erroneous advice about the process. \nAs recently as this week, a Member of this body argued in print that:\n\n       Senate practice and even the Constitution contemplate \n     deference to the President and a presumption in favor of \n     confirmation.\n\n  That's not what the Constitution says. Since the days of George \nWashington--whose nomination of a Justice was denied consent by the \nSenate of that day, there has been no ``presumption in favor of \nconfirmation'' of lifetime judicial appointees. In general, many of us \ndo give some deference to a President's nominees to the executive \nbranch, since they are not lifetime appointments. But even there, if \nthe President overreaches, we act to fulfill our constitutional \nresponsibility.\n  Three times in my experience, Presidents have pushed the Senate too \nfar on Supreme Court nominations, and the Senate has said ``no.'' Each \ntime, the White House argued for Senate deference and the Senate, each \ntime with bipartisan support, refused to defer. Two of those rejections \nwere consecutive nominations for the same vacancy, with members of the \nPresident's own party providing the majority for rejection each time. \nIn the second of those two, the selection was so plainly an arrogant \naffront to the Senate, that the best argument the proponents could make \nwas that mediocrity deserved representation, too, on the High Court, a \nproposition the Senate soundly rejected.\n  Clearly, Senators should not support a nominee just because a \nPresident of their party proposed the nomination. The Framers relied on \neach of us to make independent and individual judgments about the \nPresident's nominees. We do not fulfill our constitutional trust if we \nmerely ``placate-the-President.'' I have seen repeated examples of \nSenatorial courage when numerous members of the President's party--even \nmembers of his leadership team--have refused to go along with plainly \ninappropriate Presidential selections.\n  We should do exactly what the Framers intended us to do--be joint and \nco-equal defenders of the rule of law and the fairness and quality and \nindependence of the Federal courts. We must listen to their voices now, \nsummoning us across the centuries, to uphold that basic ideal, with \nfull devotion to our role in the checks and balances that have served \nthe Nation so well. We fail them if we march in lockstep with the White \nHouse.\n  As past experience shows, nominees selected for their devotion to a \nparticular ideological agenda are likely to have the most difficulty \nbeing confirmed, because that kind of choice rarely achieves a \nconsensus. History shows plainly that the better course is to search \nfor the highest quality candidates who have demonstrated their respect \nfor the rule of law. They respect core constitutional principles, \nespecially those that define the rights of each citizen. They have \ndemonstrated their commitment to finding the law, not making the law. \nThey respect stare decisis, the deference to well-accepted past \ndecisions that have kept the Nation strong by reconciling traditional \nprinciples with new needs and challenges. They show respect for the \nbasic structure of Government, especially for Congress when it acts \nwithin its established powers. They have demonstrated the ability to \nsubordinate their own ideological and result-oriented preferences to \nthe rule of law.\n  Especially at the Supreme Court level, the choices should not be \npartisan choices based on today's partisan issues. The Justice we may \nselect this year could well be providing justice to our children and \ngrandchildren for decades to come. It is more important that the \nnominee have a strong dedication to principles of justice than a strong \nposition on controversial issues of the day.\n  It is a disservice to the Court to attempt to install ideological \nactivists bent on making sudden and drastic shifts in the Court's \ncareful, gradual jurisprudence. The Supreme Court is at its worst when \nit splits into extreme, contentious sides, and reaches extreme results \nthat make much of the Nation cringe and leave only the ideological \nactivists satisfied.\n  Like sausage and legislation, the confirmation or rejection of a \nSupreme Court nomination is not always something pleasant to watch or \nbe part of. The course is set by the President. If the President \nsubmits an ``in your face'' nomination to flaunt his power, it takes \ntime and effort and sweat and tears before the truth about the \ncandidate is fully discovered and explained to the public and voted on.\n\n[[Page S7206]]\n\n  We are fortunate to have had a dress rehearsal for the process. \nBefore the White House decided to threaten the Senate with the nuclear \noption, few Americans had any idea what was happening here and how \nimportant it was. It took some time, but eventually the public \nunderstood the seriousness of the threat to break the rules in order to \nchange the rules, so that for the first time in Senate history, a bare \nmajority of the Senate could impose a gag rule on every other Senator \nand enable the President to exercise absolute power over the courts \nwithout meaningful review by the Senate. Fortunately, the Senate \nstepped back from that brink, and the Senators who reached that \nbipartisan agreement to make it possible deserve great credit.\n  Those who want the Senate to be a rubber stamp for a White House \nnominee to the Supreme Court will undoubtedly try to rush us through \nour duty. But if we are to do our job for the American people in good \nfaith, the process of considering a Supreme Court nominee cannot be \nrushed. It will take time to obtain the necessary information and \ndocuments, and to review and understand them. It will take time to \ngather witnesses and prepare for hearings. If the nomination is not a \nconsensus nomination, the hearings will be intensive and extensive. If \nthe nominee is evasive, there will be longer hearings and follow-up \nquestions, which will also take time to analyze. Only when all the \ninformation is available and fairly considered, can the nomination go \nforward.\n  If President Bush resists his fringe constituencies, and seeks the \nadvice of the Senate as he should, the nomination process can have a \nhappy ending. I hope our colleagues across the aisle will urge the \nPresident to respect the May 23rd bipartisan agreement and its \nmemorandum of understanding, and take to heart its serious request that \nhe consult with Senators from both parties before proposing a Supreme \nCourt nominee.\n  We already have in place a process for doing so. In selecting \ndistrict judge nominees in our States, the White House sends us the \nlist of persons being considered seriously, and asks for our comments \non each, as well as our suggestions for additional names to consider. \nWhen they have narrowed down the list, they share the short list with \nus, so that we can give our final advice as to which ones are best and \nwhich ones would raise problems. Almost always, our advice is \nconsidered and respected. As a result, most District Judges go through \nthe confirmation process quietly and expeditiously, and obtain the \nconsent of the Senate.\n  Article II, Section 2, Clause 2, of the Constitution clearly says, \n``with the advice and consent of the Senate,'' not the advice of anyone \nelse, just 100 of us here in the Senate, who speak for all the American \npeople. It doesn't take much to get our consent. All the President has \nto do is seek out his preferred non-ideological choices, ask us about \nthem, and listen to our answers.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the strong, eloquent statement \nof the Senator from Massachusetts. He is a former chairman of this \ncommittee, the Judiciary Committee. Of course, he is not only a former \nchairman but, as one of the three most senior Members of the Senate, is \nwell aware of what has been our practice.\n  I think we may also hear from the senior Senator from Delaware, Mr. \nBiden, who is another former chairman.\n  Let me speak in my capacity also as a former chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  It is now almost 1 month since the bipartisan agreement was forged to \navert an unnecessary ``nuclear'' showdown in the Senate. Democratic \nSenators who signed the Memorandum of Understanding on Judicial \nNominations that averted the nuclear option have fulfilled their \ncommitments with respect to invoking cloture on several controversial \nnominees. Sadly, with Republicans voting party-line on almost every one \nof these nominees, they have been confirmed. Meanwhile, as the \nDemocratic leader had offered months ago, the Senate considered and \nvoted upon two Sixth Circuit nominees and an additional DC Circuit \nnominee.\n  What has yet to take place, however, is the kind of meaningful \nconsultation that Republican and Democratic Senators explicitly called \nfor in that memorandum. They ``encouraged the Executive branch of \ngovernment to consult with members of the Senate, both Democratic and \nRepublican, prior to submitting a judicial nomination to the Senate for \nconsideration.'' They called for a ``return to the early practices of \nour government'' that reduced conflict and led to consensus. We have \nnot yet noticed an abundance of consultation. And unfortunately, White \nHouse officials have declared that the President has no interest in and \nfeels no obligation to assist in implementing this feature of the \nmemorandum.\n  Since the White House will not acknowledge the record, I thought it \nworth noting that 214 of this President's judicial nominations have \nalready been confirmed by the Senate. That includes 41 circuit court \nnominees, an almost 80-percent confirmation rate of his many divisive \ncircuit court nominees. These figures are all well ahead of the rates \nduring President Clinton's administration. At a similar point in the \nlast administration, only 180 nominees had been confirmed, including \nonly 31 circuit court nominees, which amounted to barely 74 percent of \nPresident Clinton's circuit court nominees.\n  With all the recent talk from Republicans about the principle of \nevery nominee being entitled to an up-or-down vote, it is striking that \nsuch a standard was not considered at all while Republicans pocket \nfilibustered more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees. As \nI demonstrated during the time I served as chairman and since then, \nPresident Bush's nominees have been treated far more fairly than were \nPresident Clinton's nominees.\n  I have spoken over the last 4\\1/2\\ years, most recently in the last \nfew weeks, about the benefits to all if the President were to consult \nwith Members of the Senate from both sides of the aisle on important \njudicial nominations. I return today to emphasize, again, the \nsignificance of meaningful consultation on these nominations. It bears \nrepeating given what is at stake for the Senate, the judiciary and the \nAmerican people.\n  In a few more days the U.S. Supreme Court will complete its term. \nLast year the Chief Justice noted publicly that at the age of 80, one \nthinks about retirement. I get to see the Chief Justice from time to \ntime in connection with his work for the Judicial Conference and the \nSmithsonian Institution. Sometimes we see each other in Vermont or en \nroute there, and I am struck every time by his commitment to service. \nHe is waging his personal battle against ill health with his \ncharacteristic resolve. I know that the Chief will retire when he \ndecides that he should, and not before. He has earned that right after \nserving on the Supreme Court for more than 30 years, the last 19 as the \nChief Justice. I have great respect and affection for him, and he is in \nour prayers.\n\n  In light of the age and health of our Supreme Court Justices, \nspeculation has accelerated about the potential for a Supreme Court \nvacancy this summer. In advance of any such vacancy, I have called upon \nthe President to follow the constructive and successful examples set by \nprevious Presidents of both parties who engaged in meaningful \nconsultation with Members of the Senate before selecting nominees. This \ndecision is too important to all Americans to be unnecessarily \nembroiled in partisan politics.\n  I have said repeatedly that should a Supreme Court vacancy arise, I \nstand ready to work with President Bush to help him select a nominee to \nthe Supreme Court who can unite Americans. I have urged consultation \nand cooperation for 4 years and have reached out to the President, \nagain, over these last few weeks. I hope that if a vacancy does arise \nthe President will finally turn away from his past practices, consult \nwith us and work with us. This is the way to unite instead of divide \nthe Nation, and this is the way to honor the Constitution's ``advise \nand consent'' directive, and this is the way to preserve the \nindependence of our federal judiciary, which is the envy of the rest of \nthe world.\n  Some Presidents, including most recently President Clinton, found \nthat\n\n[[Page S7207]]\n\nconsultation with the Senate in advance of a nomination was highly \nbeneficial in helping lay the foundation for successful nominations. \nPresident Reagan, on the other hand, disregarded the advice offered by \nSenate Democratic leaders and chose a controversial, divisive nominee \nwho was ultimately rejected by the full Senate.\n  In his recent book, ``Square Peg,'' Senator Hatch recounts how in \n1993, as the ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nhe advised President Clinton about possible Supreme Court nominees. In \nhis book, Senator Hatch wrote that he warned President Clinton away \nfrom a nominee whose confirmation he believed ``would not be easy.'' \nSenator Hatch goes on to describe how he suggested the names of Stephen \nBreyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, both of whom were eventually nominated \nand confirmed ``with relative ease.'' Indeed, 96 Senators voted in \nfavor of Justice Ginsburg's confirmation, and only three Senators voted \nagainst; Justice Breyer received 87 affirmative votes, and only nine \nSenators voted against. Nor are these recent examples the only evidence \nof effective and meaningful consultation with the Senate over our \nhistory.\n  The Constitution provides that the President ``shall nominate, and by \nand with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint'' judges \nand explicitly the members of the only court established by the \nConstitution itself, the Supreme Court. For advice to be meaningful, it \nneeds to be informed. Despite his public commitment at a news \nconference three weeks ago specifically regarding the Supreme Court, \nthe President has not even begun the process of consulting with \nDemocratic Senators. I wrote to the President, again, last month, \nurging consultation and even making suggestions on how he might wish to \nproceed.\n  Bipartisan consultation would not only make any Supreme Court \nselection a better one, it would also reassure the Senate and the \nAmerican people that the process of selecting a Supreme Court justice \nhas not become politicized.\n  The bipartisan group of 14 Senators who joined together to avert the \n``nuclear option'' included the following in their agreement:\n\n       We believe that, under Article II, Section 2, of the United \n     States Constitution, the word ``Advice'' speaks to \n     consultation between the Senate and the President with regard \n     to the use of the President's power to make nominations. We \n     encourage the Executive branch of government to consult with \n     members of the Senate, both Democratic and Republican, prior \n     to submitting a judicial nomination to the Senate for \n     consideration.\n       Such a return to the early practices of our government may \n     well serve to reduce the rancor that unfortunately \n     accompanies the advice and consent process in the Senate.\n       We firmly believe this agreement is consistent with the \n     traditions of the United States Senate that we as Senators \n     seek to uphold.\n\n  I agree. Bipartisan consultation is consistent with the traditions of \nthe Senate and would return us to practices that have served the \ncountry well. Our fellow Senators have history and the well-being of \nthe Nation on their side in urging greater consultation on judicial \nnominations. They are right.\n  What is troubling are the recent reports that the White House plan \ndoes not include meaningful consultation at all, but instead plans a \npolitical-style campaign and some sort of preemptive contact to allow \nthem to pretend they consulted, without anything akin to the kind of \nmeaningful consultation that this important matter deserves. Partisan \nactivists supporting the White House boasted last week about a war \nchest of upwards of $20 million to be used to crush any opposition to \nthe White House's selection. That sounds awfully like preparations for \nall out partisan political warfare. If the White House intends to \nfollow that type of plan, it would be most unfortunate, unwise and \ncounterproductive.\n  Though the landscape ahead is sown with the potential for controversy \nand contention should a vacancy arise on the Supreme Court, \nconfrontation is unnecessary. Consensus should be our mutual goal. I \nwould hope that the President's objective will not follow the path he \nhas taken with so many divisive circuit court nominees and send the \nSenate a Supreme Court nominee so polarizing that confirmation is eked \nout in the narrowest of margins. This would come at a steep and \ngratuitous price that the entire Nation would have to pay in needless \ndivision. It would serve the country better to choose a qualified \nconsensus candidate who can be broadly supported by the American people \nand by the Senate.\n  The process begins with the President. He is the only participant in \nthe process who can nominate candidates to fill Supreme Court \nvacancies. If there is a vacancy, the decisions made in the White House \nwill determine whether the nominee chosen will unite the Nation or will \ndivide the Nation. The power to avoid destructive political warfare \nover a Supreme Court vacancy is in the hands of the President. No one \nin the Senate is spoiling for a fight. Only one person will decide \nwhether there will be a divisive or a unifying process and nomination. \nIf consensus is accepted as a worthy goal, bipartisan consultation will \nhelp achieve it. I believe that is what the American people want, and I \nknow that is what they deserve.\n  If the President chooses a Supreme Court nominee because of that \nnominee's ideology or record of activism in the hopes that he or she \nwill deliver political victories, the President will have done so \nknowing that he is starting a confirmation confrontation. The Supreme \nCourt should not be a wing of the Republican Party, nor should it be an \narm of the Democratic Party. If the right-wing activists who were \ndisappointed that the nuclear option was averted convince the President \nto choose a divisive nominee, they will not prevail without a difficult \nstruggle that will embroil the Senate and the country. And if they do, \nwhat will they have wrought? The American people will be the losers: \nThe legitimacy of the judiciary will have suffered a damaging blow from \nwhich it may not soon recover. Such a contest would itself confirm that \nthe Supreme Court is just another setting for partisan contests and \npartisan outcomes. People will perceive the federal courts as places in \nwhich ``the fix is in.''\n  Our Constitution establishes an independent federal judiciary to be a \nbulwark of individual liberty against incursions or expansions of power \nby the political branches. That independence is what makes our \njudiciary the model for others around the world. That independence is \nat grave risk when a President tries to pack the courts with activists \nfrom either side of the political spectrum. Even if successful, such an \neffort would lead to decisionmaking based on politics and would forever \ndiminish public confidence in our justice system.\n  The American people will cheer if the President chooses someone who \nunifies the Nation. This is not the time and a vacancy on this Supreme \nCourt is not the setting in which to accentuate the political and \nideological division within our country. In our lifetimes, there has \nnever been a greater need for a unifying pick for the Supreme Court. At \na time when too many partisans seem fixated on devising strategies to \nforce the Senate to confirm the most extreme candidates with the least \nnumber of votes possible, Democratic Senators are urging cooperation \nand consultation to bring the country together. There is no more \nimportant opportunity than this to lead the Nation in a direction of \ncooperation and unity.\n  The independence of the federal judiciary is critical to our American \nconcept of justice for all. We all want Justices who exhibit the kind \nof fidelity to the law that we all respect. We want them to have a \nstrong commitment to our shared constitutional values of individual \nliberties and equal protection. We expect them to have had a \ndemonstrated record of commitment to equal rights. There are many \nconservatives who can readily meet these criteria and who are not rigid \nideologues.\n  This is a difficult time for our country, and we face many \nchallenges. Providing adequate health care for all Americans, improving \nthe economic prospects of Americans, defending against threats, the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons, the continuing upheaval that afflicts \nour soldiers in Iraq--all these are fundamental matters on which we \nneed to improve. It is my hope that we can work together on many issues \nimportant to the American people, including maintaining a fair and \nindependent judiciary. I am confident that a smooth nomination and \nconfirmation process can be developed on a bipartisan basis if we work\n\n[[Page S7208]]\n\ntogether. The American people we represent and serve are entitled to no \nless.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority side controls 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that others who wish to add \nstatements to the record on this subject be allowed to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Vermont, our \nleader on the Judiciary Committee, for, as usual, being right on point \nwith eloquence and with no malice.\n  As many know, there is a real possibility that a vacancy on the \nSupreme Court will be announced shortly. The Supreme Court should \nfinish its term either Monday or Thursday, depending on the caseload.\n  There is one question American people are asking about the Supreme \nCourt; that is, how, if and when a vacancy occurs--and we all pray, of \ncourse, for Chief Justice Rehnquist's health, but if and when a vacancy \noccurs--how do we avoid the divisiveness that has plagued this body, \nthis town, and this country about Court nominees over the last several \nyears?\n  The answer is simple. It can be described in one word: consultation. \nThe ball is in the President's court. If the President chooses to do \nwhat he has done on court of appeals nominees--not consult, just choose \nsomeone, oftentimes way out of the mainstream, and say take it or leave \nit--the odds are very high there will be a battle royal over that \nnomination. If, on the other hand, the President follows the path of \nwhat so many other Presidents before him have done--consults with the \nSenate, with the Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, and takes \ntheir advice to heart--we can have a smooth, amiable, easy Supreme \nCourt nomination.\n  Again, the ball is in the President's court. Consultation is part of \nthe constitutional process, advise and consent. The Founding Fathers \ndid not use words lightly. The relatively short document of our \nConstitution is amazing for its brilliance and its brevity. When they \ndecide to put a word in like ``advise,'' lots of thought has gone in \nbefore it. ``Advise'' means seek the advice of the Senate. It does not \nsay in the Constitution, seek the advice of your party or seek the \nadvice of people who agree with you. The intention, it is quite clear, \nis to seek a breadth of advice.\n  That is why, today, a letter signed by 44 of the 45 members of the \nDemocrat caucus, asking the President to consult with us, will be sent. \nThe 45th member, Senator Byrd, agrees with the thrust and the concept \nof our letter but felt so strongly about the issue he is sending his \nown letter, which I am sure will be in his own wonderful style and make \nthe point well.\n  The need for advice, the need for consultation, was made clear when \nthe group of 14--seven Democrats and seven Republicans--got together. \nIn their agreement, they wrote:\n\n       We believe that, under Article II, Section 2, of the United \n     States Constitution, the word ``advice,'' speaks to \n     consultation between the Senate and the President with regard \n     to the use of the President's power to make nominations. We \n     encourage the Executive branch of government to consult with \n     members of the Senate, both Democratic and Republican, prior \n     to submitting a judicial nomination to the Senate for \n     consideration.\n\n  This is a moderate, bipartisan group. They tend to be some of the \nmore conservative Democrats and some of the more liberal Republicans. \nIt is certainly mainstream. Will the President heed their advice and \nseek the advice of the Senate? If he seeks advice, will it be real? To \nsimply call someone in for a meeting and say, what do you think, and \nthen go about things as if the meeting did not happen is not advice. \nReal advice means talking about specific nominees in private, saying: \nWhat do you think of this name or that name, this person or that \nperson? That is, indeed, what President Clinton did as he consulted \nSenator Hatch, hardly his ideological soul mate, and many others. \nSenator Hatch told President Clinton some proposed nominees might be \nout of the mainstream and garner opposition, at least from the other \nside of the aisle. But some, even though Senator Hatch clearly did not \nagree with their politics, were in the mainstream and would get through \nthe Senate with relatively little acrimony. President Clinton took \nSenator Hatch's advice and the nominations were smooth.\n  That is not the only time advice has been sought. In 1869, President \nGrant appointed Edward Stanton to the Supreme Court in response to a \npetition from a majority of the Senate and the House. In 1932, \nPresident Hoover presented Senator William Borah, the influential \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, with a list of candidates \nhe was considering to replace Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. Borah \npersuaded Hoover to move the name of the eventual nominee, Benjamin \nCardozo, from the bottom of the list to the top, and Cordozo was \nspeedily and unanimously confirmed.\n\n  There are many instances of Presidents seeking the advice in terms of \nthe advice and consent of the Senate. When the President has done it on \njudicial nominees here, it has worked. Frankly, the President and the \nWhite House have consulted with me about nominations to the district \ncourts in New York and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. They have \nactually bounced names off of me and said: What do you think of this \none? What do you think of that? As a result, every vacancy is filled \nquickly with little acrimony and with broad consensus.\n  Most of the nominees I have supported in my area do not agree with me \nphilosophically. But they are part of the mainstream, and I was \nwilling, able and, in many cases, happy to support them. So it can be \ndone and should be done.\n  There is all too much divisiveness in Washington. On the issue of the \ncourts, it is our sincere belief on this side of the aisle that the \nPresident's refusal to consult and willingness to nominate some who are \nso far out of the mainstream that they cannot be regarded as \ninterpreters of law rather than makers of law. That is the main reason \nwe stand at this point of great acrimony in terms of judicial \nnominations. All of that can be undone by some sincere consultation.\n  President Bush, when he ran for office and got into office, said he \nwanted to change the tone and climate in Washington; he wanted to bring \npeople together. That was a noble sentiment, a wonderful sentiment. He \ncan, despite the acrimony that has occurred on judicial nominations and \nso much else over the last few years, almost like with a magic wand, \nundo much of it by seeking real consultation should there be a vacancy \non the Supreme Court.\n  On behalf--I believe I can say this without any hesitation--of all 44 \nof my colleagues on this side of the aisle, we plead, we pray, with the \nPresident to engage in real consultation, to heed the advise and \nconsent of the Constitution, and to come up with a Supreme Court \nJustice, should a vacancy occur shortly, that we all--from the most \nconservative to the most liberal Member of this body--can be proud to \nsupport.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority time is expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time does the Senator want?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Three minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for \nyielding the time.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Isakson are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I may \nuse.\n  Mr. President, fellow Senators, shortly the Senate is going to vote. \nWe are going to have a cloture vote to decide whether we should bring \nclosure to\n\n[[Page S7209]]\n\nwhat I think has been an excellent 2 weeks of debate about a new \nAmerican policy, a policy which is directed at trying to make our \nenergy supply for the future more secure for our domestic growth and \nfor our national security.\n  We have been waiting a long time for this day. If the Senate, indeed, \nat its pleasure, grants cloture, which I hope we will, it means we will \nbring to a conclusion in short order a long debate and fulfill a \nlongstanding need for an American energy policy that is encapsulated in \nthis bill, which was produced by the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee over weeks of hearings and day after day of debate, with \nvoting, and finally concluding that the bill that is before us is the \nright thing to do.\n  Since then, the Senate has exercised its right to offer amendments \nand discuss them. Some amendments were adopted to change, alter what \nthe committee recommended. But in essence, fellow Senators, we have a \nrare opportunity today, in a reasonable period of time--not with \nacrimony but with debate--to pass this legislation. That is, in a \nsense, consistent with the best of the Senate: having amendments openly \ndebated, many of them; views, some in accord with the bill, some in \nopposition to the bill here on the floor, as witnessed by those who pay \nattention to what goes on in the Senate.\n  So I say, as one who has been a participant for a few years, this is \nan effort to bring this matter to a vote in the Senate so we can bring \nthis legislation to the House of Representatives. Our Constitution \nrequires that both Houses agree on the legislation. Some do not \nunderstand that our Constitution is rather conservative when it comes \nto passing legislation. You do not just have your vote in the Senate; \nthe House has theirs. Then you have to go to conference and agree on \nthe same text in both Houses, which is done by a committee called a \nconference committee.\n\n  That will occur only when we have voted out a bill. We will vote out \na bill only when we have completed debate under our rules. We probably \nwill not conclude debate for a long time unless cloture is imposed.\n  I believe on a domestic bill, cloture should not be invoked \narbitrarily or in advance of a reasonable amount of time. People should \nbe permitted to talk, to amend. But, fellow Senators, we have been at \nthis on the floor for enough time. And when you consider the prior \nefforts, I believe the American people are wondering why we cannot get \nsomething done. Why more time? The purpose for this activity called \ncloture is to say we have had enough time. With cloture invoked, sooner \nrather than later, the bill will be voted ``yes'' or ``no'' by the \nSenate.\n  So we seek that. That is the privilege of saying to the Senate, we \nare going to vote ``yes'' or ``no'' soon rather than later. The way we \ncan do that is by voting ``aye'' on the cloture vote.\n  I note the presence of Senator Bingaman. I have additional time. \nWould the Senator care to address the issue of cloture today?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's comments and \nhis willingness to let me speak for a few minutes.\n  I join him in urging that we go ahead and invoke cloture on the bill. \nI do believe we have had a good debate on the Senate floor. We have had \na good opportunity for amendments to be offered. The process has been \nopen. I have supported some amendments that have been offered to the \nbill; I have opposed others. I note my colleague has done the same. I \nbelieve each Senator has done the same. That is exactly how the Senate \nis intended to operate.\n  Obviously, there are Senators who still have amendments they would \nlike to offer. Some of those amendments will be germane after the \ncloture vote occurs even if cloture is invoked. Those amendments can be \nconsidered by the Senate and disposed of at that time. That is \nappropriate.\n  But I understand the scheduling problems the majority leader has and \nthe Democratic leader has as well. They believe they need to move to \nother legislation early next week, or even as early as tomorrow. \nTherefore, they would like to go ahead and conclude work on this bill.\n  This bill is not coming to the Senate sort of ab initio, as they \nteach you in law school. It has come here after we had a substantial \ndebate on these very same issues two Congresses ago, and again last \nCongress. As the Senator from New Mexico pointed out, we had a very \nthorough and open process in the committee. This process we have had on \nthe floor has been a thorough and open process as well.\n  I believe the bill that came out of committee was a good product. It \nwas a substantial improvement over current law. And I said that. I \nbelieve it has been further improved as we have been working here on \nthe Senate floor in considering amendments to the bill, so I do not \ndoubt it could be improved even more. Some of the amendments which \nMembers may still want to offer may well improve it more, and I may be \na strong supporter of those. But clearly this has been a process that I \nthink has given everyone an opportunity to participate and offer \namendments. It has been a process that has led to a good product which \nwe can take to conference with the House of Representatives. As I say, \nthere will be additional opportunities, even if cloture is invoked, for \nus to further improve this bill with germane amendments.\n  So I will support cloture. I know each Senator can make his or her \nown mind up about that vote, but I believe the chairman of our \ncommittee has worked diligently to get us to this point. I have tried \nto work with him in that process. I think the majority leader and the \nDemocratic leader are very focused on trying to get conclusion on this \nlegislation. I support their efforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the regular order.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on H.R. 6, a bill \n     to ensure jobs for our future with secure, affordable, and \n     reliable energy.\n         Bill Frist, Pete Domenici, Lamar Alexander, Kay Bailey \n           Hutchison, Jim DeMint, Michael Enzi, Ted Stevens, Larry \n           Craig, Craig Thomas, Mike Crapo, Conrad Burns, David \n           Vitter, Richard Burr, Kit Bond, Wayne Allard, Jim \n           Inhofe, Lisa Murkowski, George Voinovich.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on H.R. 6, \nas amended, the Energy Policy Act of 2005, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this \namendment, along with the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter, and many \nother Senators. We feel very strongly about this particular amendment.\n  I first thank the chairman of the committee and the ranking member \nfor the excellent work they have done to move this Energy bill forward \nto this point. It has been a very difficult, tedious, and time-\nconsuming task that has required a lot of patience and a lot of \ncompromises to get a bill of this nature in this climate to this point. \nWe appreciate their patience and their skill.\n  This is an amendment both leaders have been working on for many \nweeks. Amendment No. 891 would basically direct a portion of revenues \nto six States in the United States that have production off their \nshores, Louisiana being the prime State that produces so much of that \nenergy resource for our Nation, but in addition, obviously Texas, \nMississippi, to some degree Alabama, there is some production off the \ncoast of California today--not much but some--and even the State of the \nPresiding officer, the State of Alaska, that contributes so much to the \nNation's energy reserves, has some production off the coast.\n  Because of this tremendous contribution we have made these many \nyears, let me say willingly and very ably, so many small, medium, and \nlarge companies have worked to perfect the technology. They have \ninvented the tools, established the procedures, and have been pioneers \nin this industry. Many of the tools and technology invented for the \nenvironmentally responsible extraction of these minerals--not just in \nthe United States but around the world--have actually been invented and \ndeveloped in Louisiana. We are extremely proud of the contribution we \nhave made.\n  In addition to this technological contribution we have made, we have \ncontributed over $150 billion to the Federal Treasury since this began.\n  I see my colleague from Louisiana on the floor ready to speak in a \nfew moments, but I would like to make a couple of other comments.\n  The wetlands in Louisiana are not Louisiana's wetlands, they are \nAmerica's wetlands. They are host to some of the largest commercial \nshipping in the world. There are seven ports that comprise the ports of \nsouth Louisiana and, if combined, it is the largest port system in the \nworld.\n  We have leveed the Mississippi River for the benefit of the Nation, \nnot just for Louisiana's benefit. Realize, there were people living in \nLouisiana before the United States was a country. So we have been doing \nthis a very long time. Controlling and taming this river, while it has \nbeen a great benefit to the Nation, has come at great cost to the State \nthat holds this mouth of the great Mississippi River.\n\n  What do I mean by that? Because we channeled this river, again for \nthe benefit of the Nation so we can ship grain out of Kansas and can \nship goods throughout this world--north, south, east, and west--and \nserve as the vibrant global port that we are, the river has ceased to \noverflow its banks. So this great delta, the seventh largest in the \nworld, is rapidly sinking. If we do not get some infusion of revenue \nthrough this mechanism and others that we are seeking, we will lose \nthese wetlands. It will not be Louisiana's loss, it will be America's \nloss.\n  In addition to the commerce we support for our Nation, we also serve \nas a great migratory flyway for all the many bird species in North \nAmerica. If they do not have a place to land when they come up from \nSouth America and Mexico--that is the place they land, that is the \nplace they nest, that is the first land that is available to them off \nthe water, and that is the marshland we are losing.\n  In addition, this delta, besides the commerce, besides the \nenvironmental benefits for birds and other wildlife, is the fisheries, \nthe nursery for the Gulf of Mexico. More than 40 to 50 percent, \nestimated by scientists, of all the fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico \nhave some part of their life cycle spent in this great expanse of \nwetlands.\n  I have been so pleased to have Senator Domenici and Senator \nBingaman--both Senators from New Mexico--come down to Louisiana to fly \nover our marsh and see it. You cannot get there any other way. You \ncannot drive to our coast as you can to the coast in Florida or to the \nbeaches in Mississippi where many of us spent many of our years growing \nup. There are actually only two beaches, and they are each only about 5 \nmiles long. There are no highways. The only way you can get there is by \npirogue, motor boat, skiff, helicopter, or air boat in the marsh. So \nnot many people have seen these wetlands. I have pictures to show any \ncolleague who would like to see them.\n  It is a magnificent stretch of land. The Everglades can fit inside \nit. It is three times the size of the Everglades in Florida. It is a \nhuge expanse we are losing. If we do not capture these revenues in some \nannual, reliable amount to help the State of Louisiana put the \nresources into saving this wetlands, it will be, indeed, a great loss \nto America.\n  In addition to what this wetlands contributes to the United States, \nit is not only all the above I have described, but it also drains water \nfrom two-thirds of the United States. Without the ability to drain this \nwater out, we would have flooding all the way up the Missouri. As you \nknow, because of the\n\n[[Page S7211]]\n\ngeography of our Nation, that water has to leave those areas or \nbusinesses and communities will flood.\n  We think we are making such--we don't think, we know we are making \nsuch a great contribution to this Nation in so many ways. We think this \namendment is quite reasonable. There is money available for this \npurpose. It will be shared with these producing States.\n  From Louisiana's perspective, this money would be used primarily and \nalmost exclusively for the restoration of America's wetlands so that \nthese wetlands will be there for our children and our grandchildren.\n  It is with great pride I helped to lead this effort, along with my \ncolleague from Louisiana and many cosponsors. That number continues to \ngrow. We have substantial support because of the leadership of Senator \nDomenici and Senator Bingaman.\n  Again, Louisiana has contributed so much. We simply ask an investment \nback to preserve this wetlands, which is America's, and to recognize \nthe contribution our State makes to the energy independence of this \nNation and to the future economic viability of this Nation.\n  I want to recognize my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Vitter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise in strong support of amendment \nNo. 891 as well. I am proud to join my Louisiana colleague, Mary \nLandrieu, in doing so.\n  I want to make five important points why this amendment is clearly \nthe right thing to do.\n  First, as Senator Landrieu said, this amendment has very broad, very \ndeep, and very bipartisan support. I thank her for her leadership, as \nwell as so many others who have come together and worked very hard to \ncraft a responsible amendment to move this issue forward in a concrete \nway.\n  Senator Domenici, the chairman of the committee, has led in an \nextraordinary way on this issue and is the primary author of this \namendment. We thank him. Senator Bingaman, the ranking member of the \ncommittee, has led on this amendment as well and is a cosponsor and \nsupportive of it. We thank him. Senator Landrieu and I, of course, as \nwell as Senators Lott and Cochran, Sessions, and others are all coming \ntogether, very broad based, in a bipartisan way to support this effort. \nThat is point No. 1.\n  Point No. 2 is this is an utterly fair and just thing to do. In this \noverall debate about an energy bill, we are constantly looking for ways \nto secure our energy future, to increase our energy independence, to \nlessen our dependence on foreign sources, which is so troublesome, \nparticularly in a post-9/11 world.\n  While in that debate, it is important to remember that there are a \nfew States that have been leading that effort and have been doing their \npart all along, particularly these five coastal producing States--\nLouisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, Alaska, and California to a \nmuch lesser extent. So in this energy debate, it is certainly important \nto remember that some of us have been pulling our weight and far more \nthan our weight every step of the way. Yet up until this moment, we \nhave gotten virtually nothing for it.\n  While oil and gas and other mineral production on public lands \nonshore gives significant royalties to the host State--usually about 50 \npercent--that same sort of oil and gas production offshore gives \nvirtually nothing to the host State, less than 1 percent.\n  That is utterly unfair and this amendment is a small initial step to \ncorrect that. As Senator Landrieu said, these coastal areas have \nproduced $150 billion or more of Federal revenue, virtually no State \nrevenue. This amendment would correct that injustice in a very small \nway by capturing a truly tiny percentage of that overall production and \nroyalty figure for the host States.\n  Point No. 3 is that the host States, the coastal producing States, \nneed this revenue to address problems directly related to this oil and \ngas production and our contribution to the Nation's energy security. In \nmy home State of Louisiana, we have an absolute crisis going on. It is \ncalled coastal erosion. The easiest way I can summarize it is as \nfollows: Close your eyes and try to picture a piece of land the size of \na football field. That piece of land disappears from Louisiana, drifts \nout into the Gulf, lost forever, every 38 minutes. That is around the \nclock, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year. The clock never \nstops. It goes on and on.\n  That loss is directly related to this oil and gas activity. So we \nhave been contributing to the Nation's energy security, but the only \nthing we have gotten directly for it is these monumental problems which \nthis revenue will help address.\n  Point No. 4 is that this amendment does not open any new areas to \ndrilling. It does not provide incentives to open any new areas. \nPersonally, I would like to do that. I think more of America needs to \ncontribute to our energy security. I think we need to look in other \nareas. But clearly that is very politically controversial and this \namendment does not attempt to do that in any way. So States that are \nnot in the business, that do not want to be in the business, have \nnothing to fear from this amendment.\n  Point No. 5 has to do with the budget. All of us, led by Senator \nDomenici, a former budget chairman, have worked extremely hard so that \nthis does not bust the budget in any way. We have bent over backward to \nfashion this amendment so it is within all the budget numbers.\n  A budget point of order may nevertheless be raised and I expect it to \nbe raised. I want to explain what that is because it is not busting the \nnumbers built into the budget. There is a reserve fund or a contingency \nfund within the budget that was part of the budget and part of the \nBudget Act specifically associated with the Energy bill. This amendment \nis well within the numbers of that fund and therefore does not go \nbeyond the numbers of the budget. However, in the Budget Act, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee has the role of having to sign off on \nthe use of that contingency fund. The chairman may not do that. He may \ntherefore raise a budget point of order, and that is his right, and I \nrespect his right and what he views as his obligation, but I want to \nmake the point very clearly that is a technical point of order which is \nfundamentally different from an amendment which busts the budget \nnumbers, which goes beyond the numbers built into the budget.\n  We have worked extremely hard with the budget chairman's staff, I \nmight add, hand in glove with them, to make sure this amendment falls \nwithin all of the numbers of the budget and is well below that \ncontingency fund number specifically for the Energy bill. So if that \nbudget point of order is raised, it is valid, but it is, in a sense, a \ntechnicality because our amendment does not go beyond the numbers built \ninto the budget and the Budget Act.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. VITTER. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is it the position of the Senator from Louisiana, \ntherefore, that when a discretionary program is taken and turned into a \ndirect spending entitlement program, that that is a technical point?\n  Mr. VITTER. No. The point which I just made was that this amendment \nis well within all of the numbers laid out in the Budget Act. That was \nthe point I was trying to make.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. VITTER. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. GREGG. It appears to be the Senator's position that since this \nbudget point of order involves taking a discretionary program and \nmaking it an entitlement program that that is a technical point.\n  Mr. VITTER. That is not my----\n  Mr. GREGG. My position is that is not technical.\n  Mr. VITTER. If I could clarify and respond to the question, that is \nnot my position at all. My position, which I think I laid out pretty \nclearly, is this amendment is well within all of the numbers within the \nbudget. It does not bust those numbers. It does not go beyond those \nbudget numbers. That is what I said, that is what I meant, and I \nbelieve to the extent the Senator did not argue the point, it is \nconfirmed.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, would the Senator from Louisiana yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. VITTER. I will be happy to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n[[Page S7212]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Louisiana appears to want to have it both \nways, that the chairman of the Budget Committee has a right to make \nthis point of order because the chairman of the Budget Committee is \ngiven that authority by the Senate in order to protect the integrity of \nthe budget process, and when the chairman of the Budget Committee rises \nand asks a question which is the basis of his point of order, which is \nthat this amendment takes a discretionary program and turns it into an \nentitlement program, and asks the Senator from Louisiana does he deem \nthat to be a technical point, the Senator from Louisiana says, no, that \nis not my argument. My argument is something else.\n  Well, I would simply say to the Senator from Louisiana, he cannot \nhave it both ways. He cannot say to the budget chairman he has the \nauthority to do this and then say to the budget chairman, when he asks \nthe Senator whether it is a technical point when the budget chairman \nelicits why he is doing it, that it is not a technical point.\n  It is a very unusual position to take, that moving a discretionary \nprogram to an entitlement program is a technical point, and that is the \ngravamen of the argument of the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Reclaiming my time, I think I have laid out my position \nvery clearly. This is a broad-based, bipartisan amendment. This is a \nfair amendment, particularly considering everything that these coastal \nproducing States have given the country in terms of our energy \nsecurity. Unfortunately, we are a very small number of States that have \ncontributed in that way. This is designed to address a very real crisis \nin Louisiana and other coastal States. By the way, that is not some \nparochial problem. That is a national problem, as my colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Louisiana, has outlined. It threatens national oil \nand gas infrastructure. It threatens national maritime commerce and \nports. It threatens nationally significant fisheries.\n  Fourth, we are not opening new areas with this amendment. We are not \nproviding incentives to open new areas with this amendment.\n  Fifth and finally, we are within all the numbers within the budget.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee. I thank Senator Bingaman and \nothers. I thank my colleague, Senator Landrieu, for her leadership on \nthis issue.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I rise in support of this amendment. I \nam a cosponsor of this amendment. It would dedicate funding for coastal \nimpact assistance to States that currently produce oil and gas from the \nFederal OCS adjacent to State waters.\n  I have visited the coastal area near Louisiana with Senator Landrieu. \nI know of the very serious concerns which many in that State have about \nthe loss of coastal wetlands caused by a variety of factors, including \nsome activities related to the oil and gas development that has \noccurred there. Senator Landrieu has been a tireless advocate for her \nState on this issue and I know her colleague has as well.\n  It is important for my colleagues to know what the amendment does not \ndo. The amendment does not modify any moratorium on OCS leasing. It \ndoes not provide an incentive for States to start production. It does \nnot provide for a State opt-in or opt-out for resource assessment or \nleasing activities. What the amendment does is establish a coastal \nimpact assistance program and provide a stream of revenues for coastal \nimpact assistance to States that already have OCS production off their \ncoast.\n  Under the amendment, funding would be made available to address the \nloss of coastal wetlands as well as for other projects and activities \nfor the conservation, protection, and restoration of coastal areas, \nmitigation of damage for fish and wildlife and other natural resources, \nand implementation of federally approved marine coastal and \nconservation management plans.\n  In addition, up to a fixed percentage of the funding could be used \nfor mitigation of the impact of OCS activities through funding of \ninfrastructure projects. In other words, the amendment allows funding \nof certain infrastructure projects and public services, but the amount \nof funds that can be expended for those purposes is capped.\n  Before concluding, let me clarify one significant point. I support \nthe amendment because it does provide dedicated funds from the Treasury \nfor coastal impact assistance. The amendment does not provide a \npercentage of revenues or future revenues or otherwise call for \nrevenuesharing from the Outer Continental Shelf. I have stated \nrepeatedly my opposition to that idea. It is my view that the oil and \ngas resources in the OCS belong to the entire Nation, and the revenue-\nsharing arrangement, which was earlier discussed but is not part of \nthis amendment, would run contrary to that principle.\n  In closing, I reiterate my support for this amendment. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in voting aye for the amendment and waiving the \nBudget Act, if necessary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may not object to a quorum call. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I do not sense that the manager of the \nbill is on the floor, but I would be interested in knowing whether the \nSenators from Louisiana wish to enter into a time agreement so we can \nmove to a vote on this point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, it is my understanding there are other \nMembers who have asked to be given a chance to speak, some in \nopposition to the amendment, perhaps some additional in favor. So we \nare not able to go to a vote at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Did the Senator from Louisiana wish to respond to my time \nagreement? I was going to speak.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. No. I am sorry. I am wondering if we could have some \nadditional time. Did the Senator want to speak for a certain amount of \ntime?\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand there is an objection. I believe I have the--\ndo I have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is my understanding from the Democratic leader on the \nbill that there is an objection to any time agreement at this point so \nthere is no point in even entering a discussion on that matter, I \nguess.\n  Madam President, I rise to address this issue as chairman of the \nBudget Committee. I begin with this rather unfortunate characterization \nthat a budget point of order is a technical event around here.\n  Budget points of order are not technical events. In my humble \nopinion, they are rather important. I guess that is because I am \nchairman of the Budget Committee. We pass a budget and we say as a \nCongress and as a party specifically, because nobody on the other side \nof the aisle participated in passing the budget, that we are going to \ndiscipline our house, we are going to be fiscally responsible. In fact, \nthe budget we passed was extremely disciplined. It limited nondefense \ndiscretionary spending to a zero increase over the next 3 years. For \nthe first time in 7 years, it attempted to address entitlement spending \nbecause we see that as probably the most significant threat to our \nfiscal integrity as a nation.\n  It had very aggressive language in the area of enforcement. Certain \naccounts were set up, such as the reserve account which has been \nreferred to, in order to make sure that dollars were spent \nappropriately and not whimsically or outside the purposes of the \nbudget.\n  That budget passed. It was voted on. It passed by a couple of votes \nbut with no Democratic support. However, it was the first budget to \npass this Congress in 2 years and only the second time in 4 years did \nwe actually get a budget out of the Congress. I think it is important \nthat we look to the budget\n\n[[Page S7213]]\n\nfor leadership, or at least for guideposts as to how we are going to \nfunction around here. To represent that points of order made under the \nbudget might be technical is, to say the least, inconsistent with the \npurposes of the budget and the points of order under the budget.\n  There are a lot of points that have been raised in presenting this \ncase. There have been substantive points and then there have been \narguments that it is not outside the budget and therefore should be \npaid for.\n  Let me speak initially to the substantive points. I do respect the \ncomments of the senior Senator from Louisiana, when she quite \nforthrightly stated that the problem that is being caused in Louisiana, \nrelative to loss of frontage and land, is a function of the levying \nsituation--which benefits the Nation. I do not deny that. I read the \nbook ``Rising Tide'' and was amazed at the impact of that flood and \nknow that the levee situation addresses that as well as commerce.\n  But here is the essential problem. I have reviewed this, briefly. I \nhaven't reviewed it in depth, but I asked my people who are expert in \nthis area, especially those who work in NOAA or have worked in NOAA, \nwhat causes this erosion. I agree with the Senator from Louisiana, the \nsenior Senator, that the erosion is essentially being caused by the \nlevees.\n  It is not a function of drilling offshore, and therefore there is no \nnexus here. Between drilling offshore and the need to restore, the \nconservation issues around the land that is being lost, there is no \nnexus. A scientific nexus does not exist. The issues are really \nindependent of each other. How you fund the restoration of those shore \nlands is the issue at hand. But what I think is important is that, from \na substantive policy debate purpose, the problem is not being caused by \nenergy production, and the amendment, as proposed, has no relationship \nto energy production, and this is an Energy bill. In other words, this \namendment does not create new production. This amendment does not \ncreate new renewables, and it does not create conservation.\n  This amendment conserves land, but the land that is being lost is not \nnecessarily being impacted by energy production, or at least there is \nno scientific evidence to that effect that I can glean. It hasn't been \npresented, and I think the senior Senator from Louisiana made the case \nbetter than I could make it on that point. So there is not a \nrelationship between what this amendment wants to gather money for and \nthe Energy bill.\n  Second, I think it is important to note that this amendment uniquely \nbenefits five States at the expense of the General Treasury. It \nessentially says those five States have a unique conservation issue \nwhich the General Treasury has an obligation to support over other \nStates which have conservation issues.\n  There may be other places that have conservation issues which are \nprobably directly related to the production of energy. I suspect West \nVirginia has some very serious conservation issues dealing with the \nproduction of coal. There is a pretty good nexus. But this amendment \ndoesn't say we use general revenues, that we use the General Treasury \nto support that effort. No, it says five States have gathered together \nto take money out of the General Treasury for the purposes of \naddressing what they see as their conservation needs, which have no \nnexus of any significance that can be proven to the energy production.\n  Granted, those States do produce a lot of energy and that energy is a \nbenefit to this country and I appreciate the fact that they do that. \nBut New Hampshire produces more energy than we consume--a significant \namount more than we consume--because we built a nuclear plant. I will \ntell you that produced some conservation issues. But we are not seeking \na special fund, for which the taxpayers will have to pay, in order to \ntake care of that issue that will be uniquely tied to New Hampshire.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. After I finish my comments, I will be happy to yield for a \nquestion.\n  The more appropriate approach here, if this is what the game plan is, \nis probably to fund something such as--use these moneys, if you are \ngoing to take money out of the General Treasury and set up an \nentitlement program for a few States--is to say that program should be \nfor more than a few States. It should be for all the States that have \nimpact from conservation. But I don't think we should be doing even \nthat because I don't think we should be creating new entitlement \nprograms, which is the gravamen of this case, creating a new \nentitlement program.\n  Louisiana already benefits rather uniquely--and I think this point \nshould be made, and folks should focus on it a bit--from a variety of \ndifferent funds which are generated by energy, which help them in the \narea, theoretically, of conservation. They get 100 percent of the \nroyalties for the first 3 miles of drilling. Last year that was over \n$800 million. I think they get 27 percent of the rights for the next 3 \nmiles, and last year that was about $38 million. What we are talking \nabout are royalties beyond those areas, in Federal water--not State \nwater; Federal taxpayers, Federal water.\n  Louisiana is already receiving a fair amount of money through the \npresent royalty process. In addition, due to the creativity--I suspect \nthe senior Senator from Louisiana was involved in this, and I know the \nprior Senator from Louisiana was involved in this--through their \ncreativity, when Dingell-Johnson was reauthorized, they managed to get \na dedicated stream of money for conservation land, and they are the \nonly State in the country that has this; the only State that has a \ndedicated stream of money.\n\n  I congratulate them for their creativity, but I don't think they \nshould get another dedicated stream of money. They already did it once. \nWhy should they get it twice? Every time you start a lawnmower in this \ncountry, whether you start it in Louisiana or whether you start it in \nupstate New York or Montana or Washington or Oregon, every time you \npull that cord and it doesn't start and you pull it again and you \nfinally get it started, you are sending money to Louisiana.\n  Every time somebody in New Hampshire gets on a snowmobile, you are \nsending money to Louisiana. A lot of people don't get on snowmobiles in \nLouisiana, but in New Hampshire they do. But we are sending our dollars \nto Louisiana every time we take out a snowmobile. It is a dedicated \nstream. I think last year it was $767 million they received out of that \nfund, unique to Louisiana. I guess they thought it was such a good idea \nthey would come back again: Let's get another dedicated stream of \nmoney. What the heck, if it worked once, why not try it twice?\n  The problem they have, of course, is that this time there is a budget \npoint of order against it. So they have to convince 60 people that \nLouisiana should get this unique treatment, after Louisiana already \ngets 100 percent of the royalties from the 3-mile area, which is over \n$800 million; 27 percent of the royalties from 3 to 6 miles, which is \nabout $38 million; and $71 million from Dingell-Johnson, which no other \nState gets in that dedicated stream.\n  Then they put it forward for a program which has no relationship to \nenergy production. Interestingly enough, if you read the amendment, it \nappears that not only does it have no relationship to energy production \nbut that the money could actually be spent on just about anything. It \ncould probably go into the General Treasury of Louisiana. It basically \nwill become a revenue-sharing event. It doesn't have to go to \nconservation. On page 14 it says:\n\n       Mitigation of impacts of Outer Continental Shelf activities \n     through the funding of onshore infrastructure projects and \n     public service needs.\n\n  ``Public service needs'' is a term that means you can fund anything. \nYou could fund the fact that fishermen are not having a good year \nfishing or that the casino didn't have a good year of gambling or \nmaybe, as we have seen occasionally in the past, that you wanted to \nbuild a Hooters in order to hold the shoreline in place. ``Public \nservice needs'' is a pretty broad term, and I know there are some very \ncreative people who, when they see language such as that, see Federal \nrevenue sharing. Give me the dollars, I am going to spend it on \nwhatever.\n  So this amendment not only does not have a nexus to energy, it \ndoesn't even\n\n[[Page S7214]]\n\nnecessarily have a nexus to conservation with that language in there. \nSo it has some serious problems.\n  Those are a few of the substantive probleMs. There are obviously \nmore. Just the issue of fairness is probably the biggest one.\n  But the bigger issue, of course, is the attack on the General \nTreasury. The representation that this is a technical event when you \ncreate an entitlement, to me, affronts the sensibility of fiscal \nresponsibility. The creation of entitlements around here has become a \ngame. What happens is the Appropriations Committee, of which I am a \nMember--and I honor my service there and appreciate my chance to serve \non it--has given up massive amounts of spending responsibility to the \nentitlement side. Why? Because every time they create an entitlement to \ndo something which is a discretionary program, it frees up money to \nspend on some other discretionary program. So it is a very attractive \nevent, quite honestly, to create an entitlement for a discretionary \nprogram because that gives an appropriator freedom to spend the money \nthat has just been freed up--again.\n  That is how you end up driving up Federal spending. Because suddenly \nyou have taken money, for which there was going to have to be some \nprioritization because the Appropriations Committee would have had to \nsay: If we spend ``X'' million here, we can't spend ``X'' million over \nthere because we can't have it because we are subject to a budget cap. \nYou take that money and put it over on the entitlement side so that \nmoney can be spent again.\n  That is why this is such an outrage as an approach, creating an \nentitlement. There is no way that, as budget chairman, in good \nconscience, I can allow this type of activity to go forward without \nbeing at least noticed--without at least putting up the red flag and \nsaying: Hey, folks, this is highway robbery. This is a attempt to raid \nthe Treasury, to stick it to the taxpayers twice.\n  That is why I raised the point of order. I will probably lose it \nbecause there is a log rolling exercise going on around here that is \nsignificant. But it doesn't mean I should not raise it; That is my job. \nThat is what I am here for, I guess--temporarily, anyway.\n\n  So that is the essence of the problem. Substantively, this is not an \nenergy issue. The State of Louisiana already has many revenue streams, \nincluding, ironically, unique revenue streams which they have been \nsuccessful in the past in gaining. This would be an additional revenue \nstream which would be inappropriate to limit to five States because \nconservation is not a unique problem for Louisiana, and there are other \nStates that actually have higher equity arguments relative to impacts \nfrom energy directly related to where the conservation dollars are \ngoing.\n  I am sure there are significant conservation issues in Louisiana \nrelative to energy production, but the loss of this frontage doesn't \nappear to be one of them. And creating an entitlement where there was a \ndiscretionary program is just bad fiscal policy.\n  So that is the reason I will be making a point of order at the proper \ntime. I am perfectly happy to go to that vote as soon as the parties \nwish to do so. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I wanted to briefly respond to each of \nthe major points that the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee has made because I believe, quite honestly and sincerely, he \nis misinformed about each of these points.\n  No. 1, the idea that there is no causal linkage between the problem, \nat least in Louisiana we are trying to address, and offshore oil and \ngas production: Nothing could be further from the truth. I am glad the \ndistinguished Senator has read ``Rising Tide.'' But I suggest he needs \nto read a lot more and maybe come to Louisiana.\n  There are, of course, several causes that have all worked to create \nthis coastal erosion problem, but one of the biggest has been all of \nthe oil and gas service activity which comes off the swampy coast of \nLouisiana. All of that 50 years of activity has created channelization \nof our marshes. That has directly led to the intrusion of saltwater \ninto the marshland, the loss of vegetation, which is the glue that \nholds it together, and this coastal erosion.\n  There is an absolute identifiable, scientifically proven, causal \nconnection between offshore oil and gas activity and this coastal \nerosion problem. It is not speculative. It has been scientifically \nproven. Are there other contributing factors? Of course. Is levying of \nthe Mississippi a significant factor? Of course. But there is a direct \ncausal connection.\n\n  Point No. 2, the chairman has suggested there is no relation between \nthis money and energy production. Again, nothing could be further from \nthe truth. The amendment specifically states these States share in this \nfund in direct proportion to their Outer Continental Shelf energy \nproduction. The way to calculate how much each State gets is according \nto what activity, in meeting the Nation's energy needs, goes on off our \ncoast. There is a direct connection between the calculation of the \nmoney and this activity. Again, a direct connection in terms of what \nmoney the States get directly dependent on what OCS oil and gas \nactivity exists.\n  Point No. 3 causes me the most angst being from Louisiana, the notion \nthat there is no justice to this amendment, or that this is somehow a \nrip-off to the advantage of Louisiana and other coastal States. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth. We have worked 50 years to produce \nenergy in this country. We are one of the only States in this country \nto have done this. The other States are also represented in this \namendment. Yet we have gotten hardly anything for it and truly hardly \nanything for it in terms of direct revenue to the State.\n  States that have onshore mineral production or onshore oil and gas \nproduction on public land get a 50-percent royalty share. A State such \nas Louisiana that has this production offshore in the OCS gets less \nthan 1 percent. Yes, there is a justice issue, but the justice issue is \nweighted in our favor.\n  I note two things, in particular, the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire mentioned. He talked about other conservation needs. What \nabout the conservation needs brought about by coal activity in West \nVirginia? The chairman should note West Virginia gets a 50-percent \nroyalty share that directly relates to that activity. Put us on par \nwith West Virginia. We will take that; we will take 50 percent. The \nfact is this is a pittance compared to that.\n  Is there a justice problem? You bet there is. West Virginia produces \ncoal, and that is great for the country, and they get a 50 percent \nroyalty share. We produce oil and gas, and that is great for the \ncountry, and we get less than 1 percent. This is a justice issue, and \nall the justice arguments are in our favor.\n  The Senator also mentioned that Louisiana has a windfall because 3 \nmiles off our coast is State waters. That is true. But the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire should note that for Texas, \nthat seaward boundary is 9 miles. For Florida, that seaward boundary is \n9 miles. Yet because of historical accidents and idiosyncracies, it is \nonly 3 miles for Louisiana and Mississippi and Alabama. Everywhere else \nit is 9 miles or more. For Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, it is a \nthird of that, about 3 miles.\n  You bet there is a justice issue. But, again, the injustice for 50 \nyears and more has been against us. We are trying to correct that in a \ntruly modest way with this amendment.\n  Fourth and finally is the budget point. I reiterate and am very \nspecific and very clear: This amendment is wholly within the numbers \nbuilt into that budget. As the chairman knows, built into the budget is \na fund specifically dedicated to the Energy bill. This amendment is \nwell within those numbers.\n  There are lots of things in the Energy bill that are mandatory \nspending. There are lots of tax provisions. There are lots of other \nprovisions that basically can amount to mandatory spending. This is the \nsame as that. There are lots of other things that are not subject to \nfuture decisions or future appropriation or other decisions. This is \ntantamount to that, and it is within the numbers built into the budget \nfor the Energy bill. We have bent over backwards, worked very hard, to \nmake sure that was the case.\n  I yield time to the senior Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu.\n\n[[Page S7215]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes since we \nhave no timeline.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I appreciate so much the support we have \non this amendment from both sides of the aisle. A great deal of thought \nhas gone into this amendment. My colleague from Louisiana answered \nevery single one of the objections raised against this amendment by the \nSenator from New Hampshire. I add just a few words.\n  First of all, the Senator has done a very good job as budget \nchairman. I have enjoyed working with the Senator on many issues, \nincluding the education reform issue and trying to move toward a \nbalanced budget. I share his goals in so many ways.\n  He, of course, is a great advocate for his State, although he is \nsomewhat critical of an act that we fondly, and in a very appreciative \nway, refer to as the Breaux Act in Louisiana. We take that in Louisiana \nas a great compliment when a Representative, a Senator or a \nCongressman, can use their committees to do something that is so \nwarranted and so worthy and so necessary for a State. Senator Breaux \nserved so ably in this Senate for many years. We refer to that act as \nthe Breaux Act.\n  The Senator is correct, we get a relatively substantial amount of \nmoney, $50 million a year. It started out at $20 to $25 million and has \ngone up to $50 million. However, that is a drop in the bucket \nconsidering the money that Louisiana has generated for this Nation and \nfor the Senator's general fund. There has been $155 billion generated \nsince 1953. Last year alone, $5 billion came off the coast of \nLouisiana. That would not be possible without our State agreeing to lay \nthe pipeline, drive the pipe, allow the trucks to come down our two-\nlane roads that go underwater even when it rains. Forget the storm and \nhurricanes. Five billion dollars last year.\n  If any State has contributed to the Federal Treasury anywhere near \nthat amount with their resources, please, I would like to know. No \nother State, except the State of Wyoming, contributes more to energy \nindependence than the State of Louisiana. Wyoming gets prize 1 and we \nget prize 2. I am speaking about all sources--nuclear, hydro, \ngeothermal, wood, wind, waste, solar, oil, natural gas, and coal. All \nof it. The States of Wyoming, Louisiana, West Virginia, Alaska, New \nMexico, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Montana, North Dakota, Colorado, and Utah, \ngenerate more energy in their State than they consume, more energy than \ntheir industries need, and we export it out. And we are happy to do it \nbecause we actually believe in our State what we say in the Senate, \nthat we want to be energy independent.\n  These States are at the top of the chart for usage: California, New \nYork, Ohio. There are others.\n  People say every State contributes what it can. Some produce sweet \npotatoes, some produce Irish potatoes, some States have beaches, some \nStates have mountains. I understand that argument. That is what makes \nour Nation great. We all contribute to this great whole. But Louisiana \ncontributes more than its share and it has since 1940.\n  Are we asking anybody else to do that? No. Are we trying to move \nmoratoria? No. We are saying for the money we contribute--we understand \nthe OCS does not belong to us; we do not claim it does--we are saying \nfor the money we contribute, could we please have six-tenths of a \npercent. If it means an entitlement, let me say to the Senator, the \npeople in Louisiana are entitled. They are entitled to the money we \nhelped contribute to the general fund. I don't take that as an insult, \nI take it as a compliment to the people of my State. We are entitled to \nsome small amount of money we are asking for. We are willing to share \nit with the States that did not produce nearly the amount we produce, \nbut we are happy to do that. In fact, the Presiding Officer may \nremember we have had bills to try to share the money with everyone. No \nmatter what we try, we can share with everyone, but it is never quite \nenough, never quite right.\n  We have it right this time because we probably have over 60 \nsupporters of this amendment to give Louisiana and these coastal States \na small share of the money that, yes, they are most certainly entitled \nto.\n  Second, in this bill, the use of this money will go to wetlands \nconservation and resources. There have been a lot of pictures shown of \nthe coast. I will show one of my favorites because this is what our \ncoast looks like. This is what we are trying to keep healthy, a place \nwhere wildlife can flourish. A lot of people live near marshes like \nthis. When they open their kitchen windows, they do not see interstates \nor big highways, they see this marsh.\n  If you live near the Atchafalaya and you open your back windows, you \nwill see a beautiful cypress forest. Most are gone in North America, \nbut we are fortunate to have some in Louisiana we are trying to \npreserve. If you go out near Lake Maurepas around Lake Pontchartrain, \nthis is what you see when the sun sets in the evening.\n  I am tired of people coming to the Senate and putting up pictures of \npelicans with oil all over them. We are wise people. We are an \nindustrious people. We are a people who care about our environment. We \nhave cared about it for hundreds of years. And we continue to try to \nsave it.\n\n  The Senator from New Hampshire can most certainly appreciate how much \nwe love our State because he loves his, and how smart the people in \nLouisiana are to use the resources appropriately, the Senator would \nunderstand that these are some of the extraordinarily beautiful places \nthat we are trying to save.\n  There is a delta that is growing in Louisiana. It is the Atchafalaya \nDelta. And because of its natural beauty and because the water \ncontinues to flow and because of the good technologies our great \nuniversities have contributed to understanding the ecology of a delta--\nthere is no delta in New Hampshire, I don't believe. The last time I \nchecked there wasn't one, but there is a big one in Louisiana, the \nseventh largest delta in the world. It is a growing delta. If you \nlooked on a map from the satellite, you could see there is land growing \noff the coast of Louisiana. We are proud that this Atchafalaya Delta is \ngrowing. We are preserving it. The State is spending millions of \ndollars to buy this land and preserve it.\n  Any argument in the Senate that the people of Louisiana are sitting \naround twiddling their thumbs, not smart enough to figure this out, is \nan insult. I don't think that is what the Senator meant, but sometimes \npeople in Louisiana hear words in the Senate that lead them to believe \nthat might be the conclusion. I am certain that is not what he meant.\n  We have every intention of using this money to preserve these \nwetlands, to make the place that we have lived for over 300, 400 years \nmore beautiful, and most importantly to make it secure for the future. \nAs this marsh goes away, it threatens not only the life and livelihood \nand investments of the 2 million people who happen to live there and \nthe 1 million people who live on the coast of Mississippi--because this \nmarsh land protects them, as well--it also puts at risk billions and \nbillions of dollars of infrastructure that the oil and gas industry has \ninvested for the benefit of every single solitary American, whether \nthey live in New Hampshire, Maine, Illinois, California, or Florida.\n  The Senator from Louisiana and I have made our points very well. We \nappreciate the work of the Senator from New Hampshire and his work on \nthe budget. We understand he has a tough job. But we have a job to do, \nas well. That job is to get six-tenths of 1 percent of the money that \nwe generate for this Nation without bellyaching about it, without \ncomplaining about it. We have patiently and consistently asked for some \nfair share.\n  Yes, Senator Breaux was quite successful in managing a small amount \nof money, but the tab that we have, the Corps of Engineers has helped \nus to appreciate. The tab that we have to pick up right now in our 20/\n50 plan is estimated to be $14 billion.\n  So am I to believe the Senator from New Hampshire expects the 4.5 \nmillion people in Louisiana to pick up the tab--$14 billion--to fix the \nwetlands that is not ours but belongs to everyone, that we did not \ndestroy but the\n\n[[Page S7216]]\n\nMississippi River leveeing destroyed, and put taxes on us to do this? I \ndo not think he would suggest that.\n  This is a partnership we ask for. We will do our part. The Federal \nGovernment should do its part. We are going to continue to press this \nissue. I am pleased to be able to answer some of those questions and \nconcerns.\n  Finally, this is a picture of the wetlands itself from a satellite \nview. This is Louisiana's coast. It is very different from Florida, \nvery different from California. As I said, most people have never quite \nseen it because there are only two places you can get to. One is Grand \nIsle, which is shown right here, that tiny, little place. It is a \nbeautiful little island, but it keeps getting battered by the \nhurricanes that continue to come. And Holly Beach is somewhere right \naround here on the map. It is too small to see on the map.\n  There are only two roads you can get to. No one can see our coast \nunless you are one of the thousands of fishermen who come fish and tie \ntheir boats up next to the rigs. They actually fish next to the oil and \ngas rigs. That is where the best fishing is in the Gulf of Mexico. So \nunless you are one of those fishermen, or one of the trappers who have \ntrapped here--for hundreds of years families have trapped here--you \nwould not know where this is or what it looks like. But we do because \nwe represent this State.\n  We are losing this land and must find a way to save it.\n  This amendment is a beginning. My colleagues have been so patient. \nOur colleagues have been so helpful. Chairman Domenici and Ranking \nMember Bingaman have seen this land.\n  Again, as my partner from Louisiana said--and I am going to wrap up \nin a moment--this does not open moratoria. It is not an opt-out or opt-\nin amendment. It is simply a revenue-sharing amendment. We believe the \npeople of Louisiana and Mississippi and Texas and California and Alaska \nand Alabama are entitled to some of the money, a small amount of money \nthey are contributing to the general fund that helps us keep our taxes \nlow and funding projects all over the Nation.\n  Mr. President, 30 more seconds. The Senators have been so patient, \nbut I want to say this one response.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. When the Senator says no other States share the \nrevenues, that is inaccurate. I know he is aware that interior States \nshare 50 percent of their revenues from Federal land in their States. \nLouisiana does not have a lot of Federal lands. Texas has very little \nFederal land. Mississippi does not have much Federal land. Most of that \nis in the West. We are different. We are not the West. We are the \nSouth, although Texas could claim to be both. But Louisiana and \nMississippi are Southern States. We do not have a lot of Federal land. \nWhat we do have is a lot of land right off of here, as shown on the \nchart, that belongs to the Federal Government. But the Federal \nGovernment could not get to it unless we allowed pipelines. There are \n20,000 miles of pipelines put under this south Louisiana territory to \ngo all over the country, to keep our lights on and our industries \nrunning.\n  So again, there is revenuesharing. We would like our share. This is \ngoing to go for a good cause, for the preservation of an extraordinary \nmarsh. It is time for us to make this decision today for Louisiana and \nthe coastal States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the forthrightness of the \nSenator from Louisiana. She has made my case. She says it is \nrevenuesharing. I agree with her. She says it is an entitlement. I \nagree with her. She says they want their share. I agree that is what \nthis plan would do. It would create a new entitlement. It would take \nmoney from the general fund and send it to Louisiana.\n  Fifty-four percent of the money under this amendment goes to \nLouisiana. The amendment started out as a $200 million a year \namendment. Now it is up to $250 million a year, which would mean \nLouisiana would get about $135 million.\n  The issue of whether it violates the budget is obvious. It does. And \nthe issue of whether it is technical is obvious. It is not technical. \nIt would create a new entitlement. And it is certainly not technical to \nsay five States should have a unique role in conservation revenues from \nthe Federal general treasury, that they should have a unique right to \nthat as compared to other States which have equal arguments of equity \nrelative to conservation.\n  So it is very hard to understand--well, no, it is not hard to \nunderstand. The Senator from Louisiana made the case. They want their \nshare, they want revenuesharing, and they want an entitlement. That is \nwhat they are going after here. It is a grab at the Federal Treasury. \nMaybe they will be successful at it. But before they do that, they are \ngoing to have to at least overcome a point of order and vote to \ndisregard the budget.\n  At this point, I do make that point of order. Mr. President, this \nadditional spending in this amendment would cause the underlying bill \nto exceed the committee's section 302(a) allocation; and, therefore, I \nraise a point of order against the amendment pursuant to section 302(f) \nof the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I move to waive the applicable sections of \nthe Budget Act with respect to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I think the fact that this budget point of \norder has to be waived makes the case there is a budget point of order \nthat lies. It is not an insignificant point of order when it involves \ncreating a new entitlement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I would be happy to vote on this \nnow, but I understand the other side has reservations about voting now. \nBut it is fine with me to go to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, let me say to the Senator from \nNew Hampshire----\n  Mr. GREGG. Can I get the yeas and nays on the motion to waive?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I say to the Senator from New \nHampshire, of course, this motion is debatable, as the Senator knows. \nWe do not want to take a lot of time, and we do not want them to take a \nlot of time. But we have objection to proceeding from the other side, \nso we are going to be here a while. Sooner or later we will vote, even \nif it is at the end of 30 hours. Everybody should know that. So whoever \nis delaying this, all the other amendments are waiting.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I leave it to the good offices of the \nchairman of the committee, who is an exceptional floor leader, to tell \nme when he wants to have a vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, you should know that at some \npoint I am going to take 3 minutes to explain my version of the budget.\n  Mr. GREGG. I look forward to that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You do not have to be here, but I want you to know that \nso you don't think I am doing it without your knowledge. I will not \ntake more than 3 minutes explaining what I think it says. All right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will continue the call of the roll.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S7217]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. The pending business is the amendment offered by Senators \nLandrieu, Domenici, Vitter, and others with regard to the offshore \nroyalty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe there are some negotiations going \non on other issues. My intent is to speak strictly on this amendment, \nand then I would be glad to put a quorum back in place if there is not \nanother Senator waiting to speak.\n  To me, this amendment is about energy production, but it is also \nabout basic fairness. I am not going to argue at this point with those \nwho are opposed to oil and gas drilling in various and sundry places. I \npersonally think we should drill where the oil, where the gas is. I \nknow that is a novel idea. I do believe we need a national energy \npolicy that is broad, that will have more production of oil and gas and \nclean coal technology and hydropower and nuclear power and LNG plants \nand conservation and alternative fuels--the whole package.\n  I am glad we appear to be getting to the end of this debate and \namendment process and hopefully will produce a bill that passes \noverwhelmingly and will get into conference and will come up with a \nbill that can be passed. We need to do it for the country.\n  This legislation is about national security, and it is about economic \nsecurity. If we don't deal with the problems of energy needs, if we \ndon't become less dependent on foreign imported oil, the day will come \nwhen we are going to have a problem. Just remember, those troops in \nIraq and Afghanistan and around the world, those sailors steaming in \nships, those tanks, those planes, it takes fuel to run them. So it is \nabout national security.\n  We are an energy-driven economy. We need this diversity. We need more \nproduction, more independence. I believe we should open more areas than \nwe are prepared to do apparently. But the fact is, in my part of the \ncountry and the Gulf of Mexico, we have been prepared to have an energy \npolicy. We have been prepared to have the oil and gas industries and \nrefineries and nuclear plants and LNG plants. We are prepared to do \nwhat is necessary not just for our own people and for the financial \nbenefit of our own but, frankly, for the whole country.\n  We are prepared to produce fuels and oil and gas and other fuels. We \nare prepared to refine it and share it with the rest of the country. We \nare prepared to wheel our power to other parts of the country because \nwe have been willing to take the risks. We are willing to build utility \nplants.\n  Other parts of the country don't want to drill. They don't want coal. \nThey don't want nuclear power. They don't want hydropower. They don't \nwant utility plants. They want nothing. But they want to flip the \nswitch and have the lights come on. They want to get in their SUVs and \ndrive off into the sunset. I resent that hypocrisy, quite frankly, but \nthat is the way it is.\n  All we are saying is, in our area--Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, \nAlabama--we have been willing to do what needs to be done, the right \nthing for our region, for our people, and for our country. So we have \noil and gas off the coast. I haven't had a problem with it. I live on \nthe Gulf of Mexico. When I get up in the morning and look out the \nwindow, I am looking at the gulf. I am looking at the pelicans that now \nare plentiful. I am sure they are coming from Louisiana. When I look at \nships going and coming, I am looking at oil tankers, smaller tankers \nthat are lightering oil from bigger tankers. I can remember sitting on \nmy front porch and looking at a natural gas well being flared late \nat night. It wasn't ugly. It was really quite pretty. But there are \nrisks that go with this.\n\n  Particularly in Louisiana, they have paid some prices for what we \nhave done. We levied the Mississippi River, the big and mighty \nMississippi River, to keep it from overflowing year after year. That \nhas affected their wetlands because now you don't have that overflow \nthat goes particularly west of the river that puts sediment out there. \nThe levees send it right on out into the gulf. Now we are concerned \nabout dead zones. We are concerned about the impact on salinity. We are \nconcerned about the fisheries in the gulf, the shellfish and others.\n  We have had to oil drill. In some areas of our region, that has led \nto some channelization. When you are taking things from under the \nEarth, I think it has an effect on elevation in certain areas, wetlands \nareas in particular, estuaries.\n  You might say: Wait a minute. You get the benefit of the business. \nSome, yes, I don't deny that. It does create some jobs--some good-\npaying jobs, some dangerous jobs. It does, though, create a lot of \nactivity for which we have to provide services--roads, harbors. Some of \nthe big companies in the Gulf of Mexico drill off of our coast of \nMississippi, but they don't do business there, not in my State. They \ndon't really even hire that many employees. So there is some good from \nthis, but there is some risk and some bad things.\n  Other parts of the country, when you drill in their States, they get \n50 percent of the royalties, and we get an infinitesimal 1 percent plus \nsome benefits within, I guess, the 6-mile limits of the State. But that \nmoney coming out of the gulf goes into the deep dark hole of the \nFederal Treasury. A lot of it goes into land and water conservation for \nother parts of the States.\n  Other States are saying: We don't want you to drill or produce or \nbuild utility plants in our area. And by the way, we don't want you \nfolks down there who are doing the job and taking the risk to get any \nof that money. We want that money to come up to the Federal Treasury \nand come to our States.\n  Now we are accused of trying to bust the budget. No, we are trying to \nget a fair share. It is not big money in my State, but it would make a \nhuge difference. When you come from a small 2.8 million-population \nState with a history of poverty and needs, even though we are making \nsome progress now--we are not 50th or 49th or 48th on most lists; we \nare moving up the line, creating more jobs, more businesses, better \neducation, better roads--we have other problems. We do have wetlands \nthat are being disturbed or destroyed. We are losing some land, as they \nare in Louisiana. We do have some environmentally sensitive and some \nhistoric sites we need to preserve, protect, and improve. We need some \nhelp. We are prepared to do the dirty work. We are prepared to take the \nrisks. We are prepared to do the right thing and share it with America. \nBut we do think we should get a little bit of the return on the \nroyalties that go right through our hands to the rest of America.\n  This is not a great money grab by Louisiana or Texas, Alabama. This \nis a way that we can get some help from things that we are producing, \nsome benefit that will help our people and preserve the areas we live \nin and love. We are accused of being insensitive to the environment and \nto conservation. Well, this will give us a way to do something about \nit. Quite often, we don't do what we need to do because we cannot \nafford it; we do not have the money. I plead with my colleagues from \nall parts of the country: Look at what we are doing. Look at what \nproblems we are coping with, and look at what we will do with this \nsmall amount of money.\n  By the way, the budget allowed $2 billion in this energy area for us \nto make some decisions on. Yes, it can be objected to on a point of \norder at the committee or on the floor or out of conference. But there \nwas money allowed, and this amendment gets well within that number. I \nthink this is a questionable budget point of order, although I don't \ndispute that the chairman has that authority. I want him to have that \nauthority. Chairman Judd Gregg is doing his job. I am not mad at him. I \ntold him I hope he will do his job and I hope he will do it for effect, \nbut don't get mad about it. If anybody should get mad, the Senators \nfrom Louisiana and the Texans should get mad, and the Mississippians, \ntoo.\n  I support this amendment. I plead with my colleagues, let us have a \nlittle bit to help ourselves, and we will in turn help the country.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator from Mississippi has made such excellent \npoints, and we appreciate his comments and support. The Senator may \nwant to express for a moment the terror that reigned south Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Florida last hurricane season with the unusual number \nof storms\n\n[[Page S7218]]\n\nthat came up through the Gulf of Mexico and how frightening it is to \npeople on the coast when these wetlands continue to disappear. The \nintensity of those storms gets greater and greater, and the damage to \nproperty and the threat to life is fairly serious.\n  As a Senator who lives on the Gulf of Mexico, maybe just a word to \ntalk about what happened to our States last hurricane season.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have great fear that some day, one of \nthose hurricanes will go right up the mouth of the Mississippi River \nand inundate New Orleans. When Hurricane Ivan was coming through the \ngulf last year, when it got to the hundred-mile marker, it was headed \nfor my front porch. Then it veered to the east and missed us by about \n90 miles and did a lot of damage.\n  What can we do about that? First of all, you have to have evacuation \nroutes. We need more money for roads to allow the people to get out of \nthere. The best buffer against the damage is the wetlands, the \nprotective barrier islands, protective areas. The only reason my house \nhasn't been wiped out is because we have a seawall in front of my \nhouse, and we are up on a relatively high point. My house is 11 feet up \noff the ground, what we call an old Creole house.\n  It survived hurricanes for 150 years. But these estuaries, these \nareas outside the main area in which we live, are critical because once \nthat high wind and water hits that area, it begins to lose its \nstrength. If we keep losing land into the gulf, across the Gulf of \nMexico, the hurricane damage--even though the violence may not \nincrease, the damage will really increase. This is just one aspect.\n  By the way, we have to be prepared to get people off these oil rigs \nand out of the Gulf of Mexico. We have to have infrastructure to do \nthat. This will help us achieve that goal.\n  I yield to my colleague from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's remarks. I \nassure him that I support everything he has said, and I agree it is now \ntime for us to recognize that the initiative of the Senators from \nLouisiana, Senator Vitter and Senator Landrieu, and others, including \nmy colleague from Mississippi, deserves to be supported. It deserves \nour support.\n  I understand the question about the budget, but I am reminded about \nan appeal that I had to defend one time in the Supreme Court of the \nState of Mississippi. The lawyer on the other side started off his \nbrief he filed with the supreme court, and he said that this is a \nclassic example of a claim not being paid on the basis of a mere \ntechnicality. Well, of course, there was a lot more to it than just \nthat. The technicality was a real impediment to the appeal being filed \nby my opponent in that case. But I was reminded of that when I was \nwalking over here. This is an issue that could go either way, in terms \nof the point of order and the provisions of the Budget Act. The Senator \nhas made that point, and I congratulate him for doing that.\n  We are not quarreling with the fact that you can make a point of \norder, but you should not as a matter of the overriding national \ninterest. It is a national interest; the integrity of the Gulf Coast \nStates are at risk. We have before us a solution to the problem, and it \nis in the national interest that we support it. That is the argument \nthat is being made to the Senate right now. So however this vote is \ncouched, in terms of a motion to waive the Budget Act or on the \nvalidity of the point of order, I hope the Senate will come down on the \nside of the gulf coast Senators who are trying to solve a problem that \nis in the national interest. We ought to recognize that and vote that \nway on this issue.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank my colleague from Mississippi for his comments and \nhis knowledge of the issue and the procedures we are dealing with. It \nis a great comfort to have him here.\n  One final point before I yield the floor. I thank Senator Domenici \nand Senator Bingaman for working with the Senators who are sponsoring \nthis legislation to try to help us find a way to make this effort, to \nget it at a level that would be helpful to us that would not be a \nbudget buster, that would comply with the amount of money that was \nallowed in the budget resolution. So I commend Senators Vitter and \nLandrieu, and I hope we will be able to get this provision approved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on behalf of the people of Utah, I thank \nthe managers of this Omnibus Energy bill for their leadership in \nproducing a comprehensive and broadly supported proposal.\n  If the American people think bipartisanship is dead in Congress, they \nshould look at this bill and how it is being managed on the floor these \npast 2 weeks.\n  On behalf of the people of Utah, I want to thank the managers of this \nOmnibus Energy bill for their leadership in producing such a \ncomprehensive and broadly supported proposal.\n  If the American people think that bipartisanship is dead in Congress, \nthey should take a look at this bill, and how it is being managed on \nthe floor these 2 weeks.\n  I must commend the leadership of Chairmen Domenici and Grassley, and \ntheir Democratic counterparts, Senators Bingaman and Baucus as the \nSenate considers this critically important piece of legislation.\n  In addition, I want to thank Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus for \nworking so closely with me on the energy tax incentive package, now \npart of the Omnibus Energy bill.\n  In particular, this bill includes a number of provisions of great \nimportance to Utahns, provisions I authored. These include my CLEAR \nAct, which promotes alternatives in the transportation sector, my Gas \nPrice Reduction through Increased Refinery Capacity Act, and my \nproposal to improve the treatment of geothermal powerplants. All were \nincluded in the energy package.\n  I am also grateful to the leaders of the Energy Committee, Chairman \nDomenici and Senator Bingaman, for agreeing to include the major \nprovisions of another bill of keen interest to Utahns, my bill, the Oil \nShale and Tar Sands Promotion Act, S.1111, which was cosponsored by \nSenators Bennett and Allard.\n  Our bill would promote development of the largest untapped resource \nof hydrocarbons in the world. There is more recoverable oil in the oil \nshale and oil sands of Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming than in the entire \nMiddle East.\n  The chairman and his staff have done yeomen's work to successfully \nstrike a compromise on S. 1111 that is agreeable to all sides and that \ncan be accepted into this bill. I thank both leaders for that effort.\n  And finally, I thank them for including my bill, S. 53, in the Energy \nbill. S. 53 would amend the Mineral Leasing Act to authorize the \nSecretary of the Interior to issue separately, for the same area, a \nlease for tar sands and a lease for oil and gas, thus freeing up a new \nresource of natural gas in our Nation.\n  Now, I would like to turn to the Hatch-Bennett amendment on high \nlevel nuclear waste, which we filed in an effort to bring some focus to \nour Nation's policy for handling spent nuclear fuel.\n  In my hand is an article from yesterday's Washington Post.\n  The headline reads, ``Bush Calls for More Nuclear Power Plants.'' And \nthe article begins: ``President Bush called today for a new wave of \nnuclear power plant construction as he promoted an energy policy that \nhe wants to see enacted in a bill now making its way through \nCongress.''\n  The President is calling for a robust nuclear power strategy, and his \nreasons are clear: nuclear power is clean and safe, and there is an \nabundant supply of cheap uranium in Northern America.\n  But my question is, ``What are we going to do with all the waste?''\n  We cannot have a nuclear power strategy until we know what to do with \nall the spent nuclear fuel.\n  And what is becoming quickly apparent to me and to the people of Utah \nis that we do not have a coherent national nuclear waste policy. Until \nwe do, we are putting the cart before of the horse.\n  For years, I have supported sending this high level nuclear waste to \nthe desert of Nevada.\n  To be honest, it has never been an easy vote for me, because it was \nagainst the wishes of my friends and colleagues from that State. \nHowever, it\n\n[[Page S7219]]\n\nhas been our national policy for more than two decades to build a site \nat Yucca Mountain, a safe, remote location, where spent fuel could be \ntaken over by the Federal Government and buried deep beneath the \ndesert.\n  Even though Utah does not use or produce nuclear power, I have \nrecognized the need to have a nuclear power program in the U.S. that \nrelies on a plan to safely handle our waste. In other words, we need a \nstrong nuclear waste program.\n  Here is a picture of the desert area where Yucca Mountain actually \nis. You can see it is desolate and out in the middle of nowhere.\n  Unfortunately, a few nuclear power utilities are attempting to hijack \nour Nation's nuclear waste strategy by joining forces to build an away-\nfrom-reactor, aboveground storage site for one-half of our Nation's \nhigh level nuclear waste on a tiny Indian reservation in Tooele, UT.\n  Even more unfortunate is that the only tribe they could con into \ntaking this waste was the Skull Valley Band of the Goshutes, whose \nsmall reservation just happens to sit on one of the most dangerous \nsites you could imagine for storing high level nuclear waste.\n  The Skull Valley reservation is directly adjacent to the Air Force's \nUtah Test and Training Range and Dugway Proving Grounds where live \nordnance is used.\n  Here is an illustration of an F-l6 that flies regularly in this area.\n  This location proposed for the aboveground storage of half of our \nnuclear waste sits directly under the flight path of 7,000 low altitude \nF-16 flights every year.\n  Even if this area were truly remote from all civilization, which it \nis not, its location alone should disqualify it for the storage of even \none cask of high level nuclear waste. But that's the problem with \nallowing private intrests to establish our nuclear waste strategy, \neconomics can get in the way of reason and safety.\n  Mr. President, 80 percent of Utah's population sits within 50 miles \nof the Skull Valley reservation.\n  Represented on this picture are the type of communities we have near \nthat place.\n  As a crow flies, Skull Valley is less than 15 miles away from Tooele \nCity, one of the fastest growing cities in Utah, which is becoming a \nmajor suburb of Salt lake City.\n  Skull Valley is only about 30 miles from the Salt Lake City \nInternational Airport. And let us not forget that many of the families \nof the Skull Valley Band live right on the reservation, and half, if \nnot more, of them are against this. These families face, by far, the \ngreatest risk.\n  When this group of utilities, known as Private Fuel Storage, or PFS, \napplied for a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the \nCommission's three judge Atomic Licensing Board ruled that the threat \nof a crash from an F-16 was too great to allow a license for the \nproposed facility. Not letting science get in its way, PFS came back \nlater after two of the three judges were replaced with new ones, this \ntime making a different pitch even though all the facts remained the \nsame.\n  As a result, the two new judges ruled, in a two-to-one decision, that \nthe risk of a crash from an F-16 was low enough to allow the license.\n  One has to wonder who in the world would allow the license for a \nsmall tribe in this area with this type of danger. The trustee I don't \nthink could possibly do that. Nevertheless, they ignored the prior \ncommission and went ahead and did it.\n  However, Judge Peter Lam, the senior member of the panel, and its \nonly nuclear engineer, gave a very strong dissent. I would like to \nquote from Judge Lam's dissent:\n\n       The proposed PFS facility does not currently have a \n     demonstrated adequate safety margin against accidental \n     aircraft crashes. . . . This lack of an adequate safety \n     margin is a direct manifestation of the fundamentally \n     difficult situation of the proposed PFS site: 4,000 spent \n     fuel storage casks sitting in the flight corridor of some \n     7,000 F-16 flights a year.\n\n  Judge Lam also cited the inadequacy of the new methodology used to \ndetermine that the site would be safe.\n  He writes:\n\n       In this current proceeding, the Applicant has performed an \n     extensive probability analysis and a structural analysis to \n     rehabilitate its license application. As explained below, the \n     Applicant's probability and structural analyses both suffer \n     from major uncertainties. These uncertainties fundamentally \n     undermine the validity of the analyses.\n\n  Mr. President, with 7,000 F-16 flights every year, one can imagine \nthat emergency landings are not uncommon at the training range, and I \nam unhappy to report that crash landings are not rare, either.\n  In the last 20 years, there have been 70 F-16 crashes at the Utah \nTest and Training Range, and a number of these crashes have occurred \nwell outside the boundaries of the training range.\n\n  I have found it baffling that the Final EIS for the Skull Valley plan \ndoes not require PFS to have any on-site means to handle damaged or \nbreached casks. Rather, the NRC staff concluded the risk of a cask \nbreach is so minimal that they did not have to consider such a scenario \nin their EIS. I find this conclusion dubious and dangerous in light of \nthe facts relating to F-16 overflights.\n  In his dissent, Judge Lam refers to the threat of accidental aircraft \naccidents. He doesn't even go into the possibility of terrorists. Since \nthe events of September 11, we have learned that one of our Nation's \nmost serious threats may come in the form of deliberate suicide air \nattacks. It would seem inconceivable that a Government entity would \nconsider giving their endorsement of the PFS plan without thoroughly \ntaking into account the added terrorist threat our Nation now faces.\n  Yet the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has refused to reopen the \nEnvironmental Impact Statement to consider this new threat, even though \npost-9-11 studies have been completed at all other facilities licensed \nby the NRC.\n  It is apparent they just want to dump this stuff somewhere. I have to \nsay, if this continues, I am certainly going to do some reconsidering \nmyself.\n  I found this especially troubling since the NRC has never granted a \nlicense for the storage of more than about 60 casks, but the Skull \nValley site will hold up to 4,000 casks of this waste.\n  I want my colleagues to understand that not only is the size of the \nPFS proposal a gigantic precedent, but issuing itself a license for a \nprivate away-from-reactor storage site has never been done and runs \ncounter to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act which clearly limits the NRC to \nlicense storage sites only at Federal facilities or onsite at nuclear \npowerplants.\n  Former Secretary of Energy Abraham stated publicly he shares our \ninterpretation. In a letter to members of the Utah congressional \ndelegation, Secretary Abraham issued a policy statement that barred any \nDOE reimbursement funds from being used in relation to the Skull Valley \nsite. This would include industry members who would lease space at the \nsite. He said:\n\n       Because the PFS/Goshute facility in Utah would be \n     constructed and operated outside the scope of the [Nuclear \n     Waste Policy] Act, the Department will not fund or otherwise \n     provide financial assistance for PFS, nor can we monitor the \n     safety precautions the private facility may install.\n\n  My amendment is compatible with the policy outlined by Secretary \nAbraham in his letter. It would ban the transportation of high level \nnuclear waste to private away-from-reactor waste sites and calls for a \nstudy to the feasibility of storing spent fuel either at Department of \nEnergy facilities or of the Department taking possession of the spent \nfuel onsite at nuclear reactors.\n  My amendment calls also for a study of reprocessing spent nuclear \nfuel for future use.\n  Let me state the obvious for the record. The PFS plan is vehemently \nopposed by the entire Utah congressional delegation, Gov. Jon Huntsman, \nformer Gov. Michael Leavitt, and an overwhelming majority of Utahans. \nIn fact, virtually everybody in Utah. A large portion of the 70-member \nGoshute Band is strongly opposed to the proposal. We believe a majority \nof them are, but there is some indication of fraud in their elections \nout there.\n  Furthermore, the leader of the band, Leon Bear, has pleaded guilty to \na Federal indictment. It is notable that every other tribal government \nin Utah has come out flatly against it. How could any trustee for the \nIndians allow something like that to be?\n\n[[Page S7220]]\n\n  Utahns are well aware of the points I have made today. Because of the \nrisks we face associated with the PFS proposal, we know better than any \nthat our Nation's nuclear waste policy is broken. It was with good \nreason that our Nation's nuclear waste strategy has been built around \nthe expectation that the Federal Government, namely the Department of \nEnergy, would take possession of spent nuclear fuel rods. What better \nexample do we need than the PFS plan to see why private industry should \nnot be allowed to develop and implement our Nation's nuclear waste \nstrategy.\n  Think about it. PFS is a shell corporation. If anything went wrong, \nUtah is going to eat it. That is all there is to it. It is ridiculous.\n  I understand why our colleagues from Nevada oppose the Yucca Mountain \nsite. I am getting more and more understanding of that as I go along. \nBut if they are concerned about waste at Yucca Mountain, they should be \nexponentially more concerned over the PFS site which is so flawed as to \nbe inherently dangerous, extremely dangerous.\n  In closing, let me drive home one point. Our President has called for \na dramatic increase in our Nation's capacity to generate nuclear power. \nAs Congress considers that proposal, I ask, Should any increase we \nmight authorize rest on a nuclear waste policy established by the \nFederal Government or should that policymaking rest with a couple of \nprivate companies that are driven by profit?\n  Do we want the Federal Government to take possession of our high \nlevel nuclear waste or is our national waste policy to allow private \ncompanies to control the transport, storage, and security of this \nwaste? And with shell corporations at that. If that is to be our \npolicy, then I need to inform our colleagues that our Nation's nuclear \npower strategy is a house built on sand.\n  Let me summarize my remarks. We Utahns are adamantly opposed to the \nstorage of spent nuclear fuel at the Skull Valley reservation. The \ncurrent site that has been selected by a consortium made up of eight \nutilities has several fatal flaws, including the fact that it \ncontemplates a facility that is, one, located fewer than 50 miles from \nthe Salt Lake Valley where 80 percent of our fellow Utahans live; two, \ndirectly under the Utah Test and Training Range where roughly 7,000 \nlow-altitude F-16 training flights take place each year, many with live \nordnance, and over a range where 70 crashes have taken place already; \nand three, on the small Skull Valley Goshute Indian reservation where \nabout 40 of the band's 120 total members reside--only 40. Moreover, the \nSkull Valley Band's leadership is in question. Leon Bear, the band's \ncurrent chairman, has been accused by his colleagues of disregarding a \nvote of no confidence. In addition, Mr. Bear recently pleaded guilty to \nFederal criminal charges and is awaiting sentencing relating to his \nmanagement of tribal financial resources.\n  I would like to know if my friend, the chairman of the Senate Energy \nCommittee, believes that storing spent nuclear fuel on a privately run \nand privately owned offsite facility, such as the Skull Valley \nreservation in Utah, is a component of our national nuclear waste \npolicy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in response to that question, I would \nsay that our national policy for handling high level nuclear waste is \nto store it at the proposed DOE site at Yucca Mountain. I don't know \nwhether the Skull Valley site will receive the regulatory approval it \nneeds. That is not my decision. However, in my view, our focus should \nremain on a solution that puts this waste directly in the hands of the \nFederal Government.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for that \nclarification.\n  I again thank the leaders of this bill who have done such a great job \nin bringing both sides together to pass what will be one of the most \nimportant energy bills in the history of the world. It certainly is \ngoing to do a lot for our country if we will continue to follow this \nthrough conference and get it back for final passage. It is long \noverdue.\n  I know it has been an ordeal for Senator Domenici in particular and \nothers as well. I pay my tribute to them for the hard work they have \ndone.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 891\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of this Energy \nbill and in particular the amendment that is primarily sponsored by \nSenators Domenici, Bingaman, Landrieu, Vitter, and others.\n  First, I thank Chairman Domenici and Ranking Member Bingaman for \ntheir skillful leadership, their dedication, their patience, and \neverything they have done to craft a bipartisan bill. It is a \nbipartisan energy policy that I believe encourages, incents, provides \nus, as a country, with clean and affordable energy in a growing and \nobviously more secure economy.\n  We have made significant progress so far on this measure. I look \nforward to passage of this bill in the Senate so we can get a final \nmeasure passed before the summer recess.\n  This bill is important for three salient reasons: No. 1, the security \nof this country; No. 2, jobs in this country; and No. 3, the \ncompetitiveness of the United States of America.\n  As far as security and energy independence, we must become less \nreliant on foreign sources of oil and natural gas from unstable, \nunreliable places in the world.\n  Second, as far as jobs are concerned, this measure, when passed, will \nsave jobs. Hundreds of thousands of jobs will be saved and hundreds of \nthousands of jobs in a variety of ways will be created--new jobs. It is \nimportant for saving jobs especially in the areas where there is \nmanufacturing of chemicals, fertilizers, plastics, forestry products, \nand even tires. All of those can be manufactured anywhere in the world, \nbut we have a high-intensity need for clean burning natural gas right \nhere in America. And jobs will be saved if we produce it here within \nour own borders.\n  We are supporting new technologies for the production of electricity \nusing clean coal technology--where we are embracing the advances of \ntechnology to utilize an abundant resource, coal--we are the Saudi \nArabia of the world in coal, and we ought to be using it, as well as \nnew technologies for clean nuclear power generation. That is where jobs \nmatter.\n  As far as competitiveness, there is not a person here, not a person \nin this country, whether it is driving to school, driving to work, \noperating a business, and it could be the highest, most technologically \nadvanced business, that doesn't need electricity. Everything we consume \ngoes by rail, truck, air, or a combination thereof before it gets to \nthe store or to our homes or to our places of business. This bill is \nessential for lower gasoline and diesel costs for transport of these \nproducts.\n  We need to have an affordable energy source for our economy, for \njobs, and the competitiveness of our country in the future because many \nof these jobs can be put anywhere in the world. In addition to proper \ntax policies, reasonable regulatory policies, less litigation, and the \nembracing of innovations, an energy policy for this country is long \noverdue.\n  With regard to competitiveness, I was Governor at one time. We would \nalways try to get businesses to locate in the Commonwealth of Virginia. \nWe succeeded. The businesses looked at the cost of operations in \ndifferent States. They looked at what the cost was; what is the \nregulatory burden; do you have a right-to-work law, which we did; what \nis the cost of health care. They cared about transportation, but they \nalso looked at the cost of doing business with electricity. We would \nhave a report to top management in New York City, and we would compare \nour electricity rates in Virginia to those in the New York City area. \nVirginia's electricity rates, compared to those, looked as though they \nwere almost free. That was an attribute, a strong selling point for \nbusinesses to come to the Commonwealth of Virginia. These same \nprinciples apply to the entire United States of America.\n  Let's look at natural gas. Natural gas, that wonderful clean burning \nfuel, is in many places around the world, in many strong economies \naround the world. We would certainly want to be able to match other \ncountries in the cost of producing this clean burning fuel, whether for \nour homes, but also for manufacturers. It is not just the chemical and \nfertilizer manufacturers, it is the farmers who have to pay these\n\n[[Page S7221]]\n\nhigher prices, and when farmers have to pay higher prices to run their \ntractors or to fertilize their fields, that means the cost of food goes \nup, which affects us all in that way as well.\n\n  Look at our prices--and these prices are from February, and prices of \nnatural gas have gone up in this country since this report. In the \nUnited States of America, we are over $7 for 1 million Btus of natural \ngas and it is rising.\n  Take the United Kingdom, Great Britain. It is $5.15. Turkey is only \n$2.65. Ukraine is $1.70. Russia is less than a dollar per 1 million \nBtus. You say, well, we are not competing with them. Who are we \ncompeting with then? We are competing with them, as well as with South \nAmerica. Look at the prices of natural gas in South American countries: \n$1.50 in Argentina compared to over $7 in the United States. In North \nAfrica, it is less than a dollar.\n  What about real competition we are facing in the loss of \nmanufacturing jobs to India and to China? China and India are \nincreasing in their economies and, of course, demand for oil, natural \ngas, coal and other fuels is going up, too, exacerbating the prices. We \nsee China now trying to buy up our gasoline companies, specifically \nUnocal. For our national security, it's important that we have a \ncomprehensive review of the types of investments State owned Chinese \ncompanies are making in international and U.S. based energy resources.\n  Even there, where China has this booming economy, their price is \n$4.50 compared to us. The same with Japan. India pays half the price we \ndo in natural gas, $3.10 per 1 million Btus. Our friends in Australia \npay $3.75 for a million Btus of natural gas.\n  As a result of what we are seeing in these higher natural gas prices, \nwe are already losing jobs in this country. The chemical industry, one \nof our Nation's largest industrial users of natural gas, has watched \nmore than 100,000 jobs, one-tenth of the U.S. chemical workforce, \ndisappear just since the year 2000.\n  Recent studies by the National Association of Manufacturers and the \nAmerican Chemistry Council found that 2 million jobs could be saved if \nCongress lays out a fresh blueprint for the supply, delivery, and \nefficient use of all forms of energy, including clean burning natural \ngas.\n  To address this natural gas crisis that is crippling our American \nfarmers and manufacturers, we need a positive, proactive strategy for \ngreater fuel diversity. The bill does just that by supporting clean \ncoal. It supports nuclear energy and a whole host of renewable \ntechnologies, such as biofuels and incentives for fuel cells.\n  In the area of nuclear, I think it is one of the most important \naspects of the bill. When one thinks of the generation of electricity, \nwe ought to be using clean nuclear and clean coal technology while \nallowing natural gas to be utilized not for base load electricity \ngeneration but rather for factories, manufacturing jobs, and in our \nhomes.\n  The President's Nuclear Power 2010 Program is designed to work with \nthe nuclear industry in a 50/50 cost-sharing arrangement. It also \naddresses some of the risks and litigation aspects of it. One thing \nthat is not in this measure but I am going to work on in the future is \nthe repository.\n  The Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, was talking about Yucca Mountain. I \nfully understand why the people in Nevada would not want to have highly \nradioactive fuel rods that are radioactive for 40,000 years. What we \nneed to do long term is look at what France is doing with nuclear \npower. What they have done is taken a technology that was started in \nthis country on reprocessing and they have perfected it. We ought to be \nreprocessing this nuclear fuel, these spent fuel rods. If we do that, \nit is a much more efficient and much less dangerous approach. It is \nmuch less volume, and are decreased. That is something we need to do \nlong term. It is not in this measure, but we need to move forward with \nit in the future.\n  Also in this bill we have set efficiency standards for everything \nfrom buildings to appliances that will help reduce our demand for \nelectricity and natural gas.\n  Ultimately, we need to need to produce more natural gas. This \namendment talks about coastal States that are committed to more \nexploration, the impact on their coastal areas and allowing them to get \nsome assistance to these States closest to the exploration.\n  What I am going to say is not part of this amendment, but the issue \nof exploration off the coasts of different States came up during the \nhearings in our committee. It is not necessarily part of--in fact, it \nis not part of this amendment, but for the people of the Commonwealth \nof Virginia, this is an issue of some interest in our General Assembly. \nOur State legislature, in a very strong bipartisan action, stated that \nthey were in favor of allowing or at least determining if there is any \nnatural gas--not oil but natural gas--far off the coast of Virginia, \nbeyond the viewshed, and, in the event that there is, allowing Virginia \nto share some of those revenues. That is not going to be part of this \nmeasure, and I say to Senator Bingaman, it is not part of this measure.\n  I realize things move slowly around here, slower than some of us \nwould like, but I do think that the people in the States should have \nmore of a say in energy production. Right now, if one looks at these \ncoastal areas, it is all subject to the whims of the Federal \nGovernment. The Federal Government says they own it; the Federal \nGovernment says: We will determine if it is in a moratorium or not.\n  I am one, having been Governor, who would actually like the people in \nthe States to have more prerogatives. There may be a different batch of \nfolks in the Senate, and we may have a different President who says, \nNo, we are going to do this, we do not care what the people of New \nJersey think; we are going to go forward and explore. I would like to \nprotect the prerogatives of the people of the States and also allow the \npeople in the States, if they so choose to explore, to actually share \nin those revenues.\n  I have suggested that in Virginia, we ought to use a good portion of \nit for universities and colleges to reduce in-State tuition costs; \nanother big chunk for transportation to alleviate traffic congestion; \nand another portion to the coastal areas, such as places like Virginia \nBeach, for things like beach replenishment. That is just something I \nwould like to see ultimately allowed, but that is not part of this \nmeasure.\n  I also do think that I know the President's views on the inventory \nissue. People in South and North Carolina, Florida, and New Jersey do \nnot even want an inventory. They do not even want to know what is off \ntheir coast. In my view, the compromise to all of this, if they do not \nwant to, they don't have to. Why spend money looking off those coasts \nbecause the people of Florida, North Carolina, New Jersey, and maybe \nSouth Carolina as well, do not want to. So why waste the money? \nHowever, if the people of Georgia and Virginia would like to know what \nis off their coasts, allow them to at least find out what is out there \nand then make a determination therefrom. That might be the good \ncompromise to this issue in conference.\n  This measure that Senator Landrieu and Senator Vitter have brought up \nhas to do with Louisiana and a great deal, obviously, with the gulf \ncoast. They have certain needs in Louisiana. Being in Cajun country and \nall around Louisiana last year for a variety of purposes, I know this \nis a very big issue to the people of Louisiana. We should be thankful \nto the people of Louisiana for the efforts they have made in the \nexploration off their coast because they are powering this country.\n  Granted, natural gas prices are high, and maybe we will get more \nproduction out of Alaska, and maybe we will get some more out of \nLouisiana or maybe off of Mississippi, but the point is that they have \ngreat coastal impacts, not because of the exploration way off in the \nGulf of Mexico but because of the services to transport it, just the \nnature of the bayous. It is just the topography, that they have coastal \nerosion there that is of great concern to everyone in the State of \nLouisiana, especially south Louisiana. They are all proud of that \nsportsman paradise, as they call it.\n  I strongly support Senator Domenici's and Senator Bingaman's effort \nin this bill to consider the needs of producing States. Long term, what \nwe are looking at is supporting, creating, and\n\n[[Page S7222]]\n\npreserving manufacturing jobs and finding environmentally safe ways to \nincrease production of clean burning natural gas. It is important for \njobs in this country. It is important for our national security to be \nless dependent on foreign energy. We need to be more independent, and, \nof course, we need to be much more competitive for investments and jobs \nif we are going to be the world capital of innovation.\n  So I urge my colleagues most respectfully to vote for this amendment \nthat allows coastal impact assistance to States closest to this \nexploration. We have listened in meetings to Senator Vitter argue very \npersuasively to me and to others, I hope, and the same with Senator \nLandrieu in a variety of forums as well--they have made a persuasive \nargument for Louisiana, but ultimately it is a persuasive argument for \nthe United States of America.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention, and most importantly I \nthank my colleagues in anticipation of a positive vote for this \namendment and moreover getting this Energy bill passed so that this \ncountry can become more independent of foreign oil, foreign energy, \nsave those jobs, create more jobs, and make this country more \ncompetitive for investment and creativity in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before the Senator from Virginia leaves \nthe floor, might I say to all of those who pay attention to these \nissues that the Senator is a new member of the Energy Committee, and I \nwondered when we made up the committee why the Senator had chosen to be \non the committee. Then I found out that Virginia has a terrific \ninterest in a lot of these issues, and I found that the Senator was \nvery knowledgeable and a very good participant. The Senator helped us \nget a good bill. I commend the Senator on his analysis today. This is a \nbill that should direct us in the right way, especially in the natural \ngas area.\n  Clearly, we are at our knees. People say it is the gas pump, but it \nis also the price of natural gas that is causing America great trouble. \nWe have resources. We just cannot use them because we need new \ntechnology and we need to do a better job of getting them ready for the \nmarketplace so that we do not damage the air. We are working on that, \nand I thank the Senator for that.\n  Also, I want to compliment the Senator on seeing the value of the \noffshore resources of the United States. I am not suggesting that I \nunderstand each State's political issues, but I do understand that \nthere is a lot of natural gas offshore. No. 2, I do understand it can \nbe produced with little or no harm to anybody. A lot of it can be \nproduced if it is there.\n  I commend the Senator for realizing that is an American asset and he \nwould like very much for the Congress to face up to that.\n  I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I say to my chairman that the reason I wanted to get on \nhis committee was because I believed that this Energy bill was the most \nimportant legislation we will pass in this Congress that will affect \nour competitiveness, jobs in this country, as well as our independence \nor less dependence on foreign oil and foreign energy, whether it is \nnatural gas, liquefied natural gas, and all the rest.\n  I have been so impressed by the bipartisan way the Senator has \nmethodically tried to move this measure forward that has great \nimportance for the future of our country, not just for the next 5 or 10 \nyears but, indeed, for generations to come. It is a model for how we \ncan work in a bipartisan way. Does everyone get everything they want? \nNo. But I think the American people ultimately will be much better off, \nthere will be more people and families working, and we will be more \ncompetitive, thanks to the Senator's leadership.\n  I am very proud and pleased to have been appointed and elected to the \nEnergy Committee, and I look forward to working with the chairman. He \nis a magnificent leader with the right vision for this country.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I support the Landrieu/Vitter amendment. \nAs a State that is a producer of oil and gas off its shore, I certainly \nbelieve we should have some slight, minor benefit from that effort, \nparticularly in light of the fact that State after State just blithely \nannounces they will not have any off their shore. I believe that a 2-\npercent part of the revenue that is going to the Federal Government to \nthe States that bear the burden of this offshore production is not too \nmuch to ask. It is not a violation of the budget. The money is set \naside that can be spent on this. It is a question of priority. I \nbelieve we should go forward with that.\n  I wish to say how much I appreciate the remarks of Senator Allen. I \nbelieve he has analyzed our energy situation well. I would also join in \nmy praise for Chairman Domenici for his work. He understands that \nnuclear and all other sources of power have to be increased to have us \nmore energy independent. It is not just one step that we can take. \nFrankly, if one wants my opinion, and I believe it is correct, the area \nmost overlooked, the area in which we can have the largest short-term \nsurge of energy in our country that can be so important for our economy \nand jobs is offshore production of oil and gas, particularly natural \ngas.\n  We had an amendment just yesterday that I joined with the Senators \nfrom California to support--it did not pass--to have more controls over \nthe building of liquefied natural gas terminals in our States, to give \nthe States some more ability to participate in that process.\n  Why do we have liquefied natural gas terminals? We have not had them \nbefore. The reason is we are not producing enough natural gas in our \ncountry to supply our needs, and there are resources worldwide offshore \nthat can be produced around countries such as Qatar in the Persian \nGulf--some of whom have been friends, some of whom have not been \nfriends of the United States--so they would have us produce it on those \nwaters, to liquefy it at great expense, transport it around the world \nto some terminal in my hometown in Mobile, AL, and then put it in our \npipelines. And where does the money go? Where does 100 percent of the \nroyalty money go in that circumstance? It goes to the Saudi Arabias and \nthe Qatars and Venezuela and those other countries, sucking out huge \nsums of money from our country, when we could keep all of that money in \nour national economy if we produced the existing supplies of natural \ngas that are off our shores.\n\n  I go down to one of the prettiest beaches in America. It is becoming \nmore and more recognized--Gulf Shores, AL. You can stand on those \nbeaches and at night you can see the oil rigs out off the shore. We \nhave not had a spill there. In fact, I had the numbers checked, and I \nunderstand there was one spill off Louisiana in 1970. None of that \nreached the shore.\n  By the way, as all who have studied this know, natural gas is far \nless a threat to our environment, if there is a leak, than is oil. Oil \nis thicker and heavier and can pollute if there is a large amount \nspread on our shore. But we have not had any of that, and hundreds--\nthousands--of wells have been drilled and produced in the Gulf of \nMexico. According to the Energy Committee, 65 percent of all energy \nproduced from oil and gas comes from the Gulf of Mexico. That is a \ntremendous amount right off our coast. So Texas and Louisiana and \nMississippi and Alabama have participated in that. Yet under the law of \nthe United States and the tax provisions of our country, you cannot \nreceive any revenue from it. It is moving in interstate commerce. You \ncan't tax a truck going through your State, under the Constitution. You \ncan't tax fuel going through a pipeline. So you produce it, and it \nmoves out.\n  An LNG terminal, by the way, some have said, is an economic benefit \nto your community. It only has about 30 jobs, and it does have some \nsafety risk, no doubt. Some say a lot. I don't know how much, but it \nhas some safety risk. It has some tendency to diminish the value of \nproperty around it for sure. But you can't tax it because it is the \ninterstate flow of a resource.\n  So they want these States to continue to be serving the American \neconomy with no compensation whatsoever. The 2-percent figure that has \nbeen proposed here is not at all unreasonable to me. I think that is a \nmodest charge, in fact.\n\n[[Page S7223]]\n\n  Let me tell you the extent of the hypocrisy that goes on. My \ncolleagues from Florida, the leaders in the State of Florida, have \nbeautiful beaches such as we have. We border their beaches. They \ndeclare you cannot have a well if you have a beach in sight of it. Now \nthey said you can't have an oil well so close--even outside of the \nsight of the beach. In fact, they are objecting to drilling oil wells \n250 miles from the Florida beaches, as if this is somehow some \nreligious event of cataclysmic proportions, if somebody were to drill \nan oil or gas well--mostly gas wells--out in the deep Gulf of Mexico. \nYou know what. They are proposing right now, they desire and are moving \nforward with a plan to build a natural gas pipeline from my hometown of \nMobile, AL, to Tampa, FL. They want to take the natural gas produced \noff the shores of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, put it in a pipeline \nand move it to their State so they can have cheaper energy, and they \ndon't want to have anything within 100 to 250 miles of their State. \nThis is not correct.\n  Mr. President, I know you are a skilled lawyer and a JAG Officer in \nthe military, but I was a U.S. attorney and represented the U.S. \nGovernment. Let me tell you, under the law of the United States, \nFlorida does not own the land 200 miles off its shore. I have to tell \nyou, that is U.S. water. There is no doubt about it. For the Senator \nfrom Louisiana and I, our boundary line is just 3 miles. Everybody else \nin the country has 9 miles, but after 9 miles, it is Federal water. Yet \nwe show deference to the States and want to work with the States and \nlisten to what they have to say, but as a matter of law, they don't get \nto decide who drills in the waters of the United States of America.\n  This country is at a point where we have to ask ourselves where we \nwant this offshore oil and gas produced. Do we want to have it produced \noff Venezuela, in the lake down there, or in the Persian Gulf where all \nthe money we have to pay for it goes to those countries, sucking it out \nof our economy or would we rather have it produced in this Nation, in \nthe huge amounts that exist so our country can benefit from it? We have \nthese crocodile tears by people who begrudge a little 2 percent that \nwould go to our States that produce it, and they are not complaining \none bit, I suppose, about an LNG terminal in Mobile, AL, designed to \nbring natural gas from halfway around the world, from some country that \nmay be hostile to our national interests.\n  It makes no sense whatsoever. It is time for us to have a lot bigger \ndiscussion about this matter. I see the Senator from Louisiana is here. \nI know her State has more offshore wells than any other. I know they \nhave had probably more environmental degradation as a result of it. I \ndon't see anything wrong with them being able to ask for some \ncompensation.\n\n  I have enjoyed working with her on this legislation.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am pleased to.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. If the Senator will yield, he has made so many \nexcellent points, and I am not sure I heard them. Maybe if he would \nrepeat--right now we are building a pipeline from Alabama to Florida? \nCould the Senator explain that, again? I am not sure people understand \nthat you are building a pipeline from Alabama and sending the gas--\nwhere?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. To Tampa, FL, to some of those people, I guess, who \nhave the multimillion-dollar mansions on the coast, who want to use \nthat natural gas to cool their hot houses. I remember when it first \ncame up, this debate was ongoing, former Congressman ``Sonny'' \nCallahan, from Mobile, was in the House. I suggested that he put in an \namendment that just blocked the pipeline. If they don't want to produce \nany oil and gas, why should they get it? And he did, almost perhaps as \na bit of humor, but also to raise a serious point. People want to \nutilize this resource but they are opposing its production.\n  But let me ask the Senator from Louisiana this question. Don't you \nthink that some of the areas, such as California and others, that are \nso hostile to producing offshore, are ill-informed about the risk? It \nis almost as though it is this huge risk that their entire beaches are \ngoing to be threatened every day, but we have not had problems in our \nbeaches. Have you in Louisiana?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator for that question. I would like to \nrespond this way. I do think there is a lot of misunderstanding and \nfear associated with an industry that not everyone knows about. As the \nSenator knows, we do know a great deal about the industry. We \nunderstand that 40 years ago, 30 years ago, the industry was relatively \nnew and mistakes were made and technology was being tried out. We just \ndid not have all the environmental data that we have today. But as the \nSenator knows, in every industry there has been tremendous advancement \nmade.\n  Not too along ago I was watching a program on television that was \nshowing the way hot water heaters were developed in the Nation. I think \nthe chairman from New Mexico would appreciate this. The whole program \nwas about how in the early days people really wanted to have water, \nclean water, but they needed it warm for many purposes--not just for \nconvenience and health, but cleanliness. They couldn't figure it out. \nSo they kept trying to figure out a way to get hot water to people's \nhouses.\n  But what would happen is these early hot water pumps, as you know, \nwould blow up, they would blow the whole house up and people were \nactually killed; they lost their lives. But did we stop trying to bring \nhot water into the homes of Americans?\n  I know this might seem to be a small matter to people who live in the \nUnited States, but turning on a faucet, in your home, for clean, \ndrinkable cold and hot water is still a luxury in the world today. But \nAmericans did not stop with that technology. So today we take it for \ngranted. Everybody can go home and turn the hot water on and it comes \nout and nobody blows up.\n  The Senator from Alabama is absolutely correct. There are people who \njust do not know. This technology is very safe. Plus, we have the Coast \nGuard, we have Federal agencies, we have the State court system, and \nthe Federal court system, in answer to your question, that all enforce \nthe laws, and agencies that are ``Johnny on the spot'' if something \ngoes wrong.\n  Are there accidents? Yes. Can things go wrong? Yes. But I think as we \nstart telling people more and at least give people more good \ninformation--the Senator from Alabama is correct--then they can make \nbetter decisions for the country. Again, to be respectful, if some \nStates have accepted this information and still make the choice not to \ngo forward, that might be their prerogative. But the Senator is \nabsolutely correct. For those States such as Alabama, such as \nMississippi, such as Texas and Louisiana, that have decided this is in \nour State's interests and the Federal interest, then most certainly \nthis small amount of money for coastal impact assistance--to help us \nwith our wetlands, to help us with beach erosion, to help make those \ninvestments that are so necessary--is absolutely the right thing to do \nat this time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. May I ask the Senator another question? It has been \nreported that Cuba is going to be drilling for oil and gas out in the \nGulf of Mexico. I wonder if our colleague would prefer that Cuba would \ndo this where, I assume, it would be less safe, with less management, \nand all the money go to them rather than to the United States? Is that \na fact? Is Cuba considering participating in drilling for oil and gas \noff the coast of Mexico, off our coast?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator is correct. There is some thought that \nperhaps Cuba may open drilling and Canada may open drilling. But again, \nthis amendment that the Senator has cosponsored, along with my \ncolleague from Louisiana, who is here on the floor as well, is not a \ndrilling amendment. It is not touching the moratoria. It is not laying \ndown any boundary changes whatsoever. It is a coastal impact assistance \nrevenue sharing for only the current producing States. So while there \nhas been an extended debate--because we are not able to go to a final \nvote because there are some things that are being worked out and there \nhas been an extended debate in these last hours, as my good friend from \nFlorida knows, who is here on the floor--this amendment is a coastal \nimpact amendment.\n\n[[Page S7224]]\n\n  We have already debated the moratoria issue. We have debated the \ndrilling issue. We could not come to a compromise on that so that issue \nis going to be saved to another day.\n  I have said to my friends from New Jersey and my friends from Florida \nand to my friends from Virginia and to you, the Senator from Alabama, \nthis debate is not going to go away. We are going to have to continue \nto debate it. But this is not the debate at this moment. This debate \nnow, this amendment that has broad bipartisan support, is about coastal \nrevenue sharing, coastal impact assistance for States that produce oil \nand gas.\n  If I could, I wanted to make mention of something that would help the \ncountry understand, I think. This is from the Department of Energy, \nEnergy Information Agency's Report of 2001.\n  These numbers will have changed, obviously, since 2001, but probably \nnot by too much, and I doubt the quarter will change too much.\n  This is all energy produced--nuclear, hydro, geothermal, wood, wind, \nwaste, solar, oil, natural gas, and coal. That is everything--nuclear, \nhydro, geothermal, wood, wind, waste, solar, oil, natural gas, coal.\n  There are only 11 States in the Union that produce more energy than \nthey consume. All of these States, starting from No. 1, California, all \nthe way down to Vermont, use more energy than they produce.\n  Again, I am aware that we are a Nation of 50 States. Some States grow \nsweet potatoes, some States grow Irish potatoes; some States make \ntractors, some States make automobiles.\n  But the problem here is that some are saying we don't want to produce \nenergy but we want the benefits. So I am saying to my friends on all \nsides, if you don't want to drill for oil and gas on your shore or off, \nthen put up a nuclear powerplant. If you don't want to put up a nuclear \npowerplant, put up windmills. If you don't want to put up windmills, \nyou have to try to do something to generate energy for this country.\n  That is my only argument. That is not this amendment. This amendment \nis just recognizing that the States that have--let me just say this. I \nam trying to speak the truth here. Not only does Louisiana produce more \nthan it uses, but please remember how much industry we have. Most of \nthe chemical plants are in Louisiana, New Jersey, Illinois. Those are \nthe areas where there are a lot of chemical plants.\n  We are proud of the petrochemical industry. But we also supply all of \nthose manufacturing facilities--huge manufacturing facilities--that \nproduce products that are not just bought by Louisiana; these chemicals \ngo into better products we create in America. We sell them overseas, we \nsell some to ourselves, and we make money.\n  Not only are we producing all the gas and energy we need, we are \nfueling all of our plants and then exporting. When you add that on top \nof the numbers on my chart--and I want this corrected for the record. I \nam not sure this chart counts offshore; I think this may be just \nonshore. I don't think this counts offshore. If you add that, these \nnumbers go up exponentially.\n  Wyoming gets the first prize. Some States say, We do not have the \nresources. I understand that. Not everyone has oil and gas. Not \neveryone has coal. The point Senator Domenici has been trying to make \nis, that is fine, but everybody has an ability to do something. Either \nconserve more, do not let SUVs come to your State if that is what you \nwant to do, or produce more. That is the point--not on this amendment--\none of the points of this bill.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. First, the Senator is exactly correct. This amendment \nis a very modest amendment. It has nothing to do with production of oil \nand gas. It is with frustration that our State has worked toward that \ngoal and has not been able to receive any compensation, and many other \nStates seem to be slamming the door on even considering that.\n  I ask the Senator if there is not a difference in safety and \nenvironmental impact when we deal with natural gas as opposed to oil? \nAnd is it not true that much of the energy capacity in the Gulf of \nMexico and probably off our other States, is natural gas? I know that \nis important. We have probably seen a tripling of natural gas prices.\n  I know the Senator agrees that pipelines commence out of the gulf \ncoastal areas--Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas--that move the \nnatural gas all over the country, and those States, if the price keeps \ngoing up when they heat their houses, they heat their water, their \nindustries utilize natural gas, those prices are going up, also, which \nthreatens their economic competitiveness. It is not that our States \nhave a particular benefit from having the production. It goes in the \npipelines that move it all over the country.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator is correct. The Senator from Louisiana \ncould answer as well, Senator Vitter. I will yield to him for a \nresponse.\n  We get the benefit of jobs. We are happy for the jobs, and we are \nproud of the technology we are developing.\n  The Senator from Alabama is correct. This oil and gas that comes \nthrough our State and is generated in and around our State goes to the \nbenefit of everyone to try to keep the lights on in Chicago, New York, \nCalifornia, and Florida. We are happy to do it. We are not even \ncomplaining. We are just saying, in light of this, could we please \nshare less than 1 or 2 percent of the money generated. Last year we \ngave $5 billion to the Treasury.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Chair reminds Senators that the \nSenator from Alabama controls the microphone and the Senator from \nLouisiana does not have the ability to yield to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we had a nice discussion and I thank the \nChair for reminding us of that.\n  Before I yield the floor, I have enjoyed discussing this with the \nSenators from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu and Senator Vitter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will yield momentarily.\n  I say to the Senators who are listening and to their staffs, we are \nin the process of trying to put together a short list of amendments \nthat are absolutely necessary. We are getting close to the end--the end \nwill be here when 30 hours have elapsed and then we could have a series \nof votes, but I don't think anyone wants that.\n  The Democratic and Republican staffers are taking these amendments \nand they are working together to see how many are absolutely necessary.\n  I ask Senators, do not wait, because we will have to go back and call \nyou all. If you are serious about an amendment, there are people on the \nDemocratic side and the Republican side and in the respective \ncloakrooms waiting to see and talk with you through your staffs or \notherwise as to what you want to do about the amendments.\n  Clearly, there are numerous amendments and I am sure they are all not \ngoing to be offered. They were submitted in good faith, but I am sure \nthey are not intended to be voted on before we finish.\n  Would Senators on both sides of the aisle--I think Senator Bingaman \nagrees--try to help by getting word to the cloakrooms whether they are \nserious, whether they want to work on their amendments so we can put \nour list together.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. It is my understanding the Senator wants to \nget this bill done quickly. I certainly support him in his desire to \nget that done quickly. It is also my understanding, in order to achieve \nthat goal, the two managers of the bill are presently negotiating down \nthe number of amendments.\n  Is it correct, the understanding that the Senator from Florida has, \nthat the amendments that would be agreed to take up would not include \nany amendments having to do with the Outer Continental Shelf drilling?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I say it this way. We are not going to agree \nunilaterally or even together what the list is. Senators have to agree. \nSo, Senator, you and others who do not want that on the list, you will \nbe there and you will say no, and so it will not be on that list. That \nis the best way to say it. It is not going to be on the list unless \nSenators want it on the list. If you do not want it on the list, when \nwe get there, we will call, as you know, and\n\n[[Page S7225]]\n\nwe will find out. We cannot tell you now because we have a lot of \namendments. Let's follow the regular order. You will be there and \neveryone should know that.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Indeed. And this Senator understands where \nboth Senators from New Mexico are trying to get with the legislation. I \ncertainly want you to get there and get there fast.\n  Basically you come up with a list of amendments that would be \nconsidered and you would consider under unanimous consent in the \nSenate, that is the list to be considered for the rest of the debate on \nthe bill before final passage?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is absolutely right. That is the way it is \ndone. That is the way it will be done.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator for his clarification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I follow up on some of the previous \ncomments regarding this coastal amendment and quickly underscore two \nvery important points.\n  As my colleague from Louisiana has explained, this is merely treating \nthose coastal producing States that have produced so much of the \nNation's energy needs, taken care of so much of those needs, simply \ntreating those coastal producing States fairly.\n  If only more States were like us in producing far more energy than we \nconsume, of course, this energy crisis we are facing would be less and \nless onerous, but that is not the case.\n  In particular, the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee was \nin the Senate and said his State produced more energy than it consumed. \nI would love to hear the distinguished chairman's sources for that. I \nchecked with the U.S. Department of Energy and they flatly disagreed. \nThe most recent figures I could obtain, September 5, 2003, certainly \ninclude the nuclear energy plant the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire was referring to. That produces far less than the State of \nNew Hampshire consumes. In fact, the total energy production from New \nHampshire comes from that nuclear facility, .036 quadrillion Btus. The \ntotal energy consumption of New Hampshire is .329 quadrillion Btus. So, \naccording to my source from the U.S. Department of Energy, the best \ninformation I have, dated September 5, 2003, New Hampshire consumes \nabout nine times what it produces from that nuclear plant or any other \nsource.\n  I use that as an example because, unfortunately, the coastal \nproducing States we are talking about are in the distinct minority. We \ndo produce the Nation's energy needs. We do produce far more energy \nthan we consume. That is great for the Nation. I wish that load were \nspread around more, but it is not. That is a very important element of \nthis debate.\n  The second point that directly flows into is a question of fairness. \nThe Senator from New Hampshire talked about some boondoggle to coastal \nStates. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are simply asking \nfor a small, modest modicum of fairness. This amendment covers 4 years, \n2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 4 years, and then it goes away. During those 4 \nyears, the royalties into the Federal Treasury from this offshore \nproduction are expected to be $26 billion. Under this amendment, during \nthose 4 years, our share is $1 billion. That is less than 4 percent. \nMeanwhile, onshore oil and gas and mineral production is shared in \nterms of royalties on public lands 50 percent to the States and 50 \npercent to the Feds.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire, when he was here, cited the example \nof West Virginia coal production. That royalty share on public lands is \n50/50. We will take 50 percent. If the Senator from New Hampshire wants \nto offer that amendment, we will accept that. We are only asking for 4 \npercent for 4 years and then it goes away.\n  This is fair. It is a fair way to treat those few States that help \nproduce the energy the Nation needs. Those are very important points.\n  I hope all Senators remember those points as they vote, particularly \non an amendment that is squarely within the budget, that does not bust \nany of the numbers within the budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I have new pictures. Before I \nshow the pictures, I will state the situation in the Senate.\n  The Senator from New Jersey, Senator Corzine, and this Senator from \nFlorida, are insisting the debate remain on the Landrieu amendment as a \nmeans, as the clock is ticking, and with most of the Senate having an \ninterest to recess tonight for the purpose of many schedules that need \nto be met for tomorrow, including a number of BRAC Commission hearings, \nespecially in the State of New Mexico, that are being held tomorrow, \nvery important pieces of business that Senators need to attend.\n  What the managers of the bill are presently doing, because the \nSenator from New Jersey and this Senator from Florida are insisting, \nsince, lo and behold, we discovered what we thought we had taken care \nof yesterday, which was amendments would not be offered for further \nattempts at drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf--lo and behold, \nthose amendments have been filed and they were declared germane by the \nParliamentarian. Therefore, regardless of all of the agreements that \nhave been made, they can be brought up at any time.\n\n  So the Senator from New Jersey and this Senator from Florida, simply \nrecognizing the clock is ticking, in order that those amendments will \nnot be brought up, are continuing to keep the debate on the Landrieu \namendment. At such time as we expect the normal process would be done, \nwhich is the winnowing down of the remaining amendments, we then would \nask for unanimous consent from the Senate to take up only those \nremaining amendments and that those amendments will not include the \namendments further causing the drilling off the Outer Continental \nShelf. So that is the parliamentary procedure we find ourselves in.\n  Now, I have heard a number of statements on this floor over the last \nseveral days. I wish to clarify. I also wish to bring an update to the \nSenate. As shown in this picture, this is what we have at stake in \nFlorida. It is the pristine beaches. That is not the only reason for \nnot wanting to drill off the coast of Florida, but that is one of the \nreasons, and it is a major reason. We do have a $50 billion-a-year \ntourism industry that depends on those pristine beaches. Of course, \npeople from all over the world come to enjoy the extraordinary \nenvironment we have. That is one of the reasons.\n  I have enumerated over the last several days many other reasons. \nThose reasons certainly include the delicacy of the balance of nature \nin some of the estuaries and bays; the brackish waters; the mangrove \nswamps which you find on the coast of Florida, which is not \nspecifically a beach. Generally you will find a beach on what is known \nas a barrier island. It is those barrier islands that have these \nextraordinary opportunities for guests to come and visit.\n  I have enumerated over the last several days also another reason; \nthat is, the major national asset that we have off the gulf coast of \nFlorida and off a good part of the Atlantic coast of Florida. It is \ncalled restricted airspace. Is it any wonder why the training of pilots \nfor the new F-22 Stealth Fighter is at Tyndall Air Force Base? Is it \nany wonder why the training of pilots from all branches of the military \nfor the new F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is at Eglin Air Force Base?\n  It is not any wonder when you realize the place they train is out \nover the Gulf of Mexico, most of which is restricted airspace, and most \nof which has had now increased training coming because the Navy \nAtlantic Fleet training was shut down on the island of Vieques off of \nPuerto Rico. Most of that training has come to northwest Florida. That \ntraining is done out off the Gulf of Mexico. You cannot have surface \nships coordinating and training with aircraft, which are practicing \nwith their targets on virtual land masses that have been created by \ncomputers on the Gulf of Mexico, if you have oil rigs down there on the \nsurface of the Gulf of Mexico. That is another reason.\n  But I want to dwell for a minute on this reason right here as shown \non this picture. I said I had a new picture. I do. This picture is a \nweek old. This is an oilspill that just occurred off of Louisiana in \nthe last week. There have\n\n[[Page S7226]]\n\nbeen now 600 pelicans threatened, and 200 pelicans have died from this \noilspill. This was a relatively minor oilspill: 560 gallons--13 \nbarrels--of oil, a relatively minor spill. You can see the damage it \nhas done.\n  Now, I have shown other pictures out here. Shown on this picture is \nwhat we do not want. And shown on this picture is what we want. That is \nwhy the Senators from Florida, the Senators from other coastal States \nsuch as North Carolina and South Carolina, the Senators from New \nJersey--and you could go on up the coast and then go out to the west \ncoast and start in the North with Washington, Oregon, and California--\nthat is why these Senators are so concerned about the protection of the \ninterests of their particular States.\n  Now, this next picture is of an oilspill from years ago. I think this \nwas actually from the Exxon Valdez, which was a much larger oilspill. \nThat was a whole tanker. But a tanker can do that damage. And the spill \nfrom a week ago, which was a relatively minor spill, can also do \ndamage, where 200 pelicans have died and 600 are threatened.\n  Now I want to address what has been stated here. It is as if Florida \nis not doing its part, as suggested by the list that was shown earlier \nof those that are net-plus of energy and those that are net-minus of \nenergy. Is this the way we are going to solve our energy crisis? I \nthink we ought to all be doing each thing we can to solve our energy \ncrisis. It is absolutely inexcusable that America today is in a \nposition whereby we are importing almost 60 percent of our daily \nconsumption from foreign shores. That is not only inexcusable, that is \nunsustainable, when you consider the defense interests of our country, \nthat we would be so dependent on oil coming from the Mideast and the \nPersian Gulf region.\n  By the way, 15 percent of our daily consumption comes from Venezuela. \nGuess what. We do not exactly have good relations with the Government \nof Venezuela these days. And the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, \nfrom time to time beats his chest and beats the desk and says he is \nconsidering the cutting off of oil. That is another story. We could \ndiscuss that at length. But it all is forming a composite picture that \nwe ought to be doing something about our dependence on foreign oil.\n\n  Well, where do you do the most good the quickest? It is to go where \nyou consume the most energy. Where is most energy in America consumed? \nIt is in transportation. And where in transportation is most energy \nconsumed? It is in our personal vehicles--automobiles, trucks, SUVs. \nYet you see we are considering an energy bill, and we cannot even get \npast an amendment that will raise miles per gallon on SUVs, phased in \nover a 10-year period. We do not have the votes. Why? Because there are \ncertain interests here that say no. They want those gas guzzlers. Yet \nit is completely contrary to the interests of the United States.\n  If we really want to do something, we have to do something about \nmiles per gallon. I wish to share with the Senate a recent experience I \nhad talking with the former Director of Central Intelligence, Jim \nWoolsey, about a proposal he has that I believe makes a great deal of \nsense. It is quite exciting. This proposal could, according to his \nstatistics, have the equivalent of having vehicles that would run at \n500 miles per gallon. This is not science fiction. Let me tell you the \nthree components.\n  The first component has to do with the fact that we already mix \nethanol with gasoline, the ethanol being made primarily from corn. That \nis an expensive process, but we do that. In different places, there are \nvarious percentages of that ethanol. The ethanol and the gasoline burn \ntogether, and the ethanol starts replacing the gasoline.\n  What if you could replace that gasoline with more ethanol so that, \nsay, it is 50 percent gasoline and 50 percent ethanol? You may say: \nWell, it would not be economical because it is very expensive to get \nthat ethanol from corn. Jim Woolsey has said you can make ethanol from \nprairie grass. We have 31 million acres of prairie grass in the United \nStates. It would have to be harvested each year, cutting the grass. You \nwould have refined processes, just like in making ethanol from corn, \nbut you have a different ingredient, and it would be much cheaper to \nmake the ethanol. So why don't we start replacing oil--in other words, \ngasoline--with ethanol?\n  What the experts are telling me is you could use the same engines \nthat we have. Perhaps they would have to have a little bit of tweaking \nto accommodate 50 percent ethanol and 50 percent gasoline, but look how \nmuch oil per day we would be saving just with that. But that is just \nthe first component.\n  The second component is, what happens if you start turning all of \nAmerica's new automobile engines into hybrid engines? A hybrid engine \nis what the Japanese have already done so successfully that they have \nthese long waiting lists for these cars that have hybrid engines, that \nhave computers that shift to electricity at one point and to gasoline \nat another point. The Japanese automakers' cars today--and they have \nbeen for several years--are getting better than 50 miles per gallon. \nThat is the second component.\n  So what happens if you take fuel which is a mixture of ethanol and \ngasoline and put it into hybrid cars which are being run off of \nelectricity and the mixture of fuel is that you start to see you are \nbeginning to use less and less oil, and you are allowing technology to \nstart working for us.\n  But there is a third component; that is, taking your hybrid vehicle--\nthat is in your garage at night when you are not using it--and just \nplugging it in, so that in the morning, when you are ready to use your \nvehicle, your battery is fully charged up to its capacity. It would be \nusing electricity that has been coming from a powerplant that is \nusually a powerplant that is fueled by something other than oil.\n  So now you have a car that leaves the garage. It is fully powered up \nin its battery, so as it is going to its electric side of the fuel \ncomponent, it has that extra reserve. The gasoline side does not have \nto produce all that much for the electrical side of the hybrid.\n  And, by the way, when it is over on the gasoline side, it is using a \nlot less gasoline because the gasoline is mixed with ethanol. What Jim \nWoolsey has told a number of Senators is the calculations are that, \nunder present standards, you would actually have a car that would be \nthe equivalent of 500 miles per gallon. Can you imagine what that would \ndo to our dependence on foreign oil, since our personal vehicles are, \nin fact, the major factor in our daily consumption of oil? We are \ntalking serious changes. We are talking about not having to have a \nforeign policy--and I want to recognize my colleague because I want to \nhear what she says--where we, the United States, become the protector \nfor the entire civilized world of the oil supply flowing out of the \nPersian Gulf region.\n  We are talking about a United States foreign policy that, Lord \nforbid, if radical Islamists were to cause the Saudi Royal Family to \nfall and then the other gulf states start falling like dominos and \nsuddenly radical Islamists are in control of a major source of the \nworld's oil supply--you can imagine what that would do to the rest of \nthe free world and the industrialized world. We are talking about major \ncrisis.\n  And how much of a threat is it that there is such a crisis? Look what \nwe are dealing with in Iraq today. Who are the insurgents? Most of the \nterrorists in the world are now coming there not only to kill our boys \nand girls but are coming there to train to be terrorists instead of \ntraining in the former area of Afghanistan. It is easier for them to \ncome where all the action is in Iraq. Lord help us if ever radical \nIslamists took over in Iraq.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I am happy to yield to my distinguished and \nvery persistent colleague from the State of Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Florida.\n  I wanted to say that he has made some excellent points about our need \nfor energy independence. He has stated it eloquently and correctly in \nterms of our overdependence. In large measure that has been what so \nmany of our debates in the last few weeks have been.\n  As the Senator knows, the underlying bill we are trying to get to a \nfinal vote on within a few hours actually addresses so many of the \nconcerns the Senator has so rightly raised. He is correct that we can \nmove to a new kind of vehicle that you can plug in at night, drive \nduring the day, switch from electricity to gasoline. That gives\n\n[[Page S7227]]\n\nus extraordinary hope, without compromising our industry, without \nDraconian measures. What he spoke about is real, it is not fantasy, and \nit is in this bill. The ethanol provisions that he talked about are in \nthis bill because of the great work of Senator Domenici and Senator \nBingaman, a Republican and a Democrat. Yes, they are from the same \nState, but they have different views--some more conservative, some more \nliberal. But they have come together on a great, balanced bill.\n  We are attempting to pass this good bill today. We are very close. We \nare down to the last few amendments. The Senator from Florida has made \nsome excellent points. I also want to say he has been tireless in his \nadvocacy for Florida. He is a Senator from Florida, along with Senator \nMartinez. They have been down here for hours telling us about their \nbeautiful beaches. We acknowledge it. In Louisiana--I tease the Senator \nfrom Florida--we know about those beaches. We grew up on those beaches \nas well. People from Mississippi and Alabama and Louisiana spend a lot \nof time on those beaches. We want to help them preserve their beaches.\n  I wanted to ask the Senator: Does he intend, if we can get our \nsituation cleared up, to support the amendment we have on the floor, \nwhich is a revenue coastal impact assistance sharing? He has been so \ngood in his comments about the contribution that Louisiana and other \ncoastal producing States make. I know he is aware that this amendment \nwe are considering is not a drilling amendment. It is not a boundary \namendment, the Bingaman-Domenici-Landrieu-Vitter-Lott amendment. I \nwanted to ask him to comment on that.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. As the Senator well knows, her original \namendment had the provisions for drilling off the coast of Florida, \nwhich this Senator vigorously fought. But when I sought the advice and \ncounsel of the Senator from Louisiana, she had explained to this \nSenator that what she wanted was revenuesharing so that she could help \nwith the bays and estuaries and coastal waters of her State. This \nSenator from Florida did not find that at all to be contrary to any \ninterest in Florida. Therefore, it was the expectation of this Senator \nthat if the Senator from Louisiana backed off of her attempts to want \nto drill off the coast of Florida, then certainly this Senator would \ntry to help her with regard to the Senator from Louisiana protecting \nthe interests of her State. That is part of the wonderful process of \nthe give and take and the consensus building that we have around here \nwhere each State is represented by two Senators. We can look out for \nour interests, and you can look out for your interests, and then we can \nlook out for our mutual interests. As the Good Book says: Come and \nreason together.\n\n  That is what we have attempted to do. I suspect that although several \nof us coastal Senators have had to scratch and claw and stand on the \nfloor and make objections and stand up and filibuster and do all of \nthose kinds of things to get our point across, it looks as though the \nSenator from Louisiana is going to be flying on cloud nine passing her \namendment. But she has a higher threshold to get to. She has a \nthreshold of 60 votes in order to pass a budgetary waiver in order to \nget it through. It is my hope the Senator from Louisiana will get her \n60 votes.\n  Would the Senator like me to yield for purposes of a question and \nretaining the floor?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator for those comments.\n  Again, I recognize Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman, who have \ntried to work through the great differences between all of us, \nrepresenting our individual States, trying to move a bill forward that \nachieves the purpose we all want. The goal of more energy independence \nfor our Nation, stronger conservation measures, opening the supply of \ndifferent types--that is the purpose of the bill. So as we get to the \nfinal hours, having debated this bill now for 2 hours, I hope we can \nstay in the spirit of moving this important legislation. One of our \ncolleagues from Virginia said this morning that in his opinion this \nmight be the most significant piece of legislation we may pass this \nCongress.\n  We have tried for 14 years. The Senator from Florida is aware we have \ntried to pass an energy bill. This is not an easy bill to pass, not \nbecause Democrats and Republicans disagree, but because regions of the \ncountry disagree about how best to achieve that goal. It is an \nextremely difficult piece of legislation.\n  If we had not had the two leaders we had, with the patience of Job--\nas I have said many times, I don't know how they have brought us to \nthis point. I know it is the Domenici-Bingaman amendment that is \npending. Senator Vitter and I are cosponsors. Both Senators from \nMississippi came earlier to speak on the amendment. We hope sometime in \nthe next hour or so--hopefully sooner--to get a vote on the amendment--\nit would be a bipartisan vote--and then move on to take care of the \nother amendments and finalize the bill.\n  The Senator from Florida knows that despite our differences on this \nissue, we will agree to debate it in the future. This debate will go \non. The underlying debate is not about the moratoria. It is not a \ndrilling amendment. I look forward to having his support.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. This Senator thought the agreement to support \nthe amendment of the Senator from Louisiana is that the Senator from \nLouisiana would forever and always support the Senator from Florida to \nkeep drilling off of the coast of Florida.\n  Senator Landrieu has been such a tremendous advocate for the \ninterests of her State. She has a need that is in front of the Senator. \nThis Senator intends to help her, even though this Senator would \ncertainly appreciate a little more help in the future from the Senator \nfrom Louisiana.\n  I want to point out again why the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nCorzine, and I have been so exercised about now that this amendment is \nout there, filed, and it is germane to the bill, an amendment offered \nby Senator Alexander, why it is such anathema to us. I will simply give \nyou the explanation. When they say: Oh, we are just going to let States \ndecide if they want to have the drilling off their coasts, there is \nsomething known as seaward lateral boundaries that are drawn as to what \nis the waters off of a State according to a Law of the Sea Treaty \nwhich, by the way, was never ratified by the United States, so it is \nnot the law of this country. Let me show you what the line would be off \nthe State of Florida for the State of Louisiana under that Law of the \nSea Treaty.\n  This is Louisiana. This is Mississippi. This is Alabama. And this is \nthe line on the latitudes of Alabama and Florida. Guess what would be \nconsidered under the drawing of these lines called seaward lateral \nboundaries for Louisiana. It is a faint line, but I will point it out \nwith my finger. This is the line for Louisiana. All that off the coast \nof Florida would be Louisiana.\n  I suspect that in the case of Senator Corzine off New Jersey, he \nwould have to worry about something that is not the law of this land \nbut those boundaries being drawn that an adjacent State would say: We \nwant to drill. And lo and behold, it would end up off the coast of New \nJersey.\n  I yield to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I thank my colleague, who is pointing out the legal \nargument about seaward lateral boundaries which are those that would \nend up applying in a practical sense where drilling might occur. There \nis also the reality of oil spills, some associated with drilling for \nnatural gas which has occurred on more than a small percentage of \nsituations in drilling for natural gas, and oil spills moved with the \nflow of the tides. As is shown in the map the Senator from Florida is \npresenting, not only do you have a legal boundary, you have a practical \nboundary because there are no boundaries in the water. And there are no \nboundaries for fish to swim.\n  There are grave risks if the environmental and ecological elements of \nprotection are not thought about. And there is a huge cost-benefit for \nmany States with regard to how their economies and the quality of life \nand lifestyles are developed. That has to be put in measurement and \nmeasured against what is going to be gained.\n  In the case of New Jersey and the Mid-Atlantic and North Atlantic \nregion, earlier tests show very limited supplies of natural gas and oil \non that Outer Continental Shelf. Why do we\n\n[[Page S7228]]\n\nwant to put ourselves at that kind of risk on a cost-benefit analysis? \nI ask the question, Is that the same kind of analysis at which my \ndistinguished colleague from Florida has arrived?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Indeed it is. But we feel so passionately \nabout this for the reasons that I have articulated much earlier. When \nsomebody then wants to claim the patina of legality suddenly for their \nState's waters and, in fact, allow the drilling off the coast of \nanother State, then it is starting to get absurd. That is when we have \nto put our foot down.\n  As the Senator from New Jersey was talking, it occurred to me that I \nwant to show, once again, these charts. This is from the Exxon Valdez, \nwhich is many years ago. But that was last week. That is last week off \nthe coast of Louisiana. That is what we want to prevent.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Consultation on Supreme Court Nominees\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to talk about the anticipated \nvacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. Whatever the timeframe for a vacancy \non the Court, the process for selecting the next Associate or Chief \nJustice should reflect the very best of the American judiciary, not the \nworst of American politics. We deserve a Supreme Court nominee who \nreveres and respects the law--and a confirmation process that is civil, \nrespectful, and keeps politics out of the judiciary.\n  This morning, a number of our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle asked to be consulted about any future Supreme Court nomination.\n  I have two responses. First, we should be clear. Although \nconsultation, in theory, may or may not be a good idea, there is no \nconstitutional requirement or Senate tradition that obligates the \nPresident, or anyone in the executive branch, to consult with \nindividual Senators, let alone with the Senate as an institution.\n  Second, consultation may or may not be a good idea, but Senators \nshould behave in a manner that is both respectful and deserving of such \na special role in the Supreme Court nomination process, if they expect \nthe administration to meet them halfway.\n  At a minimum, the President should consider the following three \nconditions before agreeing to any special consultation with any \nparticular Senator. First, whoever the nominee is, the Senate should \nfocus its attention on judicial qualifications, not personal political \nbeliefs. Second, whoever the nominee is, the Senate should engage in \nrespectful and honest inquiry, not partisan, political, or personal \nattacks. Third, whoever the nominee is, the Senate should apply the \nsame fair process that has existed for more than two centuries, and \nthat is confirmation or rejection by a majority vote.\n  First, as I said, there is no constitutional or Senate tradition \nrequiring consultation with individual Senators, let alone with the \nSenate as an institution.\n  The text of the Constitution contemplates no formal role for the \nSenate as an institution--let alone individual Senators--to advise on \nselecting Justices on the Supreme Court, or on any Federal court.\n  As renowned constitutional scholar and historian, David Currie, has \npointed out, President George Washington did not consult with the \nSenate. I quote: ``Madison, Jefferson, and Jay all advised Washington \nnot to consult the Senate before making nominations.''\n  Professor Michael Gerhardt, the top Democrat adviser on the \nconfirmation process, has similarly noted that ``the Constitution does \nnot mandate any formal prenomination role for the Senate to consult \nwith the President; nor does it impose any obligation on the President \nto consult with the Senate prior to nominating people to confirmable \nposts.''\n  My second point: If there is to be any consultation, the Senate must \nfirst show that it will behave itself in a manner worthy of such a \nspecial role in the Supreme Court nomination process. After all, there \nis a right way and a wrong way to debate the merits of a Supreme Court \nnominee. And history itself provides some useful benchmarks.\n\n  First, whoever the nominee is, the Senate should focus its attention \non judicial qualifications--not on personal political beliefs.\n  When President Clinton nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Court in \n1993, Senators knew that she was a brilliant lawyer with a strong \nrecord of service in the law. Senators knew that she served as general \ncounsel of the American Civil Liberties Union, a liberal organization \nthat has championed the abolition of traditional marriage laws and \nattacked the Pledge of Allegiance. And they know that she had \npreviously written that traditional marriage laws are unconstitutional; \nthat the Constitution guarantees a right to prostitution; that the Boy \nScouts, Girl Scouts, Mother's Day, and Father's Day are all \ndiscriminatory institutions; that courts should force taxpayers to pay \nfor abortions against their will; and that the age of consent for \nsexual activity should be lowered to the age of 12. The Senate, \nnevertheless, confirmed her by a vote of 96 to 3.\n  Similarly, when Steven Breyer, nominated in 1994 by President \nClinton, and Antonin Scalia, nominated in 1986 by President Reagan, the \nSenate recognized that these were brilliant jurists with strong records \nof service. Breyer had served previously as chief counsel to Senator \nTed Kennedy on the Senate Judiciary Committee. His nomination to the \nCourt was opposed by many conservatives because of alleged hostility to \nreligious liberty and private religious education, while Scalia was \nknown to hold strongly conservative views on a number of topics. The \nSenate, nevertheless, confirmed them by votes of 87 to 9 and 98 to 0, \nrespectively.\n  Second, whoever the nominee is, the Senate should engage in \nrespectful and honest inquiry, not partisan political or personal \nattacks.\n  Unfortunately, as we know, respect for nominees has not always been \nthe standard--at least it has not always been observed.\n  Lewis Powell, a distinguished member of the U.S. Supreme Court, \nduring his nomination process was accused of demonstrating ``continued \nhostility to the law,'' and waging a ``continual war on the \nConstitution.'' Senate witnesses warned that his confirmation would \nmean that ``justice for women would be ignored.'' John Paul Stevens, \nalso with a distinguished record of service on the Supreme Court, was \ncharged during his confirmation hearings with ``blatant insensitivity \nto discrimination against women.'' Anthony Kennedy, also on the Court, \nwas scrutinized for his ``history of pro bono work for the Catholic \nChurch,'' and found to be ``a deeply disturbing candidate for the \nUnited States Supreme Court,'' according to some accounts.\n  David Souter, also on the U.S. Supreme Court, during his confirmation \nprocess, was described as ``almost neanderthal,'' ``biased,'' and \n``inflammatory.'' One Senator actually said Souter's civil rights \nrecord was ``particularly troubling'' and ``raised troubling questions \nabout the depth of his commitment to the role of the Supreme Court and \nCongress in protecting individual rights and liberties under the \nConstitution.'' That same Senator condemned Souter for making \n``reactionary arguments'' and for being ``willing to defend the \nindefensible'' and predicted that, if confirmed, Souter would ``turn \nthe clock back on the historic progress of recent decades.'' At Senate \nhearings, witnesses cried that, ``I tremble for this country if you \nconfirm David Souter,'' warning that ``women's lives are at stake,'' \nand even predicting that ``women will die.''\n  The best apology for these ruthless and reckless attacks is for them \nnever to be repeated again. Unfortunately, recent history is not \nparticularly promising. Even before President Bush took office in \nJanuary 2001, the now-leader of the opposition party in the Senate told \nFox News Sunday that ``we have a right to look at John Ashcroft's \nreligion,'' to determine whether there is ``anything with his religious \nbeliefs that would cause us to vote against him.'' And over the last 4 \nyears, this President's judicial nominees have been labeled ``kooks,'' \n``Neanderthals,'' and even ``turkeys.'' Respected public servants and \nbrilliant jurists have been called ``scary'' and ``despicable.''\n\n[[Page S7229]]\n\n  Third, whoever the nominee is, the Senate should apply the same fair \nprocess that has existed for over two centuries when it comes to \nconfirmation or rejection--by an up-or-down vote of the majority.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have recently asked to \nbe consulted about any future Supreme Court nomination--even though the \nConstitution provides only for advice and consent of the Senate, not \nindividual Senators, and only with respect to the appointment, not the \nnomination of any Federal judge. If Senators want an extraordinary and \nextraconstitutional role in the Supreme Court nomination process, the \nPresident should first consider seeking a commitment from them to \nsubscribe to the three principles that I have talked about briefly \nabove.\n  After years of unprecedented obstruction and destructive politics, we \nmust restore dignity, honesty, respect, and fairness to our Senate \nconfirmation process. That is the only way to keep politics out of the \njudiciary.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question before yielding \nthe floor?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I was listening carefully to my friend's comments \nabout the process by which we react to the President's nominees to the \nSupreme Court. Did I hear my colleague correctly, in discussing the \nissue of what is or is not a mainstream nominee, that Ruth Bader \nGinsburg, for whom I voted--and I believe the final vote was something \nlike 96 to 3--had at one time speculated that there might be a \nconstitutional right to prostitution? Did she not suggest that at some \npoint in one of her writings?\n  Mr. CORNYN. The distinguished assistant majority leader is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Also, had she not suggested at one point that there be \na uni-sex ``Parent's Day'' instead of a Father's Day or a Mother's Day, \nor something similar to that?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Again, the distinguished assistant majority leader is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask my friend from Texas, is it not the case that \nmany nominations that have been sent up here by Presidents have opined, \nfrom time to time, controversial or provocative views, particularly if \nthey have had a background as a teacher, that might strike many of us \non this side of the aisle, and I suspect a majority on the other side, \nas outside of the mainstream to the left?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I say to the distinguished assistant majority leader that \nany lawyer--and we are likely to get a lawyer nominated for this \nimportant job on the Supreme Court--is going to have taken on behalf of \na client, someone they have represented, or if they have taught, as the \nquestion suggests, during the course of their academic musings, \nprograms, or writings, in Law Journal articles or otherwise, they are \ngoing to engage in the kind of intellectual exercise speculating \nperhaps about the limits of the law or what the law would or would not \nbe under a particular set of circumstances.\n\n  It is simply unreasonable to ascribe to those nominees, let's say, \nthe views of someone they are defending in a criminal case because they \nhave volunteered to serve pro bono to defend somebody accused of a \ncrime, or to ascribe to them as their own personal beliefs or ones they \nwill actively seek and enforce from the bench or what they have written \nin academic writings on perhaps the limits of the Constitution or what \nwould or would not stand up in a particular court decision.\n  I agree we should be fair to the nominees. We should require they \nrule in accordance with precedent and the intent of Congress when it \ncomes to interpreting acts of Congress. But we should not try to \nmischaracterize them or paint them as out of the mainstream by viewing \nin isolation some of these writings or representations in their legal \npractice.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Finally, let me ask, is it not largely the case, I ask \nmy colleague from Texas, that until the last few years, controversial \nor provocative comments or writings have, in fact, not been used as a \nrationale for defeating nominees, assuming they are lacking in \nqualifications or ``outside the mainstream'' as a rationale for \ndefeating otherwise well-qualified nominees?\n  Mr. CORNYN. As the distinguished assistant majority leader knows, \nthere has been a mischaracterization of the record of many nominees who \nhave come up in recent times and one I hope we do not see repeated when \nwe have this Supreme Court vacancy to consider, the President's \nnominee. But we have not had a good record recently of treating these \nnominees respectfully, understanding that these are people who are \nsubjecting themselves to this process and public service at some \npersonal sacrifice. I worry if this process becomes too mean and too \nunfair that we will simply see people who will not answer the call when \nthe President requests they serve as a judge.\n  We have seen those kinds of characterizations and attacks, as the \nassistant majority leader described them. It is my hope, and I know \nhis, that we will not see a repetition of that, but we will see a \nrespectful process. We will see one where the Senate does its job. We \nask tough questions. We do a thorough investigation. But at the end of \nthe day, we do not try to paint these nominees as something they are \nnot and that we have an up-or-down vote on these nominees, as we have \nhad for more than 200 years.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Texas for responding to my \nquestions.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                         Supreme Court Nominees\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I listened with interest this morning \nto the remarks of our Democratic colleagues. They talked about a \npotential Supreme Court vacancy. While we have no knowledge of the \noccurrence of such a vacancy at this time, our friends implored the \nWhite House to consult with them in selecting a Supreme Court nominee. \nIt is on this subject that I wish to make a few observations in the \nevent such a vacancy were to occur.\n  From time to time, Senators may suggest to a President who he should \nnominate to the Federal bench. Sometimes Presidents agree with the \nsuggestions and sometimes they do not. This White House has observed \nthis practice, and I believe it will continue to do so. But we should \nnot confuse the solicitude that any President may afford the views of \nindividual Senators on a case-by-case basis with some sort of \nconstitutional right of 100 individual Senators to co-nominate persons \nto the Federal court.\n  Unfortunately, I am afraid our Democratic friends are under a \nmisapprehension that they have some sort of individual right of co-\nnomination. In the past, our colleague Senator Schumer has said that in \nhis view--in his view--the President and the Senate should have ``equal \nroles'' in picking judicial nominees.\n  And just last week, and again on the floor this morning, my good \nfriend from Vermont said that he ``stands ready to work with President \nBush to help him select a nominee to the Supreme Court.''\n  Such a view of the confirmation process is completely at odds with \nthe plain language of the Constitution, the Framers' intent, common \nsense, and past statements of our Democratic friends themselves.\n  Let's start with the Constitution. Article II, section 2 provides \nthat the President, and the President alone--no one else--nominates. It \nsays ``the President shall nominate.'' It does not say ``the President \nand the Senate shall nominate,'' nor does it say ``the President and a \ncertain quantity of individual Senators shall nominate.'' It says ``the \nPresident shall nominate''--the plain words of the Constitution.\n  It then adds that after he nominates, his nominees will be appointed \n``by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.''\n  This plain language meaning of article II, section 2 is confirmed by \nthe Founding Father who proposed the very constitutional language I \njust cited. Alexander Hamilton wrote that it is the President, not the \nPresident and members of the opposition party, who nominates judges. \nSpecifically, in Federalist No. 66, Alexander Hamilton wrote:\n\n       It will be the Office of the President to nominate, and, \n     with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint. There \n     will, of course, be no exertion of choice--\n\nI repeat, no exertion of choice--\n\n     on the part of the Senate. They may defeat\n\n[[Page S7230]]\n\n     one choice of the Executive and oblige him to make \n     another; but they cannot themselves choose--they can only \n     ratify or reject the choice [of the President].\n\n  Nothing could be more clear--Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 66 \ninterpreting the plain language of article II, section 2 of the \nConstitution.\n  The Framers were, of course, as we all know, brilliant. They \nrecognized that the judicial confirmation process would not function at \nall if we had the President and a multitude of individual Senators \nselecting judges. How could a President hope to accommodate the views \nof 100 different Senators on who he should nominate, each of whom might \nsubmit their own slate of nominees? That is why the only person who won \na national election is charged with the power of nomination--the only \nperson who won a national election is charged with the power of \nnomination.\n  Our Democratic friends at one point at least recognized this as well. \nFor example, during Justice O'Connor's confirmation hearing, my good \nfriend from Delaware, the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nsaid:\n\n       I believe it is necessary at the outset of these hearings \n     on your nomination--\n\nTalking to Sandra Day O'Connor at the time--\n\n     to define the nature and scope of our responsibilities in the \n     confirmation process, at least as I understand them. . . . \n     [A]s a Member of the U.S. Senate, I am not choosing a nominee \n     for the Court.\n\nThis is our colleague from Delaware.\n\n     . . . I am not choosing a nominee for the Court. That is the \n     prerogative of the President of the United States, and we \n     Members of the U.S. Senate are simply reviewing the choice \n     that he has made.\n\n  That was Senator Biden in 1981.\n  And on the subject of deference, I must respectfully disagree with my \ngood friend from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy. Professor Michael \nGerhardt, on whose expertise in constitutional law our Democratic \nfriends have relied, notes that:\n\n       The Constitution . . . establishes a presumption of \n     confirmation that works to the advantage of the President and \n     his nominees.\n\n  Finally, let me reiterate that at the end of the day, the Senate \ngives the President's nominees an up-or-down vote. This has been the \npractice even when there were highly contested Supreme Court nominees. \nThere were no Supreme Court nominees more contested than Robert Bork \nand Clarence Thomas. Yet those Supreme Court nominees received up-or-\ndown votes. I expect the same courtesy will be afforded to the next \nSupreme Court nominee regardless of who the nominating President is.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am sorry I was at the DPC lunch, but I \nheard that a number of my colleagues had a little debate about \nconsultation, a letter that 44 of the 45 Democrats sent to the \nPresident today, and the 45th, Senator Byrd, agreed in theory with the \nletter, agreed in the sentiments of the letter but wanted to write his \nown. He felt so strongly about it, he told me, that he wanted to put it \nin his own words.\n  All of a sudden we are hearing two things from the other side about \nconsultation. First--and I could not believe this statement--my good \nfriend from Texas, Senator Cornyn, said the Democrats are being \npolitical. If 1984 has not arrived, when asking to consult and bring \npeople together is political and asking to be divided and not consult \nis nonpolitical, I don't know what is. This is 1984. We are asking the \nPresident to bring people together. We are asking the President to \nfollow the Constitution. There is the word ``advise.'' And all of a \nsudden that is called being political? Please, give me a break.\n  The American people have asked us--every one of us; we can be from \nany one of the 50 States, we can be of any political philosophy, and I \nam sure we are asked when we get home: How do we break this \npartisanship on judges? The wisdom of the Founding Fathers, as always, \nis usually best. They recommended advise as well as consent, meaning \nconsult. And here we, in a way--all the Democrats--in a desire to avoid \nconfrontation, asked for consultation, and we are called political?\n  It seems to my good friend from Texas the only thing that is not \npolitical is we just say yes to whatever the President asks. That is \nnot what we will do, and that is not what America is all about.\n  Our letter, I say to the American people, was heartfelt.\n  Our letter said: Let us avoid the confrontation on judges. The only \nway to do it is by consultation, plain and simple. President Clinton \nconsulted. He called Senator Hatch at a time when Senator Hatch was not \nin the majority. According to Senator Leahy, he told me this morning \nthat Senator Hatch at that time--it must have been 1993 or 1994--was \nthe ranking minority member, and as I understand it President Clinton \nbounced names off Senator Hatch: How about this one, how about that \none?\n  Senator Hatch was wise enough to know that he was not going to get a \nconservative. The President would not nominate a conservative, just as \nwe know and do not expect the President to nominate a Democrat or a \nliberal. We know that. But there are always shades of gray which only \nthe ideologues of the hard right and the hard left never see. There are \npeople who are mainstream conservatives who would be acceptable to most \nof us because we believe--my test, and I think it is the test of most \nof us is not on any one issue but, rather, would be people who would \ninterpret the law, not make it.\n  I do not like judges who are ideologues. I do not like judges at the \nextremes. Obviously, the President has nominated some judges at the \nextremes, but my judicial committee, under my instructions in New York, \nwhere I get a say in nominations, knocks out anybody on the far left. \nThat is because ideologues want to make law. They are so sure they are \nright that they can ignore everybody else.\n  Consultation is what it is all about. In my judgment, consultation is \nthe only way to avoid the kinds of confrontations which I am sure none \nof us likes when it comes to judges. To call it political, that does \nnot pass the laugh test.\n  Then I heard--and again, I was not here--that my friend from Texas \nand I believe my friend from Kentucky were having a debate on what \nshould be allowed to be in the record in terms of if and when a Supreme \nCourt Justice is nominated. I was told, Well, what they considered and \nargued while in court should not be considered because they were \nrepresenting a client, or it should not be this or it should not be \nthat.\n  The nomination and the confirmation of a U.S. Supreme Court Justice \nand a U.S. Chief Justice is one of the most important things we shall \ndo as Senators. Let me put my colleagues on notice: Everything should \nbe on the record--everything. Some will have less importance, some will \nhave more importance, but to already, before someone is even nominated, \nstart saying, Oh, this should not be part of the record, that should \nnot be part of the record, sounds a little defensive.\n  I suppose we should not know anything about the nominee; just take \nthe President's recommendation. Well, again, read the Constitution, I \nwould advise my colleagues, with respect. It does not say the President \ndetermines who are Supreme Court nominees. In fact, for two-thirds of \nthe period when the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, they had \nthe Senate choose the Supreme Court. The only reason they changed it to \nhave the President nominate is--I think they called it unity of \npurpose. They thought having--then it was probably 30--26 people try to \nchoose 1 nominee was far more difficult than 1 choosing a nominee. But \nmake no mistake about it, they wanted the Senate to be very active. In \nfact, as we know from our history and we have repeated on this floor, \nalthough it does not seem to make much of a dent, the early Senate \nrejected one of George Washington's nominees, and I believe in that \nSenate there were eight Founding Fathers.\n  They ought to know better than any of us. Here we are saying this \nshould not be part of the record, that should\n\n[[Page S7231]]\n\nnot be part of the record. Maybe my colleagues are being a little \ndefensive. Maybe they do not want--I do not know who the nominees will \nbe. I have no idea. But maybe they are worried that if all the facts \ncame out, the American people might not want the nominee. I am of the \nother view. Justice Brandeis stated that sunlight is the greatest \ndisinfectant. The more we see and the more we learn, the better we will \nbe prepared.\n  I see my good friend, our great leader from Hawaii, has come to the \nfloor of the Senate, and I do not want to delay him.\n  In conclusion, one, we plead with the President to consult with the \nminority, as President Clinton did, as President Hoover did, as \nPresident Grant did, and as so many others. That will make the process \ngo more easily. When the American people ask us what can avoid the kind \nof confrontation we have seen with judges, there is a one word answer: \nconsultation. Advise, as in advise and consent.\n  The ball is in the President's court. He can determine whether we \nhave the kind of process the American people want--careful, thorough \nbut harmonious, without acrimony, by consulting--or he can be like Zeus \nfrom Mount Olympus and throw down judicial thunderbolts and say: This \nis the nominee. Then maybe some of his minions will say: You cannot \nadmit this fact about the nominee or that fact about the nominee or \nthat fact about the nominee. That is not legitimate. That will not \ncreate a harmonious process in this body.\n  We are on the edge of perhaps a nomination for the U.S. Supreme \nCourt--again, one of the most important things we Senators do. Let us \nhope, with consultation, it will occur in a harmonious and bipartisan \nway.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                          we are all americans\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, according to press reports last evening \none of the principal advisors to the President, Mr. Karl Rove, \ncriticized Democrats for failing to respond to the attacks on \n9/11. He is reported to have said that the Democratic Party did not \nunderstand the consequences of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He is \nquoted saying, ``Liberals saw the savagery of the 9/11 attacks and \nwanted to prepare indictments and offer therapy and understanding for \nour attackers, Conservatives saw the savagery of 9/11 and the attacks \nand prepared for war.''\n  Oftentimes in press reports, words are taken out of context or simply \nmisquoted. I would hope that is the case here. I would hope that the \nviews that were reported to have been expressed do not really represent \nthe thoughts of Mr. Rove and certainly not the President of the United \nStates.\n  It is not often that I come to the floor to question what someone \nmight have said. My view is that most of the time it is better to just \nremain silent and not to dignify the remarks which might have been made \nin the heat of partisan rhetoric, but this is a bit different.\n  All of us who were in the Congress at that time recall 9/11 vividly. \nLike all Americans we saw the jet liners crash into the Twin Towers on \nour televisions and we could all see the smoke rising from the Pentagon \njust across the river.\n  Perhaps Mr. Rove forgets what that day was like as we evacuated our \noffices and tried to maintain an aura of calm for the American public. \nPerhaps he forgets the spontaneous action of many of my colleagues who \ngathered on the steps of the Capitol to sing ``God Bless America.'' It \nwasn't Republicans on the steps and it wasn't conservatives, it was \nAmericans. All colors, all religions, both parties came together in a \npatriotic symbol to demonstrate the resolve of America.\n  Mr. Rove must also not remember that the Senate was in the hands of a \nDemocratic majority in September 2001. It was the Democratic majority, \nacting with the Republican minority, which pushed through a resolution \nauthorizing the use of force to go after Osama Bin Laden. There was no \ndispute between the parties on this issue. We all agreed that we had to \ndefeat this enemy of America.\n  I was Chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee at that \ntime. I worked with my colleague Ted Stevens to put together an \nemergency appropriations bill to support the Defense Department's \nrequirements to mount an attack on the terrorists. It was a bipartisan \nplan that provided the administration wide latitude to respond to this \ntragedy. There was no dissent. We were united across party lines.\n  Perhaps Mr. Rove just forgets. I cannot forget visiting the Pentagon \nand examining the extent of the damage and the continuing rescue \nefforts with my colleague Senator Stevens. I vividly recall flying to \nNew York City one week later to tour the site of the disaster. I will \nnever forget the acrid smell that still arose through the smoke from \nthe site as we flew over the area in a helicopter. I will forever \nrecall seeing the widows of lost firefighters being escorted, and \nliterally held up, by other New York emergency workers as they visited \nthe site.\n  It has not been often in our Nation's history that we have been \ntested. As a teenager I was present on December 7, 1941 at another time \nin our Nation's history when we suffered a savage attack.\n  At the time the Nation responded in a bipartisan fashion to respond \nto that awful attack. Our response to the 9/11 attack was similar. All \nAmericans were outraged by the attack and we proved our resolve to \nrespond. To claim that one party had a monopoly on a patriotic response \nor a will to act is not only factually in error it is an insult to all \nAmericans.\n  I have been in politics for many years. I understand the use of \npartisan political rhetoric to play to an audience. I also know that in \nthis era of instantaneous information, erroneous statements can become \naccepted as facts. This statement, if it truly reflects the views of \nthe President's advisor, needs to be refuted before it can be thought \nof as being historically accurate.\n  There has been a lot said in the press recently about demanding \napologies for words that have been spoken. The White House needs to \ntake a look at these statements and consider an appropriate response to \nrepudiate these words.\n  Patriotism is not owned by one political party. Our national resolve \nis not Democratic or Republican. It is American.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that I be excused from the \nSenate between the hours of 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for recognition in my own right and \nI ask my comments be printed in an appropriate place in the Record and \nbe given as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kennedy are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts. I know he wants to speak. I do want to explain the \nposition I am in. I am trying very hard to get the amendment that is \npending voted on. We have been waiting for a long time. Both Senator \nBingaman and Senator Domenici have to leave. Our scheduled time of \ndeparture is 3:30 to get home to go to a BRAC Commission meeting where \nsix commissioners will be there. I need all the time between now and \n3:30 to get it done. But if the Senator wants to speak, I will yield \nand see what happens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I want to accommodate and help my friend and colleague. \nWhat I would like to find out is, if I could be part of a unanimous \nconsent request to simply be recognized after the business\n\n[[Page S7232]]\n\nthe Senator needs to do, I am happy to accommodate him.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator wants to be recognized for a speech.\n  Mr. KERRY. I want to be recognized to be able to speak immediately \nafter the business the Senator has to conduct. If I can be so \nrecognized, I would appreciate it very much.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So long as there is no misunderstanding, the business I \nam talking about would include a vote.\n  Mr. KERRY. I understand. The Senator needs to have a vote now, and I \nwill happily accommodate that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am appreciative. I thank the Senator so much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I understand I am part of the unanimous consent request to \nbe recognized after the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, indeed. As soon as this business is finished on \nthe pending amendment, he will be recognized for whatever time he \nneeds.\n  In order to save time, I wonder if I could have 2 minutes of colloquy \nwith the Senator from Louisiana, which is part of the proposal we are \ntrying to finish. No amendments, just a colloquy with reference to the \nsubject matter. I know the Senator from New Jersey is here. This \ncolloquy has to do with some amendments he is pulling down that put our \ncompromise together so we don't have any amendments that offend you. He \nwants to ask me about two amendments which he will withdraw.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                       Amendment No. 802 Recalled\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the \ndistinguished chairman about one amendment in particular, amendment No. \n802. It is based on an underlying bill I introduced, the Alternative \nEnergy Enhancement Act, which would provide some regulatory structure \nand some royalty sharing for new alternative energy that is developed \noffshore, particularly on the Outer Continental Shelf. These are new \nforms of energy which are not in production now, things such as solar \nenergy, thermal energy, wave energy, methane hydrates.\n  First, I compliment the chairman for his work on the bill because the \nunderlying bill includes most, if not all, of the regulatory provisions \nof my bill. What it does not include is royalty sharing. I would like \nto ask the chairman if he could continue to work with me as this energy \nbill goes to conference to create a fair system of royalty sharing for \nthese new forms of energy, noting that it is absolutely no loss to the \nFederal Treasury because those revenues are not coming in yet.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator has my assurance. Just as I have tried to \ndo that in the past, I will continue to do it. It cannot be included in \nthis bill for a lot of reasons, including those the Senators from \noffshore States understand. We will continue to work on it and see how \nwe can move it along in due course.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will you pull your amendment after this colloquy?\n  Mr. VITTER. Yes, this first amendment is No. 802. My second amendment \nwe can deal with much later on. We don't to have deal with it \nimmediately.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will you withdraw it?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I withdraw amendment No. 802.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to add my support to the Domenici \namendment No. 891. However, before I proceed, I want to extend my \ngratitude and congratulations to the chairman and ranking member of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Domenici and Senator \nBingaman, for their hard work in producing this Senate energy bill.\n  Congress has tried several times to approve a comprehensive energy \nbill. Under their wise guidance and counsel, I believe that we will be \nsuccessful this time. It is critical that we provide the country with \nthe resources and tools to meet our growing energy needs and this bill \nwill go a long way in accomplishing that goal.\n  It is toward this same goal that I support this amendment that would \nshare a portion of the revenues generated by off-shore oil and gas \noperations with coastal producing States. As we work to address our \nNation's growing energy needs and to increase our domestic production \nof oil and gas, there will be enormous pressures placed on the \ncommunities along our coasts that serve as a platform to these \noperations. These pressures take a variety of forms and present a \nnumber of challenges. By giving coastal States an arrangement that \nStates with in-land development already have by sharing some of these \noil and gas revenues, we can mitigate some of these pressures. This \nincludes assistance with conservation of critical coastal habitats and \nwetlands to providing coastal communities with help for infrastructure \nand public service needs. There has been a significant amount of \ndiscussion on the issue of coastal erosion in Louisiana, but I want the \nSenate to know that parts of Texas are experiencing some of the very \nsame problems.\n  I also appreciate the comments and reservations expressed by the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Budget Committee. As a member of the \nBudget Committee, I recognize the significance and implications of \nwaiving the Budget Act. However, in this case, the budget resolution \ndoes contain a specific reserve fund to accommodate spending in the \nenergy bill. This amendment does not cause the bill to exceed the funds \nprovided in the resolution for the bill and is fully within the amount \nof money Congress set aside for the energy bill.\n  Texas is proud of its heritage as an energy producing State. Texas \nwill continue to play a vital role in providing for the Nation's energy \nneeds. This amendment is a reasonable proposal to address an issue of \nbasic fairness. This will demonstrate to those communities along the \ncoast that are so vital to the production of oil and gas for the Nation \nthat they are valuable, important, and supported.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 891\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I ask if we are ready to proceed now? Is the \nchairman of the Budget Committee prepared to make his closing remarks?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment I mentioned has been recalled.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The appropriate word is ``recalled.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Recalled.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Parliamentarian.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation? Is \nthere unanimous consent agreement?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There is none. When you finish, we are going to vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. So I have the last say here and then we will go to a vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Equal time, 1 minute, 2 minutes; whatever you take, I \ntake. Then we vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, since it is my point of order, I would like to go \nlast, and I will need about 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will use 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee has the right to raise a point of order and he did. There is \nalso a provision in the Budget Act that says if a point of order is \nmade, the Senate may waive the point of order. So the issue before the \nSenate is whether we should waive the point of order. I want to make \ntwo points.\n  First, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which has the bill \non the floor, was allotted $2 billion. People think we were allotted a \nlot of money. We were allotted $2 billion to be spent by the committee \non matters pertaining to this bill. We have a debate as to whether we \ncan spend it on this amendment or whether we have to spend it on the \nbill in committee. The Senator from New Mexico maintains that we \nshould, as a Senate, say the $2 billion was given to the committee. We \nare spending it on legitimate committee business, and we ought to be \nallowed to spend it on this amendment. We do not break the budget, we \njust use the money we were allotted. So it isn't a budgetary question. \nIt is a budget issue whether we should waive based upon whether we \nshould have used it in the committee or whether we could use that very \nsame amount of money on\n\n[[Page S7233]]\n\nthe floor of the Senate. That is the issue.\n  I yield back any time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am now recognized for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it is important to review the bidding here. \nThe situation is that a budget point of order has been raised. It is \nproperly founded, and there is a motion to waive it. The logic behind \nthe point of order is very simple. We are taking a discretionary \nprogram and moving it over to be an entitlement program to benefit five \nStates, primarily Louisiana, which will get 54 percent of the money \nthat is allocated. It is hard to understand why we would want to create \na new entitlement program simply for Louisiana to address their \nconservation concerns. There are a lot of States that have conservation \nconcerns. There is, in my opinion, virtually no nexus between the \nconservation issues which will be addressed theoretically by this \namendment, should it pass, and the energy that is being sought off the \ncoast of Louisiana. But even if there were, it would be inappropriate \nto pass such an amendment to create a new entitlement unless you \nincluded other States which had the same type of impact, because they \nwere producing energy, on their environment. Furthermore, we have heard \na great deal about how Louisiana has a right to this money. They have \nan entitlement to this money. Those were the words used by my friends \nacross the aisle. As we look at the numbers relative to how funds are \ndisbursed from the Federal Government, it appears that Louisiana is \ndoing pretty well.\n  For every dollar Louisiana sends to the U.S. Treasury, Louisiana gets \n$1.43 back. That is pretty darn good. They are getting a 43-cent bonus \non every dollar they spend from what they send up here. Of the five \nStates that will benefit from this, all of them get more money back \nthan they send to Washington, and four get substantially more money. In \nfact, they are in the top 10 of States to get more money back.\n  The equities of this Louisiana case are weak, to say the least. When \nyou throw into the factor that they already have a dedicated fund--the \nonly State in the country--for all the money raised as a result of \npeople running lawnmowers in places such as Montana, Oregon, or \nMassachusetts, you end up, if you start your lawnmower or your \nsnowblower, sending money to Louisiana to help them with environmental \nmitigation. They already have a fund, and they want more on top of \nthat.\n  The issue is simple. We passed a budget. The other side of the aisle \ndidn't participate in the process. The Republican side of the aisle \ndid. We passed a budget. Now the question is, Are we going to enforce \nthat budget or are we going to spend money creating an entitlement \nprogram that is totally outside of the bounds of the budget, which is \nwrong, and which has no equities behind it, other than that group of \nStates decided to raid the Federal Treasury?\n  It seems to me we have to make some decisions as to whether we are \ngoing to enforce the budget process. I note that the administration \nsupports this point of order and opposes this amendment. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in that position, also.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered, as I understand it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before the yeas and nays are called, I \nthink we have a unanimous consent agreement that everybody put their \nfingerprints on. I will read it, after which time we will vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of amendments that I send to \nthe desk be the only first-degree amendments remaining in order to the \nbill, including the managers' amendment, which are enumerated; provided \nfurther that this agreement does not waive the provisions of rule XXII; \nfurther, that upon disposition of the pending Domenici amendment, no \nfurther amendments relating to the issue of OCS moratorium and natural \ngas and oil exploration be in order to the bill, with the exception of \namendments Nos. 802 and 804, to be offered by the distinguished Senator \nVitter; and that upon his statements on them, the amendments will be \nwithdrawn. I modify that to strike the amendment we have already \nrecalled, and that was amendment No. 802. So I strike No. 802, which \nhas already been recalled. The rest of the proposal I leave with the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The list of amendments is as follows: .\n\n                    Final List of Energy Amendments\n\n       Talent--#819; Baucus--#846; Rocky Mountain Fund (to be \n     withdrawn); Durbin--#902, CAFE, #903, Small Business Next \n     Generation Lighting; Lautenberg--#778, P-FUELS; Inouye/\n     Akaka--#876, Deep Water Renewable Thermal Energy; Pryor--\n     #881, Weatherization Assistance Credit; Dodd--#882, SOS: \n     Power Rates in New England; Schumer--#810, Uranium Exports; \n     Obama--#851; Sununu--#873; Bond/Levin--#925; Salazar--#892; \n     and a Manager's Package.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand that we will proceed to an up-or-down \nvote. Mr. President, I might say to the Senate, after this vote, I \ndon't believe either Senator from New Mexico will be here for the \nremainder of the votes. Senator Larry Craig will assume my role as \nmanager of the bill. I thank everybody for their cooperation to get the \nbill this far.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Minnesota (Mr. Coleman), and the Senator from Alaska (Mr. \nStevens).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. \nColeman), would have voted ``yea.''\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. \nConrad), the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. Dayton), and the Senator from \nNorth Dakota (Mr. Dorgan), are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the ayes are 69, the nays are \n26. Three-fifths of the Senators, duly chosen and sworn, having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order fails.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Massachusetts will be \nrecognized, but first the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 891.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 891.\n  The amendment (No. 891) was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S7234]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout certain statements made this morning that were somewhat critical \nof the President on the issue of consultation on a prospective Supreme \nCourt nomination. One of the Senators from the other side of the aisle \nsaid that there would be a battle royal unless there was consultation \nthat met the requirements of the other side of the aisle. Two other \nlengthy speeches were also presented along the same line.\n  There has been a letter submitted by some 44 Senators that called for \nconsultation by the President on the issue of a Supreme Court \nnomination. However, I think the first thing to acknowledge is that \nthere is no vacancy. It would be premature to be critical. It would be \npremature to raise the issue in a confrontational sense until the \nmatter is ripe for consideration.\n  A number of us had occasion to have lunch with members of the Supreme \nCourt last week, and the Chief Justice looked remarkably fit. We saw \nhim when he administered the oath to the President some 5 months ago, \nwhen he was helped down to the podium, a little shaky and his voice a \nlittle faltering, but last Thursday he looked remarkably well. What he \nintends to do or what anyone else intends to do remains to be seen, but \nit is hardly the time, given the kind of confrontation in this body \nwhich we have seen on the judicial nomination process, to be looking to \npick a fight. I am not saying anyone is picking a fight--just that we \nought to avoid picking one. I respect the letter which was sent, dated \nJune 23, to the President, and signed by some 44 Senators. It quotes \nthe President at the press conference on May 31, 2005, where he said: \n``I look forward to talking to Members of the Senate about the Supreme \nCourt process to get their opinions as well and will do so. We will \nconsult with the Senate.''\n  That is an extract from the letter sent to President Bush dated \ntoday. Well, May 31 was only 24 days ago and when the President has \nmade a commitment to consult with the Senate, that is pretty firm and \nthat is pretty emphatic.\n  Given his other responsibilities, and the fact that there is no \nvacancy on the Supreme Court, it is presumptuous to say that there is \nsome failure on his part. I have asked the President to consult with \nDemocratic Members and to listen. The advice and consent clause of the \nConstitution is well known. He has asked me, in my capacity as Chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, about the issue, and I recommended to him \nconsultation. He has been very receptive to the idea. Although he has \nmade no commitment to me, he did make a very flat commitment in his \nspeech, as cited in this letter.\n  I might comment that during the confirmation proceedings of Attorney \nGeneral Gonzales, I think it is fair to say Senator Schumer was \neffusive in his praise of Mr. Gonzales as White House counsel regarding \nconsultation with New York Senators.\n  May the record show that Senator Schumer is nodding in the \naffirmative. As former prosecutors we sometimes say such things.\n  It is my hope that we will proceed to the Supreme Court nomination--\nif and when it occurs--in a spirit of comity. I do not have to speak \nabout my record on the subject. When we were fighting during the \nClinton administration about confirming Paez and Berzon, I broke party \nranks and supported them. It is my view that there is fault on both \nsides regarding stalling nominations. It began during the last two \nyears of President Reagan, all four years of Bush No. 1, and reached an \nintense line, frankly, during the administration of President Clinton, \nwhen some 60 nominations were held up in committee. We know what \nhappened with the systematic filibuster and the interim appointment, \nand we are past that.\n  We have a very heavy responsibility, if a vacancy occurs on the \nSupreme Court, to move ahead in a spirit of comity to try to get \nsomebody who can be confirmed; somebody who is acceptable to the \nSenate. If we are to fail in that and have an eight-person Court, it \nwould be dysfunctional. As we all know, there are many 5-to-4 \ndecisions. The country simply could not function with 4-to-4 court.\n  It would be my hope that we would lower the rhetoric and not put \nanybody in the position of being compelled to respond to a challenge. \nLet us not challenge each other. Let us not challenge the President. \nLet us move toward consultation.\n  This is something I have discussed with the distinguished Democratic \nLeader, Senator Reid. Also, Senator Leahy and I have talked about the \nsubject at length. I think we have established--as Senator Leahy \ncalled--it an atmosphere of comity in the Judiciary Committee. Such \nthat we will approach this very important duty with tranquility, \ncomity, and good will to do the work of the American people and not \npresume that the President is going to pick someone characterized as \nout of the mainstream or someone objectionable.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. First, I underscore what the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee said. We all hope that Chief Justice Rehnquist's \nhealth permits him to continue serving on the Court. I became an \nadmirer of his during the impeachment proceedings. I got to know him. \nHe has a great sense of humor, and we all know he has a tremendous \nintellect. I wish him the very best health. So I hope we do not have to \nconsider a vacancy in the Supreme Court.\n\n  I would say to my friend, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, we on this side of the aisle, as most all of the Senate, \nhave the greatest respect for Arlen Specter. We are very happy with the \nrelationship he has with the ranking member, Senator Leahy. They have a \nrelationship that is going to allow us to get work done in the \nJudiciary Committee. They have respect and admiration for each other.\n  I always joke with Senator Specter that I am one of the people who \nhave read his book--and I have read his book. But my feelings about the \nSenator from Pennsylvania have only increased in recent years, \nespecially during the last few months when he has responded so well to \nthe illness that he has. We are all mindful of the physical strength \nthis man has. So anything we do in the Judiciary Committee is never \ndisrespectful of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  I would say, I attended one of the press events, and I think there \nwas only one, dealing with the Supreme Court, that we talked about \ntoday. It was not a battle royal. It was a very constructive statement \nthat we all made.\n  We are hopeful and confident the President will follow through. Like \nSenator Hatch's relationship with President Clinton, it was a good way \nto do things. As a result of the work done with President Clinton and \nthen Senator Hatch, we were able to get two outstanding Supreme Court \nJustices--Ginsburg and Breyer. No one can complain about the intellect \nor the hard work and what they have done for our country and for the \nCourt.\n  We believe there should be advice and consent on all judicial \nnominations but at least on the Supreme Court. As the Senator from \nPennsylvania said, the President a month ago indicated he was going to \ndo that, and we, today, wanted to remind the President, in the letter \nwe sent to him, that he should follow what he said before.\n  We look forward to a hearing. I have spoken to our ranking member, \nSenator Leahy, and he is in the process of working with the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania to come up with a protocol, how we proceed on Supreme \nCourt nominations.\n  This is a very unusual time in the history of this country. We have \ngone more than 11 years without an opening in the Supreme Court. As a \nresult of that, staff is not as familiar with how things have happened \nin the past, and most Senators were not even here when the Supreme \nCourt vacancies were filled last time--at least many of the Senators.\n  So I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, we look forward to working \nwith you and the administration if, in fact, there is a vacancy on the \nSupreme Court. And even if there is not a vacancy on the Supreme Court, \nI believe it is important that you and Senator Leahy work toward a \nprotocol so when\n\n[[Page S7235]]\n\none does come up, it is not catchup time. I say if there is no Supreme \nCourt vacancy, we look forward to working with you on the many things \nover which the Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction. We are confident \nyour experience and intellect and love of the law will allow this body \nto be a better place.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                               Karl Rove\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, last night in New York City, Karl Rove made \nsome comments to the Conservative Party of New York that need to be \ndiscussed on this floor and for which an apology is needed.\n  None of us here will ever forget the hours after September 11, the \nfrantic calls to our families after we evacuated the Capitol, the \nevacuations themselves, the images on television, and then the \nremarkable response of the American people as we came together as one \nto answer the attack on our homeland.\n  I remember being in a leadership meeting just off the Chamber here at \nthe moment that the plane hit the Pentagon and we saw the plume of \nsmoke. Then the word came from the White House that they were \nevacuating and that we should evacuate. I will never forget the anger I \nfelt as we walked out of here, numbers of people running across the \nstreet, and I turned to somebody else walking with us and I said, \n``We're at war.'' That was the reaction of the American people. That \nwas the reaction of everybody in the Senate and Congress.\n  We drew strength when our firefighters ran upstairs in New York City \nand risked their lives so that other people could live. When rescuers \nrushed into smoke and fire at the Pentagon, we took heart at their \ncourage. When the men and women of flight 93 sacrificed themselves to \nsave our Nation's Capitol, when flags were hanging from front porches \nall across America and strangers became friends, it brought out the \nbest of all of us in America. That spirit of our country should never \nbe reduced to a cheap, divisive political applause line from anyone who \nspeaks for the President of the United States.\n\n  I am proud, as my colleagues on this side are, that after September \n11, all of the people of this country rallied to President Bush's call \nfor unity to meet the danger. There were no Democrats, there were no \nRepublicans, there were only Americans. That is why it is really hard \nto believe that last night in New York, a senior adviser, the most \nsenior adviser to the President of the United States, is twisting, \npurposely twisting those days of unity in order to divide us for \npolitical gain.\n  Rather than focusing attention on Osama bin Laden and finding him or \nrather than focusing attention on just smashing al-Qaida and uniting \nour effort, as we have been, he is, instead, challenging the patriotism \nof every American who is every bit as committed to fighting terror as \nis he.\n  For Karl Rove to equate Democratic policy on terror to indictments or \nto therapy or to suggest that the Democratic response on 9/11 was weak \nis disgraceful.\n  Just days after 9/11, the Senate voted 98 to nothing, and the House \nvoted 420 to 1, to authorize President Bush to use all necessary and \nappropriate force against terror. And after the bipartisan vote, \nPresident Bush said:\n\n       I'm gratified that the Congress has united so powerfully by \n     taking this action. It sends a clear message. Our people are \n     together and we will prevail.\n\n  That is not the message that was sent by Karl Rove in New York City \nlast night. Last night, he said: ``No more needs to be said about their \nmotives.'' The motives of liberals.\n  I think a lot more needs to be said about Karl Rove's motives because \nthey are not the people's motives. They are not the motives that were \nexpressed in that spirit that brought us together. They are not the \nmotives of a Nation that found unity in that critical moment--Democrat \nand Republican alike, all of us as Americans.\n  If the President really believes his own words, if those words have \nmeaning, he should at the very least expect a public apology from Karl \nRove. And frankly, he ought to fire him. If the President of the United \nStates knows the meaning of those words, then he ought to listen to the \nplea of Kristen Brightweiser, who lost her husband when the Twin Towers \ncame crashing down. She said:\n\n       If you are going to use 9/11, use it to make this Nation \n     safer than it was on 9/11.\n\n  Karl Rove doesn't owe me an apology and he doesn't owe Democrats an \napology. He owes the country an apology. He owes Kristen Brightweiser \nand a lot of people like her, those families, an apology. He owes an \napology to every one of those families who paid the ultimate price on \n9/11 and expect their Government to be doing all possible to keep the \nunity of their country and to fight an effective war on terror.\n  The fact is, millions of Americans across our country have serious \nquestions about that, and they have a right to have a legitimate debate \nin our Nation without being called names or somehow being divided in a \nway that does a disservice to the effort to be safer and to bring our \npeople together. The fact is that mothers and fathers of service people \nspend sleepless nights now, worrying about sons and daughters in \nhumvees in Iraq that still are not adequately armored. They are asking \nWashington for honesty, for results, and for leadership--not for \npolitical division. Before Karl Rove delivers another political \nassault, he ought to stop and think about those families and the unity \nof 9/11.\n  The 9/11 Commission has given us a path to follow to try to make our \nNation safer. He ought to be working overtime to implement the \nprovisions. We should not be letting 95 percent of our container ships \ncome into our country uninspected. We should not be leaving nuclear and \nchemical plants without enough protection. Until the work is done of \ntruly responding in the way that Kristen Brightweiser said we should, \nmaking America safer, using 9/11 for that purpose only, we should not \nsee people trying to question the patriotism of Americans who are \nworking in good faith to accomplish those goals.\n  Before wrapping themselves in the memory of 9/11 and shutting their \neyes and ears to the truth, they ought to remember what America is \nreally about; that leadership is not insult or intimidation, it is the \nstrength of making America safe. And they ought to remember what their \nresponsibility is to every single American, and they ought to just \nfocus on the work of doing that. That is what Americans expect of us, \nand that is what is going to make this country safer in the long run.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. May I direct a question to my colleague from \nMassachusetts?\n  Mr. KERRY. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Is it your view that Mr. Rove understands that the men \nand women in uniform in Afghanistan and Iraq are Republicans and \nDemocrats in political registration and political philosophy, but they \nare Americans working together to protect us, to protect our Nation?\n  As my friend from Massachusetts knows, my oldest son, a staff \nsergeant in the U.S. Army, served in combat--he is a Democrat--in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. There is no political division among those young \nmen and women fighting and endangering their lives each and every day \nin those countries. They are responding to the call of their country, \nto endanger their lives. They fought heroically, Republicans and \nDemocrats alike. For anyone to suggest that there are differences of \nmotive about protecting America, about responding to 9/11, is beyond \nthe pale. Do you believe Mr. Rove understands that or do you believe \nthat he honestly thinks that the defense of this country is a partisan \nissue?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say to the Senator, first of all, \nevery one of us is proud of him and proud of his family and proud of \nthe service of his son. I remember talking to the Senator from South \nDakota about how he felt while his son was in harm's way. If ever there \nwere a sort of clear statement about the insult of Karl Rove's \ncomments, it is the question asked by the Senator. I don't know if Karl \nRove understands that. His comments certainly do not indicate it. But I \nwill tell you this: It raises the question of whether he is, as many \nhave suggested, prepared to say anything for political purposes.\n  I think he owes your son. I think he owes every Democrat. I have been \nto Iraq. I met countless soldiers who came\n\n[[Page S7236]]\n\nup to me and said, ``I voted for you'' or people who said ``I support \nyou'' or people who said they are just Democrats. This comment by Karl \nRove insults every single one of them who responded to the call of our \ncountry, as did every Senator on this side of the aisle in voting to go \ninto Afghanistan and in supporting the troops across the board. If we \nare going to get things done and find the common ground here, this is \nnot the way for the most senior adviser to the President to be talking \nabout our country.\n  I remember the storm created in the last week over the comments of a \nSenator. Here is a senior adviser to the President of the United States \nwho has insulted every Democrat in this country, every patriot in this \ncountry who is trying to do their best to protect our troops and \nprovide good policy to our Nation. To suggest there was a weak \nresponse, when we voted 98 to 0, is an insult to that vote and to the \nunity of the moment and to the words of his own President, and I think \nhe owes an apology to your son and to all of those soldiers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we are on the Energy bill at this moment \nand have put forth a unanimous consent that moves us forward. We have a \nfinite list of amendments I will work with Senator Johnson on in the \nnext few minutes. We are about to do a unanimous consent. Those who \nhave amendments should come to the Senate so we can work out the time \nagreement as we work on the managers' package.\n  The majority leader is committed to finishing this bill tonight. If \nwe line ourselves up and move in reasonable order with those amendments \nthat will need votes, we might get out of here at a reasonable time. \nOther than that we could be here quite late.\n  I hope Senators who do have amendments remaining, and we have not \nworked them out, can work with us as we finalize the unanimous consent.\n  I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have one of those amendments. I am prepared to either \ndiscuss it or to wait until there is some agreement as to the order, \nsequence, and time of debate.\n  What would the Senator prefer?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask the Senator to hold for just a few moments until we \nwork out a unanimous consent of order. We are about there. We have two \nor three Senators ready to go. We know of your concern and interest and \nthe amendment to be offered. If the Senator withholds for a few \nmoments, we can do that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, with the agreement of the distinguished \nmanager, I ask for 10 minutes to speak on the subject of asbestos as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. CRAIG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we are now ready to proceed to continue, \nand hopefully within the next few hours finish this very important \nbill.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senator Baucus and Senator Schumer be \nrecognized to offer amendment No. 810 and that there be 30 minutes \nequally divided in the usual form; provided further that following that \ntime the amendment be temporarily set aside for Senator Sununu to offer \namendment No. 873, and that there be 30 minutes for debate equally \ndivided in the usual form. I further ask consent that following the use \nor yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the \namendments in the order offered with no second-degree amendments in \norder to the amendments and with 2 minutes equally divided for closing \nremarks prior to each vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, but \nI want to establish a spot in the queue. I have been waiting patiently \nfor 2 days. I have said on the CAFE amendment I will be more than happy \nto allow Senators Bond and Levin to offer their alternative amendment \nat the same time, debate it at the same time, with an agreement on time \nlimitation on debate, but my fear is we are going to drift into the \nnight hours and drift away. I don't want that to happen.\n  I ask if the Senator would be kind enough to tell me what his \nintention is after we have completed these two amendments.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I appreciate the Senator's concern. He has every right to \nask. The Senator is in the queue and on the list. We have worked out \nthis tranche of amendments and we will now work to see when we can fit \nyou in. I would hope sooner rather than later. So my advice would be to \nstick around.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Being on the Senator's list is as safe as being in a \nmother's arms.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right to object, as I understand it, the \nprocedure precludes second degrees?\n  Mr. CRAIG. It does.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The amendment I am going to offer--there is a friendly \nsecond degree that Senator Kyl and I have agreed to.\n  As I understand it, Senator Domenici and his staff know of the Kyl \namendment and approve of it. Senator Kyl is on his way. If my colleague \nwill yield, it is filed.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator makes a good point.\n  I will withdraw the UC so we can get this solved. I would advise the \nSenator to start debating his amendment now, and let us see if we \ncannot resolve that. If you have opening remarks on your amendment, I \nbelieve this can be solved. I talked to Senator Kyl on the issue. I \nwill talk with staff, and we will move forward.\n  Is the Senator ready to proceed?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am. I do not have that much to say, and we limited the \ntime. I do not want to finish before Senator Kyl gets here. His staff \nhas told him to get here. I guess I can talk about a lot of different \nsubjects until he gets here.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I withdraw the UC for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. First, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing my remarks Senator Kyl be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 810\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment with \nmy colleague from Arizona to strike language from this Energy bill that \nwould undermine years of progress toward combating nuclear terrorism in \nan effort to solve a problem that does not exist.\n  I want to repeat myself for the benefit of my colleagues. By \nweakening existing law, section 621 of this Energy bill would \ndrastically undercut efforts to encourage reductions in the circulation \nof weapons-grade uranium and to defend against the specter of nuclear \nterrorism.\n  I have often said that the prospect of a nuclear attack on America's \nsoil is our nightmare. That is why I, like many of my colleagues, have \nbeen so aggressive in pushing the administration to install nuclear \ndetection devices in our ports, and to take other measures to make sure \nthat nuclear materials cannot be obtained by terrorists and used \nagainst us. The human, environmental, and economic impact of such an \nattack on the United States--any part of our dear country--would be \nalmost unfathomable.\n  So I urge my colleagues to contemplate that when they are examining \nwhat exactly the provision in the Energy bill would do. For years, we \nhave prohibited what this provision of the Energy bill would allow.\n  The supporters of the language claim that it is necessary to avert an \nimpending crisis in the supply of medical isotopes used in \nradiopharmaceuticals. A\n\n[[Page S7237]]\n\nlook at the current isotope industry raises some serious questions as \nto whether that is what is really going on here. Isotope producers \ncurrently make isotopes for use in radiopharmaceuticals and other \nproducts by taking a mass of fissionable material, known as the fuel, \nand using it to shoot neutrons through another mass of fissionable \nmaterial; that is, the target. Reactors have traditionally used highly \nenriched uranium, HEU, which can be used to make a nuclear bomb, for \nfuel and targets.\n  The Law that we enacted over 10 years ago, in the Energy Policy Act \nof 1992, has encouraged reactors to shift to low-enriched uranium. And \nthe difference is very simple. It does the same medically, but it \ncannot be used to create a nuclear weapon. What we do in present law is \nrequire that any foreign reactor receiving exports of United States \nHEU, highly enriched uranium, work with our Government in actively \ntransitioning to LEU, low-enriched uranium, the kind that cannot be \nused in bombs. It makes common sense, complete common sense. Why the \nheck would we want to encourage companies to have HEU?\n  Now, the language in the Energy bill undoes that. After 12 years of \nit working, after 12 years of everyone getting the medical isotopes \nthey need, and after 12 years of moving countries away from HEU--highly \nenriched uranium, which bombs can be made from--to LEU, the language in \nthe Energy bill needlessly and dangerously undercuts this requirement. \nWhat does it do? It exempts research reactors that produce medical \nisotopes from current U.S. law.\n  As our Nation continues to fight the war on terror, now is clearly \nthe wrong time to relax export restrictions on bomb-grade uranium and \npotentially increase the demand for that material.\n  By increasing the amount of HEU in circulation around the world, the \nlanguage in the Energy bill would create an unacceptable risk by \nheightening the possibility that weapons-grade uranium could be lost or \nstolen and fall into the hands, God forbid, of terrorists with known \nnuclear ambitions.\n  What makes this language even more astonishing is that it creates so \nmuch risk for no reward by claiming to fix a problem that does not \nexist. Supporters of the language argue we are in danger of running out \nof medical isotopes if the current law is not changed. All of the \nisotopes that can be produced with HEU can also be produced with LEU, \nwhich has no danger to us. And under current law, no producer has ever \nbeen denied a shipment of the material necessary to produce isotopes. \nLet me repeat that. No producer has ever been denied a shipment of the \nmaterial necessary to produce isotopes.\n  In fact, the Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory has \ndeclared that the proposition that our supply of medical isotopes is in \ndanger because LEU targets have not been developed is incorrect, and \nthe U.S.-developed LEU target ``has been successfully irradiated, \ndissembled, and processed in Indonesia, Argentina, and Australia,'' a \nmove from HEU to LEU because of our law.\n  Mr. President, I would like to be clear about one thing. I do not \nintend to trivialize in any way the plight of those suffering from \nillnesses overseas that require isotopes to treat. My colleagues and I \nwho support this amendment take this point seriously and are \nunequivocally supportive of making sure that patients can get the \nmedicine they need. In fact, if current law hindered the ability to get \nisotopes and treat the sick, maybe this debate would be different. But \nthat is not the case.\n\n  Under existing law, medical isotope production capacity has grown to \n250 percent of demand. Let me repeat that. Under present law, which the \nEnergy bill seeks to change, medical isotope production capacity has \ngrown to 250 percent of demand.\n  In addition, I repeat, no medical isotope producer has ever been \ndenied a shipment of HEU as a result of the successful incentivization \nof efforts to convert to LEU.\n  Existing law guarantees continued use of HEU to produce medical \nisotopes until LEU substitutes are available, so long as the foreign \nproducers cooperate on efforts to eventually convert to LEU.\n  For example, exports to Nordion, a Canadian producer, have never been \naffected by current law, and the company which is at issue here has \nseveral years' worth of material stockpiled at soon-to-be-operating \nreactors. Quite frankly, maybe we have given them too much access and \nmade them complacent. Despite the efforts of the United States to \noperate in good faith and keep supplying Nordion, this company has \ndecided to resist and slow-walk the conversion process to LEU.\n  Why? Because it may inconvenience them or cost them a few more \ndollars in the short run. So for one company, not an American company, \nwe are going to increase the chances of nuclear terrorism by whatever \namount with no benefit other than to that company because everyone is \ngetting the isotopes. Maybe they can save a few dollars. If they think \nthat the Senate is willing to risk a catastrophe for their convenience, \nthey have another thing coming.\n  Existing law does not jeopardize an adequate supply of medical \nisotopes. Instead, it has been successful in enticing foreign operators \nto begin converting to LEU, thereby reducing the risk of proliferation.\n  The record shows that the program works. As a result of existing law, \nreactors in several nations have successfully instituted measures to \nconvert to LEU. The Petten reactor in the Netherlands, where the major \nisotope maker Mallinckrodt produces most of its isotopes, will convert \nits fuel to LEU by 2006 because of incentives in the current law.\n  The Department of Energy has recognized the importance of this goal \nand the effectiveness of the program. Secretary Bodman has said we \nshould set the goal of ending commercial use of weapons-grade uranium, \nand that the LEU allows great progress toward that end. The Department \nof Energy's Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors Program \nWeb site states:\n\n       This law has been very helpful in persuading a number of \n     research reactors to convert to LEU.\n\n  So what we have here is an effort to undermine an existing program \nthat has not had a negative impact on health care and has played a role \nin our fight against nuclear terrorism.\n  If the provision in the Energy bill does become law, make no mistake, \nit will create a proliferation risk. By increasing the amount of \nweapons-grade uranium in circulation, this bill would increase the \nlikelihood that lost or stolen material would find its way into the \nwrong hands.\n\n  I know the list in this bill looks innocent enough with countries \nsuch as Canada, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France. However, \nfour of these countries are members of the EU and subject to the U.S.-\nEURATOM Agreement on Nuclear Cooperation.\n  Under the agreement, these nations will not be required to inform the \nUnited States of retransfers of U.S.-supplied materials from one \nEURATOM country to another, report on alterations to U.S.-supplied \nmaterials, or inform the United States of retransfers of these \nmaterials from one facility in one country to another facility in that \nsame country.\n  As a result, HEU could end up being directly sent to any of the 25 \ncountries in the European Union, including those in which the \nDepartment of Energy is spending a considerable amount of money to \nremove existing HEU stockpiles.\n  So to my colleagues I say, if you support the language in the Energy \nbill, do not do it because of assurances that the countries the \nmaterial is heading to are safe. In reality--in reality--we do not know \nthis and cannot control where the material may end up. That is a \nterrifying thought.\n  In conclusion, the reality of this situation is that terrorists do \nnot care if the weapons-grade uranium they can try to get their hands \non was meant for a military or medical purpose. All we know they care \nabout is how they can use it to attack our Nation and harm our way of \nlife.\n  If we learned anything from the attacks on September 11, it should be \nthat we can never again afford to underestimate the ingenuity or \ndetermination of those who would cause us harm. Likewise, we must take \nevery step to ensure that they can never lay their hands on the \nmaterials they would need to launch an attack of mass destruction \nagainst the United States.\n\n[[Page S7238]]\n\n  Mr. President, a needless risk is a reckless risk, and that is \nexactly the type of risk the language in the Energy bill lays before \nus. I urge my colleagues to support the existing law that has \neffectively combated nuclear proliferation without degrading the \nquality of health care in the United States by voting for my amendment, \nalong with the friendly second-degree amendment that my colleague from \nArizona, I believe, will offer.\n  Mr. President, under the unanimous consent agreement, I now yield to \nmy colleague from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank you. I think what we are going to be \nable to agree to is that after the proponents and opponents of the \nSchumer amendment have concluded their debate, we will have an up-or-\ndown vote on the Schumer amendment. In either event, I believe we could \nat that point get a unanimous consent agreement that the study and \nreport called for in the Kyl second-degree amendment could be voted on \nby voice vote.\n  But until Senator Bond is available to confirm that, we do not need \nto propound that particular request. So we should simply go ahead with \nthe debate on the underlying Schumer amendment. Given the fact that \nSenator Schumer just spoke in favor of that, let me simply take about 2 \nminutes to second what Senator Schumer did and then turn time over to \nan opponent of the amendment, perhaps the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, will the Senator from Arizona yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as we tried to craft the UC, we gave this \nissue of the Schumer amendment 30 minutes. So I would hope we could \nkeep in the spirit of 15 and 15 so we can keep ourselves on track this \nevening. So the opponents would have 15 minutes, as we finish \nfashioning this UC.\n  Mr. KYL. If I could, Mr. President, just inquire of the manager of \nthe bill, we don't have a set 30 minutes yet, but that is the desire; \nis that correct?\n  Mr. CRAIG. We are hoping that adds in.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me take a moment to say that I totally \nagree with Senator Schumer that we need to restore existing law in this \narea. The reason is because highly enriched uranium is used to build \nbombs. We want to be very careful how we export that. In the case of \nthe production of medical isotopes, we do need to export it because \nthat is all that is available right now to produce medical isotopes in \nrelatively large quantities. Low enriched uranium for a target for \nthese isotopes is a process that scientifically works. We are trying to \nwork out whether or not it can happen on a large-scale production \nbasis. Current law says we will continue to export highly enriched \nuranium as long as the recipient of that highly enriched uranium is \nworking with the United States cooperatively to try to get to the \nproduction of these isotopes with low enriched uranium. That is a goal \nthat I think everybody agrees with. We need to have that incentive so \nthat when we export this, we are exporting it to somebody that is \ncooperating with us.\n  What the Energy bill did was to eliminate that requirement of \ncooperation. It is stricken from the language. That is wrong. If we \nwant an incentive for people to continue to work with us, we have to \nretain the existing law's language. That is why the Schumer amendment \nis critical, to ensure that we can both continue to produce these \nmedical isotopes, but also to do so in a way that does not proliferate \nhighly enriched uranium around the world.\n  The manufacturer of this product in Canada has enough of this \nmaterial right now to build a couple of bombs. In Canada that is \nprobably OK, as long as they continue to cooperate with us. But you \neliminate that requirement of cooperation, all of us will have a real \nproblem on our hands. Were something bad to happen, each one of us \nwould be responsible for that. That is the reason the Schumer amendment \nis so important.\n  My second-degree amendment, if it is agreed to, simply requires a \nstudy and report to us about the status of the development of this \ntechnology, whether it is cost beneficial and whether it is \nscientifically achievable.\n  With that, let me yield the floor to an opponent of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CORNYN). The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Schumer \namendment. Let me compliment Senator Kyl for his willingness, over the \nlast 24 hours, to try to bring assurances, through some consensus \nlegislation, of where we both agree we need to get to, that we had \nlanguage that would do it. We do have a slight disagreement because I \nbelieve the language that is in the bill does meet the move towards \nlow-enriched uranium. I believe that the health of the American public \nshould be at the forefront of our consideration. Because if, in fact, \nwe adopt a policy that eliminates the availability of \nradiopharmaceuticals, then we have greatly affected the diagnostic \ncapabilities that exist, that technology has created over the last \ndecade and, in many cases, the treatments for cancer. An interruption \nthat happened from even the Canadian source before meant that doctors \nwere rationed on what they could receive in radiopharmaceuticals. We \nknow how fragile this is because we are reliant on reactors outside \nthis country for those radiopharmaceuticals.\n  Senator Kyl and, hopefully, Senator Schumer agree that when this is \nall decided--and I hope it is decided with the language that the entire \nEnergy Committee worked on and what is in the House language and has \nbeen there--when it is all said and done, I hope we find a way to \neither get the Department of Energy or somebody to begin to produce \nlow-enriched uranium in this country. It is an awful policy that we \nstill turn outside the country for those reactors to produce the \nmedical isotopes, but there is a rich history of that. The Department \nof Energy has looked at this since 1992. They looked at Los Alamos and \nusing the reactors there to begin to make low-enriched uranium. Then \nthey looked at Sandia. Then they talked about privatizing Sandia. The \nnet result was, in the year 2000, the Department of Energy came to the \nconclusion that they were going to disband this effort, that they \ncouldn't figure out how to do it. The fact is, there is not a lot of \nprofit generated from it. But this is clearly a treatment that will \ngrow as researchers find new tools for it.\n  I know there is an attempt to try to address a time limit here, but I \nam not sure that we can put a time limit on all the patients in America \nthat are relying on the decision we are going to make tonight. We would \nspend a lot more time on individual health bills.\n  Nuclear medicine procedures using medical isotopes are heart disease, \ncancer, including breast, lung, prostate, thyroid and non-Hodgkin's \nlymphoma, and brain, Grave's disease, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, \nepilepsy, renal failure, bone infections. Our ability to take \nradioisotopes and send them to an organ, where now we can see that \norgan without an incision, without opening a person up, a noninvasive \nway to determine exactly what is happening in the human body and, on \nthe oncology side, a way to treat cancers, when we can take the \nchemotherapy product and send it right to where we want those cells to \nbe killed.\n  I would like to submit, for the record, a letter from the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission because they have commented on this language. I \nask unanimous consent to print it in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           U.S. Nuclear Regulatory\n\n\n                                                   Commission,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 3, 2004.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, \n         Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission (NRC), I am responding to the letter of April 20, \n     2004, from you and Senator Inhofe, requesting information on \n     the security measures employed by the NRC regarding the \n     licensing and transport of high-enriched uranium (HEU).\n       As you noted in your letter, the NRC has twice provided \n     comments on the provision related to export shipments of HEU \n     used in medical isotope production (a letter signed by \n     Chairman Meserve to Representative Tauzin, dated March 31, \n     2003, and a letter signed by me to the members of the \n     Conference\n\n[[Page S7239]]\n\n     Committee considering the differing versions of H.R. 6, the \n     ``Energy Policy Act of 2003,'' passed by the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives, dated September 5, 2003). The NRC \n     continues to have no objections to the provision pertaining \n     to the export of HEU targets for the production of medical \n     isotopes by specified countries. The NRC continues to believe \n     that the enactment of this measure could be of benefit in \n     ensuring the timely supply of medical isotopes in the United \n     States.\n       Additional information responding to your specific \n     questions is provided in the Enclosure. If you have any \n     further questions or comments, please feel free to contact \n     me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Nils J. Diaz.\n  Mr. BURR. They have been consulted. They are the agency that \ndetermines whether a license is granted. It was suggested that this is \nsome willy-nilly program, that anybody who wants to send highly \nenriched uranium out to a reactor somewhere just simply does that, and \nhopefully we get back radiopharmaceuticals. That is not the case. This \nis a very stringent licensing program, where they apply to the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission. They are instructed by the Atomic Energy Act as \nto the process they go through, currently in the law, that was written \nby Senator Schumer in 1992. Over the years, the interpretation of that \nprovision has changed. Over the years, that has caused indecision at \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n  It was that indecision, that vagueness in the current law that \nSenator Schumer is attempting to strike and go back to provision in law \nthat the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has said: We don't feel that we \ncan successfully make this evaluation without you clarifying the \nparameters you want us to be in.\n  So in short, we asked the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to write us \non the language and asked them if it cleared it up, asked them if, in \nfact, this gave them the proper direction from the Senate, from the \nCongress. This is the letter back from the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission that says:\n\n       The NRC continues to have no objections to the provisions \n     pertaining to the export of HEU targets for the production of \n     medical isotopes by specified countries.\n\n  I know there are others anxious to speak. I have so much more to say. \nI see the chairman of the bill has stood and may have a unanimous \nconsent request. I am not sure. But I would like to see if my colleague \nfrom Arkansas is prepared to speak in opposition to the Schumer \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments. I \nrise to join the Senator from North Carolina in speaking in opposition \nto the Schumer amendment. I certainly am concerned that the amendment \nbefore us would remove a carefully crafted provision from the bill that \nseeks to ensure that Americans will maintain a reliable supply of \nmedical isotopes or the radiopharmaceuticals used to diagnose and treat \nso many diseases. We are on the brink, all of us here, working hard to \nincrease funding for the discovery of eliminating these diseases. In \nthe meantime, being able to provide the hope to those who suffer from \nthese diseases is so critically important.\n  These diseases include everything from heart disease to \nhyperthyroidism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, epilepsy, kidney \nfailure, bone infection, brain cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, \nthyroid cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and brain cancer--so many of \nthese that plague the lives of Americans who can get some relief from \nthe medical treatment that is provided by these medical isotopes.\n  At least 14 million Americans are diagnosed and treated with medical \nisotopes each year. While I believe America should continue in the vein \nof developing policies consistent with our nonproliferation goals, we \nmust make sure that these and future patients do not lose access to the \nradiopharmaceuticals. We cannot move forward in a way toward \nnonproliferation and wrest the responsibility, not knowing full well \nwhat the future might be for these patients and their needs.\n  I support the provision in the underlying bill, as was mentioned by \nmy colleague from North Carolina, that was carefully crafted in the \ncommittee to take into consideration all of these needs, making sure \nthat we are recognizing the sensitivity and the caution that needs to \nexist and yet recognizing that the development of technologies and new \ninformation and medical treatments are something that are vital to \nthese 14 million Americans.\n  The provision in the underlying bill permits the export of the highly \nenriched uranium used only for the production of the medical isotopes \nuntil a low-enriched uranium alternative is commercially viable and \navailable. We know that those are also issues. We talk about the \nreimportation of those isotopes, making sure that the production of \nthem is something that is going to continue in order to make sure that \nthe access to these pharmaceuticals is available.\n  This provision is balanced, it is fair, and it is supported by the \nnuclear medicine community, including those in my home State of \nArkansas. I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. Vote \nagainst it so that patients do not lose their access to these very \nnecessary drugs.\n  I don't know that my colleagues have mentioned all of those in \nsupport of this effort: The American College of Nuclear Physicians, the \nAmerican College of Radiology, the American Society of Nuclear \nCardiology, the Council on Radionuclides and Radiopharmaceuticals, the \nNational Association of Cancer Patients, the National Association of \nNuclear Pharmacies, the Nuclear Energy Institute, and the Society of \nNuclear Medicine.\n  We have an opportunity to stay on course with something that has been \nnegotiated and very thoroughly vetted in the underlying bill that will \nkeep us on the right track and make sure that these 14 million \nAmericans and their families will continue to have the access to these \npharmaceuticals that they need while we continue to work forward in the \nmanner which we can to make sure that all of the safety and caution \nthat needs to be there is there, will remain there, while we still \nenjoy the unbelievable technologies that have been discovered in recent \nmedicine.\n  I thank the Senator from North Carolina for yielding. I do encourage \nmy colleagues to rise in opposition to the amendment so that we can go \nback to what is in the underlying bill. I think it will prove well for \nall of those who suffer from many diseases that we can treat with these \nmedical isotopes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will attempt to offer a unanimous consent \nnow that will finalize action on the Schumer amendment and move us to \nthe Sununu amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Schumer be recognized to offer \nhis amendment No. 810 and that there be--there has already been \napproximately 30 minutes of debate on this. I ask for another 30 \nminutes, and I would hope that my colleagues would use it wisely and \njudiciously or we will be here until early tomorrow morning, that 30 \nminutes be equally divided in the usual form; provided further that \nfollowing that time, the amendment be temporarily set aside for Senator \nSununu to offer amendment No. 873, and that there be 30 minutes for \ndebate equally divided in the usual form. I further ask consent that \nfollowing the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to votes \nin relation to the amendments in the order offered, with no second-\ndegree amendments in order to the amendments, and with 2 minutes \nequally divided for closing remarks prior to each vote; provided \nfurther that following the vote in relation to the Schumer amendment, \nthe Kyl amendment, No. 990, as modified, be considered and agreed to.\n\n  Finally, Senator Bond will be allocated 7 minutes prior to the vote \non or in relation to the Schumer amendment. That will come out of the \n15 minutes allocated of the 30 for debate on the Schumer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, so long as the \nunanimous consent agreement did not say that the last word was Senator \nBond. The last word is ordinarily reserved for the proponent of the \namendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is the intent. It is just to secure for Senator Bond \n7 minutes of debate on the Schumer amendment prior to the vote.\n  Mr. KYL. Further reserving the right to object, would the manager of \nthe bill\n\n[[Page S7240]]\n\nat this time have an estimate--we will temporarily lay this aside for \nthe presentation of another amendment and then back to this amendment \nand, with the 30 minutes, presumably, we would be voting at about 6 \no'clock, or thereabouts; is that correct?\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 810\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 810.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York, [Mr. SCHUMER], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 810.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To strike a provision relating to medical isotope production)\n\n       Beginning on page 395, strike line 3 and all that follows \n     through page 401, line 25.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will let some of the opponents speak \nnow, since I have spoken, unless my colleague from Arizona would like \nto speak. We could have some of the opponents go.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will speak very briefly in opposition to \nthe Schumer amendment.\n  Since 1971, there have been more than 45 million successful shipments \nof radioactive materials. And the Nuclear Regulatory Commission tracks \nand licenses all of these statements of medical isotope production. The \nNRC takes its job very seriously. This is a phenomenally safe track \nrecord that we are involved in.\n  My colleagues from North Carolina and Arkansas have talked of the \ntremendous importance of being able to have adequate supplies of \nradioisotopes. Doctors conduct 14 million procedures each year in the \nUnited States using medical isotopes to diagnose and treat cancer, \nheart disease, and other serious sicknesses. The Senator from North \nCarolina has clearly laid out why this language is in this bill, and it \nis important.\n  Mr. President, hundreds, of thousands of Americans depend on medical \nisotopes to diagnose and treat life-threatening diseases.\n  It is also a fact that we do not produce these isotopes in the United \nStates. We must ship enriched uranium to producers in Canada and \nWestern Europe that produce the isotopes and return them to hospitals \nin the United States.\n  Yet some of my colleagues ask: Why must we ship these isotopes \ninternationally at all? Does this pose security risks?\n  My answer: An emphatic no!\n  Let me explain why . . .\n  It is understandable to be concerned about the shipment of enriched \nuranium outside of the United States. And, of course, I share your \nconcern. But it is important to recognize that these shipments are safe \nand secure.\n  The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission tracks and licenses all of the \nshipments for medical isotope production. The NRC takes its job very \nseriously.\n  The shipments are carefully tracked by the NRC and corresponding \nagencies in Canada and Western Europe throughout their journey. They \nare subject to the same sort of strict guidelines in these countries \nthat they are under in the United States.\n  Since 1971, there have been more than 45 million successful shipments \nof radioactive materials. Shippers, State regulators, government \nagencies, and international organizations carefully handle and track \neach and every shipment--time after time. The result: The isotopes can \ndo what they are made for--fight deadly disease.\n  Doctors conduct 14 million procedures each year in the United States \nusing medical isotopes to diagnose and treat cancer, heart disease and \nother serious sicknesses. We must ensure a reliable supply of medical \nisotopes so that doctors can carry out these procedures.\n  The diagnosis and treatment of diseases like cancer, heart disease \nand other dreaded diseases depend on radiotherapy using medical \nisotopes. Doctors and patients depend on a stable supply of medical \nisotopes.\n  That supply depends on the assurance that these isotopes are \ntransported safely and securely. And they are. But the NRC must have \nthe tools it needs to carry out its mission.\n  This bill before us today helps the NRC to effectively license these \nshipments so that supply of medical isotopes is there when we need \nthem.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important and timely legislation \nas written, to insure a reliable supply of isotopes to help treat and \ndiagnose heart disease; cancer, including breast, lung, prostate, \nthyroid cancer, Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and brain; Grave's Disease \n(hyperthyroidism); Occult infection (in AIDS); Parkinson's Disease; \nAlzheimer's Disease; Epilepsy; Renal (kidney) Failure; and Bone \nInfections.\n  I yield the floor and ask my colleagues to oppose the Schumer \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I was not on the floor when the unanimous \nconsent request was proposed. It is not typical to have 7 minutes on \nthe other side and only 1 for us right before the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that 7 out of our 15 minutes be used right \nbefore the vote on the Schumer-Kyl amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will speak for a moment. I am responding \nboth to the senior Senator from Idaho and also the Senator from \nArkansas. The Senator from Idaho is correct. Under existing law, we \nhave had numerous shipments since 1992, and we have been producing \nthese medical isotopes, and everything has been fine. That is what the \nSchumer amendment seeks to do--to ensure that the existing law is in \nplace. So that condition the Senator from Idaho spoke to is precisely \nthe good condition that would prevail if the Schumer amendment is \nadopted and we return to existing law.\n  The problem is that an amendment was inserted in the Energy bill in \ncommittee which strikes existing law and eliminates the requirement \nthat the recipient of this highly enriched uranium provide assurances \nto the United States that it is cooperating with us to move to a low-\nenriched uranium target. That is everybody's goal. Nobody disagrees \nwith that goal.\n  But because of that amendment, we would no longer have the assurance \nthat we could eventually get off of highly enriched uranium--which is \nused to build nuclear bombs--and get to low-enriched uranium. This is a \nproliferation issue, not a medical issue. That is what I say to the \nSenator from Arkansas.\n  There is no suggestion that there is going to be any lack of medical \ntreatment as a result of the existing law. Since 1992, we have had \nmedical isotopes available for treatment, and we are going to have them \navailable in the future. There is nothing in existing law that takes \naway from that. There is an attempt by somebody to scare people into \nbelieving that somehow or another the existing law--in effect since \n1992--is somehow going to result in a lack of medical isotopes. That is \nfalse, and it is pernicious. Whoever is trying to spread this notion \nshould not do that because it will scare people into thinking there are \nnot going to be medical isotopes available for treatment. Nothing could \nbe further from the truth. Existing law has worked. Not once has an \nexport license been denied. So let's forget this scare tactic. We are \ngoing to have the medical isotopes that we need.\n  The real question here is proliferation. We have had a law that has \nworked very well since 1992. We are trying to move toward low-enriched \nuranium. Listen to what the Secretary of Energy has had to say about \nthis. In a speech delivered on April 5, Secretary Samuel Bodman said:\n\n       We should set a goal of working to end the commercial use \n     of highly enriched uranium in research reactors.\n\n[[Page S7241]]\n\n       The availability today of advanced, high-density low \n     enriched uranium fuels allows great progress toward this \n     goal.\n       The Department of Energy's Reduced Enrichment for Research \n     and Test Reactors program Web site states:\n       This law has been very helpful in persuading a number of \n     research reactors to convert to LEU.\n\n  That is existing law, which we want to retain. Why would we want to \nstrike the one provision in existing law that helps us to achieve this \ngoal? The provision that says that the recipient of this highly \nenriched uranium has to provide assurances to the United States that it \nis cooperating with us toward this goal--something is going on here, \nMr. President, and it is not good.\n  Let me also say, with regard to this myth about the lack of medical \nisotopes, the fact is that DOE's Argonne National Laboratory \ncharacterized this very claim as a ``myth,'' adding that the U.S.-\ndeveloped low-enriched uranium foil target ``has been successfully \nirradiated, disassembled, and processed in Indonesia, Argentina, and \nAustralia.'' Furthermore, HEU exports for use as targets in medical \nisotope production are not prohibited under current law, and no such \nexport has ever been denied under that law, as I said. Current law is \nintended to encourage conversion to low-enriched uranium, which can't \nbe used to make nuclear bombs. But in no way does it prohibit the \nexport of highly enriched uranium. We are not at the technological \nstage where we can mass produce through low-enriched uranium.\n  The bottom line is this: Current law has been working, as the Senator \nfrom Idaho so eloquently noted. It provides the medical isotopes we \nneed. No export license has ever been denied. Recently, the Secretary \nof Energy made the point that we are trying to convert, eventually, to \nlow-enriched uranium, and the current law that requires recipients of \nhighly enriched uranium to work with us toward that goal has worked \nvery well toward this end.\n  Why would we eliminate that requirement of cooperation, when we are \ntrying to make sure that this highly enriched uranium doesn't \nproliferate around the globe? As I said, a company in Canada that is \ncurrently working with us has enough of this stuff for two bombs. It \nwould not be a good idea for us to allow further proliferation of \nhighly enriched uranium around the world when we are concerned about \nterrorists getting a hold of a nuclear weapon. Let's keep the law in \nplace. I urge my colleagues to support the Schumer amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I have all the respect in the world for my \ncolleague, Senator Kyl. I think it is reasonable in life that two \npeople can disagree on what something says.\n  In this particular case, an entire committee looked at it, the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission. When the question is asked, Who asked \nfor change? the answer is simple: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission. \nThis is with over 10 years of working with the current language. And as \ntime has gone on and technology has changed, and as the requirement for \nthe size of what we needed in radioisotopes has changed, it was the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission that, in fact, suggested they needed \nCongress's help.\n  Let me address the last fact Senator Kyl brought up. One, only \nArgentina currently produces medical isotopes using LEU target \ntechnology, which is unable to even meet the current needs in Argentina \nmedical community. Indonesia has ceased any further testing of the \nU.S.-developed LEU through the technical obstacles. We all want low-\nenriched uranium. After this is over, I hope this body will take on \nthat challenge, the challenge of domestically producing medical \nisotopes and the Department of Energy will probably have a hold of the \ntiger that we give them when we instruct the Department to go back to \nwhat they dropped in 2000, after they have reviewed it, and look at our \nreactors here and how we accomplish production, whether we can make \nmoney at it or not.\n  I want to go back to health, though. Some have suggested that health \nis not important. Health is important. I list it up here on the chart. \nAnnually, over 14 million nuclear medicine procedures are performed in \nthe United States that require medical isotopes manufactured from \nhighly enriched uranium. Patients and doctors in the United States are \n100 percent reliant on the import of medical isotopes that are used \nwith highly enriched uranium. That is a fact. Every day, over 20,000 \npatients undergo procedures that use radiopharmaceuticals developed to \ndiagnose coronary artery disease and assist in assessing patient risk \nfor major cardiac-related deaths, such as strokes.\n  This is not just what we treat; this is what we prevent from \nhappening through this diagnostic tool. The CDC estimates that 61 \nmillion Americans--almost one-fourth of the U.S. population--lives with \nthe effects of stroke or heart disease, and heart disease is the \nleading cause of disability among working adults.\n  Medical isotopes are one of the tools used to diagnose and treat many \nforms of cancer, as we have listed. Medical isotopes are also used to \nhelp manage pain in cancer patients, such as decreasing the need for \npain medication when cancer spreads or metastasizes to the bone. \nThyroid cancer. Radiopharmaceuticals are used to diagnose and treat \nthyroid disorders and cancer which, according to the American Cancer \nSociety, is one of the few cancers where the incident rate is \nincreasing.\n  Mr. President, we are talking about dealing with real health problems \nthat are on the rise, and technology can come up with new treatments. \nBut that treatment is held in limbo until we decide. Non-Hodgkins \nlymphoma is the fifth most common cancer in the United States. \nAccording to the American Cancer Society, approximately 56,000 new \ncases of non-Hodgkins lymphoma will be diagnosed in the year 2005. The \nvoice of proliferation, Alan Kuperman, of the Nuclear Control \nInstitute, said this about the language that is currently in the Energy \nbill:\n\n       This provision is not controversial and, thus, likely to \n     remain in the energy bill when and if it is enacted.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Ironically, an amendment originally drafted to pave the way \n     for continued HEU exports [which is his interpretation, not \n     that of the committee] for isotope production may have the \n     unintended consequences of terminating them.\n\n  That is exactly the opposite of what those who suggest the need for \nthis amendment is. Even the person who is the most outspoken in this \ncountry says: You know what. What the Energy Committee has done will \nforce us into the use of low-enriched uranium.\n  In fact, this tells me from the person who is the most outspoken that \nour committee has done exactly what we attempted to do. We have written \nexactly the right language.\n  Without a secure and permanent supply of medical isotopes, it is \nunlikely that new nuclear medicine procedures will be researched or \ndeveloped. If, in fact, we suggest we will cut off this source, why \nwould any researcher around this country look at how to further what \nthey can do with medical isotopes?\n  My colleague from Arkansas stated it very well. This is not just \nMembers of the Senate who are suggesting we have read the language and \nit is right; it is the American College of Nuclear Physicians, the \nAmerican College of Radiology, the American Society of Nuclear \nCardiology--and the list goes on. Every Member can see it. Can this \nmany health care professionals be wrong?\n  Separate this, as Senator Kyl suggested. This is a proliferation \nissue, and it is a health issue. As to the health issue, I do not think \nanybody questions the value of this product for the health of the \nAmerican people.\n  There is no better gold standard on deciding whether an application \nor license should be approved than the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. \nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission is still in charge of this process. \nThat has not changed. It will not change. If it is a national security \nrisk, it will not just be the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that \nscreams, it will be the Government--the House and Senate, the White \nHouse--that screams.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7 minutes remaining to the opposition \nwhich has been allocated to Senator Bond.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I want to maintain the 7 minutes for Senator \nBond. I thank Senator Kyl for the gracious way we tried to negotiate. I \nthink it is unfortunate that we have not. I urge Senators to defeat \nthis amendment. Protect the patients.\n\n[[Page S7242]]\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, how much of that time remains of the window \nof 7 minutes for the Schumer side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 10 minutes remaining on the Schumer \nside.\n  Mr. CRAIG. A total of 10.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me use part of that 3 minutes right now \nto ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a statement and a \nletter from the Physicians for Social Responsibility, dated June 20, \n2005. I ask unanimous consent that this material be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Stop the Proliferation of Weapons-Grade Uranium\n\n\n       Support the Schumer and Kyl Amendments to the Energy Bill\n\n       Senator Schumer and Senator Kyl intend to offer amendments \n     (Amendments 810 and 990, respectively) to the Energy Bill to \n     eliminate language that would undermine U,S. efforts to \n     encourage reductions in the circulation of weapons grade \n     uranium. Senators Schumer and Kyl urge their colleagues to \n     support these amendments, which will maintain current \n     restrictions on the export of bomb-grade uranium and reduce \n     the possibility that nuclear material will wind up in \n     terrorists' hands.\n       Isotope producers currently make isotopes for use in \n     radiopharmaceuticals and other products by taking a mass of \n     fissionable material, known as fuel, and using it to shoot \n     neutrons through another mass of fissionable material, the \n     target. Reactors have traditionally used highly enriched \n     uranium (HEU), which can be used to make a nuclear bomb, for \n     fuel and targets. Language in the Energy Policy Act of 1992 \n     has encouraged reactors to shift to low-enriched uranium \n     (LEU), which cannot be used to create a nuclear weapon, by \n     requiring any foreign reactor receiving exports of U.S. HEU \n     to work with the United States in actively transitioning to \n     LEU.\n       Section 621 of the Energy Bill dangerously undercuts this \n     requirement by exempting research reactors that produce \n     medical isotopes from current U.S. law. It would weaken \n     efforts to reduce the amount of weapons-grade uranium in \n     circulation around the world and reward producers that have \n     been most resistant to complying with U.S. law. It would do \n     so by allowing facilities to avoid ever having to move to an \n     LEU ``target'', even if it is technically and economically \n     feasible to do so. This is in direct contradiction to \n     Secretary of Energy Bodman's call to ``set a goal of working \n     to end the commercial use of highly enriched uranium in \n     research reactors.''\n       As our nation continues to fight the War on Terror, now is \n     clearly the wrong time to relax export restrictions on bomb-\n     grade uranium and potentially increase the demand for that \n     material. Not only does the language in the Energy bill pose \n     a threat to national security, it seeks to fix a problem that \n     does not exist. Supporters of the language argue that we are \n     in danger of running out of medical isotopes if current law \n     is not changed. No producer has ever been denied an export \n     license for HEU to be used in medical isotope production \n     because of the restrictions in the 1992 Energy Policy Act. \n     Indeed, all that a facility must do to continue to receive \n     these exports is work in good faith with the United States on \n     eventual conversion to LEU when it is technically and \n     economically feasible. This is not an unreasonable standard, \n     it does not jeopardize our supply, and it is, as intended, \n     encouraging conversion.\n       Senator Schumer plans to offer a first degree amendment to \n     strike section 621. Senator Kyl will second degree his \n     amendment with a requirement for a study. The rationale is \n     that it is prudent to conduct a comprehensive study before we \n     even consider lifting the restrictions, as opposed to after \n     lifting them, as the Energy bill language would do.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              Medical Isotope Production: Myths and Facts\n\n       Myth: Our supply of medical isotopes is in danger because \n     LEU targets have not been developed, and an adequate supply \n     of medical isotopes cannot be produced with LEU.\n       Fact: The Department of Energy's Argonne National \n     Laboratory characterizes this claim as a ``myth,'' adding \n     that the US-developed, LEU foil target ``has been \n     successfully irradiated, disassembled, and processed in \n     Indonesia, Argentina, and Australia.'' Furthermore, HEU \n     exports for use as targets in medical isotope production are \n     not prohibited under current law, and no such export has ever \n     been denied under that law. Current law is intended to \n     encourage conversion to low-enriched uranium, which cannot be \n     used to make a nuclear bomb. It is working without \n     jeopardizing our supply of medical isotopes.\n       Myth: Section 621 has broad agency support.\n       Fact: The fact is that the United States has a long-\n     established policy of reducing HEU exports. In a speech \n     delivered on April 5th, Secretary of Energy Bodman stated, \n     ``We should set a goal of working to end the commercial use \n     of highly enriched uranium in research reactors. The \n     availability today of advanced, high-density low-enriched \n     uranium fuels allows great progress toward this goal.'' The \n     Department of Energy's Reduced Enrichment for Research and \n     Test Reactors program website states, ``This law has been \n     very helpful in persuading a number of research reactors to \n     convert to LEU.''\n       Myth: Existing law needs to be weakened to ensure a \n     reliable supply of medical isotopes for use in medical \n     procedures.\n       Fact: Under existing law, medical isotope production \n     capacity has grown to 250% of demand. In addition, no medical \n     isotope producer has ever been denied a shipment of HEU as a \n     result of the successful incentivization of efforts to \n     convert to LEU. The Schumer-Kyl amendments would guarantee \n     continued use of HEU to produce medical isotopes until LEU \n     substitutes are available, so long as foreign producers \n     cooperate on efforts to eventually convert to LEU when \n     possible. For example exports to Nordion, a Canadian \n     producer, have never been affected by current law and the \n     company has several-years worth of material stockpiled at \n     soon-to-be-operating reactors.\n       Myth: Weakening existing law will not create a \n     proliferation risk.\n       Fact: Weakening existing law will increase the amount of \n     HEU in circulation and the frequency with which it is \n     transported, resulting in a greater proliferation risk of \n     loss or theft. For example, Section 621 exempts five \n     countries from current law restrictions, including four \n     members of the European Union. These four nations would be \n     subject to the requirements of the U.S.-EURATOM Agreement on \n     Nuclear Cooperation. Under the EURATOM agreement, EURATOM \n     countries are not required to inform the U.S. of retransfers \n     of U.S.-supplied materials from one EURATOM country to \n     another, report on alterations to U.S.-supplied materials, or \n     inform the U.S. of retransfers of these materials from one \n     facility in one country to another facility in that same \n     country. As a result, HEU could end up being indirectly sent \n     to any of the 25 countries in the European Union including \n     those in which the Department of Energy is spending a \n     considerable amount of money to remove existing HEU \n     stockpiles.\n       Myth: Existing law has not been effective in decreasing the \n     risk of proliferation.\n       Fact: As a result of existing law, reactors in several \n     nations have successfully instituted measures to convert to \n     LEU. For example, the Petten reactor in the Netherlands, \n     where the major isotope maker Mallinckrodt produces most of \n     its isotopes, will convert its fuel to LEU by 2006 because of \n     incentives in the existing law. The Department of Energy's \n     Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors program \n     website states, ``This law has been very helpful in \n     persuading a number of research reactors to convert to LEU.''\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Physicians for\n\n\n                                        Social Responsibility,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 2005.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR), \n     representing 30,000 physicians and health professionals \n     nationwide, is writing to urge you to reject a provision in \n     the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Section 621 of the nuclear \n     title, ``Medical Isotope Production'') that would seriously \n     weaken export controls on highly enriched uranium (HEU), the \n     easiest material for terrorists to use to make a nuclear \n     bomb. As physicians and health care professionals, we support \n     the use of medical isotopes, but this legislation is not \n     necessary to ensure the supply of medical isotopes to U.S. \n     hospitals and clinics. We urge you to support instead the \n     amendment offered by Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Jon \n     Kyl (R-AZ), which would retain current HEU export control \n     provisions.\n       Under existing law, medical isotope production capacity has \n     grown to 250 percent of demand. In addition, no medical \n     isotope producer has ever been denied a shipment of HEU as a \n     result of the successful incen-\n     tivization of efforts to convert to LEU. The Schumer-Kyl \n     amendment would guarantee continued use of HEU to produce \n     medical isotopes until LEU substitutes are available, so long \n     as foreign producers cooperate on efforts to eventually \n     convert to LEU when possible. For example exports to Nordion, \n     a Canadian producer, have never been affected by current law \n     and the company has several-years worth of material \n     stockpiled at soon-to-be-operating reactors.\n       Moreover, there is no shortage of medical isotopes. An \n     April 2005 paper entitled ``Production of Mo-99 in Europe: \n     Status and Perspectives,'' by Henri Bonet and Bernard David \n     of IRE, a major producer of medical isotopes, reports both \n     ``current production'' and ``peak capacity'' production by \n     the major isotope producers at the major reactors used for \n     isotope production. Nordion's current production is 40 \n     percent of current world demand. The firms IRE and \n     Mallinckrodt (Tyco-Healthcare), at Petten and BR-2, together \n     currently produce 39 percent of current world demand. But \n     their peak capacity production is 85 percent of current world \n     demand. That means that IRE and Mallinckrodt, by themselves, \n     could more than replace Nordion's entire current production.\n       In addition, the Safari reactor in South Africa currently \n     produces 10 percent of current world demand. But its peak \n     capacity is 45 percent of current world demand. That means \n     that the South African reactor, by itself, could almost \n     entirely replace Nordion's entire current production.\n\n[[Page S7243]]\n\n       A final illustrative statistic is that worldwide peak \n     capacity production today is 250 percent of current world \n     demand. So, we do indeed have a surplus of production \n     capacity. Worldwide production capacity is more than twice \n     worldwide demand.\n       There is therefore absolutely no need to put Americans at \n     risk of nuclear terrorist attack by loosening rules on \n     international shipments of HEU. We would gain nothing from \n     repealing the Schumer Amendment but an increased \n     proliferation threat.\n       Existing law limiting U.S. HEU exports (Section 134 of the \n     Atomic Energy Act, known popularly as the Schumer amendment) \n     has been on the books for more than a decade, and there is no \n     evidence that it has interfered in any way with the supply of \n     medical isotopes in the past, or that it will suddenly begin \n     to do so in the future. The law as it stands allows continued \n     export of HEU to producers of medical isotopes, as long as \n     they agree to convert to low-enriched uranium (which cannot \n     be used as the core of a nuclear bomb) when it becomes \n     technically and economically possible to do so, and to \n     cooperate with the United States to bring that day closer. We \n     strongly believe that this law has served our country well \n     for more than ten years, drastically reducing commerce in \n     potential bomb material while ensuring continued supplies of \n     needed medicines, and that this is the right policy to \n     maintain for the future. This law directly supports the call \n     of Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman, made in a speech on April \n     5, to ``set a goal of working to end the commercial use of \n     highly enriched uranium in research reactors.''\n       The purpose of Schumer amendment was to phase out HEU \n     exports in order to reduce the risk of this material being \n     stolen by terrorists or diverted by proliferating states for \n     nuclear weapons production. The law bars export of HEU for \n     use as reactor fuel or as targets to produce medical \n     isotopes, except on an interim basis to facilities that are \n     actively pursuing conversion to low-enriched uranium (LEU), a \n     material that, unlike HEU, cannot be used to make a \n     Hiroshima-type bomb. Because the United States has been the \n     primary world supplier of HEU, the law provides a strong \n     incentive for reactor operators and isotope producers to \n     convert their operations from HEU to LEU. The law does not \n     impose an unreasonable burden on isotope producers and indeed \n     exempts them if conversion would result in ``a large \n     percentage increase in the total cost of operating the \n     reactor.''\n       This is entirely in line with administration policy. \n     President Bush has repeatedly said that the deadliest threat \n     facing the United States is that of terrorists armed with \n     nuclear weapons. Repealing the Schumer amendment would make \n     access to HEU easier, and thus a terrorist nuclear attack on \n     an American city more likely. It is further likely that \n     countries such as Latvia, Poland and Hungary would be allowed \n     to receive retransfers of U.S. HEU, despite holding poorly \n     safeguarded stocks of this material already. Once this \n     material gets into the hands of terrorists, it is a \n     relatively simple task to produce a crude nuclear weapon that \n     could kill hundreds of thousands of people if exploded in a \n     major city. It makes no sense to take action that would not \n     make our medical isotope supply more secure, but would \n     increase the terrorist threat to our cities.\n       The legislation on which you are about to vote would \n     eliminate the Schumer amendment's legal restriction on supply \n     of HEU to the main producers of medical isotopes and thereby \n     dramatically reduce their incentives to convert from HEU to \n     LEU. The likely result would be perpetual use of HEU by these \n     isotope producers instead of the phase-out foreseen by \n     current law. Worldwide, such isotope production now annually \n     requires some 50-100 kg of fresh HEU, sufficient for at \n     least one nuclear weapon of a simple design, or several of \n     a more sophisticated design. (Each of the world's major \n     isotope production facilities already requires annually \n     about 20 kg of fresh HEU.) If conversion to LEU is \n     derailed, the annual amount of HEU needed for isotope \n     production is likely to grow in step with the rising \n     demand for isotopes. Moreover, after the HEU targets are \n     used and processed, the uranium waste remains highly \n     enriched (exceeding 90 percent), and cools quickly, so \n     that within a year the remaining HEU is no longer ``self-\n     protecting'' against terrorist theft. Thus, substantial \n     amounts of weapon-usable HEU waste accumulate at isotope \n     production sites, presenting yet another vulnerable and \n     attractive target for terrorists.\n       Contrary to its stated intent, section 621 would do nothing \n     to ensure the supply of medical isotopes to the United States \n     because that supply is not currently endangered by \n     restrictions on exports of HEU. The United States now gets \n     most of its medical isotopes from the Canadian supplier \n     Nordion, which still produces such isotopes at its aging NRU \n     reactor and associated processing plant. The Schumer \n     Amendment does not block continued export of HEU for isotope \n     production at this facility prior to its impending shutdown. \n     In addition, Nordion has stockpiled four years' worth of HEU \n     targets specially designed for its new isotope production \n     facility, which is scheduled to commence commercial operation \n     soon. Even in the unexpected circumstance that Nordion's \n     isotope production were to cease, the United States could \n     turn to alternate suppliers in the Netherlands, Belgium, and \n     South Africa that currently enjoy excess production capacity.\n       We wish to underscore that the existing law does not \n     discriminate against Canada or any other foreign producer. \n     Indeed, in 1986, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) \n     ordered all domestic, licensed nuclear research reactors to \n     convert from HEU to LEU fuel as soon as suitable LEU fuel for \n     their use became available. The NRC recognized that \n     prevention of theft and diversion of HEU from civilian \n     facilities cannot be assured by physical protection and \n     safeguards alone, but rather requires a phase-out of HEU \n     commerce. The Schumer Amendment applied the same standard to \n     foreign operators.\n       Supporters of the new legislation, like the Burr Amendment \n     before it, such as the American College of Nuclear \n     Physicians, have argued erroneously that the Schumer \n     Amendment ``was not drafted with medical uses of HEU in \n     mind.'' In fact, the approximately 500-word Schumer Amendment \n     uses the word ``target'' nine times. Targets, in distinction \n     to ``fuel,'' are used exclusively for the production of \n     medical isotopes. Thus, it is readily apparent that the \n     current law was drafted explicitly to include the HEU targets \n     that are used in medical isotope production.\n       We also wish to underscore that conversion of isotope \n     production from HEU to LEU is technically and economically \n     feasible. Australia has produced medical isotopes using LEU \n     for years. According to Argonne National Laboratory, the main \n     consequence of Nordion converting from HEU to LEU would be to \n     increase its waste volume by about ten percent. That is a \n     small price to pay to eliminate the risk that this material \n     could be stolen by terrorists and used to build nuclear \n     weapons.\n       The main obstacle to Nordion converting its production \n     process from HEU to LEU has been the company's refusal to \n     pursue such conversion in good faith, as required by the \n     Schumer amendment as a condition for interim exports of HEU. \n     In 1990, Atomic Energy Canada, Ltd. (from which Nordion was \n     spun off) pledged to develop an LEU target by 1998 and to \n     ``phase out HEU use by 2000.'' Nordion and AECL failed to \n     meet this target. During the last few years, to qualify \n     for additional HEU exports, Nordion repeatedly has pledged \n     to cooperate with the United States on conversion. \n     However, Nordion stopped engaging in such cooperation more \n     than a year ago.\n       The Schumer Amendment will never lead to an interruption in \n     Nordion's ability to produce isotopes unless Nordion \n     aggressively refuses to cooperate with U.S. policies designed \n     to prevent terrorists from acquiring the essential \n     ingredients of nuclear weapons. No company has a perpetual \n     entitlement to U.S. bomb-grade uranium, and any such exports \n     should be reserved for recipients who cooperate with U.S. law \n     intended to prevent nuclear proliferation and nuclear \n     terrorism.\n       During the past 25 years, an international effort led by \n     the U.S. has succeeded at sharply reducing civilian HEU \n     commerce. In 1978, the U.S. created the Reduced Enrichment \n     for Research and Test Reactors (RERTR) program at Argonne \n     National Laboratory. In 1980, the UN endorsed the conversion \n     of existing reactors in its International Nuclear Fuel Cycle \n     Evaluation. In 1986, the NRC ordered the phase-out of HEU at \n     licensed facilities. Also in 1986, the RERTR program began \n     work on converting isotope production. And in 1992, the \n     Schumer amendment was enacted. All of these far-sighted \n     efforts were undertaken well in advance of the concrete \n     manifestation of the terrorist intent to wreak mass \n     destruction that our country experienced on September 11, \n     2001. For Congress now to undermine this longstanding U.S. \n     effort to prevent nuclear terrorism flies in the face of the \n     Bush Administration's stated determination to protect our \n     country from weapons of mass destruction.\n       For over forty years PSR physicians have dedicated \n     themselves to protecting public health and opposing spread of \n     nuclear weapons and material. We strongly oppose current \n     efforts to repeal part of the Schumer Amendment to relax \n     export controls on nuclear-weapon grade material because be \n     believe that rather than ensuring the supply of medical \n     isotopes, the main effect of section 621 would be to \n     perpetuate dangerous commerce in bomb-grade uranium and \n     increase the risk that this material will find its way into \n     terrorist hands. We urge you to support the amendment offered \n     by Senators Schumer and Kyl, maintaining important \n     proliferation controls and safeguarding the medical isotope \n     needs of Americans.\n       Thank you for your attention to this important national \n     security matter. PSR physicians stand ready to provide \n     further information upon request.\n       Sincerely,\n\n                                          John O. Pastore M.D.\n\n                                                        President,\n                   President Physicians for Social Responsibility.\n\n                                  Robert K. Musil, Ph.D., MPH,\n\n                                       Executive Director and CEO,\n                             Physicians for Social Responsibility.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will quote a couple lines from this letter. \nI appreciate the comments of my colleague from North Carolina. I am \ntempted--I do not know if he is a poker player--to use that old phrase, \n``I will see you one and call you here,'' talking about the number of \npeople who are supportive. We have a letter from 30,000 physicians. \nThat letter is in the Record and I will quote from it briefly.\n\n[[Page S7244]]\n\n  The Physicians for Social Responsibility, representing 30,000 \nphysicians and health professionals nationwide, is writing to urge \nsupport for the Schumer amendment and opposition to the language \nsupported by the Senator from North Carolina.\n  As noted, the letter says:\n\n       As physicians and health care professionals, we support the \n     use of medical isotopes, but this legislation--\n\n  Meaning the legislation in the Energy bill--\n\n     is not necessary to ensure the supply of medical isotopes to \n     U.S. hospitals and clinics.\n       Under existing law, medical isotope production capacity has \n     grown to 250 percent of demand. In addition, no medical \n     isotope producer has ever been denied a shipment of HEU as a \n     result of the successful incentivization of efforts to \n     convert to LEU. The Schumer-Kyl amendment would guarantee \n     continued use of HEU to produce medical isotopes until LEU \n     substitutes are available, so long as foreign producers \n     cooperate on efforts to eventually convert to LEU when \n     possible.\n\n  It makes the point that under existing law, we have all the medical \nisotopes we need, but we also have something else. We have assurances \nfrom these producers that they are working with the United States to \neventually try to move away from using highly enriched uranium, which \nmakes nuclear bombs, and move instead to low-enriched uranium, when \nthat is possible.\n  The essence of the Schumer amendment is to retain that law because \nthe language that is in the bill right now eliminates that requirement \nof assurances. Why on Earth would we want to do that?\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Schumer amendment. I simply note \nthat if there is any confusion, after the Schumer amendment is \ndispensed with, the Kyl second-degree amendment will be automatically \nvoted on or adopted, and that provides for a study and a report to the \nCongress on the status of this situation so that instead of having \ncompeting claims by all of us, we will have a report upon which I think \nwe can all rely to help guide us in the future. In the meantime, it \nseems to me only to make sense to keep current law in effect.\n  Mr. President, might I inquire if there is more than 7 minutes \nremaining on the Schumer side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is precisely 7 minutes remaining on the \nSchumer side.\n  Mr. KYL. I leave it to the manager at this point to determine what to \ndo.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask, consistent with the unanimous \nconsent request, that we set the Schumer amendment aside for \nconsideration of the Sununu amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Sununu amendment has 30 minutes equally divided \nallotted under the unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 873\n\n  Mr. Sununu. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 873.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Sununu], for himself \n     and Mr. Wyden, proposes an amendment numbered 873.\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To strike the title relating to incentives for innovative \n                             technologies)\n\n       Beginning on page 756, strike line 1 and all that follows \n     through page 768, line 20.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Wyden. This is a very comprehensive energy \nbill. As I have said before on this floor and outside this Chamber, I \nthink it is probably much too comprehensive an energy bill; there is \ntoo much in it; it is too large; it spends too much money. There are \nauthorizations. There is mandatory spending. We, unfortunately, voted \nto waive the budget limitations in our budget resolution earlier today. \nThere is an $11 billion tax package that creates all manner of \nincentives and subsidies for producing energy.\n  It is time that we exercise just a little bit of restraint, and the \namendment I offer this afternoon with Senator Wyden would do just that \nin one particular area, and that is in the area of loan guarantees for \nbuilding new powerplants.\n  We need a competitive energy sector including nuclear power, coal, \ngas, hydroelectric, solar, and wind. And we should do everything \npossible to establish a competitive marketplace that avoids trying to \npick winners and losers in that energy production marketplace. \nUnfortunately, in too many areas, this bill fails to do so.\n  In particular, this title provides loan guarantees--taxpayer \nsubsidized loan guarantees--for building new privately owned \npowerplants. That simply is not sound economic policy, sound fiscal \npolicy, or sound energy policy. They could be coal plants. They could \nbe nuclear plants. They could be renewable energy plants.\n  Over the course of the 5-year authorization in this bill, the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that nearly $4 billion worth of \nloan guarantees will be offered at a cost to the taxpayers of $400 \nmillion. But the potential cost could be much higher because the \nFederal Government and the taxpayers would be on the hook for the full \nsubsidy, the full cost of those loans.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says the following in their report on \nthe Energy bill:\n\n       Under the bill, the Department of Energy could sell, \n     manage, or hire contractors to take over a facility to recoup \n     losses in the event of a default or it could take over a loan \n     and make payments on behalf of the borrowers.\n\n  These are private sector borrowers.\n\n       Such payments could result in the Department of Energy--\n\n  That is the Federal Government and the taxpayers--\n\n     effectively providing a direct loan with as much as a 100-\n     percent subsidy rate.\n\n  That just is not sound economic policy. The administration, through \nits budget office, states that ``the administration is concerned about \nthe potential cost of the bill's new Department of Energy programs to \nprovide 100 percent federally guaranteed loans for a wide range of \ncommercial or near commercial technologies.''\n  Therein lies the heart of the problem. We are subsidizing, providing \nloan guarantees for privately owned and operated and profitable \npowerplants, whether coal or nuclear or renewable energy. It is not \nsound economic policy. Our amendment simply strikes this portion of the \nbill.\n  There is still $11 billion in tax subsidies to every conceivable kind \nof energy production. There is still an 8-billion-gallon mandate to \npurchase ethanol and it still contains a taxpayer subsidy for ethanol. \nThis does not touch the electricity title. It does not touch the \nauthorization for the clean coal technologies or fossil fuel research \nand development or other areas in the bill that provide subsidies to \nsuccessful private companies. We are just trying to target this loan \nguarantee which just does not make any sense. It would be a new \nprogram. It is a terrible precedent, putting the taxpayers on the hook \nfor billion-dollar loans to successful private profitable corporations.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is supported by a \nnumber of taxpayer groups concerned about the size and scope of \nGovernment--Taxpayers for Common Sense and National Taxpayers Union. It \nalso is supported by the Sierra Club and a host of other environmental \ngroups that are focused on good environmental policy as well as good \nenergy policy.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to reject the \nSununu-Wyden bill and support the Domenici-Bingaman bill. The provision \nthe Senator seeks to strike is one of the most innovative and one of \nthe crucially important parts of the legislation. As I will explain in \na minute, it is not a free ride, and it costs the Government nothing. \nIt scores at 0. It is constructed in conformance with the Federal \nCredit Reform Act.\n  Let me explain the amendment and, in doing so, I am doing it on \nbehalf of the chairman of the committee, Senator Domenici. This is his \nidea. It is an idea to help us jump-start legislation which we have \nprobably come to think of as a clean energy bill, as a bill which \ntransforms the way we produce electricity in the United States, puts us \non\n\n[[Page S7245]]\n\na path toward low-carbon and no-carbon electricity, and involves, in \ndoing so, using a number of new technologies, technologies that are not \nyet commercially proven.\n  For example, in our legislation, the Domenici-Bingham clean energy \nlegislation, we talk about more efficient coal plants. We talk about \ncarbon sequestration, a technology which has not yet been fully \ndemonstrated. We talk about advanced nuclear plants, plants that are of \nthe next generation of nuclear plants. We talk about new forms of \nsolar. Solar has a very limited use in the United States, but there is \nsome exciting new technology there. We talk about new biomass and \nhybrid cars, a technology which is just beginning to emerge.\n  One of the largest and most important of these new technologies is \nwhat we call IGCC, or clean coal gasification, the idea of using coal, \nof which we have hundreds of years supply, to turn it into gas. I will \nsay more about that in a minute. We have higher efficiency natural gas \nturbines, a hydrogen economy. We are quite a bit away from there, and \nresearch and development is important for that.\n  We are excited about these incredible potential new technologies, and \nour goal here is to jump-start these technologies, get them into the \nmarketplace--only new technologies, only technologies that are not \ncommercially viable--and then we step back and get out of the way.\n  That is not just the idea of our Energy Committee, which voted 21 to \n1 for a bill that contains this provision and heard a great amount of \ntestimony, it is the idea, for example, of the bipartisan National \nCommission on Energy Policy, which pointed out that the energy \nchallenges faced by the United States mean many new technologies and, \nunfortunately, ``both public and private investments in research and \ndevelopment, demonstration and early deployment of advanced energy \ntechnologies have been falling short of what is likely to be needed to \nmake these technologies available in the time frames and on the scales \nrequired.''\n  We have since World War II invested in research and development. Half \nour new jobs since World War II, according to the National Academy of \nSciences, have come from research and development. Our R, our \nscientific capacity, is our cutting edge advantage. If we do not, for \nexample, help launch a handful of new clean coal gasification plants, \nif we do not, for example, invest in the next generation of nuclear \nplants, they either will not happen or they will happen so slowly that \nwe do not get on the path we intend to be on.\n  In conclusion, let me point out exactly what we are talking about. \nThis title is limited to technologies that are not commercial, that are \nnot in general use. These technologies have to avoid reduced or \nsequestered air pollutants or manmade greenhouse gases, and the \ntechnology has to be new or significantly improved over what is \navailable today in the marketplace.\n  In addition, this is not a free ride. The guarantees can only be for \n80 percent of the cost of the project. The developers will share the \nrisk.\n  More important, the program is constructed in accordance with the \nFederal Credit Reform Act and it costs the Government nothing. In every \ncase, the cost of the guarantee has to be paid in advance. It could be \ndone through appropriations, but that would have to be decided each \ntime. But in most cases it will be done because the project sponsors \nwill simply write a check to the Federal Treasury before the guarantee \nis issued. These payments are calculated based upon the risk that any \none of the guaranteed loans might go into default--that always could \nhappen--so that the amount collected will be sufficient to pay off that \nportion of the loans that do default.\n  In other words, it is in the form of an insurance premium that takes \ninto account, actuarially, what the defaults might be should there be \nany.\n  This is not new. The Federal Credit Reform Act has been on the books \nsince 1990. It applies across the Government, and I want to emphasize \nthis key point: The provision scores at zero. Only if Congress later \ndecides to appropriate money for the program will it cost anything.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, let me respond briefly just to a couple of \npoints there. There was a lot of discussion at the end of Senator \nAlexander's remarks about the credit law and scoring and the suggestion \nthat this scores at zero.\n  This scores at zero cost, as we stand here on the Senate floor, \nbecause no loans have been issued. So, obviously, it scores at zero. To \nsay that, and to suggest to the American taxpayers that there won't be \nany liability or any cost to this program is absolutely outrageous.\n  This is a program that does authorize, No. 1, no limit of the number \nof loans that could be offered; no limit in the total principal that \ncould be put at risk. The Congressional Budget Office estimates $3.75 \nbillion in loans over the 5 years. Yes, when you use our credit law, \nthat would mean $400 million in appropriations. But to say it scores at \nnothing, as if this is a program with no cost or risk to the taxpayer, \nis absolutely misleading.\n  We need to be clearer about what this program really does and does \nnot do. There are no limits on the number of projects, no limits on the \nprincipal that could be guaranteed, and it certainly does authorize a \nprogram that puts the taxpayers at risk.\n  At this time I yield to my cosponsor on this amendment, Senator \nWyden.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, before the Senator from Oregon speaks, \ncould I ask what time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 8\\1/2\\ \nminutes; the time in opposition is 9\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 5 minutes and \nthen allow my friend and colleague to conclude on behalf of the Sununu-\nWyden amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Hampshire yield 5 \nminutes?\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Sununu-Wyden \namendment to strike the so-called incentives title of this legislation \nbecause I believe this title is a blank check for boondoggles. The fact \nis, we are now at the point when some of the special interests in this \ncountry are going to be triple-dipping. They are going to get tax \nincentives as a result of the tax cut; they are going to get loan \nguarantees under the amendment of the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska; and this amendment, this section that we seek to strike, \noffers additional loan guarantees.\n  These loan guarantees are not only costly, they are also risky. \nAmerican taxpayers would be required, under title XIV, to subsidize as \nmuch as 80 percent of the cost of constructing and operating new and \nuntried technologies. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the \nrisk of default on these projects funded by guarantees is between 20 \npercent and 60 percent. The amendment that Senator Sununu and I offer \ntoday would block this unwise and risky investment and stop throwing \ngood taxpayer money after bad.\n  I see our friend from Tennessee is here. He heard me discuss this to \nsome extent in the Energy Committee. I have believed that this \nlegislation is already stuffed with a smorgasbord of subsidies for \nvarious industries. As I touched on earlier, the buffet of subsidies is \nso generously larded that you are going to have industries in this \ncountry come back for seconds and even third helpings from this \ntaxpayer-subsidized buffet table.\n  You look for examples: the Hagel amendment, which provides secured \nloan guarantees for virtually the same projects and technologies as \ntitle XIV loan guarantees; coal gasification, advanced nuclear power \nprojects, and renewable projects receive up to 25 percent of their \nestimated costs for construction activity, acquisition of land and \nfinancing. There is no need to double the subsidies for these projects \nwith the incentives under title XIV as well.\n  I want to be clear. I am not against incentives for new technologies. \nThat is why, as a member of the Finance Committee, I supported the \nenergy tax title that provides tax benefits for a variety of energy \ntechnologies, ranging\n\n[[Page S7246]]\n\nfrom fuel cells and renewable technologies to fossil fuel and nuclear \nenergy. So I am already one who has voted, at this point in the debate, \nto say that we ought to have some incentives with respect to these \npromising industries.\n  But what concerns me is the double- and triple-dipping. There is an \nimportant difference between the tax incentives that I supported in the \nFinance Committee and the loan guarantees under title XIV. The tax \nincentives that were produced on a bipartisan basis in the Finance \nCommittee reward those who produce or save energy. By contrast, the \nloan guarantees subsidize projects whether they produce energy or not.\n  As I mentioned, the Congressional Budget Office says there is a very \nsubstantial risk of failure. I might even be persuaded to go along with \nthe 25-percent subsidy provided by the Hagel amendment to help kick-\nstart new energy technologies, but I don't think it is a wise use of \ntaxpayer money to provide up to an 80-percent subsidy for the very same \nprojects that would also get a 25-percent subsidy under the Hagel \namendment.\n  Just with that example alone, you are talking about some projects \nthat would receive a subsidy of 105 percent.\n  With respect to who reaps the benefits from these extraordinary loan \nguarantees, we know a variety of interests would. In my area of the \ncountry, we still remember WPPSS, the nuclear powerplants where there \nwas a huge default and we had many ratepayers very hard hit. Our \nratepayers are still paying the bills for the powerplants that were \nplanned years ago but were never built. Skyrocketing cost overruns led \nto defaults. The collapse shows that Federal loan guarantees are a \ngamble that taxpayers should not be forced to take.\n  I am very hopeful my colleagues will support the Sununu-Wyden \namendment. At this point, I think it is fair to say that we have voted \nfor multiple subsidies for a lot of the industries that we hope will \nhelp to some degree cure this country's addiction to foreign oil. But \nat some point the level of subsidies ought to stop. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment, and I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I don't know that all has been said, but \nmost nearly all has been said. Let me speak briefly about the Sununu \namendment.\n  If I have heard it once I have heard it a lot of times in the last \nfew years: Oh, we need new technology. We need innovation. We need \nclean energy. All of those kinds of things are at the threshold of the \nAmerican consumer's opportunity: Sequestration of carbon, new nuclear \ntechnology, biomass, hybrid cars--some of those are beginning to enter \nthe market--coal gasification--here we have a very large part of our \nenergy being supplied by coal; we want to clean it up so we can \ncontinue to use it--high, efficient natural gas turbines, hydrogen, and \non and on and on.\n  New technologies are wonderful, but sometimes it is very hard to get \nthem started, get them into the marketplace, allow them to be \nmainstreamed, create the cost effectiveness, the duplication, and \nmultiplying effects that occur in the marketplace. That is why, in \nworking this major piece of energy legislation for our country, we \nlooked at incentives. We also looked at assuring that we protect the \nAmerican taxpayer, who is also now, because we failed over the last 5 \nyears to develop an energy policy, being taxed at the pump higher than \nany of these incentives would ever tax them. Yet we have some who would \nsuggest that this is simply the wrong approach--to add some incentive, \nto build guarantees, to do that which assures that we can mainstream a \nvariety of these technologies, that we can become increasingly self-\nsufficient.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is right, and he has explained it very \nwell. Many of these are scored as zero, not because the loan has not \nbeen made but because the cost of the guarantee is paid by the person \ntaking out the loan.\n  So this is clearly, here, the right thing that is being done, and \nthat does not mean that the Government of our country, our taxpayers, \nis ``off the hook.'' It doesn't mean that at all. It means right now \nthey are on the hook and paying through the nose for high-cost energy \nbecause we have not done for the last 5 years what we are now trying to \ndo in this bill, and that is to build a new marketplace, new \nopportunities, clean technologies, get them into the marketplace, get \nthem working, mainstream them so America and American business can pick \nthem up and make them available to the American consumer.\n  I think it is a very important amendment. If you are for the Energy \nbill as it is before us, you must vote no on the Schumer amendment. It \nguts the very underlying premise of the bill. It is not a double-dip, \nit is not a triple-dip, it is a slam-dunk to defeat and destroy a very \nvaluable piece of legislation.\n  I hope my colleagues will oppose the Sununu amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, first I apologize to my colleague, Senator \nSchumer of New York. It was just a slip of the tongue by the Senator \nfrom Idaho, I am sure. Senator Schumer may be in trouble if he is \neasily confused with me when he goes back home to New York.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I do apologize. I do know the difference, and I apologize.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. No offense taken, but I would say, lightheartedly, that \nyou might wish to apologize to the Senator from New York.\n  If the owners of these powerplants were paying the risk premium, then \nthe Congressional Budget Office would not estimate that in the year \n2006 there will have to be $85 million in appropriated taxpayer \nresources to support this program; or, in 2007, $85 million; or 2008, \n$85 million; or 2009, $85 million; or 2010, $60 million. The owners of \nthese powerplants are not picking up the risk. That money will have to \nbe appropriated because there will be risks borne by the Federal \nGovernment, by the taxpayer, when these loans are issued. To suggest \notherwise is to misunderstand how the program operates.\n  With regard to technology, let me close in response on this broad \npoint of our concerns for technology. I also would like to see new and \ninnovative technologies brought to the market. Only, when I talk about \nthe importance of those new technologies, I then do not hesitate to say \nI have confidence in the engineers and scientists and investors and \nfinancial people, working in the solar industry and nuclear industry \nand coal industry, to continue to develop new ideas and new \ntechnologies. I am not so arrogant, as an elected representative, or \nsomeone here in Washington, to think that only someone working in the \nDepartment of Energy in Washington, DC, can know or understand what \nkind of technologies are deserving of a billion-dollar loan subsidy or \na $500 million loan guarantee.\n  That is the problem with this kind of a program. It presumes that the \nonly people who understand technology and innovation and how it might \nmake a contribution to our energy markets and our environment reside in \nWashington. That is wrong.\n  We need more competitive markets. We need to do something about the \ncosts of regulation, but we do not need to put the taxpayers on the \nhook for billions of dollars in loan guarantees for privately owned and \noperated powerplants that are operated by successful, profitable \ncorporations. I wish them well, I want to see them compete, but I do \nnot want to put taxpayers on the hook for the cost.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment that is endorsed and \nsupported by those concerned about the cost to the Federal budget as \nwell as those concerned about the environment.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would hope that timewise, all time could \nbe used on the Sununu amendment, understanding there is still a minute \nto close at the time of the vote and that we can return now to the \nSchumer amendment. Senator Bond is on the Senate floor, and he could \nutilize his 7 minutes prior to Senator Schumer utilizing his 7 minutes \nin closure so we could bring these two amendments to a close and to a \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back the time in opposition \nto the Sununu amendment?\n\n[[Page S7247]]\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. We have no objection. I yield back time on our side.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 810\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). There are now 7 minutes per side \non the Schumer amendment.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment \nby Senator Schumer and Senator Kyl to prevent cancer patients from \ngetting the cancer medicine they need. Both Senator Schumer's first-\ndegree amendment and Senator Kyl's second-degree amendment would strip \nprovisions we put in the Energy bill to ensure cancer patients continue \nto have a reliable and affordable source of cancer medicine. We cannot \ndo this to our cancer patients.\n  Cancer is a scourge that affects millions of people across the Nation \nin each of our States and in many of our families. Cancer will strike \nover a million people this year, 30,000 in my home State of Missouri, \nand cancer will kill 12,000 Missourians this year. Cancer takes our \nmothers and fathers. Cancer takes our spouses, our children. But many \npeople beat cancer.\n  Section 621 of the Energy bill will help people beat cancer. Cancer \npatients beat cancer with nuclear medicines, also known as medical \nisotopes, to diagnose and treat their cancer. Doctors use slightly \nradioactive forms of iodine, xenon, and other substances to help them \nfind and diagnose breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, and \nother cancers. Doctors also use nuclear medicines to treat cancer \npatients fighting non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, thyroid cancer, and relieve \ncancer symptoms such as bone pain.\n  Andrew Euler, seen here, is a boy from the small town of Billings, \nMO, in my home State. Drew was 8 years old when cancer struck him. \nDrew's parents described the day the doctors told them that their son \nhad cancer as the most horrific experience of their lives. The Eulers \nlearned that cancer is the leading cause of death among children like \nDrew under 15 years of age. Thyroid cancer will strike 23,000 Americans \nthis year and take the lives of 1,400 children and adults.\n  With the help from the fine cancer doctors at Washington University \nin St. Louis, Drew underwent surgery and received doses of nuclear \nmedicine in the form of radioactive iodine to treat his cancer. Drew, I \nam happy to say, is now cancer free, living a normal teenage life of \nbasketball, skateboarding, and swimming. Having good doctors and access \nto medicine is a blessing too many take for granted. Drew and many \nothers across the country are alive today because of the nuclear \nmedicine administered after his surgery.\n  Section 621 of the Energy bill, which Senator Burr and I authored, \nwill ensure that cancer patients like Drew can continue to get and \nafford the cancer medicine they need.\n  This provision is needed because the Atomic Energy Act requires \nindustry to change the way they make nuclear medicines. The law \nrequires a shift from highly enriched uranium, HEU, to low enriched \nuranium, LEU. I have no problem with the switch. Indeed, our energy \nprovisions encourage this switch. What I have a problem with is that \ncurrent law makes no accommodation for supply disruptions or \naffordability. That means cancer patients might not get their medicine.\n  Currently, law was written that way to address fuel for nuclear \nreactors but is now being applied to nuclear medicine. It would force a \npremature switch in the nuclear medicine production process before we \nhave a feasible and affordable alternative. That would mean cancer \npatients could not get the medicine they need at prices they could \nafford. Section 621 still requires a production changeover but not \nbefore we know that patients will retain affordable access to their \nmedicine.\n  Unfortunately, well-meaning stakeholders want to strip this cancer \nmedicine provision from the bill. Opponents of this provision somehow \nthink that making the cancer medicine that helped cure Drew will help \nterrorists build a bomb, but that is simply not the case. The nuclear \nmedicine production process is highly regulated by the U.S. Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission. Raw material shipments of HEU are conducted \nunder strict Government requirements, including armed guards. These \nshipments go to Canada and back because no U.S. reactor is designed to \nmake medical isotopes. We send HEU because that is the only raw \nmaterial target that the Canadian reactor can accept.\n  In the post-9/11 world, we are obliged to take this concern \nseriously, check it out, and see whether it is valid. I can assure my \ncolleagues that the concern is not one we have to worry about. Homeland \nsecurity is fully protected in the production of nuclear medicines. No \none has to take my word for it. We wrote to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission to ask them whether the shipment of HEU to Canada endangers \nhomeland security. The NRC said it did not. Indeed, they said:\n\n       The NRC continues to believe that the current regulatory \n     structure for export of HEU provides reasonable assurance \n     that the public health and safety and the environment will be \n     adequately protected and that these exports will also not be \n     inimical to the common defense and security of the United \n     States.\n\n  The full response is for official use only, so I cannot describe it \non the Senate floor. This has been cleared. I will be happy to share \nthe full response with any Senator who wishes to see it.\n  There are other smaller issues raised by stakeholders that are \naddressed in our provision. The section only applies to nuclear \nmedicine production, not reactor fuel. It allows HEU so long as there \nis no feasible and affordable alternative. Once the Department of \nEnergy finds that a feasible and affordable alternative exists, then \nthe switch occurs and the provision sunsets.\n  These provisions sound reasonable because they are the outcome of a \ncompromise. Section 621 represents a compromise reached in the Energy \nbill in the last Congress. Indeed, this section has garnered nothing \nbut unanimous approval as it has gone through the committee process. \nThe Energy Committee approved it unanimously during their markup. My \ncolleagues on the Environment Committee approved this section \nunanimously last Congress and again this Congress. Members of the \nmedical community support this provision and strongly oppose attempts \nto strike it such as the Schumer and Kyl amendments. These groups \ninclude: The National Association of Cancer Patients, American College \nof Nuclear Physicians, American College of Radiology, American Society \nof Nuclear Cardiology, Council on Radionuclides and \nRadiopharmaceuticals, National Association of Nuclear Pharmacies, and \nSociety of Nuclear Medicine.\n  Of course, Drew Euler supports this provision. He is alive today \nbecause of nuclear medicines. Drew got the medicine he needed. I hope \nthe Senate will act today to ensure that cancer patients continue to \nget the medicine they need. I ask my colleagues to oppose the Schumer \nand Kyl amendments.\n  I yield such time as remains to my colleague from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator and would only make this \npoint. Some have made the accusation that this legislation weakens \nexisting law. Let me point out to my colleagues item 7 in the language, \ntermination of review:\n\n       After the Secretary submits a certification under paragraph \n     (6), the Commission shall, by rule, terminate its review of \n     export license applications under this subsection.\n\n  This does fulfill the national security. It is reassured by the \nNuclear Control Institute and the person who is most outspoken, Alan \nKuperman. Ironically, he says this amendment, originally drafted to \npave the way to continued HEU exports, would actually do away with \nthem. We would go to LEU faster, is his conclusion.\n  We urge our colleagues to oppose the Schumer amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is now my understanding that Senator Schumer will \nclose, and the 7 minutes remaining includes the 2 that had been \nallotted in the original UC.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am going to take 3\\1/2\\ minutes and yield the closing \n3\\1/2\\ minutes to my colleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n[[Page S7248]]\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, again, the argument is simple: Do we want \nnuclear proliferation? If we do, we allow highly enriched uranium to be \nfloating around the world with very few checks.\n  There is no issue of health. Let me repeat: Everyone, every single \nperson in this country and in other countries who needs isotopes has \ngotten them. Let me quote from Physicians for Social Responsibility, a \ngroup that has been involved: Contrary to its stated intent, section \n621, the new section added to this bill, would do nothing to ensure the \nsupply of medical isotopes to the United States because that supply is \nnot currently endangered by restrictions on exports of HEU.\n  So the bottom line is simple: We want sick people to get these \nisotopes. They are all getting them. But why do we have to trade away \nthe ability to prevent highly enriched uranium from proliferating \naround the world? God forbid the consequences to our country if a \nterrorist steals such uranium or it gets lost.\n  No U.S. firm has any interest in this. It is one Canadian firm that \ndoes not want to pay the extra price that other firms have been paying \nto require foreign countries to convert from HEU, highly enriched \nuranium, which can be used for weapons, to low-grade uranium, LEU, \nwhich cannot.\n  So the argument is simple. There are a large number of organizations \nthat support our amendment, many of them concerned with nuclear \nproliferation and, of course, organizations concerned with health such \nas Physicians for Social Responsibility.\n  The argument is clear-cut. This amendment never should have been put \nin the Energy bill. The policy that our country has had for the last 12 \nyears has been working very well, and we have had our cake and eaten \nit, too. Everyone gets isotopes, and various reactors and foreign \ncountries are required to convert from HEU to LEU. Right now, we are \nworried about Iran. We are worried about North Korea. We are worried \nabout terrorists stealing weapons-grade uranium, and we are now doing \nsomething here, mainly at the behest of one Canadian company, to allow \nmore of that uranium out on the market.\n  If my friends on the other side could point to a single person who is \ndenied the isotope they need for health purposes, they might have an \nargument, but they do not. The argument is simple: the cost to one \nCanadian company versus our ability to prevent weapons-grade uranium, \nhighly enriched uranium, from proliferating around the world.\n  I hope we will go back to present law, stay with present law, stick \nto the law that has been supported by both administrations, Republican \nand Democrat, and prevent the danger of nuclear terrorism from getting \nany greater than it is.\n  I yield my remaining time to my colleague and friend from Arizona, \nJon Kyl. \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, my colleagues first should be astonished that \nSenator Schumer and I are in total agreement on something, and I cannot \nwait to tell them why and hope that will persuade them that if the \nSenator from New York and I are in agreement on something, there must \nbe something to it. Indeed, both Senator Schumer and I have been very \nstrong advocates against proliferation of nuclear material.\n\n  The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator \nLugar, is strongly in agreement with the position that Senator Schumer \nand I are taking. He will be listed as one of the people in support of \nthe Schumer-Kyl approach. No one has fought this harder than Senator \nLugar. We are all familiar with the Nunn-Lugar work.\n  The reason Senator Lugar is so strongly supportive, the reason \nmembers of the Democratic Party are so strongly supportive, the reason \npeople who have been involved in national defense and proliferation on \nnuclear issues from day one, like myself, are so concerned about this \nis that we are in danger, unless this amendment passes, of changing a \nlaw that has helped us to control proliferation of nuclear material. \nWhy would we want to change the law?\n  Since 1992, our law has enabled us to export highly enriched uranium, \nfrom which you can make bombs, as long as there is an assurance that \nthe recipient is cooperating with us in trying to control \nproliferation; in this case, trying to eventually move to low-enriched \nuranium. We would all love to be able to move to low-enriched uranium \nto produce, for example medical isotopes. That is why we are so \nconcerned.\n  The language in the bill, unfortunately, removes the requirement for \nthat cooperation. Why would we want to do that? Because one Canadian \ncompany is concerned about the cost. That shouldn't even be a concern \nbecause today the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issues these export \nlicenses and one of their considerations is cost. They have already \nmade the decision that this is not an issue for the issuance of a \nlicense.\n  Has one license ever been denied? Never. None. It is a false choice \nto suggest somebody is going to be denied medical treatment, a little \nboy or a little girl or anybody else, if this amendment is adopted. \nSince 1992, nobody has been denied treatment with medical isotopes. The \nlaw has permitted the development of this kind of treatment, and there \nis nothing to suggest that it will not continue.\n  The law does something else, too. It requires assurances that the \npeople who are producing this are working with us to eventually try to \nconvert to low-enriched uranium. What does the Department of Energy say \nabout that? The Department of Energy, on its Web site dealing with this \nsubject with regard to current law, says this law has been very helpful \nin persuading a number of research reactors to convert to low-enriched \nuranium.\n  Why, if we have a law that has never denied any license and has \npermitted the production of these isotopes for medical production and \nmoves us toward a nonproliferation, toward low-enriched uranium, why we \nwould want to scrap that and say we will do away with the requirement \nthat the companies work with the United States to work toward low-\nenriched uranium? It makes no sense at all.\n  That is why the group of physicians I cited earlier is in support of \nthe current law. It is why the Department of Energy Web site notes the \nfact that the current law is working well.\n  I ask my colleagues, in summary, this question: If ever a terrorist \ngroup gets a hold of this high-enriched uranium and builds a bomb \nbecause we eliminated this requirement for no particular purpose, what \nare we going to say about that? Let's retain the existing law the \nDepartment of Energy believes has been working. Nobody is denied \nmedical treatment as a result of this law.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Schumer amendment. Please support \nthe Schumer amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays were previously ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, if Chairman Domenici were here tonight, \nhe would urge our colleagues to oppose the Sununu amendment because it \nis critical to this clean energy bill. If we want lower natural gas \nprices, we need new technologies for carbon sequestration, for advanced \nnuclear, for solar, for biomass, and for hybrid vehicles. We need to \ninvest in these options and jump start them. We have done that \nthroughout our history in America. That is our secret weapon, our \nscience and technology, research and development. Chairman Domenici \nlikes the existing provision because this is for new technology. It is \nnot a free ride.\n  Chairman Domenici would urge Members, as I do, to vote no on Sununu-\nWyden because his existing provision jumpstarts new technologies for a \nclean energy bill from coal plants to sequestration to advanced nuclear \nto solar, new technologies not in general use. It costs the Government \nnothing, according to the scoring of the Congressional Budget Office. \nIt is like an insurance policy. The user of the guarantee pays the \npremium.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, there are nearly $4 billion in estimated \nloan guarantees over the next 5 years in this title. Those absolutely \nwill cost the Federal Government something. That is exactly why money, \n$400 million, has to be appropriated to support them.\n  I was pleased to work on this amendment with Senator Wyden to whom I \nyield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, when it comes to subsidies, without the \nSununu-Wyden amendment, some of the country's deepest pockets will be \ntriple-dipping. These industries get subsidies under the tax title from \nFinance. That is dip 1. The Hagel amendment, yesterday adopted, \nprovides loans. That is dip 2. Title XIV that we seek to strike \nprovides loan guarantees of up to 80 percent. That is dip 3. I urge \nSenators to join all the country's major environmental groups, all the \ncountry's major organizations representing taxpayer rights and support \nthe bipartisan Sununu-Wyden amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my amendment would simply add a reporting \nrequirement.\n  Current law--known as the Schumer amendment to the Energy Policy Act \nof 1992--is intended to phase out U.S. exports of highly enriched \nuranium in order to reduce the risk of that material being stolen by \nterrorists or diverted by proliferating states for nuclear weapons \nproduction.\n  The importance of phasing out these exports is glaringly obvious in \nthe post-September 11 world, as we are confronted with terrorist-\nsponsoring regimes, such as North Korea and Iran, that are intent on \ndeveloping nuclear weapons and terrorist organizations that would like \nnothing more than to attack the United States using a nuclear device.\n  Asked several years ago about suspicions that he is trying to obtain \nchemical and nuclear weapons, Osama bin Laden said:\n\n       If I seek to acquire such weapons, this is a religious \n     duty. How we use them is up to us.\n\n  U.S. law bars export of HEU for use as reactor fuel or as targets to \nproduce medical isotopes, except on an interim basis to facilities that \nare actively pursuing conversion to low-enriched uranium.\n  Because the United States is the world's primary supplier of HEU, the \nlaw also provides a strong incentive for such conversion, an objective \nthat is strongly supported by Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman's \nrecent statement that, ``We should set a goal of working to end the \ncommercial use of highly enriched uranium in research reactors.''\n  Why is this important? Unlike highly enriched uranium, low-enriched \nuranium cannot be used as the core of a nuclear bomb.\n  Section 621 of the pending bill would essentially exempt HEU exports \nto five countries for medical isotope production from the standards set \nby the 1992 Schumer amendment. If enacted, it would allow foreign \ncompanies to receive U.S. HEU for use in medical isotope production \n``targets'' without having to commit to converting to low-enriched \nuranium.\n  Specifically, for export license approval, the new language requires \nonly a determination that the HEU will be irradiated in a reactor in a \nrecipient country that ``is the subject of an agreement with the United \nStates Government to convert to an alternative nuclear reactor fuel \nwhen such fuel can be used in that reactor.''\n  In contrast, current law requires the proposed recipient of a U.S. \nHEU export to provide ``assurances that, whenever an alternative \nnuclear reactor fuel or target can be used in that reactor, it will use \nthat alternative in lieu of highly enriched uranium.'' In addition, \ncurrent law permits such exports only if ``the United States government \nis actively developing an alternative nuclear reactor fuel or target \nthat can be used in that reactor,'' which requires the proposed \nrecipient to actively cooperate with the United States on conversion.\n  This is a difficult distinction, so let me be clear: current law \nplaces restrictions on exports of targets and fuel, and the Energy bill \nexempts targets from these restrictions. How are fuel and targets used? \nFuel is used to generate the chain reaction that powers a reactor; a \ntarget is a mass of fissionable material that is irradiated to produce \na medical isotope. The target is inserted in an operating reactor and \nthen withdrawn after it has been irradiated.\n  This change would allow countries to avoid ever having to move to an \nLEU target, even if it is technically feasible to do so.\n  Furthermore, four of the five countries to which the Energy bill's \nexemption would apply are members of the European Union and, therefore, \nU.S. exports of HEU to them would be subject to the requirements of the \nU.S.-EURATOM Agreement on Nuclear Cooperation.\n  Under that agreement, EURATOM countries are not required to inform \nthe United States of retransfers of U.S. supplied materials from one \nEURATOM country to another or report on alterations to U.S. supplied \nmaterials. As such U.S. HEU--once transferred to one of these four \ncountries--can go anywhere else in the EU. Given EU expansion, it is \nnot difficult to imagine the concern this creates. The Energy bill \nlanguage ostensibly exempts only five countries from current law; in \npractice, the number is much larger.\n  This is all the more reason not to remove the incentive to convert to \nLEU.\n  One of the gravest threats we face today is the possibility that a \nterrorist will obtain nuclear material and use it in an attack against \nthe United States. It simply makes no sense to loosen our own \nrestrictions on the export of nuclear weapon-grade uranium to countries \nwhere we do not have direct control over its security.\n  Proponents of the new language contained in the Energy bill argue \nthat weakening current law is needed to ensure the continued supply of \nmedical isotopes--for the diagnosis and treatment of sick patients--and \nthat this reality justifies any increased proliferation risk. They \nclaim that there is a danger we will run out of these isotopes.\n  But we have seen no compelling evidence that the United States is in \ndanger of running out of medical isotopes. Our main supplier--a \nCanadian company called Nordion--has stockpiled over 50 kg of U.S.-\norigin HEU, which is enough to make one simple nuclear bomb or two more \nsophisticated bombs. Indeed, Nordion has enough U.S.-origin bomb-grade \nuranium to produce medical isotopes for the next three to four years. \n[Source: Union of Concerned Scientists and the Nuclear Control \nInstitute]\n  Supporters of the language in the Energy bill seem to be concerned \nthat Nordion will cut off from U.S.-HEU exports and that will result in \nan isotope deficiency. But that claim does not mesh with the facts. \nNordion produces about 40 percent of the world's supply of medical \nisotopes today; worldwide production capacity is 25 percent of current \nwordwide demand.\n  That means that, even without Nordion's medical isotopes, production \ncould still reach 210 percent of world demand.\n  Finally, it is important to note that no company has ever been denied \nan export license under the Schumer amendment for HEU to be used in \ntargets for medical isotope production AND current law has, as \nintended, incentivized countries to begin to convert to LEU. The \nNetherlands is one good example; conversion of that country's Petten \nreactor (to LEU fuel) is scheduled to be completed by 2006.\n  Senator Schumer's amendment, which I strongly support, strikes \nsection 621 of H.R. 6. Maintaining current law restrictions will ensure \nthat the United States plays an active role in encouraging other \ncountries to convert to using low-enriched uranium. All that they must \ndo in order to continue to receive U.S. HEU exports is agree to convert \nto low-enriched uranium--which cannot be used as the core of a nuclear \nbomb--when it becomes technically and economically possible to do so \nand actively cooperate with the United States on that conversion. This \nis not unreasonable.\n  And, as I mentioned, there is no danger of running out of medical \nisotopes at this time--the largest supplier to the United States \ncurrently has a surplus of U.S. HEU and worldwide maximum production \ncapacity is more than twice demand.\n  My second-degree amendment would simply add a requirement for a \nreport from the National Academy of Sciences. That report includes an \nanalysis of:\n  The effectiveness of current law (the Schumer amendment) in \ncompelling conversion to low-enriched uranium; the likely consequences \nwith respect to nonproliferation and antiterrorism initiatives of \nremoving current restrictions;\n  Whether implementation of current law has ever caused an interruption \nin\n\n[[Page S7251]]\n\nthe production and supply of medical isotopes to the U.S.; and\n  Whether the U.S. supply of isotopes is sufficiently diversified to \nwithstand an interruption of production from any one supplier.\n  It is prudent to conduct such a comprehensive study before we even \nconsider lifting the restrictions in current law, as opposed to after \nlifting them, as the Energy bill language would do.\n  The report would be due 18 months after enactment of the Energy bill. \nSo, even if Nordion were cut off from U.S. exports tomorrow, the due \ndate would be long before Nordion's surplus HEV runs out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 990), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we are going to move as quickly as we can. \nIt appears that we can complete all work on this bill tonight. We have \na few remaining amendments. I am going to offer a unanimous consent \nrequest at this time and, hopefully, we can cut the time down from it, \nif our colleagues will expedite their effort on behalf of these \namendments that are outstanding.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bond be \nrecognized in order to offer the Bond-Levin CAFE amendment No. 925; \nprovided further that the amendment be set aside and Senator Durbin be \nrecognized immediately to offer his CAFE amendment No. 902; provided \nfurther that there be 80 minutes of debate total to be used in relation \nto both amendments, with Senators Bond and/or his designee in control \nof 40 minutes, and Senator Durbin and/or his designee in control of 40 \nminutes.\n  I further ask that following the use or yielding back of time, the \nSenate proceed to a vote in relation to the Bond amendment, to be \nfollowed by a vote in relation to the Durbin Amendment, with no second \ndegrees in order to either amendment prior to the vote, and with 2 \nminutes equally divided for debate prior to the second vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chair. I trust that our colleagues are on the \nSenate floor.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Wednesday, June 23, 2005, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nSenators be added as cosponsors: Dodd, Cantwell, Lautenberg, Kennedy, \nReed of Rhode Island, and Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding, under the terms of \nthe agreement, that we have 40 minutes on our side, and there are 40 \nminutes under the control of Senators Bond or Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will start by reading a paragraph, but \nit is not from an environmental magazine or a political magazine or \nfrom a liberal magazine. It is from BusinessWeek, published in their \nmost recent online edition of June 20, entitled ``Energy; Ignoring the \nObvious Fix.'' I will read this paragraph because it describes where we \nare at this moment in time:\n\n       As Congress puts the final touches on a massive new energy \n     bill, lawmakers are about to blow it. That's because the \n     bill, which they hope to pass by the end of July, almost \n     certainly won't include the one policy initiative that could \n     seriously reduce America's dependence on foreign oil: A \n     government-mandated increase in the average fuel economy of \n     new cars, SUVs, light trucks and vans.\n\n  That is BusinessWeek. They say that Congress is about to blow it. \nSadly, BusinessWeek is correct because you can search this bill, page \nafter page, section after section, and find no reference to the obvious \nneed in America to increase the fuel efficiency of the cars and trucks \nthat we drive.\n  The amendment that I am proposing addresses the CAFE standards. This \namendment would result in more fuel-efficient vehicles in America. This \namendment would incrementally increase fuel economy standards in \nautomobiles over the next 10 years.\n  Regardless of what the opponents of this amendment say, technology is \navailable to reach these goals, the safety of our vehicles need not be \ncompromised in the process, and we don't have to lose American jobs in \norder to have safer, more fuel-efficient cars.\n  I suggest to those who have no faith in the innovative capacity of \nour Nation that America has risen to the challenge before. We can do it \nagain.\n  Before I explain my amendment and highlight why improving fuel \nefficiency would be a priority, let me read from a few headlines that \nmake this debate especially important.\n  This was in this week's Washington Post:\n\n       Gas price rises as oil hits a record high.\n\n  What was the dollar amount, the latest amount? It was $59.42 a \nbarrel--record high amounts for oil. In my State of Illinois, the \naverage price of gasoline is $2.16 per gallon.\n  From the Wall Street Journal, here is the big headline:\n\n       Big Thirst for Oil is Unslaked, Demand by U.S., China \n     Rises.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal says:\n\n       Oil consumption remains strong even as petroleum prices \n     approach $60 a barrel, sparking concerns that growing demand \n     could spur still-higher prices and further dampen economic \n     growth.\n\n  Philip Verleger, senior fellow at the Washington-based Institute for \nInternational Economics, says:\n\n       I can see oil at $90 a barrel by next March 31.\n\n  I have read from BusinessWeek. We understand their consideration of \nthis provision. They understand that if we do not deal with more fuel-\nefficient vehicles, we are ignoring the obvious.\n  I am offering this amendment to give my colleagues an opportunity to \nput America back on track, to reduce consumption of oil-based products \nby our transportation fleet by increasing fuel economy standards.\n  The BusinessWeek online piece continues:\n\n       If we don't act now, a crisis will probably force more \n     drastic action later.\n\n  I first say to my colleague following this debate, I wish them all a \nhappy 30th anniversary. It was 30 years ago we faced an energy crisis \nin America. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Energy Policy \nand Conservation Act that created the original CAFE program and \nresponded to that crisis.\n  Listen to these oil prices that brought America's economy to its \nknees 30 years ago. I am going back to October of 1973. The price of \noil rose from $3 a barrel to $5.11 per barrel, sending a shock across \nAmerica. By January, just a few months later, the prices were up to \n$11.65 a barrel. At the time, however, the United States was only \ndependent on foreign oil for 28 percent of its use. That percentage has \ngrown to 58 percent today.\n\n[[Page S7252]]\n\n  Put it in context: 30 years ago, 28 percent of our oil was coming \nfrom overseas, and we were dealing with $11 a barrel. Today, 58 percent \nis, and we are dealing with $59.60 a barrel, roughly speaking. So we \nhave seen a dramatic increase in our dependence, a dramatic increase in \nprice, and there is no reason to believe it is going to end. We are \ncaptives of OPEC and that cartel.\n  When Maria Cantwell came to the floor of the Senate and offered an \namendment to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil by 40 percent \nover the next 20 years, it was soundly defeated. I think only three \nRepublicans joined the Democrats who supported it.\n  To think we are overlooking in a debate on an energy bill dependence \non foreign oil and the inefficiency of cars and trucks tells you how \nirrelevant this debate is. Any serious debate about America's energy \nfuture would talk about our dependence--overdependence--on foreign oil \nand the fact that we continue to drive cars and trucks that are less \nfuel efficient every single year.\n  The recent prices that have shown up also create anxiety over oil \nexports from other producer nations. This past Friday, the United \nStates, Britain, and Germany closed their consulates in Nigeria, in its \nlargest city of Lagos, due to a threat from foreign Islamic militants. \nThe countries we are relying on for foreign oil are politically shaky, \nand we depend on them. If they do not provide the oil, our economy \nsuffers, and American families and consumers suffer.\n  In response to the 1973 oil embargo, Congress created the CAFE \nprogram and decided at the time to increase the new car fleet fuel \neconomy because it had declined from 14.8 miles per gallon in 1967 to \n12.9 miles per gallon in 1973.\n  Today we face even more embarrassing statistics. Today we consume \nmore than 3 gallons of oil per capita in the United States, whereas \nother industrialized countries consume 1.3 gallons per capita per day, \nand the world average is closer to a half a gallon per capita per day. \nWe use four times more oil than any nation.\n  The amendment I am proposing would increase passenger fuel economy \nstandards by 12.5 miles per gallon over the next 11 years, increasing \nfuel economy standards for nonpassenger vehicles by 6.5 miles per \ngallon in the same time period, for a combined fleet average of nearly \n34 miles per gallon. I am increasing it 5.3 miles per gallon over \ncurrent plans. Current NHTSA rulemaking would only raise it to 22.2 \nmiles per gallon by 2007.\n  The average mileage of U.S. passenger vehicles peaked in 1988 at 25.9 \nmiles per gallon and has fallen to an estimated 24.4 in 2004.\n  Let me show one chart which graphically demonstrates the sad reality. \nRemember the oil embargo I talked about, in 1973, the panic in America, \nthe demand that our manufacturers of automobiles increase the fuel \nefficiency of cars over the next 10 years? They screamed bloody murder. \nThey said the same things we are going to hear from my colleagues \ntonight in opposition to this amendment. They said if you want cars \nthat get so many miles per gallon over the next 10 years, America is \ngoing to be riding around in little dinky cars such as golf carts. I \nheard exactly the same words on the Senate floor today.\n  Furthermore, if you want more fuel-efficient cars, they are going to \nbe so darned dangerous, no family should ride in them. This is what our \nbig three said back in 1973: We can't do this; it is technologically \nimpossible. Frankly, if you do it, we are going to see more and more \nforeign cars coming into the United States.\n  Thank God Congress ignored them. We passed the CAFE standards. Looked \nwhat happened. Fuel-efficiency cars in a 10-year period went up to \ntheir highest levels. Now look what has happened since. It is flat or \ndeclining in some areas. It tells us, when we look at both cars and \ntrucks, that our fuel efficiency has been declining since 1985. How can \nthis be good for America? How can this make us less energy dependent? \nHow can this clean up air we breathe? It cannot.\n  People will come to the floor of the Senate today and say: We think \nevery American ought to buy and drive the most fuel-inefficient truck \nor car they choose, and if you do not stand by that, you are violating \nthe most basic American freedom. What about the freedoms that are at \nstake as we get in conflicts around the world with oil-producing \nnations?\n  If we want to preserve our freedoms, we should accept personal \nresponsibility as a nation, as families, and as individuals. Personal \nresponsibility says we need better cars and better trucks that are more \nfuel efficient. We need to challenge all manufacturers of cars and \ntrucks, foreign and domestic, to meet these standards so that we are \nnot warping the market, we are setting a standard for the whole market.\n  Unfortunately, there is strong opposition to this notion. Some of \nthose who oppose it have the most negative and backward view of \nAmerican technology that you can imagine.\n  We understand now from reliable scientific sources--in particular the \nNational Academy of Sciences--that we have technologies and can improve \nfuel efficiency of trucks by 50 to 65 percent and cars by 40 to 60 \npercent. But Detroit is so wedded to the concept of selling these \nmonster SUVs and big cars that they will not use it. They will not use \nthe technology that is currently there.\n  We are dealing now with hybrid technology. Let me tell a little story \nabout hybrid technology.\n  First let me tell you what we are dealing with on the overall \npicture. This chart shows U.S. consumption of oil in the transportation \nsector. As we can see, light-duty vehicles represent the biggest part \nof it--60 percent. It is a huge part.\n  We also have general oil consumption in America. If we want to reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil, we have to focus attention on \ntransportation--68 percent usage of the oil we import.\n  We know if we want to reduce dependence on foreign oil, this is what \nwe need to do. Here is a list of all the different technologies \ncurrently available. I won't read them all through but will make them \npart of the Record as part of my statement: transmission technology, \nengine technologies, vehicle technologies that could be used right now \nto make cars and trucks more efficient.\n  What is going to happen over a period of time, though, is we are \ngoing to see a lot of debate about different cars and different trucks. \nLet me show you one in particular. I just mentioned hybrid vehicles. My \nwife and I decided a few months ago to buy a new car. We wanted to buy \nAmerican. We did not need a big monster SUV. It is basically just the \ntwo of us and maybe a couple of other passengers. We wanted something \nAmerican and fuel efficient.\n  Go out and take a look. You will find there is one American-made car \non the market today that even cares about fuel efficiency--the Ford \nEscape hybrid. That is the only one. The others are made by \nmanufacturers around the world. It turns out they are not making too \nmany of these Ford Escape hybrids. In the first quarter of this year, \nFord made 5,274. Take a look at the competition. Japan again, sadly, \ngot the jump on us. When they came up with their Honda Accords and \nCivics, they ended up selling 9,317 and then 14,604 the first quarter. \nToyota was 13,602, and look at the number here: 34,225.\n  What I am telling you is, how could Detroit miss this? When we look \nat the big numbers, the total sales for these cars for hybrids sold, \ntotal hybrids sold in 2004 before we ended up having an American car on \nthe market was 83,000 vehicles. Where was Detroit? Where are they now? \nThe only place one can turn is a Ford Escape hybrid. What are they \nwaiting for? Do they want the Japanese to capture another major market \nbefore they even dip their toe in the water?\n  We have to understand that there is demand in America for more fuel-\nefficient cars. We also have to understand the technology is there to \ndramatically increase gas mileage. This Ford Escape hybrid my wife and \nI drive is getting a little better than 28 miles a gallon. I wish it \nwere a lot better. Sadly, some of the Japanese models are a lot better. \nAt least it is better than the average SUV by a long shot and better \nthan most cars we buy. They can do a lot better if Ford, General \nMotors, and Chrysler would wake up to the reality. Instead, they are \nstuck in the past. They are going to sell more this year of what they \nmade last year. They cannot\n\n[[Page S7253]]\n\njust look ahead as, unfortunately, their competitors in Japan have \ndone.\n  The National Research Council puts away this argument that we cannot \nhave a fuel-efficient car that is safe. The National Research Council's \nrecent report found that increases of 12 to 27 percent for cars and 25 \nto 42 percent for trucks were possible without any loss of performance \ncharacteristics or degradation of safety.\n\n  What we know now is that we have the technology to make a more fuel-\nefficient car. They do not have to be so dinky you would not want to \ndrive in them. They accommodate a family, and you do not compromise \nsafety in the process.\n  Look at history. The automobile industry in America has resisted \nchange for such a long time. I can remember as a college student when \nthey came out with all the exposes about the dangers of the Corvair. \nOh, Detroit just denied it completely. The auto industry, sadly, has \nfought against safety belts, airbags, fuel system integrity, mandatory \nrecalls, side impact protection, roof strength, and rollover standards. \nI am not surprised they are fighting against fuel efficiency, but I am \ndisappointed. They just don't get the marketplace. As the price of oil \ngoes up and the price of gas goes up, Americans want an alternative--a \nsafe car they can use for themselves and their family that is fuel \nefficient.\n  Let me talk about the loss of jobs. The argument is made that if we \nhave more fuel-efficient cars, we are just going to be giving away \nAmerican jobs. It comes from the same industry where General Motors \nannounced 2 weeks ago they were laying off 25,000 people, and Ford \nannounced they were laying off 1,700 this week. They have to see the \nwriting on the wall. Their current models are not serving the current \nmarket. Their sales are going down while the sales from foreign \nmanufacturers are going up.\n  There was an auto industry expert on NPR a few weeks ago, Maryann \nKeller. She said:\n\n       General Motors has been focused in the United States on big \n     SUVs and big pickup trucks. . . . It worked as long as gas \n     was cheap, but gas is not cheap . . . They really have not \n     paid attention to fuel economy technology, nor have they paid \n     attention to developing crossover vehicles which have better \n     fuel economy. They've just been very late to the party and \n     that's probably their primary problem today in the \n     marketplace.\n\n  We ought to ask the American people what they want. We are going to \nhear a lot of people stand up and say what they want. I will tell you \nwhat the latest polls say: 61 percent of Americans favor increasing \nfuel-efficiency requirements to 40 miles a gallon. They get it; they \nunderstand it. The problem is they can't buy it. If you want to buy an \nAmerican car that meets this goal in your family's mind, there is only \none out there. Some will come trailing along in a year or two, but the \nJapanese have beaten us to the punch again.\n  Let's create an incentive for Detroit and for Tokyo. Let's create an \nincentive for all manufacturers that are selling cars in the United \nStates, an incentive that lessens our dependence on foreign oil, cleans \nup the air, and gives us safe vehicles using new technology. Those who \nare convinced that America cannot rise to this challenge do not know \nthe same Nation I know. We can rise to it. We can succeed. We can meet \nour energy needs in the future by making good sense today in our energy \npolicy.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time have I consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has 22 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator for laying out so clearly \nthe fact that we are so dependent on foreign oil. If we really want to \ndo something about it--as the Senator has explained by the charts, it \nis clear that most of the oil that is consumed in America is consumed \nin the transportation sector and most of the oil that is consumed in \nthe transportation sector is consumed in our personal light vehicles. \nSo if we really want to do something about weaning ourselves from \ndependence on foreign oil, of which almost 60 percent of our daily \nconsumption of oil is coming from foreign shores, this is where we can \nmake a difference.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Florida is correct. I will tell him I \nknow what I am up against. I think the Senator from Florida, being a \nrealist, does too. When you have the major automobile manufacturers who \nare frightened by the challenge--they are afraid of this challenge. \nThey do not think they can meet it. They have been beaten to the punch \nby Japan when it comes the hybrid cars. Instead, they started talking \nabout hydrogen fuel vehicles. That may happen in my lifetime, but it is \njust as likely it will not happen in my lifetime. Instead of dealing \nwith hybrid vehicles that are already successful with consumers in \nAmerica, they are afraid of this challenge. Because they are afraid of \nthis challenge, they throw up all of these arguments: oh, that car is \ngoing to be a golf cart, it is going to be so tiny if it is fuel \nefficient, it is not going to be safe; there is just no way that \nAmerican engineers can even figure out how to make them.\n  I do not buy it. I think, as I said to the Senator and others who are \nlistening, the technology is there. We do not have to compromise \nsafety. What is wrong with the challenge? What is wrong with the \nchallenge from the President and the Congress asking the manufacturers \nselling cars in America to make them more fuel efficient? This \nlegislation does not do it; my amendment would.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Would it not be something if we could start to \nhave all new vehicles be required, in some way, to be hybrid and/or \nhigher miles per gallon standard, if that were combined with an \nadditional thing like ethanol into gasoline, ethanol that could be made \nmore cheaply, perhaps from prairie grass--that is on 31 million acres; \nall it needs to be is cut--instead of a more expensive process of corn, \nalthough that certainly is a good source of ethanol. Would we not start \nto see exponentially our ability to wean ourselves from dependence on \nforeign oil?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Florida has a vision that I share, and \nthat is alternative fuels, fuels that are renewable such as those the \nSenator has described, ethanol and biodiesel, and vehicles that do not \nuse as much fuel.\n  Senator Obama and I have a public meeting every Thursday morning, and \nthere was a real sad situation today. A group of parents brought in \nchildren with autism to talk about that terrible illness and the \nchallenges they face. More and more of that illness, and others, are \nbeing linked to mercury. Whether it is in a vaccine, I do not know; \nwhether it is in the air, most certainly it is. If we can reduce \nemissions by reducing the amount of fuel that we burn, would my \ncolleagues not believe we would be a healthier nation? Maybe there \nwould be fewer asthma victims. Maybe some of these poor kids who are \nafflicted with respiratory problems would be spared from them.\n  I cannot believe people can rationally stand on the Senate floor and \nsay what we need is to give Americans a choice of driving a car that \nburns gasoline and gets 6 miles per gallon; boy, that is the American \nway. Well, that is selfish. It really is. We ought to be looking at \nnational goals that bring us, as an American family, together to do the \nresponsible thing.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator for being so eloquent in \nlaying out what is a looming crisis. The crisis is going to hit us. We \nmay not suspect it. It may hit us in the way of radical Islamists \nsuddenly taking over major countries where those oilfields are, such as \nSaudi Arabia. If that occurs, Lord forbid. Then we are going to have a \ncrisis, and we are going to be wishing that we were not so dependent on \nforeign oil, as we are now.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator. I yield the floor and reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  I rise to address some of the lingering questions regarding Corporate \nAverage Fuel Economy, or CAFE standards. I was hoping this debate would \nnot be necessary because we have debated it, we have resolved it, we \nhave set a process in place, and it is working. Obviously, we are here \nagain. We have been through this CAFE debate in the 107th\n\n[[Page S7254]]\n\nand 108th Congresses, and with the Durbin amendment before us we get to \ngo through it once again in this Congress. Surely, my colleagues \nremember that both of the previous CAFE amendments in the last two \nCongresses were soundly defeated.\n  Why were they? Because Members of this body realize that CAFE is a \ncomplex issue that requires thought and scientific analysis, not just \npolitical rhetoric.\n  The Bond-Levin amendment that was passed in 2003 by a vote of 66 to \n30 requires the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or \nNHTSA, to increase CAFE standards as fast as technology becomes \navailable. It is a scientific test based on science, not politics.\n  We must recognize at the beginning that the Durbin amendment costs \nlives, costs U.S. jobs, and deprives consumers of their basic free will \nto choose the vehicle that best fits their needs and the needs of their \nfamilies. Neither the lives of drivers or passengers on our Nation's \nhighways nor the livelihood of autoworkers and their families should be \nplaced in jeopardy so Congress can arbitrarily increase infeasible and \nscientifically unjustified standards for fuel efficiency.\n  Any fuel efficiency standard that is administered poorly, without a \nsound scientific analysis, will have a damaging impact on automobile \nplants, suppliers, and the fine men and women who build these vehicles.\n  There have been many arguments that a large increase in CAFE \nstandards is needed to pressure automakers to invest in new \ntechnologies which will consistently increase automobile fuel \nefficiency. Automobile manufacturers already utilize advanced \ntechnology programs to ensure the improvement of fuel efficiency, the \nreduction of emissions and driver and passenger safety, and they are \nbeing pushed to do so by NHTSA regulations. Auto manufacturers are \nconstantly investing capital in advanced technology research by the \nintegration of new products, such as hybrid electric and alternative \nfuel vehicles and higher fuel efficiency vehicles. So far, the auto \nindustry has invested billions of dollars in developing and promoting \nthese new technologies. Diverting resources from further investments in \nthese programs in favor of arbitrarily higher CAFE standards would \nplace a stranglehold on the technological breakthroughs which are \nalready taking place.\n  Alternative fuels, such as biodiesel, ethanol, and natural gas, have \ncontinuously been developed to service a wide variety of vehicles. The \nautomotive industry continues to utilize breakthrough technology which \nfocuses on the development of advanced applied science to produce more \nfuel-efficient vehicles, while at the same time producing innovative \nsafety attributes for these vehicles.\n  Furthermore, modifications need time to be implemented. According to \nthe National Academy of Sciences:\n\n       Any policy that is implemented too aggressively (that is, \n     too much in too short a period of time) has the potential to \n     adversely affect manufacturers, suppliers, employees and \n     consumers.\n\n  The NAS further found that no car or truck can be prepared to reach \nthe 40 miles per gallon or 27.5-mile-per-gallon level required for \nfleets within 15 years. The Durbin amendment would require it in 11. \nThat makes it clear that if we try to shove unattainable standards down \nthe throats of automakers, the workers and the companies, we will have \na problem.\n  What will we have achieved by doing so? There is the false perception \nthat the Federal Government has done nothing to address CAFE standards. \nNothing could be further from the truth. On April 3, 2003, NHTSA set \nnew standards for light trucks for the model years 2005 through 2007. \nThese standards are 21 miles per gallon this year; 21.6 next year; and \n22.2 the following year. This 1\\1/2\\-mile-per-gallon increase during \nthis 3-year-period more than doubles the last increase in light truck \nCAFE standards that occurred between 1986 and 1996. This recent \nincrease is the highest in 20 years.\n  In addition, by April 1 next year, NHTSA will publish new light truck \nCAFE standards for model year 2008 and possibly beyond. Most \nstakeholders expect a further increase in CAFE standards for these \nyears as well.\n  It is important to understand that NHTSA is doing this, utilizing \nscientific analysis as a basis for these increases. We must proceed \nwith caution because higher fuel economy standards, based on emotion or \npolitical rhetoric, not sound science, can strike a major blow to the \neconomy, the automobile industry, auto industry jobs, and our Nation. \nHighway safety and consumer choice will also be at risk.\n  Letting NHTSA promulgate standards is the appropriate way to do it, \nand that is what almost two-thirds of the Members of this body decided \nwhen we brought the last Levin-Bond amendment before us.\n  In an April 21 letter this year, Dr. Jeff Runge, Director of NHTSA, \nsaid:\n\n       The Administration supports the goal of improving vehicle \n     fuel economy while protecting passenger safety and jobs. To \n     this end, we believe that future fuel economy must be based \n     on data and sound science.\n\n  Those advocating arbitrary increases may try to avert any discussion \nof the impact on jobs or dismiss the argument. However, I have heard \nfrom a broad array of union officials, plant managers, local automobile \ndealers and small businesses who have told me that unrealistic CAFE \nstandards cut jobs because the only way for manufacturers to meet these \nnumbers is to make significant cuts to light truck, minivan and SUV \nproduction. But these are the same vehicles that Americans continue to \ndemand and American workers produce.\n  On June 17, this month, I received a letter from the UAW regarding \nCAFE amendments, such as the Durbin amendment, which speaks volumes \nabout the detrimental impact that further CAFE increases could have on \nthe automotive industry. The letter states that:\n\n     the UAW continues to strongly oppose these amendments because \n     we believe the increases in CAFE standards are excessive and \n     discriminatory, and would directly threaten thousands of jobs \n     for UAW members and other workers in this country.\n\n  It further states:\n\n       In light of the economic difficulties currently facing GM \n     and Ford, the UAW believes it would be a profound mistake to \n     require them now to shoulder the additional economic burdens \n     associated with extreme, discriminatory CAFE standards. This \n     could have an adverse impact on the financial condition of \n     these companies, further jeopardizing production and \n     employment for thousands of workers throughout this country.\n\n  However, the UAW does strongly support the newly introduced Bond-\nLevin amendment requiring NHTSA to continue the rulemaking efforts to \nissue new fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks, based on a \nwide range of factors such as technological feasibility and the impact \nof CAFE standards. I ask unanimous consent that the letters be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, & \n           Agricultural Implement Workers of America--UAW\n                                    Washington, DC, June 17, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: Next week the Senate is scheduled to continue \n     debate on the comprehensive energy legislation. At that time, \n     the Senate may consider a number of amendments relating to \n     Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.\n       The UAW strongly supports the Levin-Bond amendment which \n     would require the Department of Transportation to engage in \n     rulemaking to issue new fuel economy standards for both cars \n     and light trucks, taking into consideration a wide range of \n     factors, including technology, safety, and the impact on \n     employment. This amendment is similar to the Levin-Bond \n     amendment that was approved by the Senate in the last \n     Congress. The UAW supports the approach contained in this \n     amendment because we believe it can lead to a significant \n     improvement in fuel economy, without jeopardizing the jobs of \n     American automotive workers.\n       The UAW understands that Senators McCain, Feinstein or \n     Durbin may offer amendments that I would mandate huge \n     increases in the CAFE standards. These amendments are similar \n     to proposals that have been considered and rejected \n     decisively by the Senate in previous Congresses. The UAW \n     continues to strongly oppose these amendments because we \n     believe the increases in the CAFE standards are excessive and \n     discriminatory, and would directly threaten thousands of jobs \n     for UAW members and other workers in this country. In our \n     judgment, fuel economy increases of the magnitude proposed in \n     these amendments are neither technologically or economically \n     feasible. The study conducted by the National Academy of \n     Sciences does not support such increases. The UAW is \n     particularly concerned that the structure of these proposed\n\n[[Page S7255]]\n\n     fuel economy increases--a flat mpg requirement for cars and/\n     or light trucks--would severely discriminate against full \n     line producers, such as GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler, because \n     their product mix contains a higher percentage of larger cars \n     and light trucks. This could result in severe disruptions in \n     their production, and directly threaten the jobs of thousands \n     of UAW members.\n       Furthermore, in light of the economic difficulties \n     currently facing GM and Ford, the UAW believes it would be a \n     profound mistake to require them now to shoulder the \n     additional economic burdens associated with extreme, \n     discriminatory CAFE increases. This could have an adverse \n     impact on the financial condition of these companies, further \n     jeopardizing production and employment for thousands of \n     workers throughout this country.\n       The UAW continues to believe that improvements in fuel \n     economy are achievable over time. But we believe that the \n     best way to achieve this objective is to provide tax \n     incentives for domestic production and sales of advanced \n     technology (hybrid and diesel) vehicles, and to direct the \n     Department of Transportation to continue promulgating new \n     fuel economy standards that are economically and \n     technologically feasible.\n       Thank you for considering our views on these important \n     issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Alan Reuther,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 16, 2005.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Frist: The U.S. Senate is in the \n     process of considering various energy-related provisions and \n     amendments to the comprehensive energy bill which passed the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources earlier this month. \n     It has come to our attention that amendments may be \n     forthcoming calling for increases to the Corporate Average \n     Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards including light trucks. The \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources defeated similar \n     amendments, in a bipartisan way.

It has come to our attention that amendments may be \n     forthcoming calling for increases to the Corporate Average \n     Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards including light trucks. The \n     organizations listed below strongly oppose any increase in \n     CAFE standards.\n       Our opposition is based on concerns that such a federal \n     mandate will have a negative impact on consumers and \n     translate directly into a narrower choice of vehicles for \n     America's farmers and ranchers, who depend on affordable and \n     functional light trucks to perform the daily rigors of farm \n     and ranch work.

This is very important to know because 1 out of every 10 \njobs in our country is dependent on new vehicle production and sales. \nThe auto industry is responsible for 13.3 million jobs, or 10 percent \nof private sector jobs. Auto manufacturing contributes $243 billion to \nthe private sector, over 5.6 percent of the private sector \ncompensation. Every State in the Union is an auto State. Let us take a \nlook at that chart. The occupant of the chair is from North Carolina. \nThat has 158,000. The State of Illinois has 311,000. My State has \n221,000. The State of Michigan has 1,007,500.\n  I have heard it said that we should not worry about these jobs. The \nproponents of the amendment to increase it say that it is not going to \ndo any harm.\n  But if you adopt this amendment you can kiss tens of thousands of \ngood, high-paying, American, union manufacturing jobs goodbye. I am not \nwilling to do that to the 36,000 men and women working directly in the \nautomotive industry, nor to the over 200,000 men and women who work in \nauto-dependent jobs in my State.\n  But it is not just jobs. It is safety. According to the National \nAcademy of Sciences:\n\n       Without a thoughtful restructuring of the program . . . \n     additional traffic fatalities would be the tradeoff if CAFE \n     standards are increased by any significant amount.\n\n  You see, we have learned in the past that when you have politically \ninspired CAFE increases which cannot be achieved with technological \nmeans, the only way of achieving them is by making the cars lighter, \n1,000 pounds to 2,000 pounds lighter.\n  Do you know what. More people die in those smaller cars than in the \nfull-size cars that they replace. Since it began, we are running about \n1,500 deaths a year. In August of 2001, the NAS issued a report which \nfound that between 1,300 to 2,600 people in 1993 alone were killed in \nthese smaller automobiles. It is not just smaller automobiles hitting \nlarger automobiles--43 percent of those deaths were in single-car \naccidents.\n  My colleague from Illinois has suggested we disregard these \nstatistics as estimates. These are not estimates, these are dead \npeople. These are people who died from politically inspired CAFE. That \nis what we are talking about. Excessive CAFE standards pressure \nautomobile manufactures to reduce the weight for light trucks, \ncompletely do away with larger trucks used for farming and other \ncommercial purposes.\n  My colleague from Illinois mentioned golf carts--yes, golf carts \nwould comply. But certainly the pickup trucks that a lot of farmers in \nmy State drive would not make it.\n  If an increase in fuel economy is brought about by encouraging \ndownsizing, weight reduction, or more small cars, it will cause \nadditional traffic fatalities. The notion that people's lives and \nsafety are hanging in the balance because of unwarranted CAFE increases \nshould cause all of us some concern. The ability to have a choice of \nthe vehicle assures the safety of one's family. It should not be a \nsacrifice that must be made in favor of arbitrary fuel efficiency \nstandards.\n  I don't want to tell the people in my State or any other State they \nare not allowed to purchase an SUV because Congress decided it would \nnot be a good choice. That sounds like the command and control economy \nof the Soviet Union.\n  Another very important point is the impact of increased CAFE \nstandards on consumer choice and affordability. Despite the record high \ncost of gasoline sales, light truck sales have continued to skyrocket. \nIn the past 25 years, sales of light trucks have almost tripled. In \nMarch of 2005, full-size pickup trucks occupied three of the top five \nsales positions, including the No. 1 and 2 spots. From these numbers \nand from these\n\n[[Page S7256]]\n\ncharts it is obvious that consumers consistently favor safety, utility, \nperformance, and other characteristics over fuel economy. The only way \nto stop sales of these vehicles would be to enact Soviet-style \nmandates, declaring that auto manufacturers could no longer produce \nlight trucks and SUVs, and consumers could no longer buy them.\n  Some people in this body apparently believe our fellow Americans \ncannot be trusted to make the right choice when purchasing a vehicle. \nAs far as I am concerned, when you get down to having the Government \nmaking the choice or the consumer making the choice, I am with the \nconsumer.\n  Just how arbitrary would these CAFE cost increases be to consumers? \nThe CBO last found that raising fuel standards for cars and trucks by 4 \nmiles per gallon could cost consumers as much as $3.6 billion.\n  I also have a copy of a recent letter that was sent to Chairman \nDomenici and Majority Leader Frist from a consortium of agricultural \norganizations which states that ``recent studies indicate that an \naggressive increase in CAFE standards for light trucks could add over \n$3,000 to the purchase price per vehicle. It is signed by the National \nCattlemen's Association, the National Corn Growers, the American Farm \nBureau, National Milk Producers and the National Association of Wheat \nGrowers among others. They oppose these arbitrary increases because \nthey believe they will have a negative impact on consumers, and \ntranslate directly into a narrower choice of vehicles for America's \nfarmers and Ranchers, who depend on affordable and functional light \ntrucks to perform the I daily rigors of farm and ranch work. I \nsubmitted this letter for the Record.\n  Finally, I must to dispel the myth that CAFE increases reduce our \nNation's dependence on foreign oil. According to the American \nInternational Automobile Dealers:\n\n       Despite the claims of CAFE advocates, experience shows that \n     CAFE does not result in the reduction of oil imports. The \n     import share of U.S. oil consumption was 35% in 1974. Since \n     that time, new car fuel economy has doubled but our oil \n     imports share has climbed to almost 60%.\n\n  In that 30 year time frame, the consumption of gasoline has increased \nand not decreased. The bottom line is that after 30 years of CAFE \nstandards, our nation is more dependent on foreign oil than ever \nbefore.\n  I believe that there are other better ways to reduce our Nation's \ndependence on foreign oil than massive increases in CAFE standards. \nThese include promoting the development and use of alternative fuels \nsuch as ethanol, bio-diesel and natural gas. We should pass legislation \nthat encourages the development of advance fuel technology such as \nhybrid and fuel cell vehicles that utilize hydrogen and other sources \nof energy. We should also focus on increasing domestic supplies I of \nenergy that include oil and natural gas.\n  We must talk about what is technologically feasible and what will \nproduce better fuel economy, while continuing to preserve and produce \njobs, and not risk the lives of drivers and their families on our \nnation's roads. We must continue to ensure the safety for parents and \ntheir children, and we must not throw out of work the wonderful \nAmerican men and women who are making these automobiles in my state and \nacross the entire nation.\n  In light of this, Senator Levin and I have reintroduced an amendment \nthat was `` adopted by the Senate in the previous two Congresses, which \nmaintains the authority of the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration--subject to public comment--to determine passenger auto \nstandards based upon the ``maximum feasible'' level. Under the Bond-\nLevin Amendment, determinations to this feasibility level include the \nfollowing factors:\n  No. 1. Technological feasibility;\n  No. 2. Economic Practicability;\n  No. 3. The effect of other government motor vehicle standards on fuel \neconomy;\n  No. 4. The need of the nation to conserve energy;\n  No. 5. The desirability of reducing U.S. dependency on foreign oil;\n  No. 6. The effects of fuel economy standards on motor vehicle safety, \nand passenger safety;\n  No. 7. The effects of increased fuel economy on air quality;\n  No. 8. The adverse effects of increased CAFE standards on the \ncompetitiveness of U.S. manufacturers;\n  No. 9. The effects of CAFE Standards on U.S. employment;\n  No. 10. The cost and lead time required for the introductions of new \ntechnologies; and\n  No. 11. The potential for advanced hybrid and fuel cell technologies.\n  Every factor, which I have just mentioned, must play a major role in \nthe consideration of setting future fuel efficiency standards for \nvehicles. The Bond-Levin amendment provides for these impacts and \nleaves it to the experts at NHTSA to develop viable standards based on \nthis criteria and sound scientific analysis.\n  The Bond-Levin amendment also extends the flexible fuel or ``duel \nfuel'' credit to continue to provide incentives for automakers to \nproduce vehicles that are capable of running on alternative fuels such \nas ethanol/gasoline blends. So far these incentives have been \nsuccessful in putting more than 4 million alternative fuel vehicles on \nour nation's roads. This will be another positive step in helping our \nNation reduce its dependence on foreign oil.\n  Again, this debate is about safety, jobs, consumer choice and sound \nscientific analysis.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the arbitrary and unscientific Durbin \namendment, and to support the Levin-Bond 2nd degree amendment.\n  I yield to my colleague from Michigan--how much time does he want?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 24\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is the time combined on the two amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has 17 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is on both amendments combined?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me thank Senator Bond for his \nwork on this amendment, which offers an alternative, a rational \nalternative. This alternative would allow the agency that is the expert \nto weigh all the factors that should go into a rulemaking and to raise \nCAFE standards in a logical and rational and scientific way rather than \na totally arbitrary way, which is what the Durbin amendment does.\n  Of course, we want to raise CAFE standards. We want to do it in a way \nthat protects the environment and protects jobs in America. But we do \nnot want to do it in a way that will not protect the environment and \nwill destroy jobs in America at the same time.\n  We need to improve fuel economy, but how we increase it is critical. \nThat is the main point I am going to make. You need to do it, but how \nwe do it is critical. The question is whether we are going to do it \nthrough a rulemaking on the part of an agency looking at all the \nrelevant factors, and I am going to list them in a moment or whether we \nare going to just pick a number out of the air. The number of the \nSenator from Illinois is 40--just go to 40 miles per gallon on the \nfleet and at the same time, by the way, just add trucks to the car \nfleet for the first time. It is not just cars now that have to get to \n40 miles per gallon under the proposal of the Senator, but we add \nminivans and sport utility vehicles to that fleet--and it is done \narbitrarily. It is not based on the considerations that a rational \nagency should bring to bear on rulemaking, which is what NHTSA is there \nfor.\n  Instead we are going to 40 miles per gallon for the whole fleet. We \nare throwing trucks into the car fleet to boot. It is a triple whammy \nto American jobs in the Durbin amendment. The first whammy is that the \nnumbers that he picks are total arbitrary numbers: 40 miles per gallon, \nand he adds two of the three types of light trucks to the car fleet.\n  Rather than legislating an arbitrary number, what the Bond-Levin \namendment does is to tell NHTSA to take a number of important \nconsiderations into account when setting the level of the standard. \nHere are the 13 factors that we tell NHTSA to consider. We think we \nhave found and identified every rational standard or criterion\n\n[[Page S7257]]\n\nwhich they ought to look at in setting this number.\n\n  First, maximum technological feasibility.\n  Second, economic practicability.\n  Third, the effect of other Government motor vehicle standards on fuel \neconomy--because we have other standards, in terms of clean air and \nemissions, which bear on fuel economy. Someone, NHTSA, should take that \ninto account.\n  Fourth, the need to conserve energy.\n  Fifth, the desirability of reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.\n  Next, the effect on motor vehicle safety. This is a point which \nSenator Bond has made, which the National Academy of Sciences has \ncommented on.\n  Next, the effects of increased fuel economy on air quality.\n  Next, the adverse effects of increased fuel economy standards on the \nrelative competitiveness of manufacturers.\n  Next, the effect on U.S. employment.\n  Next, the cost in lead time required for introduction of new \ntechnologies.\n  Next, the potential for advanced technology vehicles, such as hybrid \nand fuel cell vehicles, to contribute to significant fuel usage \nsavings.\n  Next, the effect of near-term expenditures required to meet increased \nfuel economy standards on the resources available to develop advanced \ntechnologies.\n  Finally, to take into account the report of the National Research \nCouncil entitled ``Effectiveness and Impact of Corporate Average Fuel \nEconomy Standards.''\n  Those are 13 factors that ought to be considered in a rulemaking, \ninstead of just an arbitrary seizure on a number that is then put into \nlaw and imposed on everybody arbitrarily.\n  The Durbin amendment, in addition to adopting an arbitrary number, \nworsens the discriminatory features of the existing CAFE system because \nthere are inherent discriminatory features in that system that give an \nunfair competitive advantage to foreign automotive manufacturers while \nnot benefiting the environment. The reason for this is a bit \ncomplicated. I hope every Member of this body will look very hard at \nthe CAFE system and not just look at the amendments that are before us, \nbut also look at the situation we have where CAFE already gives a \ndiscriminatory boost to imported vehicles. The CAFE system gives this \nboost, not because the vehicles are more efficient--because they are \nnot. The same size imported vehicles have about the same fuel economy \nas the same size domestic vehicles.\n  I want to give some examples. There is no difference in terms of fuel \neconomy. But the CAFE system, because of the way it has been designed, \ngives a discriminatory boost to imports because the domestic \nmanufacturers provide a full line of different sized vehicles, which \nresults in a lower fleet average.\n  Let's just take four vehicles. This is a comparison of vehicle fuel \neconomy, pound per pound. We are looking at vehicles of the same size.\n  Here is an example of a large SUV. The Chevrolet Suburban weighs \n6,000 pounds. The Toyota Sequoia weighs 5,500 pounds. So the Sequoia, \nin this case, is actually lighter than the Suburban. But the Sequoia, \nToyota, is less fuel efficient--although it is slightly lighter--than \nthe Chevrolet Suburban.\n  The Jeep Liberty, 19 miles per gallon; the Toyota 4Runner, slightly \nless fuel efficient, although they are the same weight, 4,500 pounds.\n  The example of a large pickup truck, the Chevrolet Silverado gets 18 \nmiles per gallon, the Toyota Tundra gets 17 miles per gallon. They both \nweigh the same amount, 4,750 pounds. The Toyota Tundra, slightly less \nfuel efficient than the Chevrolet Silverado.\n  The Chevrolet Venture and the Toyota Sienna both weigh exactly the \nsame, 4,250 pounds. The Chevrolet Venture is slightly more fuel \nefficient than the Toyota Sienna.\n\n  The point of this is to try to bring to bear the fact that, when you \nhave vehicles of about the same weight, you have about the same fuel \neconomy, in these cases slightly better fuel economy on the part of the \nChevrolet and the Jeep, than we do the Toyota.\n  You never get that impression from the charts that we see from the \nSenator from Illinois. That is not the impression that you get. He says \nthat Toyota does everything more efficiently, they do all the hybrids. \nWe, on the other hand, do all the big vehicles.\n  We do not make all the big vehicles. As a matter of fact, the growth \nin the sale of Toyotas and Hondas, when it comes to light trucks \nprimarily pick up trucks and SUVs is dramatically greater than anything \nthey are doing in the area of hybrids. Their hybrid sales are a peanut \ncompared to the growth in light truck sales. Hybrids represent 1 \npercent of the market, but when you look at the light truck sales on \nthe part of Toyota and Honda, there are dramatic increases in numbers \nof sales of those vehicles. That is not because they are more fuel \nefficient, they are not. In some cases, they are slightly less. Let's \nassume they are the same. The sale of those light trucks has nothing to \ndo with their fuel efficiency. It has to do with legacy costs, but I am \nnot going to get into that at this point.\n  So we have a situation where, because of the CAFE system, which is \ndesigned to look at the entire fleet average, because the imports have \ntraditionally had a lot smaller vehicles--smaller trucks and SUVs in \ntheir fleet, they have a lot more ``headroom'' to sell all the light \ntrucks they want without being penalized under the CAFE system.\n  It doesn't do the environment one bit of good to tell people you can \nbuy a Toyota Tundra but not a Chevrolet Silverado. But that is what the \nCAFE system does.\n  That is what the CAFE system does. Toyota has ``headroom''--and I \nwill give you the numbers in a moment--to sell huge additional numbers \nof their vehicles but a company like GM does not. That does nothing for \nthe environment. Quite the opposite, it slightly hurts the environment. \nBut call it a draw. It does nothing for the environment, and it damages \nAmerican jobs. That is an inherent defect in the CAFE system. The \nDurbin amendment exacerbates that defect because it builds into the \nsystem an even larger number that must be met.\n  By the way, these are the numbers I said a moment ago. This is the \nheadroom, the additional sale of large pickups or SUVs allowed under \nCAFE. Toyota can sell an additional 1.8 million vehicles and still meet \nthe CAFE standard. Honda can sell an additional 2.6 million vehicles \nand still meet the CAFE standard. But GM cannot sell any additional \nvehicles. But that is not because the Toyota and Honda vehicles are \nmore fuel efficient. I cannot say that enough times. It is not because \nthey are more fuel efficient. They are not more fuel efficient. At \nbest, they are even.\n  What good does it do to tell folks: You can buy a Tundra but not a \nSilverado? Why are we doing that to ourselves? It is not for the \nenvironment because it is no more environmentally friendly. Why are we \ndoing that to ourselves? Why are we doing that to American jobs?\n  The growth in sales of the imported vehicles is dramatic. It \noverwhelms the numbers of hybrids being sold. My dear friend from \nIllinois shows on his chart hybrid sales of something like 35,000. \nMeanwhile, Toyota's truck sales include 700,000 pickup trucks and SUVs \nthis year. The impression of my colleague's chart is, look at all of \nthe hybrids they are selling. But this is a peanut compared to the \nnumber of large trucks they are selling. So do not say the Big 3 are \nselling all the large vehicles and let everyone else off the hook. They \nare all selling a lot more large trucks than they are hybrids.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Why don't we change the standard, the CAFE standard? Why \nis no one recommending that? Why don't we say that every vehicle, based \non weight, no matter where it is made, must meet the same exact \nstandard? Why don't we do that?\n  Mr. LEVIN. It could be done. And NHTSA has a right to do that under \nour bill if it is logical to do that. But we should not set the number. \nWe could say to NHTSA, and it is a perfectly logical argument, it seems \nto me that you should have the same mile per gallon standard for the \nsame size vehicle. That is a logical argument. But that is not what is \nin this amendment. This builds on a defective system and makes it \nworse.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, I have trouble with the \namendment of the Senator from Illinois, but I also\n\n[[Page S7258]]\n\nhave trouble with the amendment of the Senator from Michigan. It seems \nto me we have a problem, a big problem. I don't think we can meet the \nstandard of the Senator from Illinois in time, and I think it would \ndamage American jobs significantly.\n  But I don't understand why we do not bite the bullet and say, whether \nNHTSA does it or not, you can't drive a Toyota that gets less miles \nthan a Dodge Durango or an American-made car because you have a fleet \naverage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan should be advised \nhis time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has 17 minutes; the \nSenator from Missouri has 9 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will speak for a few minutes and yield to my colleague \nand friend from Missouri.\n  To the Senator from Delaware, I am talking fleet average. That \napplies to German, Japanese, American cars--to all cars. The argument, \nbuy a Toyota Tundra, do not buy a Chevrolet Silverado that is not true. \nThis is not a standard for American-made cars but a standard for cars \nsold in America from wherever they are manufactured.\n  Yes, the rules will apply to American manufacturers the same as they \napply to others. Don't we want that? Isn't our goal to reduce the \nconsumption of oil in America and our dependence on foreign oil? I no \nmore stand here and put a discriminatory amendment up for American \nmanufacturers and workers and say, You have to play to a higher \nstandard than Japanese, German, Swedish, or whatever the source might \nbe of the other car. This is a fleet average. It does not mean that \nevery car has to meet this average. It is an average, which means there \nwill be larger cars and larger trucks that will get lower mileage, but \nthere must be more fuel-efficient cars that bring it to an average \nnumber.\n  Let me also talk about the unrealism of my proposal. For the record, \nincreasing the fuel efficiency of passenger cars by 12\\1/2\\ miles per \ngallon over the next 11 years, the argument that it is beyond us, \nAmericans cannot imagine how we would do such a thing--NHTSA has \nrequired that trucks in our country increase their fuel efficiency by \n2.2 miles a gallon over 2 years. So they are improving by more than a \nmile a gallon over 2 years. My standard for all is 12\\1/2\\ miles over \n11 years. Why is this such a huge technological leap? I don't think it \nis.\n\n  I yield for a short question on a limited time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I truly am confused. I don't doubt what the Senator says. \nI don't fully understand it.\n  It is a fleet average. Toyota makes an automobile--I am making this \nup--that gets 60 miles per gallon when people drive around in Tokyo \nthat they will not sell here at all in order that they can make a giant \nToyota truck that gets poorer mileage or as poor mileage as our truck, \nand they get to sell it here because they have averaged out their \nfleet.\n  My question is, Why don't we just say, based on the weights of these \nvehicles, everybody has to meet the same standard, not an average, \nbecause people are not buying two-seater 60-mile-per-gallon vehicles \nhere as they are in Europe where it is $4 a gallon. That is my \nquestion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me say to the Senator from Delaware, if that is the \nloophole, I want to close it.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I think it is.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am concerned about what is sold in America. I am \nconcerned about the oil that is consumed in America and the gasoline \nconsumed in America. I don't care if Toyota makes a car that is sold in \nAustralia and what the mileage might be. That is their concern.\n  For us to take the attitude or approach that we are not even going to \nhold the manufacturer to any higher standards with fuel efficiency in \nmy mind is a concession that we will be dependent on foreign oil for as \nlong as we can imagine.\n  The Senator from Missouri says I am engaged in a ``Soviet survival'' \napproach to the economy. I will just tell him that I don't believe it \nwas a Soviet-style approach which enacted CAFE in the first instance \nand resulted in such a dramatic decline in our dependence on foreign \noil.\n  As to the argument that this kills jobs, the idea this kills jobs, I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter of \nendorsement from the Transport Workers Union of America. Here is one \nunion that supports it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Transport Workers Union\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 16, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 130,000 members of the \n     Transport Workers Union and transit and rail workers \n     everywhere, we urge you to vote for the Durbin CAFE amendment \n     to the pending energy bill to raise fuel economy standards.\n       The amendment requires all car companies in America--both \n     domestic and foreign--to increase average fuel efficiency. \n     This is achievable with current technology and so clearly in \n     the national interest that it is difficult to understand how \n     anyone could oppose it:\n       (1) National Security--in an era when the United States is \n     under attack from foreign fanatics, it is of critical \n     importance to reduce our dependence on foreign oil imports, \n     most especially when those imports support and subsidize \n     those very nations which are the source of these attacks.\n       (2) Air Pollution--Opponents of environmental measures are \n     fond of citing the need for established, proven science. \n     There is no dispute that auto emissions are one of the major \n     sources of air pollution in the modern era.\n       (3) Reducing Health Costs--Auto emissions are a major cause \n     of asthma and other respiratory diseases and a major \n     contributor to the rising health care costs in America. These \n     costs are, in turn, a major factor in the difficulty American \n     manufacturers have in competing with foreign manufacturers.\n       It would be disingenuous to pretend that the members of the \n     Transport Workers Union do not have a major stake in reducing \n     the costs to the U.S. economy--accidents, death, healthcare, \n     pollution cleanup, and enforcement--of automobile use. \n     Certainly anything that would stop the extreme subsidizing of \n     auto use in America and allow the marketplace to drive \n     consumers to the most efficient use of transportation \n     resources would increase jobs for the rail and transit \n     workers we represent.\n       But that is an important point. Tightening auto fuel \n     efficiency standards would not, as some argue, reduce \n     American jobs. It would simply transfer them from one \n     industry to another--to an industry which is not only highly \n     unionized and highly compensated, but which promotes the \n     national interest of security, a clean environment and lower \n     health care costs.\n       We urge you to vote for the Durbin fuel economy amendment \n     to the energy bill.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Roger Tauss,\n\n                                             Legislative Director,\n                                          Transport Workers Union.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. And I might also say the National Environmental Trust \nsays that by 2020, nearly 15,000 more U.S. autoworkers would have jobs \nbecause of a higher fuel efficiency standard, a 14-percent increase in \naverage annual growth in U.S. auto industry employment, an auto \nindustry that is declining in terms of the people who are working \nthere.\n  In terms of the savings, the Senator from Missouri was troubled by \nthe notion that American consumers would spend $3.6 billion for this \nnew technology in these more fuel-efficient vehicles. What the Senator \ndoes not acknowledge is that by making that investment of $3.6 billion, \nunder my amendment the savings in fuel to consumers will be over $110 \nbillion; $3.6 billion in new cars and trucks, $110 billion of savings \nto consumers.\n  So would you get rid of an old gas guzzler to have a more fuel-\nefficient engine if it meant a trip to the gasoline station did not \nrequire taking out a loan at a local bank? Of course you would. That is \nonly smart and only sensible.\n  Let me also say on the issue of safety, if you see the memo on safety \non the vehicles involved, we know that we have the potential here of \nbuilding vehicles that are safer and fuel efficient. We have statistics \nthat relate to cars and trucks sold, but, in fairness, these are \nstatistics in a period from 1994 and 1997. I will assume SUVs are a lot \nsafer today.\n  But if you think it is a given that an SUV is safer than a car, the \nHonda Civic, at 2,500 pounds, had a year death rate of 47 per million \nregistered vehicle miles; a 5,500-pound vehicle--twice as large--four-\nwheel-drive Chevy Suburban had a death rate of 53 per million \nregistered vehicle miles. Other popular SUVs are even more lethal \nduring that period: four-door Blazers, at 72 deaths\n\n[[Page S7259]]\n\nper million; the shorter-wheel-base two-door Blazer had an appalling \n153 deaths per million; the Explorer, 76; Jeep Grand Cherokee had 52; \nand of course, in fairness, Toyota 4Runner, a large SUV, 126 deaths per \nmillion.\n  The notion that SUVs are automatically safer--we know the problems \nwith rollovers, and we know that some of the difficulties with even the \nlarger cars have to be reconciled. To assume that a larger, bigger SUV \nis always safer is not proven by these numbers, these statistics.\n  Let me also say what I propose would apply to Toyota and Honda SUVs \nsold in America as well. I honestly believe we should hold those to the \nsame standard.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I have trouble explaining to my Chrysler workers when I \nwant to raise the CAFE standard. They are not happy with me. I voted \nagainst it last time.\n  My friend from Michigan, if you can drive a Toyota into that Chrysler \nparking lot that gets less mileage than the vehicle being made in that \nChrysler plant under the way CAFE standards are set up, you would be \nable to do that because the fleet average means you can drive in a big \nold Toyota getting 16 miles to the gallon or 17 miles to the gallon, \nbut you could not drive the Dodge Durango that gets 18 miles a gallon--\n1 mile better--because the fleet average causes the Durango to be out \nof the ballpark.\n  That is my problem with all of this. That is why I cannot vote for \nwhat the Senator is suggesting even though I agree with the thrust of \nwhat he is saying. That is why I have difficulty with my friend from \nMichigan. He solves that problem in a sense, but he does not solve the \nlarger problem of kicking the requirements higher.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has 8 minutes 40 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I also say about a Bond-Levin amendment that will be \noffered that it does not set goals for increased fuel economy for oil \nsavings. That is unfortunate. It gives the decisionmaking over to the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration. They do not have a very \ngood track record in holding the automobile maker selling in America to \nincreased fuel efficiency.\n  I like dual E85 vehicles. I think those are sensible. Sadly, at this \npoint, there are very few places to turn to to buy the fuel.\n  My colleague, Senator Obama, was talking about a tax treatment that \nwould give incentives to set up these E85 stations. It was, \nunfortunately, not included in this bill. I think it should have been. \nRight now, there are precious few to turn to. Dual-fuel use is part of \nthe Bond-Levin amendment, but it is a very rare occurrence where you \ncan actually find the E85 fuel to put in your car. Plus, we find when \nthey are dual-fuel use vehicles, which the Senators rely on a great \ndeal for their savings, fewer than 1 percent of the people actually use \nthe better fuel. They stick to the less fuel efficient source of energy \nfor their car. They do not use the E85 fuel.\n  Sadly, the Bond-Levin amendment will increase our 2015 oil \nconsumption by almost as much as we currently import from Saudi Arabia. \nSo no more fuel efficiency, a response to the problem which is not \nrealistic and, unfortunately, even more dependent on foreign oil in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Missouri would \nyield 30 additional seconds to me to put a statement in the Record.\n  Mr. BOND. I so yield, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this is a National Academy of Sciences \nfinding about the CAFE system that the Senator from Delaware made \nreference to. It states:\n\n     . . . one concept of equity among manufacturers requires \n     equal treatment of equivalent vehicles made by different \n     manufacturers'' that is, ``equal treatment of equivalent \n     vehicles made by different manufacturers.''\n\n  The NAS continues, ``The current CAFE standards fail this test.''\n  That is what the Senator from Delaware was referring to.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full paragraphs from \nthe National Academy of Sciences study be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           National Academy of Sciences Report on Cafe [2002]\n\n\n         CAFE Discriminates Against the Domestic Auto Industry\n\n       ``. . . one concept of equity among manufacturers requires \n     equal treatment of equivalent vehicles made by different \n     manufacturers. The current CAFE standards fail this test. If \n     one manufacturer was positioned in the market selling many \n     large passenger cars and thereby was just meeting the CAFE \n     standard, adding a 22-mpg car (below the 27.5-mpg standard) \n     would result in a financial penalty or would require \n     significant improvements in fuel economy for the remainder of \n     the passenger cars. But, if another manufacturer was selling \n     many small cars and was significantly exceeding the CAFE \n     standard, adding a 22-mpg vehicle would have no negative \n     consequences.'' (page 102)\n       ``A policy decision to simply increase the standard for \n     light-duty trucks to the same level as for passenger cars \n     would operate in this inequitable manner. Some manufacturers \n     have concentrated their production in light-duty trucks while \n     others have concentrated production in passenger cars. But \n     since trucks tend to be heavier than cars and are more likely \n     to have attributes, such as four-wheel drive, that reduce \n     fuel economy, those manufacturers whose production was \n     concentrated in light-duty trucks would be financially \n     penalized relative to those manufactures whose production was \n     concentrated in cars. Such a policy decision would impose \n     unequal costs on otherwise similarly situated \n     manufacturers.'' (page 102)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Michigan.\n  I would say that, No. 1, NHTSA has said they will consider basing \nlight-truck standards on vehicle weight or size, as the Senator from \nDelaware suggested. The Senator from Illinois was downplaying the CAFE \nincreases by NHTSA, but he just talked about them. The difference \nbetween the 1.5-mile-per-gallon increase that NHTSA ordered for light \ntrucks--and they did order it--and what he is proposing is that NHTSA's \nwas based on science and technology.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to my friend from \nMissouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I thank my friend for yielding me time.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, Missouri is an auto State. Each year the \nhard-working employees of six assembly plants produce well over 1 \nmillion cars and light trucks that are shipped around the country. In \nfact, we have 221,000 auto-related workers in Missouri. There are 6.6 \nmillion autoworkers around the country. I raise the question: What \nhappens to our automobile economy, what happens to the workers, what \nhappens to the people who buy them, what happens to the people on the \nhighways if suddenly our auto manufacturers are forced to make \nunreasonable changes in fuel economy standard?\n  When enacted, CAFE established a 14.6-mpg level for combined car and \nlight truck fuel economy. That level increased to 17.5-mpg in 1982 and \nto 20.7-mpg in 1996. Since the early 1970s, new vehicles have continued \nto become more fuel efficient. According to the EPA data, efficiency \nhas increased steadily at nearly 2 percent per year on average from \n1975 to 2001 for both cars and trucks. Fuel economy rates in cars have \nmore than doubled in the past generation, from 14.2 miles per gallon in \n1974 to more than 28.1 miles per gallon in 2000.\n  Today's light truck gets better mileage than the compact cars from \nthe 1970s. This bipartisan approach, offered by Senator Levin and the \nSenior Senator from Missouri, Kit Bond, increases fuel economy. It does \nit in a way that also allows the domestic manufacturing industry in our \nU.S. economy to thrive as well. The two are not mutually exclusive. We \ncan accomplish both goals. If we rush to legislate higher CAFE \nstandards it will have a negative effect on the American economy and on \nmanufacturing jobs in America. If we do it wrong, we will not even \nbenefit the environment the way we should.\n  I drive a Ford, and I just toured the Ford Motor plant in Kansas \nCity. I listened to the car manufacturers, the\n\n[[Page S7260]]\n\nworking men and women in the unions who build the cars, and the other \nimpacted groups, and the significantly higher CAFE standard creates a \nreal possibility of costing thousands of Americans their jobs, \nincluding many of the 221,000 auto-related workers in Missouri. The \nFord F150 pickup truck is made in Kansas City. They estimated that an \nincrease in CAFE standards to the 34-mpg that others are suggesting \nwould raise the price of the truck by $3,000. That is a lot of money to \na farmer or a construction worker considering a purchase. Adding $3,000 \nor more to the sticker price of a new SUV or truck hurts sales and it \nkills jobs. This compromise offered by Senators Bond and Levin is a \nreasonable measure that gives our U.S. automakers equal footing with \ntheir foreign counterparts. The adverse effects of an increased fuel \neconomy standard will have a negative effect on the relative \ncompetitiveness of U.S. manufacturers.\n  A higher fuel economy discriminates against the American auto \nindustry. The American-manufactured vehicles, like those made in \nMissouri, are just as fuel efficient as the imports. However, they are \nput in a negative position, because of the CAFE structure--the fact \nthat it looks at a fleetwide average rather than looking at class of \nvehicles compared to class of vehicles. Nothing is gained for the \nenvironment if an imported SUV is bought instead of an American-made \nSUV where the American SUV is at least as fuel efficient as the foreign \nSUV. Nothing is gained for the air, but a lot of American jobs are \nlost. This is the impact of a 36-mile-per-gallon combined car/truck \nstandard on five manufacturers. Honda only has to increase theirs by 20 \npercent; Toyota, 36 percent; GM, 51 percent; Ford, 56 percent; \nDaimlerChrysler, 59 percent.\n  Instead of saying the same size vehicle will be subject to the same \nCAFE standard, the same mileage standard, it lumps together all \nvehicles of a manufacturer, and the results are, in my judgment, \nbizarre and costs huge numbers of American jobs without the benefit to \nthe environment. While CAFE standards do not mandate that manufacturers \nmake small cars, they have had a significant effect on the designs \nmanufacturers adopt--generally, the weights of passenger vehicles have \nbeen falling. Producing smaller, lightweight vehicles that can perform \nsatisfactorily using low-power, fuel-efficient engines is the most \naffordable way for automakers to meet the CAFE standards.\n\n  The only way for U.S. automakers to meet the unrealistic numbers that \nothers are proposing is to cut back significantly on the manufacturing \nof the light trucks, minivans, and SUVs that the American consumers \nwant, that the people of my State and the people of the other States \nwant--to carry their children around safely and conveniently, to do \ntheir business.\n  Levin-Bond asks the Department of Transportation to consider \nrulemaking that would also consider the effect on U.S. employment, the \neffect on near-term expenditures that are required to meet increased \nfuel economy standards on the resources available to develop advanced \ntechnology. It puts in place a rational and science-based system of \nlooking at many criteria which are relevant to the question of where \nthe new standards for fuel economy ought to be instead of arbitrarily \npicking a number out of the air. CAFE should be addressed through a \nrational rulemaking process that is put in place by experts over a \nfixed period of time that then makes a decision on what the new \nstandards should be. Politicians who don't fully understand the \ntechnologies involved should not arbitrarily set unattainable CAFE \nstandards.\n  As we struggle to get our economy moving again, we ought to be \ndeveloping proposals that will increase the number of jobs--not \neliminate them. We are debating this obscure theory of CAFE where \nforeign manufacturers are relatively unconstrained by CAFE because of a \nfleet mix, not because they are more fuel efficient class by class. For \nthose who say, too bad, we must force the U.S. Big Three to build more \nfuel-efficient cars and trucks, do you know that under CAFE it doesn't \nmatter what the companies manufacture and build? It is calculated based \non what the consumer buys.\n  Our auto manufacturers can produce vehicles that get 40 miles per \ngallon. Sure, they can. They can produce electric vehicles which even \ndo better than that. The question is: Are there people who want to buy \nthem? Light trucks today account for about 50 percent of GM sales, 60 \npercent of Ford sales, and 73 percent of DaimlerChrysler sales. There \nare over 50 of these high economy models in the showrooms across \nAmerica today. But guess what. They represent less than 2 percent of \ntotal sales. Americans don't want them. You can lead a horse to water; \nyou can't make him drink. You can lead the American consumer to a whole \nrange of lightweight, automobiles, but you can't make them buy them.\n  Additionally, with the higher cost of new vehicles, farmers, \nconstruction workers and parents aren't going to afford the more \nexpensive new light truck. More older, less efficient cars will stay on \nthe road longer. How does that improve our air quality or reduce the \nneed for imported oil?\n  Let's put this debate in perspective. Support the American \nautoworker, support the American economy, support the Levin-Bond \namendment and oppose the unreasonable proposal from Senator Durbin.\n  Mr. President, I sure agree with what the Senator from Delaware was \nsaying, and the Senator from Michigan, so I do not have to repeat it \nall. I want to make what I think are four brief points.\n  Let me clarify, whether you meet CAFE standards does not depend on \nthe cars you offer to sell. It depends on the cars that people actually \nbuy. It is very important to remember that. That is the reason for the \nproblem with the amendment of the Senator from Illinois that the \nSenator from Michigan and Senator Biden both mentioned.\n  The Japanese have been effective in capturing more of the small-car \nmarket. American manufacturers have been more effective in capturing \nthe SUV and truck market. Now, the Senator from Illinois says we missed \na bet by going after the truck and SUV market. Well, the Japanese don't \nthink so. The Senator from Michigan made the point, they have been \ngoing like a house afire to try to capture precisely that market. And \nthe amendment of the Senator from Illinois would make it much easier \nfor them to do it.\n  The reason is, the trucks and the SUVs we sell now are general fleet. \nThey tend to be big and, therefore, have somewhat lower mileage. So if \nthe amendment of the Senator from Illinois were adopted, the Japanese \nmanufacturers could continue to sell lower mileage bigger trucks and \nbigger SUVs and still comply with his standard under the CAFE laws. The \nresult would be they would be able to capture the SUV and larger truck \nmarket.\n  His amendment would not cause people to buy fewer large SUVs and \ntrucks. It would cause them to buy fewer American SUVs and American \ntrucks. That is the point the Senator from Michigan and my friend from \nMissouri have made.\n  Now, the Senator from Illinois talks about monster SUVs. I have to \ncomment, people do not buy SUVs or trucks because they have lower gas \nmileage. They buy them generally for reasons of safety or utility. We \nwent through this in my family. We used to drive smaller cars. When we \nstarted having kids, my wife put her foot down and said: The car you \nhave been driving would fold up like an accordion if you ever got in an \naccident. We have kids now. You have to get a bigger car. That is the \nfirst time we bought an SUV. That kind of decisionmaking goes on all \nover the United States.\n  Let me close by commenting on some of what the Senator from Illinois \nsaid about our auto manufacturers. He was criticizing decisions they \nmade and mentioning they are having difficult economic times. It is \ntrue that our auto manufacturers are going through some troubled times. \nIs that a reason to heap a new burden on them? It is true they have not \nbeen as effective as any of us would have liked in capturing the small-\ncar market. Is that a reason to take the larger truck market from them? \nIt is true that America relies too much on overseas oil. Is that a \nreason to send our jobs overseas?\n  We have an alternative in front of us that is going to encourage \ngreater fuel economy: higher mileage automobiles. It is working. It is \nrational and logical, as the Senator from Michigan has said, rather \nthan arbitrary. It is the Bond-Levin amendment.\n\n[[Page S7261]]\n\n  I urge the Senate to adopt that amendment and stay the course. It is \nworking, and it will protect American jobs.\n  I thank the Senate, Mr. President. I yield whatever time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Missouri.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nMissouri, Mr. Talent, and the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Bunning, be \nadded as cosponsors to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. President, as cochairman of the Senate Auto Caucus, I \nam pleased to join with my colleagues, Senator Bond and Senator Levin, \nas a cosponsor of this corporate average fuel economy standards \namendment to the Energy bill. It is an important issue, and it impacts \non the economy of our country, the environment, and the safety of the \ntraveling public.\n  There is no doubt that each of us wants the automobile industry to \nmake cars, trucks, SUVs, and minivans that are energy efficient. It is \nnot only good for the environment, but it means more money in the \npockets of the American consumers because they are going to spend less \nmoney at the gas pump.\n  However, I am deeply concerned that the artificial and arbitrarily \nchosen CAFE standard supported by some of my colleagues will have a \ndevastating effect on jobs. Ohio is the No. 2 automotive manufacturing \nState in America, employing more than 630,000 people either directly or \nindirectly. I have heard from a number of these men and women whose \nlivelihood depends on the auto industry and who are, frankly, very \nworried about their future.\n  There is genuine concern that a provision mandating an arbitrary \nstandard could cause a serious disruption and shifting in the auto \nindustry resulting in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs across the \nNation.\n  Domestic automakers build the light trucks that consumers want. \nDaimlerChrysler's fleet of light trucks makes up more than 50 percent \nof their entire fleet. The company manufactures the Jeep Liberty and \nthe Jeep Wrangler in Toledo, OH, and employs approximately 5,200 \nworkers at this plant. If an arbitrary CAFE provision is mandated that \ntargets light trucks, this plant could close because Chrysler would be \nforced to redistribute their manufacturing base to build more small, \nhigh-mileage cars.\n  The concern of auto workers was evident at the polls in Ohio last \nNovember. Voters rejected a candidate for President who had advocated \nan arbitrary standard that would have cost jobs and raised prices on \nthe vehicles that consumers demand.\n  Another concern is that an arbitrary standard would have a harmful \neffect on public safety, as well as put a severe crimp in the \nmanufacturing base of my State of Ohio which is already under duress \nbecause of high natural gas costs, litigation, health care costs, and \ncompetition from overseas.\n  In 2001, new vehicle sales of trucks, SUVs, and minivans outpaced the \nsale of automobiles for the first time in American history. This \nremarkable result can be attributed to a number of factors, but one \nreason that is often cited is the fact that these vehicles are seen as \nsafer.\n  On the other hand, the Bond-Levin amendment is a rational proposal \nbased on sound science that will keep workers both in Ohio and \nnationwide working, allowing these men and women to continue to take \ncare of their families and educate their children while also \nencouraging greater fuel efficiency and safer vehicles.\n  This amendment calls for the Department of Transportation to increase \nfuel economy standards based on several factors including the \nfollowing: technology feasibility; economic practicability; the need to \nconserve energy and protect the environment; the effect on motor \nvehicle safety; and the effect on U.S. employment.\n  I believe this is a much more responsible approach that will improve \nthe fuel efficiency of our Nation's vehicles while also protecting \npublic safety and our Nation's economic security.\n  This amendment also requires that the Department of Transportation \ncomplete the rulemaking process that would increase fuel efficiency \nstandards for 2008 model vehicles. If the administration doesn't act \nwithin the required timeframe, Congress will act, under expedited \nprocedures, to pass legislation mandating an increase in fuel economy \nstandards consistent with the same criteria that the administration \nmust consider.\n  This administration is already taking steps to improve fuel \nefficiency. As you know, in 2003, the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration enacted the largest fuel efficiency increase for light \ntrucks in over 20 years. By 2007, fuel efficiency requirements will \nincrease to 22.2 miles per gallon from the 20.7 miles per gallon that \nhad been in place through the 2004 model year.\n  The amendment will also increase Federal research and development for \nhybrid electric vehicles and clean diesel vehicles.\n  Additionally, the amendment will increase the market for alternative-\npowered and hybrid vehicles by mandating that the Federal Government, \nwhere feasible, purchase alternative powered and hybrid vehicles.\n  I believe that this guaranteed market will encourage the auto \nindustry to continue to increase their investment in research and \ndevelopment with an eye towards making alternative-fuel and hybrid \nvehicles more affordable, available, and commercially appealing to the \naverage consumer.\n  As a matter of fact, I have ridden in a hybrid manufactured by \nDaimlerChrysler and I have driven a fuel-cell automobile manufactured \nby General Motors. I firmly believe that my children and grandchildren \nwill one day be driving automobiles that run on hydrogen and give off \nonly water. However, it will take time for the technology that makes \nthese vehicles possible to be cost-effective and for these vehicles to \nbe marketable.\n  Until then, I believe that consumer demand will continue to drive the \nmarket place. While truck, SUV, and minivan demand is not expected to \ndecrease any time soon, automakers will meet this demand.\n  In the meantime, many consumers are making the decision to move from \nlight trucks to smaller vehicles as their needs change. In light of \ntoday's gas prices, consumers will demand more fuel efficient-vehicles \nthat do not jeopardize their personal and family safety.\n  For example, my daughter-in-law currently drives a full-size van. As \nthe mother of four young children, she has needed the space and \nflexibility a van provides in order to accommodate the necessary safety \nseats for my grandchildren. Now that her children are getting older and \nare able to travel without car safety seats, she is looking into \npurchasing a station wagon. Such a vehicle will meet her needs while \nsaving fuel over the long term.\n  As consumer demands change because of trends and fuel prices, \nautomakers will change to meet that demand. These changes in auto \nmanufacturing should be driven by consumer choice, not by a government-\nmandated arbitrary standard.\n  The Bond-Levin amendment is supported by the AFL-CIO, the UAW, the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, the automotive industry, the American Farm \nBureau Federation and a number of other organizations.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Bond-Levin amendment. It meets \nour environmental, safety and economic needs in a balanced and \nresponsible way, contributing to the continued and needed harmonization \nof our energy and environmental policies.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I support increasing corporate average \nfuel economy standards. In fact, I have supported strengthening CAFE \nstandards for several years, and in 2002 I introduced legislation that \nwould have significantly improved such standards. My strong support for \nraising CAFE standards makes it all the more difficult for me to oppose \nthe amendment offered by Senator Durbin this evening.\n  When this body considers legislation, we must always be mindful of \ndistinguishing between the advisability and the feasibility of the \nproposal before us. I strongly support the Durbin amendment's goals of \nlowering our reliance on foreign oil and of reducing\n\n[[Page S7262]]\n\nthe emission of greenhouse gases. I strongly support those goals. But \nthis amendment, sadly, does not appear to be achievable without \nsignificantly and detrimentally affecting our economy.\n  Mr. President, there are realistic options available to us. For \nexample, I support legislation that would require passenger cars and \nlight trucks to meet the same average fuel economy standard of 27.5 \nmiles within a reasonable amount of time. I will continue to work \ntowards such achievable and beneficial improvements to our Nation's \naverage fuel economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has 6 minutes 53 \nseconds. The Senator from Missouri has 1 minute 50 seconds.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Take a look at this chart and see what is happening in America. As \nthe price of gasoline goes up, this veracious appetite for SUVs is \ngoing down. SUV sales in America are declining, with a 19-percent \ndecrease from the first quarter of 2004 to 2005.\n  Detroit, are you listening? Are you listening to consumers across \nAmerica? They do not like to take expensive gasoline and put it into an \nSUV that gets terrible mileage. They are telling you what the future is \ngoing to look like when we have $50- and $60- and $70- and $80- and \n$90-a-barrel oil coming into the United States.\n  The consumers are speaking already. Sadly, their response is not \nbeing picked up. Sadly, their response is not being picked up by some \nof the major manufacturers of U.S. automobiles.\n  Take a look at this chart. The Chevy Suburban: I know the Chevy \nSuburban. The car I am provided in the Senate is a Chevy Suburban. It \nis a great car but a big, heavy car. It is picked for that reason for \nsecurity purposes. Whatever. But take a look at the comparable sales: \nthe Toyota Prius, 34,225 in U.S. sales so far in 2005; 35,756 Ford \nExpeditions; 24,000 Chevy Suburbans.\n  The point I am making is the American consumer's appetite is growing \nfor a car which Detroit is not making. We are, sadly, 2 years behind. \nThese Toyota Priuses, which one of our colleagues in the Senate drives, \nhappen to be cars for which you can get 50 miles a gallon and more. \nPeople want them, but they cannot buy an American version. What is \nDetroit waiting for?\n  Look where we are as a nation. When we took the leadership--Senator \nBond may call this Soviet-style leadership, command-and-control \nleadership--in 1975 and said we were going to have more fuel-efficient \nvehicles, look at that increase in average miles per gallon in a 10-\nyear period of time--dramatic. Look what has happened since then--flat-\nlining.\n  As we have increased our dependence on foreign oil, our cars and \ntrucks are less and less fuel efficient. The end is near, my friends. \nIt is going to reach us sooner rather than later if we do not accept \nthe reality that we need to say, if America is going to be truly less \ndependent on foreign oil, we have to set standards that move us toward \nenergy conservation and energy efficiency. The first place to start is \nin the cars and trucks we drive.\n  I think if a President, if a Congress, stood up and said: ``America, \nwe are in this together; we are challenging Detroit to come out with a \nfuel-efficient car; we need one that is going to make America less \ndependent on foreign oil so we do not get involved in wars, so we do \nnot have to walk hand-in-hand with Saudi sheiks around America; we want \nto be less dependent and will you join us, America, the businesses and \nfamilies of this country would stand up and say: We are ready.\n  I wish to say, in response to the Senator from Ohio, the Chair of the \nSenate Auto Caucus, Mr. Voinovich, I could not agree with him more. \nThis is a hugely important industry. It is in trouble because the \nmarket share for American automobile manufacturers continues to \ndecline. They are building cars that Americans are not buying. \nAmericans are looking to Japanese and German and other cars instead.\n  There is a message there. We have to revitalize this industry by \nthinking forward instead of thinking backward. And thinking forward \nsays, the price of gas is going up. You better have a more fuel-\nefficient vehicle. You can reach it if you use innovation and \ncreativity. Unfortunately, that is not occurring today.\n  Let me close with a comment I opened with from BusinessWeek magazine:\n\n       As Congress puts the final touches on a massive new energy \n     bill, lawmakers are about to blow it. That's because the \n     bill, which they hope to pass by the end of July, almost \n     certainly won't include the one policy initiative that could \n     seriously reduce American's dependence on foreign oil: a \n     government-mandated increase in the average fuel economy of \n     new cars, SUVs, light trucks, and vans.\n\n  The Bond-Levin amendment does not do that. It does not increase fuel \nefficiency. It does not reduce dependence on foreign oil. The amendment \nwhich I offer does, and I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think there is a clear difference. My \ncolleague from Illinois has a political idea of a fuel standard and \nsays that will increase efficiency. The difference is that the Bond-\nLevin approach relies on what is working and that is having sound \nscience, administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration, pushing the manufacturers of cars to improve mileage as \nquickly as it can be improved, using science and technology, rather \nthan forcing them to go to small automobiles which, according to NHTSA, \nhave caused between 1,300 and 2,600 more vehicle deaths a year as a \nresult of the lower weight cars needed to meet arbitrary fuel standards \npreviously imposed.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Durbin amendment but to support \nthe Bond-Levin amendment to ensure that we maintain safe, efficient \nautomobiles, getting better fuel economy, and providing choices for our \nfamilies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, does the Senator from Missouri have time \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 37 seconds.\n  Does the Senator wish to reserve that time or yield it back?\n  Mr. BOND. I reserve my time.\n  Dr. DURBIN. In the interest of picking up a few more votes, I yield \nback all my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois yields back all his \ntime.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield back all my time as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back his time. All time has \nexpired.\n  The junior Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I have talked to both sides to get \npermission for a unanimous consent request allowing me to offer an \namendment that is acceptable to both sides on a voice vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 819\n\n  So I ask unanimous consent to be permitted to offer amendment No. 819 \nand proceed to a vote right after I explain it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, some of us have to catch a \nflight. I was hoping we would get the vote off here.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me work this through. This will take a minute or 2 for \nthe Senator from Missouri. It has been agreed to. It will be a voice \nvote, and then we will move immediately to the votes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object if it is more than a minute. That is how close \nit is. I can give him a minute.\n  Mr. TALENT. Thirty seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Talent], for himself, Mr. \n     Johnson, Mr. Bond, and Mr. Dorgan, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 819.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To increase the allowable credit for fuel use under the \n           alternatively fueled vehicle purchase requirement)\n\n       On page 420, strike lines 5 through 16 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 702.

Will the chairman yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the chairman. As the chairman is aware, repeal of \nthe Public Company Utility Holding Act of 1935 has been a priority of \nthe Senate\n\n[[Page S7267]]\n\nBanking Committee for almost 25 years. As recently as 1997 and 1999, \nthe Senate Banking Committee reported PUHCA repeal bills out of \ncommittee. As chairman of the Banking Committee, I have been pleased to \nwork with the Chairman of the Energy Committee to ensure that PUHCA \nrepeal was included as part of a comprehensive Energy bill.\n  I congratulate the chairman for reporting a bill out of Committee \nthat includes PUHCA repeal. Nevertheless, I have concerns that the \nexpanded merger review authority for FERC provided for in the \nElectricity title undermines the important policy goals behind PUHCA \nrepeal. It is widely understood that PUHCA has served its purpose and \nis outdated. Now, PUHCA acts as a barrier to interstate capital flows, \nand other Federal laws make the PUHCA regime redundant.\n  The purpose of PUHCA repeal legislation is to eliminate these \nduplicative and unnecessary regulatory burdens. I am concerned that \nPUHCA repeal is undermined by legislation providing FERC with enhanced \nmerger review authority over utility companies. I do not believe that \nCongress should repeal PUHCA, only to replace it with a burdensome \nregulatory framework administered by FERC. But I am afraid that may be \nexactly what we are doing in the Electricity title of this bill. I do \nnot believe that Congress should require enhanced FERC merger authority \nas a prerequisite for PUHCA repeal.\n  I would ask the chairman to consult with me during conference to \nensure against this result. As the Senate Banking Committee has done \nrecently, I think it is important that we repeal PUHCA without creating \nadditional regulatory burdens.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator from Alabama for his remarks, and I \nshare his concern regarding additional FERC merger review authority. I \nlook forward to working with him in conference to ensure that PUHCA \nrepeal is not accompanied by the grant of unnecessary merger review \nauthority to FERC.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Thank you, Mr. chairman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/23/senate-section/article/S7267-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7267-S7284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION PROPERTY DEPRECIATION\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to speak about an amendment I \nfiled to the tax title of this bill on electric transmission property \ndepreciation and engage Mr. Grassley in a colloquy on this important \nissue if I may.\n  I did not push this issue to a vote during the committee markup, and \nI don't intend to do so on the floor either since I understand the \nprovision is included in the House version of the bill and enjoys broad \nsupport in both the House and the Senate.\n  That said, I felt it was important to underscore the importance of \nenergy infrastructure in the United States. It is completely irrelevant \nhow much we have in the area of energy-producing resources if we can't \ntransport that energy to where it's needed.\n  And electric transmission capacity is a prime example.\n  There are a number of barriers to building additional transmission \ncapacity, among them being stringent regulations at the federal, state, \nand local levels; NIMBY-ism, in other words, those who want it, but not \nin their backyard; and high capital cost.\n  My amendment--which would have incorporated my bill, S. 815, into the \ntax title--addresses the substantial investment required to build \nadditional capacity.\n  I thank Senators Snowe, Bingaman, Bunning, and Smith for cosponsoring \nboth the bill and the amendment.\n  The provision would shorten the depreciation life of electric \ntransmission property from the current 20 years to 15 years, thereby \nsubstantially reducing the cost.\n  I understand Chairman Grassley's hesitancy to include provisions in \nthe Senate package that are already covered in the House bill. However, \nI am asking for the Chairman's commitment to ensure this important \nprovision is included in a final energy package.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree that energy infrastructure, particularly \nelectric transmission capacity, is a critical component of our domestic \nenergy policy, and I am committed to helping you ensure that it is \nincluded in the final energy bill.\n\n\n               Sec. 261, Hydroelectric Relicensing Reform\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, Section 261 of the underlying bill \ncontains provisions designed to reform the hydroelectric relicensing \nprocess. These provisions are the result of a hard-won compromise, and \nI thank the chairman and ranking member, along with Senators Craig, \nSmith and Feinstein for their leadership on this issue. In particular, \nthese provisions significantly differ from previous House- and Senate-\npassed versions, as they will allow States, tribes and the public to \npropose alternative licensing conditions, and will further allow these \nentities to trigger the trial-type hearing process outlined in this \nsection. I believe these public participation provisions are key \nimprovements in this legislation. I would also like to more fully \nexplore the process by which alternative conditions proposed by these \nstakeholders should be considered.\n  Before an alternative condition or prescription to a license may be \napproved, the Secretary must concur with the judgment of the license \napplicant that it will either cost significantly less to implement, or \nresult in improved operation of the hydro project for electricity \nproduction--at the same time it provides for adequate protection of the \nresource--or in the case of fishway prescriptions, will be no less \nprotective than the fishway initially proposed by the Secretary. This \nprovision does not provide the license applicant a so-called veto power \nover proposed alternatives, because this judgment requires the \nSecretary's concurrence. In addition, it is the Senate's intent that \nthese judgments be supported by substantial evidence as required by \nSection 313 of the Federal Power Act. I would like to ask the senior \nSenator from New Mexico the following question: If the Secretary \ndetermines that a license applicant's judgment has been based on \ninaccurate data and thus fails to meet the test of being supported by \nsubstantial evidence, can the Secretary withhold his or her \nconcurrence?\n  Mr. Domenici. The Senator from Washington is correct in expressing \nour intent that the license applicant's judgment be supported by \nsubstantial evidence. It is not our intent to provide an incentive for \napplicants to provide poor data in order to prompt the rejection of a \ncondition by other stakeholders. If the Secretary of a resource agency \ndetermines that the evidence provided by the license applicant is of \ninsufficient quality and therefore does not meet the substantial \nevidence test, the Secretary should not concur with the license \napplicant's judgment in the matter.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I am pleased join with the distinguished \nmajority leader in support of H.R. 6.\n  I am particularly pleased with the bill's support for integrated coal \ngasification, IGCC, technology development and deployment into \ncommercial use. Our Nation needs a comprehensive energy policy which \npromotes new, cleaner, and more advanced generation technologies.\n  I have been increasingly concerned with the challenges associated \nwith developing IGCC technology for burning Western coal. Western coal \nis a valuable resource and crucial to our economy; however, both cost \nand technological difficulties have prevented development of IGCC in \nthe West. That is why I support a provision for a Western IGCC \nDemonstration Project, Section 407. This project would allow for \ndevelopment of an IGCC technology designed to use Western coal and in a \ncost-effective manner.\n  I have also been increasingly concerned with the need to address \nclimate change. The promise of IGCC technology's ability to reduce \ncarbon dioxide emissions should be realized as soon as possible. That \nis why the Western IGCC demonstration project shall include a carbon \ntechnology component.\n  I wish to also take this opportunity to clarify an important point. \nThere have been media reports expressing concern that the Western IGCC \ndemonstration project is special legislation designed to benefit a \nsingle company building a new project in Wyoming. I can assure you that \nneither this provision, nor any other provision I have sponsored, is \ndesigned to benefit any specific project or any specific company. My \nsincere objective is simply to provide for the development of an IGCC\n\n[[Page S7268]]\n\ndemonstration project in the West, using Western coal, regardless of \nwho owns or develops it.\n  This provision is designed to provide incentives to an IGCC project \nusing Western coal at high altitudes. I have heard from many \nstakeholders, the utility industry, environmental groups and energy \nconsumers, regarding the potential environmental and energy benefits of \nthis new technoloy. However, I have also heard that IGCC has been \napplied primarily in the East. It is not yet demonstrated to be viable \nand cost-effective in the high altitude West using the low-rank coals \nmined in Western States. This provision would allow the region to prove \nthe viability of this important technology, assess carbon capture and \nsequestration opportunities, and, I hope, lead to its successful \ndeployment in my region of the country.\n  The purpose of the Western coal demonstration project will be to show \nthat coal gasification works for the different kinds of coals mined in \nthe West. This includes the lower energy coals like those mined in \nWyoming's Powder River Basin, and it includes higher energy coals like \nthose found in Colorado. These coals vary by energy content, and in \nother ways such as moisture and sulfur content. My colleague from \nWyoming and I want to ensure that the demonstration project will show \nthe feasibility of gasification for the entire range of Western coals. \nIn that way, hurdles to gasification can be removed and our Nation can \nmove forward into a cleaner energy future, and one that recognizes the \nimportance of our abundance of coal resources.\n  I want to close with a special tribute to Senator Thomas for his \ndiligence in this effort. We are both Western Senators and we share a \nconcern that the Western United States should benefit from IGCC \ntechnology as much as the Eastern United States. I want to thank him \nfor his initiative and support for this provision.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank Senator Salazar for his support for H.R. 6 and \nshare his interest in developing a sound and forward-looking energy \npolicy for our Nation. I understand his concern that the West enjoy \nclean energy generation. I look forward to working with him to move \nH.R. 6 as quickly as possible.\n\n\n                        Innovative Technologies\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nmanager of the bill in a brief colloquy. I understand that title XIV of \nthe bill before us includes incentives for ``innovative technologies,'' \nincluding gasification projects that will allow us to use our vast \ndomestic coal reserves to produce clean transportation fuels.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the distinguished Senator from New Mexico for \naccepting clarifying language that will allow additional coal-to-fuel \nfacilities to qualify for the loan guarantees included in title XIV of \nthe Energy bill.\n  As a result of these changes, the incentives included in section \n1403, which include loan guarantees, would apply to the development of \nprojects that will utilize various gasification technologies to produce \nclean transportation fuels from any of our coal types, including \nbituminus, sub-bituminous, and lignite coals.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Again, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Energy \nCommittee for working with me to ensure that facilities in my State \nwill be eligible for these incentives for coal-to-liquids technologies. \nIt is my hope that North Dakota's coal resources will play an important \nrole in reducing our dependence on foreign oil, allowing us to create \njobs here at home and clean our environment.\n\n\n                          Governor's Authority\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I would like to discuss a Governor's \nauthority to approve the issuance of a license for an offshore LNG \nfacility.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand that intend to emphasize the current role \nof a Governor in the licensing of offshore LNG facilities pursuant to \nthe Deepwater Port Act.\n  Mr. VITTER. The Senator is correct. In Louisiana, there has been a \ntremendous amount of controversy involving the licensing of offshore \nLNG terminals recently related mainly to a technology for reheating the \ngas called open rack vaporization. My amendment is designed to \nemphasize the Governor's current authority under the Deepwater Port \nAct. Under current law the Deepwater Port Act allows the Governor of a \nstate to approve--or be presumed to approve--the issuance of a license \nfor an offshore LNG facility.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator saying that a Governor currently has a \nclear opportunity to disapprove that a license be issued for any \noffshore LNG terminal?\n  Mr. VITTER. That is correct. So, no changes to existing law are \nnecessary in order for the Governor to approve or disapprove issuance \nof a license for offshore LNG facilities.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How many times has a Governor used this authority to \napprove or disapprove that a license be issued?\n  Mr. VITTER. A Governor has never attempted to use this authority. In \nthe case of Louisiana, we have two licensed offshore LNG facilities and \nthe Governor of Louisiana approved both of these facilities.\n  Louisiana has lost thousands of jobs due to the high costs of energy. \nThe underlying bill does much to address this challenge and LNG will \nplay an important role in addressing the increasing demand for natural \ngas.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico for clarifying the Governor's \nauthority to approve or disapprove an offshore LNG facility.\n\n\n        blm policy on oil and gas development in potash reserve\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak to an amendment I have \nfiled to address the Bureau of Land Management's policy toward \ndevelopment of much needed oil and gas resources in the potash reserve. \nNotwithstanding the strong bipartisan consensus that the U.S. must \nexpeditiously develop its readily available domestic oil and gas \nresources, for decades the Bureau of Land Management has restricted \ndevelopment of large volumes of oil and gas located in the Known Potash \nLeasing Area near Carlsbad, NM. BLM has authority to permit compatible \noil and gas development in conjunction with potash mining in the area, \nbut the agency has failed to do so due to asserted concerns with \nadverse impact on potash mining reserves and mine safety. For a long \ntime the oil and gas industry has had the technical ability to drill in \nthe potash region without creating any such threat to these potash \nmining interests. Concerns with BLM's administration of the Interior \nSecretary's October 1986 order have been raised with Congress over many \nyears. However, given the Nation's continuing economic stress due to \nthe oil and gas price and supply situation, and the policy imperative \nunderlying the current energy bill debate to facilitate resource \ndevelopment on Federal lands where Federal rules or policies have \nunnecessarily inhibited such activity, the time has come to \nexpeditiously resolve the administrative problems that have impeded \nreasonable oil and gas development in the Nation's potash reserve.\n  The BLM has denied approximately 190 applications for drilling \npermits and applicants strongly believe that their permits have been \ndenied without appropriate consideration of their technical ability to \ndevelop oil and gas in the potash area while not creating any safety \nrisks to potash mining or jeopardizing economically recoverable potash \nreserves.\n  My amendment would address this disadvantage for oil and gas drilling \npermits in the potash area, insuring that BLM allows drilling \ncompatibly with the interest in maintaining potash reserves and mining \nin the area. Specifically, my amendment would still allow BLM to deny \npermits out of concern for adverse impact on potash mining, but only if \nthe agency could specify with particularity the reasons why approval of \nthe oil and gas permit would jeopardize potash mining safety or \nthreaten recoverable potash reserves the value of which exceeded the \nvalue of the recoverable oil and gas associated with the relevant \npermit.\n  I understand that the chairman is well aware of the protracted \nhistory of this problem and has directed his staff to investigate the \nsituation with BLM. Indeed, this week my staff attended a meeting with \nthe BLM State director and the Chairman's staff to discuss this issue.\n\n[[Page S7269]]\n\n  I certainly could offer the amendment for a vote at this time, but \nmay I first inquire of the chairman whether he shares my concern with \nthe BLM policy regarding the amount of oil and gas drilling being \npermitted in the potash region?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This has been an evolving problem for some time now and \nI share the Senator's concern about whether the proper balance is being \nstruck. Particularly in light of available technologies, I believe that \nthere should be a way to produce oil and gas in the potash area without \ninterfering with the recovery of the potash resource. My desire is to \nsee both a vibrant potash industry and a vibrant oil and gas industry \nin the region, with both generating strong economic activity and \nemployment.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I share the Chairman's views and would furthr inquire \nwhether the chairman would be willing to work with me through the \ncourse of the conference on the energy bill to assure that this problem \nwith BLM policy is properly addressed?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would tell the Senator that I would be pleased to \ngive him that commitment.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chairman.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I wish to clarify for my colleagues the \nintent of section 1270 of the underlying Energy bill, which is a \nprovision of extreme importance to my Washington State constituents. \nRatepayers in my State were harmed by the Western energy crisis and the \nmanipulation and fraudulent practices of Enron in wholesale electricity \nmarkets. A number of proceedings remain underway at the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, which will determine the relief granted to \nconsumers harmed by Enron's unlawful trading practices. An important \nissue that remains is whether utilities--such as Washington State's \nSnohomish County Public Utility District--should be forced to make \ntermination payments to Enron, for power Enron never delivered in the \nmidst of its scandalous collapse into bankruptcy.\n  The intent of section 1270 of the underlying bill and the technical \ncorrection we have adopted today is simply to affirm that the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission has exclusive jurisdiction under sections \n205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act to determine whether these \ntermination payments should be required. This provision expresses \nCongress's belief that the issues surrounding the potential requirement \nto make termination payments associated with wholesale power contracts \nare inseparable and inextricably linked to the commission's \njurisdictional responsibilities.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would like to inquire of the Senator from Washington, \ndoes section 1270 predetermine or in any way prejudice the manner in \nwhich FERC employs its jurisdiction in matters currently pending before \nthe Commission?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. This provision in no way prejudices or predetermines \nFERC's decisions in those matters. During the Senate Energy Committee's \nwork on this legislation, the supporters of this amendment and I \ninitially considered offering an amendment that would have gone further \nto require a certain outcome, had the commission made certain findings. \nWe chose not to pursue that amendment in response to concerns that were \nraised by colleagues. Section 1270 of this legislation is completely \nneutral regarding how the commission uses its authority under sections \n205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act. As such, the provision does not \nin any way implicate what is known as the Mobile-Sierra doctrine, \nrelated to which standard FERC should apply to its review of \njurisdictional wholesale power contracts.\n  Mr. CRAIG. How does the technical amendment adopted today further \nclarify the committee and Congress's intent in regard to section 1270 \nof the underlying legislation?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The clarifications to section 1270 effectuated by the \namendment accepted today are consistent with the committee's intent in \nadopting section 1270. In addition, they are completely consistent with \nSupreme Court precedent.\n  The committee sought assurances that section 1270 would not disturb \nunderlying legal doctrines such as the Mobile-Sierra doctrine or the \nseparation of powers principles. The amendment provides further clarity \nthat section 1270 is not intended to otherwise disturb or modify the \nMobile-Sierra doctrine by adding the phrase ``or contrary to the public \ninterest.'' This phrase, when coupled with the standard recital of \nFERC's exclusive authority to determine whether a charge is just and \nreasonable, makes it clear that Congress is making no pronouncements \nregarding the manner in which FERC exercises its authority, but rather \nonly that it is the appropriate forum to resolve these issues. Congress \nis giving no guidance to FERC on Mobile-Sierra one way or another \nthrough this provision.\n  The committee's overarching intent with respect to section 1270 was \nto ensure that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and not the \nbankruptcy court involved in the Enron matter, decides all of the \nissues surrounding whether termination payments are lawful. The \naddition of the phrase ``rate schedules and contracts entered \nthereunder'' ensures that result.\n  In addition, this clarification is completely consistent with Supreme \nCourt decisions permitting Congress to give a Federal agency the \nauthority to resolve matters that are also normally addressed by our \njudicial branch of government. As the Supreme Court stated in a case \nentitled Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, \n854 (1986),\n\n       ``looking beyond form to the substance of what Congress has \n     done'', we are persuaded that the congressional authorization \n     of limited CFTC jurisdiction over a narrow class of common \n     law claims as an incident to the CFTC's primary, and \n     unchallenged, adjudicative function does not create a \n     substantial threat to the separation of powers. Thomas v. \n     Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co., 473 U.S. 568, 589 \n     (1985).\n\n  Similarly, in this instance, the grant of authority to FERC to decide \nthis matter is exceedingly narrow insofar as it relates solely to the \nlegality of Enron collecting additional profits in the form of \ntermination payments for power not delivered. Clearly, it is directly \nrelated to the agency's core function to ensure just and reasonable \nrates and guard against market manipulation. Moreover, these are public \nrights that are at stake in this dispute--the rights of electric \nratepayers across the country to just and reasonable rates, rights that \nhave existed under federal statute since 1935--and not mere private \nrights that should be resolved by a non-article III bankruptcy \ntribunal. Accordingly, the clarification provided by the amendment is \ncompletely consistent with Supreme Court precedent on the separation of \npowers principle.\n  Mr CARPER. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to discuss \nwith my friend, the Senator from Montana, a tax incentive which I \nbelieve is very important to our efforts to reduce fuel consumption in \nAmerica. As you know, Senator Baucus is the ranking Democrat on the \nSenate Finance Committee and has a great understanding of our nation's \ntax policy, as well as a great institutional memory of tax legislation \nthrough the years. Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley, the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, provide us with advice and counsel concerning \ntax policy and do a superb job in that role.\n  The specific incentive I would like to discuss with my friend from \nMontana is a provision included in the House energy bill to encourage \nthe use of clean diesel passenger vehicles. It is called the ``diesel \nadvanced lean-burn'' tax credit, and it would give consumers a credit \non their income taxes when they purchase a clean diesel vehicle meeting \nstated fuel efficiency and environmental requirements. I am very \nsupportive of this provision and want to encourage my colleagues to \nconsider it when the Senate energy bill is conferenced with the House \nbill.\n  Why is that? Why do I think this provision is so important to our \nenergy policy? For these reasons.\n  Diesel fuel contains more energy than gasoline, resulting in fuel \neconomy increases of more than 40 percent compared to equivalent gas \npowered autos.\n  In fact, the Department of Energy estimates that 30 percent diesel \npenetration in the U.S. passenger vehicle market by 2020 would reduce \nnet crude oil imports by 350,000 barrels per day.\n  So why aren't diesel vehicles more common on U.S. highways? Because \nuntil recently, they have been considered significantly dirtier in \nterms of air pollution. But the technology has\n\n[[Page S7270]]\n\nchanged. Today, you will have a difficult time telling a new diesel car \nfrom its gasoline counterpart. New diesels are clean, quiet, and \npowerful. And they will get even cleaner with the introduction of low \nsulfur diesel fuel in the United States late next year as the result of \nnew regulations.\n  Diesel engines have become increasingly popular in Europe over the \nlast 20 years to the extent that market penetration now exceeds 40 \npercent. The situation is very different in the U.S. where diesel \naccounts for only 1 percent of light vehicles.\n  Clean diesel engines provide the perfect platform for the use of \nBioDiesel which comes from products grown here at home by American \nfarmers. The more diesel engines on the road, the greater demand for \nthis renewable product, and the less petroleum imports from overseas to \nmeet our fuel needs.\n  We now have the opportunity to take advantage of the advances in \nclean diesel technology and to do what we can to get more of these fuel \nefficient vehicles on the road.\n  In the 2003 Energy Bill there was a tax incentive for ``new advanced \nlean burn motor vehicles,'' and the House recently passed an Energy \nBill containing essentially the same provision.\n  So with that background, I wanted to ask my friend from Montana \nwhether it is correct that high efficiency diesel vehicles would be \nconsidered ``lean burning'' vehicles?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. First, let me compliment my friend for his thoughtful \ndiscussion of this issue. The Senator from Delaware has obviously done \na fair amount of homework on automotive technology, and I appreciate \nhis insights on the benefits of clean diesel technology. Let me also \ncongratulate the Senator on his work with Senator Voinovich and others \non the recently introduced legislation to clean up heavy-duty diesel \nengines through retrofitting. We adopted that measure as an amendment \nto the energy bill earlier this week, and I think it is an important \naddition, so I thank the Senator for his work in that regard.\n  Now, to respond to the Senator's question concerning the diesel lean-\nburn provision from the House bill. Under the House provision, the tax \ncredit would be available for the purchase of diesel vehicles meeting \ncertain fuel efficiency and emissions standards. As long as a vehicle \nmet those standards, it would be considered a ``lean burning'' vehicle \nand thereby merit the tax credit to the purchaser.\n  Mr. CARPER. The 2003 conference legislation contained incentives for \nlean-burn diesel vehicles. Is it fair to say that you are interested in \nthis technology and in promoting cleaner diesel cars in the U.S.?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I agree with my colleague that lean-burn diesel is \npromising technology. We did include the diesel lean-burn credit in the \nenergy conference measure in 2003. As you know, in the Senate bill, we \nhave included similar incentives for the purchase of other energy-\nefficient vehicles--hybrids, alternative fuel vehicles and fuel cell \nvehicles. We often start out with different positions than our House \ncounterparts, and typically we merge together the best pieces of each \nbill in conference. I think any new technology warrants serious \nconsideration if it can help make U.S. vehicles more fuel efficient and \nlessen our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Mr. CARPER. And is it your thought that the Senate conferees should \ncarefully consider the tax incentives provided in the House version of \nthe bill for these types of vehicles?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I believe we should, and I believe we will. I am \nconfident that the clean diesel credit will get very careful \nconsideration by the Senate conferees.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank my friend for taking a moment to discuss this \nmatter with me, and I would encourage my colleagues who will be \nnegotiating the tax provisions of the Energy Bill with the House of \nRepresentatives to do just that--to carefully consider the benefits \nthat new clean diesel vehicles have to offer. I think the benefits are \nsubstantial, that diesel passenger vehicles are already very clean and \nwill get even cleaner next year when low sulfur fuel becomes available, \nand that a transition toward this technology will pay big dividends for \nthe country over the next few years. This is something we can do which \nwill have an almost immediate positive effect, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to consider this incentive positively.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak to a particular section \nof the comprehensive energy bill (S. 10) that we have been discussing \nfor the past 2 weeks. My comments focus specifically on section 1270 of \nthis legislation.\n  Section 1270 was an amendment I offered in the Energy & Natural \nResources Committee mark-up of this legislation. It was accepted after \nconsiderable debate and discussion, on a bipartisan voice vote. Since \nthen, I have continued to work with my colleagues on the Energy \nCommittee, to further clarify and perfect this language. In fact, I was \npleased to work with my colleague from Idaho, Senator Craig, on a \ntechnical amendment to this language, amendment No. 895, to refine it \neven further.\n  This provision, entitled ``Relief for Extraordinary Violations,'' is \nextremely important to the consumers of Washington State and ratepayers \nin other parts of the West, who bore tremendous costs as a result of \nEnron's schemes to manipulate our wholesale electricity markets. The \nprinciple at the heart of this provision is simple. The consumers of \nWashington State must not be forced to become the deep-pockets for \nEnron's bankruptcy. The same ratepayers who have paid so dearly for the \nWestern energy crisis and Enron's schemes to manipulate markets should \nnot be forced to pay even more--four years later--for power that Enron \nnever even delivered.\n  I must thank my colleagues on the Energy Committee for their \nthoughtful consideration of this issue, particularly my colleagues from \nthe Pacific Northwest and West as a whole who have seen first-hand the \ntoll the crisis has taken on our economy and our constituents. I must \nalso express my gratitude to the rest of the members of the committee, \nand to the chairman and ranking member for indulging what was a very \nthoughtful debate on this issue.\n  At the conclusion of the committee debate, this Senator was extremely \nsatisfied; first, because of the very nature of the debate itself, in \nwhich--for almost an entire hour--a bipartisan group of Senators \nfocused their valuable time and attention on a situation that is highly \ncomplicated, and likely unprecedented in the history and application of \nour Nation's energy laws. And second, because, at the end of the day, \nthe committee struck a blow for justice and for Western consumers. It \nwas an important statement. This is not the kind of country where we \nshould reward Enron for its criminal conspiracy to commit fraud; a \nfraud of historic proportions perpetrated against the consumers of the \nWest.\n  As my colleagues appreciate by now, my State was particularly ravaged \nby the western energy crisis of 2000-2001. One of my State's public \nutility districts, Public Utility District No. 1 of Snohomish County, \nhad a long-term contract with Enron, to purchase power. The contract \nwas terminated once Enron began its scandalous collapse into \nbankruptcy. Nonetheless, Enron has asserted before the bankruptcy court \nthe right to collect all of the profits it would have made under the \ncontract through so-called ``termination payments.'' Enron has made \nthis claim even though Enron never delivered the power under the \ncontract, even though Enron had obtained its authority to sell power \nfraudulently, and even though Enron was in gross violation of its legal \nauthority to sell power at the very time the contract was entered into. \nThis has been demonstrated by the criminal guilty pleas of the senior \nmanagers of Enron's Western power trading operation, in which it has \nbeen admitted that Enron was engaged in a massive criminal conspiracy \nto rig electric markets and rip off electric ratepayers. But it has \nbeen further illustrated by the now-infamous Enron tapes, in which \nEnron employees discuss many unsavory topics, including specifically \nhow they were ``weaving lies together'' in their negotiations related \nto the contract with Snohomish.\n\n  I will tell my colleagues that there is no way under the sun that I \nbelieve my constituents owe Enron another penny. Not one single penny \nmore. What this amendment does is ensure that, when the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission FERC comes to a conclusion\n\n[[Page S7271]]\n\nlater this year about how to cleanup the Enron mess, that the \nbankruptcy court cannot overturn FERC's decision about whether these \n``termination payments'' are just, reasonable or in the public \ninterest. It says to FERC, ``do your job to protect consumers, and when \nyou make a decision, that decision will stand.'' Interpreting our \nnation's energy consumer protection laws is not the job of a bankruptcy \njudge.\n  Now, this Senator has a very strong opinion on this matter in \ngeneral. I believe there is no way no stretch of the imagination, or \ninterpretation of law in which these termination payments could be \ndeemed just, reasonable or in the public interest, knowing everything \nwe know today about what Enron did to the consumers of my state. In \nfact, during committee debate on the underlying provision in this bill, \nsome of my colleagues suggested that we should just out-right abrogate \nthese contracts; simply declare them null and void on their face. But \nwhat we recognized, relying on the legal expertise of the committee \nstaff, is that an act like that--as tempting as it may seem--would pose \ncertain constitutional issues. We recognized that this provision \nsection 1270--is the best way for Congress to express its will in this \nmatter.\n  I have, as my colleagues know, had substantial differences with FERC \nover the course of the past few years. But I am glad to say today, \nafter 4 long years, it appears that the commission may be on the right \ntrack on this issue. This March, FERC issued a ruling in which the \ncommission definitely found that the termination payments at issue here \n``are based on profits Enron projected to receive under its long-term \nwholesale power contracts executed during the period when Enron was in \nviolation of conditions of its market-based rate authority.'' For the \nfirst time, FERC found that Enron was in violation of its market-based \nrate authority at the time victimized utilities such as Washington's \nSnohomish PUD inked power sales contract with the now-bankrupt energy \ngiant. That FERC process is on-track to wrap-up this year; but so long \nas that process is ongoing, utilities like Snohomish have been \noperating under the threat that the bankruptcy court would swoop in and \ndemand payments for Enron, regardless of the pattern of market \nmanipulation and fraud. In a series of rulings, the bankruptcy court \nhas expressed its will to do just that. What this provision does is \nensure the bankruptcy court cannot force these utilities and their \nconsumers to make termination payments that are unjust, unreasonable or \ncontrary to the public interest.\n  Section 1270 states that notwithstanding any other provision of law, \nand specifically the bankruptcy code, FERC ``shall have exclusive \njurisdiction'' to make these determinations. Many of my colleagues \nmight naturally assume that this provision merely sets forth what is \nalready the case. But as I stated earlier, that is not necessarily the \ncase. This provision is necessary and critical because the Federal \nbankruptcy court has already concluded that it will not defer to FERC \nwith respect to whether our constituents will be required to make \ntermination payments. Not only has the bankruptcy court not deferred to \nFERC, it compounded the seriousness of the issue by enjoining FERC from \nproceeding with its own specific inquiry into whether Enron is owed the \ntermination payments. It forced FERC to stop on a matter that FERC had \nsaid required its special expertise.\n\n  Imagine making it through the arduous and frustrating, years-long \nprocess of proving the case against Enron and proving it to FERC, only \nto find out at the end of the day that the bankruptcy court would \nintervene and force these termination payments anyway. It is this \nsituation--a collision between FERC and the bankruputcy court that this \nlegislation addresses. And what the Congress is saying with this \namendment, as counsel for the Energy Committee stated during our \nextended discussion, is that ``the Commission, not the bankruptcy \n[court], is the proper forum in which these question be resolved.'' \nThat is certainly my view, and the view of many of us who represent \nratepayers harmed by Enron.\n  I do not assume this position in denigration of the responsibility of \nthe bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy court has an important role to \nplay in our law and our economic community. However, I do think it is \nfair to say that it is a forum in which it naturally looks first to \nmaximizing the assets of the estate. In contrast, the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission's first obligation is to protect our nation's \nratepayers. In this very unique context, in which a seller of \nelectricity that has fraudulently and criminally manipulated the market \nin violation of the tariffs on file with the commission--and where the \nseller is now seeking to reap the profits from that activity in the \nform of termination payments for power never delivered--what we are \nsaying here, unequivocally, is that FERC is the forum in which this \nshould be resolved. FERC is the entity that is supposed to look after \nour nation's ratepayers, and should have make the decision about \nwhether termination payments are permissible under the Federal Power \nAct..\n  Given the nuanced, legal nature of this provision, I can assure my \ncolleagues that this ``rifle shot,'' as the ranking minority member of \nthe committee called it, is narrowly drawn in order to minimize any \nunanticipated impacts. It is only applicable to contracts entered into \nduring the electricity crisis with sellers of electricity that \nmanipulated the market to such an extent that they brought about unjust \nand unreasonable rates. There is only one such seller, and that is \nEnron, and there are only a handful of terminated contracts with Enron \nthat haven't been resolved as of this date.\n  As a result, the amendment does not tamper with or otherwise disturb \nlong-standing legal precedents. It does not tamper with the Mobile-\nSierra doctrine, nor does it disturb other recent federal court \ndecisions regarding the relationship of the bankruptcy courts and FERC \nin the context of the rejection in bankruptcy of FERC approved power \nsales contracts. It is, as the ranking minority member of the committee \nobserved, a ``clean shot'' that ``affirms that FERC is the entity with \nthe authority to review whether termination payments associated with \ncancelled Enron power contracts are lawful under the Federal Power \nAct.''\n  The ultimate disposition of this issue is of paramount concern to my \nconstituents. It will decide whether they will be on the hook for more \nthan $120 million, an amount that means more than $400 in the pocket of \neach ratepayer in Snohomish County, WA. It is critical that this issue \nbe decided by the forum with the specialized expertise in matters \nrelating to the sale of electricity with a stated mission of protecting \nratepayers, and that is the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n  Let me conclude by saying that I am very pleased that this provision \nhas broad bipartisan support as well as the support of the Edison \nElectric Institute, the National Rural Electric Co-operative \nAssociation and the American Public Power Association. I believe my \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, said it exactly right when this \namendment was debated in committee, and I am extremely grateful for his \nsupport. He essentially said that no Senator Republican or Democrat \nshould feel any limitation in ``lending their shoulder to this wheel,'' \nto get this situation fixed. Senator Smith, Senator Allen, and Senator \nCraig all played important roles during the mark-up in allowing this \nmeasure to move forward.\n  And I would be remiss if I did not mention the invaluable assistance \nfrom the Senators from Nevada on this issue the minority leader, \nSenator Reid, but also Senator Ensign. While Senator Ensign does not \nserve on the Energy Committee, he played a crucial role in ensuring \nthat colleagues on both sides of the aisle understood the importance \nand reasonableness of this measure, and the importance of this \nprovision to him and to the people of Nevada.\n  I thank my colleagues, look forward to the passage of this provision \nout of the Senate and to working together to ensure this critical \nmeasure is included in legislation that emerges from the Energy bill \nconference with the House of Representatives.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to express my support for a \nprovision in this energy legislation that provides relief for \nWashington State ratepayers who suffered from Enron's market \nmanipulation schemes.\n\n[[Page S7272]]\n\n  All of us from the West Coast remember the energy crisis of 2001, \nwhen consumers and businesses were hit with massive increases in the \ncost of energy. Many in California faced shortages and brownouts. In \nWashington State, we felt the impact as well.\n  Washington State ratepayers have been continually penalized for \nfailures in the energy market and failures by Federal energy \nregulators. While there were many causes for the energy crisis, the \nmost disturbing is the fact that energy companies, such as Enron, \nmanipulated the marketplace to take advantage of consumers.\n  As we saw throughout the crisis, the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission did not take aggressive action to protect consumers from \nmarket manipulation. In fact, over the last several years, as we in the \nWest have sought to clean up the mess that these companies left in \ntheir wake, FERC has continued to drag its regulatory feet.\n  For more than 3 years, many of us in the Northwest delegation have \nbeen urging FERC to better protect consumers, and provide relief to \nratepayers affected by market manipulation. At the height of the 2001 \nenergy crisis, FERC was urging companies to enter into long-term \ncontracts at highly-inflated rates, advice which many Northwest \ncompanies followed.\n  In 2003, FERC found that market manipulation occurred during the 2001 \nenergy crisis, but indicated it would be unlikely that Washington State \nratepayers would be reimbursed for the harm caused by the manipulation. \nWhen Western utilities--including Snohomish PUD, which was hit \nparticularly hard--terminated their contracts with Enron, Enron turned \naround and sued them for ``termination payments.''\n  It was very disturbing for all of us to see FERC agree that there was \nmanipulation, but leave Washington ratepayers holding the bag--with no \nrelief--for the harm they experienced in 2001 and continue to \nexperience today.\n  I am pleased that this energy legislation addresses this important \nissue by giving FERC exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether \ntermination payments are required under certain power contracts are \nunjust and unreasonable.\n  This is wonderful news for Washington State ratepayers because of a \nMarch 2005 order, in which FERC found Enron in violation of its market-\nbased authority at the time Snohomish PUD signed its power contract. \nThis provision ensures Snohomish PUD's ratepayers will not be required \nto pay the now-bankrupt Enron for power the region did not receive.\n  Mr. President, I support this provision as it will protect Northwest \nratepayers and give FERC more tools to better police the energy market.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to thank my colleagues for \nincluding a provision in this bill which give the people of Nevada a \nfair chance to keep their hard earned money away from the clutches of \nEnron.\n  Enron is still seeking to extract an additional $326 million in \nprofits from my State's utilities for power that was never delivered. \nEnron, after all of its market manipulation and financial fraud, is \nstill trying to profit from its wrong-doing at the expense of each and \nevery Nevadan.\n  Section 1270 of the Energy Policy Act ensures that the proper \ngovernment agency will determine whether Enron is entitled to more \nmoney from Nevada. That agency is the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission. When FERC was established by Congress, its fundamental \nmission was, and remains, to protect ratepayers. FERC has specialized \nexpertise required to resolve the issues surrounding some of the \ncontracts that Enron entered into and eventually terminated.\n  Many of my colleagues know that Enron has filed for bankruptcy \nprotection. There is an issue in the bankruptcy case as to whether \nEnron can enforce contracts that it terminated. The enforceability of \nthese contracts should not be decided by a bankruptcy court. A \nbankruptcy judge does not have the specialized expertise required for \nthis job. A bankruptcy court is responsible for considering different \nequities than an oversight agency, like FERC, would. The bankruptcy \ncourt is responsible for enhancing the bankruptcy estate for the \nbenefit of creditors. FERC, on the other hand, sees a more complete \npicture which includes protecting the interests of the general public.\n  This is why section 1270 is so important. It is a provision that is \nlimited in scope. It does not seek to resolve the issue in the favor of \none party. Though many Senators from affected States may have been \ntempted to legislate the outcome, we have refrained from doing so. Let \nme set the stage for why this provision is so critical. It is a \ncomplicated story. It is one that should be told in order to understand \nwhy I so strongly support this provision and why I believe the \nprovision should be enacted into law.\n  There are two major utilities that serve Nevada: Nevada Power and \nSierra Pacific Power. Both need to buy power in the wholesale power \nmarket to meet the growing energy needs of Nevada. Las Vegas is the \nfastest growing city in the country. It takes a lot of power to keep \nthe lights on in Las Vegas, Reno, and other parts of our growing State. \nAt the height of the western electricity crisis, when spot market \nprices for electricity were going not just through the roof but through \nthe stratosphere, FERC urged utilities like the Nevada utilities to \nreduce their purchases of spot supplies and enter into long-term \ncontracts for electricity.\n  That is precisely what the Nevada utilities did. Enron was one of the \nbiggest suppliers of wholesale electricity at the time. Starting in \nDecember 2000, the Nevada utilities entered into long-term contracts \nwith Enron to meet a significant portion of their long-term needs. At \nthe time, no one was aware of Enron's on-going criminal conspiracy to \nmanipulate the market. No one knew that Enron had engaged in fraud to \nhide its true financial picture.\n\n  The prices that the Nevada utilities agreed to pay Enron for long-\nterm power were truly outrageous. The prices fully reflected Enron's \nsuccess in manipulating the market. Prices were three times as high as \nthe threshold that FERC had established as a ceiling price that would \ntrigger close scrutiny under the just and reasonable standard. As a \nresult, in November 2001, the Nevada utilities asked FERC to review the \nrates to determine whether those contract prices were just and \nreasonable.\n  Two days after the Nevada companies filed their complaints against \nEnron, Enron filed for bankruptcy. Its financial house of cards had \nfinally collapsed. As one definitive study of Enron concluded, Enron \nhad been insolvent at the time the company entered into each and every \ncontract with the Nevada utilities.\n  The contracts between Enron and the Nevada utilities incorporated the \nWestern Systems Power Pool Agreement, a master agreement on file and \napproved by FERC. This master agreement governs transactions of more \nthan 200 parties throughout the west.\n  Under the terms of that agreement, if one of the parties files for \nbankruptcy, the other party may rescind the agreement. So in this case, \nEnron's bankruptcy would have given the Nevada utilities cause to \nterminate the contracts. Under the unique terms of this agreement, \nhowever, the commercial party that is ``in the money'' will still be \nable to benefit if the contract is rescinded. So while the Nevada \ncompanies could terminate the contract, they still would have had to \npay Enron the difference between the contract price and the market \nprice at the time of terminating, to say nothing of the need to buy \nreplacement power.\n  When Enron entered bankruptcy, the price for electricity had fallen \nto the level power had sold for prior to Enron's market manipulation. \nThis demonstrates that there was a huge difference between the \nartificially and unlawfully manipulated price that Enron commanded at \nthe time of the contract and the market price at the time Enron filed \nfor bankruptcy. Given the huge financial hit that the Nevada companies \nwould have had to pay to terminate the Enron contracts, the Nevada \ncompanies continued to honor their commitment to purchase power under \nthese contracts.\n  In March 2002, the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada refused to \nallow the Nevada utilities to pass more than $400 million in purchased \npower costs on to ratepayers. As a result, the credit ratings of the \nNevada utilities fell below investment grade. Under the terms of the \nWSPPA, this downgrade gave Enron the right to request assurances \nregarding the Nevada companies'\n\n[[Page S7273]]\n\nintentions with respect to their contracts. In meetings and in \ntelephone calls, the Nevada Companies assured Enron that they would be \nable to pay Enron everything that would be owed under the contracts.\n  The WSPPA required Enron to use ``reasonable'' discretion with \nrespect to the contracts. Despite this requirement, Enron terminated \nthe contracts with the Nevada companies and demanded that the Nevada \ncompanies pay Enron termination payments totaling approximately $326 \nmillion. These termination payments represent pure profit to Enron on \npower than Enron never delivered. By pure profit, I mean just that. The \ntermination payments are calculated, as I previously noted, by the \ndifference between the cost of power today and the outrageous, \nmanipulation-based prices Enron was able to extract during the energy \ncrisis that Enron had unlawfully created.\n\n  The Nevada companies refused to make payment. At this time, it was \nknown that Enron had manipulated the entire western market. As part of \nEnron's bankruptcy, an ``adversary proceeding'' was initiated to \ndetermine the enforceability of these contracts and whether Enron would \nbe allowed to continue to profit under fraudulent contracts at the \nexpense of Nevada's ratepayers.\n  At this point, the legal proceedings become very complex but the \nproceedings should be summarized so my colleagues will understand \nexactly what has happened.\n  On June 24, 2003, FERC determined that the ``just and reasonable'' \nstandard of review is not available to the Nevada companies with \nrespect to their long-term contracts with Enron. This decision was made \nbecause FERC argued that it had previously ``pre-determined'' that the \ncontracts would be just and reasonable when they granted Enron its \nauthority to sell electricity at market-based rates years earlier.\n  On the very next day, FERC withdrew Enron's authority to sell \nelectricity at market-based rates because of its ``market manipulation \nschemes that had profound adverse impacts on market outcomes'' which \nviolated its ``market-based rate authorizations.''\n  The bankruptcy court judge, on August 23, 2003, ruled on a summary \njudgment motion that the Nevada utilities were required to pay Enron \n$326 million in termination payments. The court held that, because FERC \nhad not found that Enron's contracts should be modified by virtue of \nits market manipulation, the filed-rate doctrine applied. It further \nruled that it did not need to defer to FERC on whether Enron had \ncomplied with the tariff since it could interpret the tariff as well as \nFERC.\n  On October 6, 2003, the Nevada Companies filed a complaint with FERC. \nThe complaint sought to have FERC determine: Enron's termination was \nunreasonable under the tariff; Enron was not entitled to termination \npayments on equitable grounds; and, assuming Enron was otherwise \nentitled to termination payments, the contract provision should be set \naside as contrary to the public interest.\n  Then, on July 22, 2004, FERC set for hearing the narrow question of \nwhether Enron's termination was reasonable. FERC deferred ruling on the \nissue of whether the contract should be set aside under the public \ninterest standard until that issue became ``necessary.'' At the \nhearing, FERC did not address the issue of equitable claims. On that \nsame day, FERC ruled in a separate case that Enron could be required to \ndisgorge all of its profits.\n  On September 30, 2004, FERC's administrative law judge denied Enron's \nmotion to dismiss the case, finding, among other things, that FERC's \nspecialized expertise is required.\n  U.S. District Court Judge Barbara Jones reversed a ruling of the \nbankruptcy court on October 15, 2004. The district court considered the \nissue of whether the Nevada companies owed Enron the termination \npayments. The district court found that the Nevada companies had \noffered timely assurances and that the issue of whether Enron rejected \nthose assurances and terminated reasonably were issues of fact which \nrequired a trial.\n  On December 3, 2004, the bankruptcy court enjoined FERC from further \nproceedings after finding that FERC had violated the ``automatic stay'' \nprovisions of the Bankruptcy Code. A hearing on termination payments \nwas tentatively scheduled for this coming July. Currently, motions for \ninterlocutory appeal are pending before a U.S. District Court Judge.\n  Despite the ruling of a FERC administrative law judge that FERC's \nexpertise was necessary to interpret the master tariff's requirement \nthat a terminating party act ``reasonably,'' the bankruptcy court has \nenjoined FERC from further considering this issue. Section 1270 of this \nlegislation confirms the decision of the FERC administrative law judge. \nThis section says the judge is correct and the bankruptcy court is \nwrong. It makes clear that, in this limited matter, FERC has the \nexclusive jurisdiction to determine the merits of the claims at issue.\n  This provision is very reasonable. It is a targeted response to a \nclash among competing jurisdictions over which tribunal, FERC or the \nbankruptcy court, should decide this issue. If Congress doesn't address \nthe issue of jurisdiction now, the Supreme Court will have to do so \nyears from now. That need not happen. Congress can decide this \njurisdictional issue. The decision of the Senate, as reflected in \nSection 1270, is the right decision.\n  The language of the amendment tracks Supreme Court precedent that \nrecognizes that Congress can choose to give jurisdiction over issues to \nadministrative agencies when the jurisdiction is consistent with the \ncore functions of the agency. In this instance, the recognition of \nauthority to FERC to decide this matter is narrow. It relates solely to \nthe legality of Enron collecting additional profits in the form of \ntermination payments for power not delivered. It is also directly \nrelated to the agency's core function to ensure just and reasonable \nrates and guard against market manipulation.\n  I want to assure my colleagues that this provision does not encroach \nupon the sanctity of contracts. It merely picks the proper forum for \ndetermining whether Enron complied with its tariff obligations. \nLikewise, it also does not alter the standard of review for challenging \nthe contract. Congress is not picking a standard; it is only picking a \nforum.\n  Mr. President, this reasonable provision has the support of key \nindustry leaders such as the National Rural Electric Cooperative \nAssociation, the American Public Power Association, and the Edison \nElectric Institute. It has bipartisan support. Anyone who has been as \nharmed by Enron as ratepayers in my state have understands the need to \nensure that only the most qualified tribunal should rule on whether \nEnron can collect an additional $326 million in windfall profits.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, as I have said time and again during this \ndebate over the last several weeks, America is being held hostage to \nits over-dependence on foreign oil. This Energy bill is our first step \nin setting America free.\n  From the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden to the \nbalanced development of oil and gas, Colorado is already playing a big \npart in setting America free.\n  With a huge, untapped resource called oil shale, Colorado can play an \neven bigger role in this effort. If properly developed, oil shale that \nexists in my great State of Colorado has the potential to be part of a \nstrategy to address America's dependence on foreign oil.\n  Colorado is home to tremendous deposits of oil shale, a type of \nhydrocarbon bearing rock that is abundant in Western Colorado, as well \nas Utah and Wyoming. Estimates place the potential recoverable amount \nof this type of oil as high as 1 trillion barrels. Let me say that \nagain--1 trillion barrels.\n  Let me put that in perspective:\n  Saudi Arabia's proven conventional reserves are said to be around 261 \nbillion barrels.\n  Several of our colleagues argued earlier this spring that ANWR is a \nresource so remarkable that we must open that pristine land to \ndrilling. According to the U.S. Geological Survey--USGS--the mean \nestimate of technically recoverable oil is 7.7 billion barrels--billion \nbbl--but there is a small chance that, taken together, the fields on \nthis Federal land could hold 10.5 billion bbl of economically \nrecoverable oil. That's one percent of the potential oil shale.\n  Assuming we use 15 million barrels of oil a day just for \ntransportation, oil\n\n[[Page S7274]]\n\nshale could keep our transportation going for another 200 years.\n  Colorado has some experience in trying to access this potential \nasset. We have had two boom and bust periods, one in the 1800s and the \nother in the 1980s.\n  The most recent story is about the ``Boom & Bust'' Colorado \nexperienced during the last oil shale development cycle that began in \nthe 1970's and ended in May of 1982 on ``Black Sunday.''\n  I will never forget the powerful lessons of Black Sunday.\n  Colorado invested millions in new towns, only to see thousands of \nresidents flee when oil prices fell, leaving behind them a devastated \nreal estate market.\n  Communities that invested heavily in schools and roads and housing \ncould no longer meet the burden of paying for this critical \ninfrastructure.\n  Buildings on the Western Slope--and even in Denver--were built and \nleft empty, if the construction was completed at all.\n  Towns that thought they were seeing a bright future, struggled to \ndeal with crippling unemployment.\n  The technical challenges of oil shale and the searing memories of \nBlack Sunday have taught all of Colorado some important lessons.\n  We now recognize that oil shale's potential can only be realized if \nit is approached in the right way.\n  Oil shale development must be considered a marathon and not a sprint.\n  I believe, as many in Colorado do, that oil shale research and \ndevelopment must be conducted in an open, cautious and thoughtful \nmanner that includes our local communities.\n  As Congress instructs Federal agencies to consider oil shale research \nand development leasing and commercial leasing, it must give careful \nconsideration to environmental and socioeconomic impacts and \nmitigations as well as the sustainability of an oil shale industry.\n  Colorado is a team player. The people of my State are ready to share \nthe abundant natural resources with which we have been blessed. In \nexchange, Colorado expects to have a seat at the table.\n  That is why I introduced the Oil Shale Development Act of 2005. I am \nvery pleased that it has been incorporated into the Energy bill we are \nnow considering.\n  I believe the oil shale provision in this Energy bill is a thoughtful \napproach to future oil shale development. It is full of commonsense \nprovisions that build on the lessons we learned in that painful \nexperience 30 years ago.\n  It directs leasing for research and development;\n  It requires a programmatic Environmental Impact Study to ensure that \nwe take a comprehensive environmental look at potential commercial \nleasing;\n  It directs the Secretary of Interior to work with the States, local \ncommunities, and industry to identify and report on issues of primary \nconcern to local communities and populations with commercial leasing \nand development;\n  and it insists that States--not the Federal Government--retain \nauthority over water rights.\n  I know we are going to hear more and more about oil shale development \nin the Rocky Mountain west. That is as it should be, and we will embark \non a thoughtful, balanced approach to oil shale development with this \nbill.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, as we move forward on Energy legislation \ncrucial for our country's national security, jobs, and competitiveness, \nI wish to raise an issue which is threatening global energy security. \nThe surging demand for energy in developing countries coupled with the \ndynamic rise in power and influence of government operated energy \ncompanies is changing the global energy market. Specifically, I am \nconcerned about the role of the People's Republic of China with its \nnational oil companies, and the potential adverse effects on U.S. \nenergy supplies. I am also concerned about our ability to compete for \nenergy assets.\n  China's surging demand for energy is impacting the world. China has \nnow emerged as the second largest consumer of energy, and demand could \ndouble by 2020. According to the U.S. Energy Information \nAdministration, China is consuming 7.2 million barrels of oil per day \nand this is expected to rise to 7.8 million barrels of oil per day by \nnext year. China alone has accounted for 40 percent of growth in oil \ndemand over the last 4 years. According to recent studies, China's \ngrowing demand for oil is one of the significant factors driving oil \nprices to record high levels. With such growth in the Chinese economy, \nit is understandable why there is greater demand for energy in the form \nof coal, oil, and nuclear power as well as materials ranging from \ncement to steel.\n  With limited domestic resources, China has embarked on an aggressive \nprogram through its national energy companies to secure energy and in \ndoing so has proposed acquisition of energy assets around the world, \nincluding assets of U.S. based companies. It has become increasingly \ndifficult for private companies in the U.S. to compete against these \ngovernment-owned energy companies, such as the Chinese state-owned \ncompany known as CNOOC. The inherent advantage that these state-owned \ncompanies have is that they can operate under non-market terms and \nconditions for the purchase of energy supplies and assets, including \naccepting very low rates of return. Thus, private entities in free \ncountries are disadvantaged in competing for energy assets.\n  China in the past year has signed deals for oil reserved in Africa, \nIran, South America, and now Canada. Today, one of China's largest \nstate-controlled oil companies made a $18.5 billion unsolicited bid for \nUnocal, signaling the first big takeover battle by a Chinese company \nfor a U.S. corporation.\n  Energy is a global issue and we need to understand the implications \nfor American interests on how these energy shifts may impact us as well \nas the rest of the world.\n  It is important that we have a comprehensive review which would \ninclude a full assessment of the types of investments China is making \nin international and U.S. based companies, a better understanding of \nthe relationship between the Chinese energy sector and the Chinese \ngovernment, and what we can do to ensure a level playing field and \nflexibility in the global market. Perhaps most importantly, we need to \nunderstand how we can better work cooperatively to pursue energy \ninterests as well as work together on conservation, energy efficiency, \nand technology.\n  It is nice to talk about working cooperatively with China, but I am \nconcerned that we may be headed on a collision course. Energy is the \nlifeblood of economic growth and we are beginning to see an imbalance \noccur. I look forward to hearing from the administration to gain a \nbetter understanding of the issues and how the U.S. can best proceed to \nsecure our future energy needs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, while I voted for a similar amendment \noffered by the Senators from Arizona, Mr. McCain, and Connecticut, Mr. \nLieberman, in 2003, unfortunately, the current version of the amendment \nincludes over $600 million in taxpayer subsidies for the creation of \nnew nuclear powerplants. The nuclear industry is a mature industry that \ndoes not need to be propped up by the taxpayers. Over 300 national \nenvironmental and consumer organizations, including the League of \nConservation Voters, Public Interest Research Group, and the Sierra \nClub, oppose this amendment. Our Nation faces an ever-growing budget \ndeficit and we must be fiscally and environmentally responsible. I \nstrongly believe that global warming is an important national issue, \nwhich is why I supported the Bingaman-Specter sense-of-the-Senate \namendment to push for a national policy on global warming. I will \ncontinue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \ncreate a meaningful global warming program.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my \ncolleagues on our efforts to pass an energy bill through the Senate \nthat does not include exemptions for the oil and gas industry from \ndrinking water and clean water protections. Section 327 of H.R. 6 as \nreported contains an exemption to the Safe Drinking Water Act for the \npractice of hydraulic fracturing. Section 328 of H.R. 6 contains an \nexemption for the oil and gas industry from obtaining stormwater \ndischarge permits under the Clean Water Act, rolling back fifteen years \nof environmental\n\n[[Page S7275]]\n\nprotection. These efforts to weaken the protections applied to our \nNation's waters should be stricken from the bill as the conferees on \nH.R. 6 work to resolve the differences between the two bills.\n  Over half of our Nation's fresh drinking water comes from underground \nsources. Hydraulic fracturing occurs when fluids are injected at high \nrates of speed into rock beds to fracture them and allow easier \nharvesting of natural oils and gases. It is these injection fluids, and \ntheir potential to contaminate underground sources of drinking water, \nthat are of high concern. In a recent report, the EPA acknowledged that \nthese fluids, many of them toxic and harmful to people, are pumped \ndirectly into or near underground sources of drinking water. This same \nreport cited earlier studies that indicated that only 61 percent of \nthese fluids are recovered after the process is complete. This leaves \n39 percent of these fluids in the ground, risking contamination of our \ndrinking water.\n  In June of 2004, an EPA study on hydraulic fracturing identified \ndiesel as a ``constituent of potential concern.'' Prior to this, EPA \nhad entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with three of the major \nhydraulic fracturing corporations, whom all voluntarily agreed to ban \nthe use of diesel, and if necessary select replacements that will not \ncause hydraulic fracturing fluids to endanger underground sources of \ndrinking water. However, all parties acknowledged that only technically \nfeasible and cost-effective actions to provide alternatives would be \nsought.\n  Litigation over the last several years has resulted in findings that \nhydraulic fracturing should be regulated as part of the underground \ninjection control program in the Safe Drinking Water Act. Yet, EPA \nindicated in a letter in December of 2004 that they have no intention \nof publishing regulations to that effect or ensuring that state \nprograms adequately regulate hydraulic fracturing.\n  I will include our letter to EPA dated October 14, 2004, and their \nresponse dated December 7, 2004, in the Record.\n  We need to be moving in the right direction--taking steps to ensure \nthat hydraulic fracturing is appropriately regulated under the Safe \nDrinking Water Act. I have introduced S. 1080, the Hydraulic Fracturing \nSafety Act of 2005 to ensure that the practice of hydraulic fracturing \nis regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act through the Underground \nInjection Control, UIC, Program. I would like to thank Senators \nLautenberg, Boxer, and Lieberman for co-sponsoring that bill. The House \nenergy bill takes steps in the wrong direction--exempting hydraulic \nfracturing from the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  I urge the conferees of this energy bill to strike section 327 of the \nHouse-passed energy bill. By striking this language, the conferees will \nhelp to ensure that the drinking water enjoyed by all Americans is not \ndamaged through the process of hydraulic fracturing.\n  This exemption for hydraulic fracturing is not the only step \nbackwards that the House energy bill takes. Section 328 of the bill \nexempts the oil and gas industry from stormwater protections in the \nClean Water Act.\n  Stormwater runoff is a leading cause of impairment to the nearly 40 \npercent of surveyed U.S. water bodies that do not meet water quality \nstandards.\n  Currently, the oil and gas industry is regulated under Phase I of \nEPA's stormwater regulations which requires National Pollution \nDischarge Elimination System, NPDES, permits for medium and large \nmunicipal storm sewer systems and eleven, 11, categories of industrial \nactivity, including construction sites disturbing more than 5 acres of \nland. In 1999, EPA adopted the Phase II permitting requirements, \neffective March 10, 2003, covering small municipal separate stormwater \nsystems and construction sites affecting one to five acres of land. \nHowever, EPA extended the Phase II permitting deadline to June 12, 2006 \nfor only the oil and gas industry.\n  Now, section 328 of the House energy bill completely exempts the oil \nand gas industry from compliance with both Phase I and Phase II of the \nNPDES stormwater program.\n  This action will adversely impact water quality. Oil and gas \nconstruction activities require companies to undertake a number of \nearth disturbing activities, including: clearing, grading, and \nexcavating. Oil and gas site development may also include road \nconstruction to transport equipment and other materials, as well as \npipeline construction. The stormwater pollution created from these \nactivities can be devastating to the environment.\n  According to the EPA, over a short period of time, stormwater runoff \nfrom construction site activity can contribute more harmful pollutants, \nincluding sediment, into rivers, lakes, and streams than had been \ndeposited over several decades. Sediment clouds water, decreases \nphotosynthetic activity, reduces the viability of aquatic plants and \nanimals; and ultimately destroys animals and their habitat. Sediment \nrates from cleared and graded construction sites are typically 10 to 20 \ntimes greater than those from agricultural lands and one-thousand to \ntwo-thousand times greater than those from forest lands. Other harmful \npollutants in stormwater runoff from construction sites include \nphosphorous and nitrogen, pesticides, petroleum derivatives, \nconstruction chemicals, and solid wastes that may be mobilized when \nland surfaces are disturbed.\n\n  More than 5,000 cities, towns, and counties and eleven, 11, \nindustrial sectors are required to obtain NPDES stormwater permits. \nLarge oil and gas construction sites covered under the Phase I \nstormwater program have been taking action to reduce the impact of \nsediments and pollutants on water quality since 1990. In 2005, GAO \nreported that over a one-year period, 4,330 oil and gas construction \nsites obtained Phase I stormwater permits in three of the six largest \noil and gas producing states. In 20 the Warren County Conservation \nDistrict submitted information to EPA indicating that 70 percent of the \noil and gas projects they inspected between 1997 and 2002 were in \nviolation of Phase I permit conditions. If this amendment is adopted, \nthese actions will no longer be required. In FY 2002/2003, the Alaska \nDepartment of Environmental Conservation estimated that they would \nreview 400 engineering plans as part of the stormwater permitting \nprocess. The House provision would exempt these sites from 15-year-old \nrequirements to reduce the pollution they send into surrounding waters \nthrough stormwater discharges.\n  The environmental impact from this amendment is even more severe when \nyou factor in the approximately 30,000 oil and gas ``starts'' per year \nthat EPA anticipates could be covered by the Phase II stormwater \nregulation. EPA is currently reviewing the impact of the regulation on \nthese sites. Adopting this amendment would circumvent this review \nprocess and exempt thousands of sites from taking action to protect \nwater quality.\n  Section 402(l) of the Clean Water Act contains a limited exemption \nfor specific types of uncontaminated discharges from specific types of \noil and gas sites from stormwater permit requirements. The language of \nthe Act and the legislative history of this section indicate that when \nadopted, section 402(l) was intended to give a narrow exemption for \nspecific circumstances in the oil and gas industry that did not include \nconstruction activities at every oil and gas--related site.\n  I urge the conference committee on H.R. 6 to reject the Clean Water \nand Safe Drinking Water Act exemptions included in the House energy \nbill. These provisions represent a major step backward in efforts to \nprotect water quality and could pose a direct threat to the safety of \ndrinking water supplies. Should these exemptions be included in the \nfinal conference report, we will see our Nation's water quality \nstandards go down the drain.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the above-referenced letters in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         U.S. Senate, Committee on\n\n\n                                 Environment and Public Works,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 14, 2004.\n     Administrator Michael O. Leavitt,\n     Environmental Protection Agency, Ariel Rios Building, \n         Washington, DC\n       Dear Administrator Leavitt: We are writing to you regarding \n     the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's). administration \n     of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) as it pertains to \n     hydraulic fracturing. In recent months, the Agency has taken \n     several key actions on this issue:\n       On December 12, 2003, the EPA signed a Memorandum of \n     Understanding with three of the largest service companies \n     representing 95 percent of all hydraulic fracturing performed\n\n[[Page S7276]]\n\n     in the U.S. These three companies, Halliburton Energy \n     Services, Inc., Schlumberger Technology Corporation, and BJ \n     Services Company, voluntarily agreed not to use diesel fuel \n     in their hydraulic fracturing fluids while injecting into \n     underground sources of water for coalbed methane production.\n       In June of 2004, EPA completed its study on hydraulic \n     fracturing impacts and released its findings in a report \n     entitled, ``Evaluation of Impacts to Underground Sources of \n     Drinking Water by Hydraulic Fracturing of Coalbed Methane \n     Reservoirs. The report concluded that hydraulic fracturing \n     poses little chance of contaminating underground sources of \n     drinking water and that no further study was needed.\n       On July 15, 2004, the EPA published in the Federal Register \n     its final response to the court remand (Legal Environmental \n     Assistance Foundation (LEAF), Inc., v: United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency, 276 F. 3d 1253). The Agency \n     determined that the Alabama underground injection control \n     (UIC) program for hydraulic fracturing, approved by EPA under \n     section 1425 of the SDWA, complies with Class II well \n     requirements.\n       We are concerned that the Agency's execution of the SDWA, \n     as it applies to hydraulic fracturing, may not be providing \n     adequate public health protection, consistent with the goals \n     of the statute.\n       First, we have questions regarding the information \n     presented in the June 2004 EPA Study and the conclusion to \n     forego national regulations on hydraulic fracturing in favor \n     of an MOD limited to diesel fuel. In the June 2004 EPA Study, \n     EPA identifies the characteristics of the chemicals found in \n     hydraulic fracturing fluids, according to their Material \n     Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs), identifies harmful effects \n     ranging from eye, skin, and respiratory irritation to \n     carcinogenic effects. EPA determines that the presence of \n     these chemicals does not warrant EPA regulation for several \n     reasons. First, EPA states that none of these chemicals, \n     other than BTEX compounds, are already regulated under the \n     SDWA or are on the Agency's draft Contaminant Candidate List \n     (CCL). Second, the Agency states that it does not believe \n     that these chemicals ate present in hydraulic fracturing \n     fluids used for coalbed methane, and third, that if they are \n     used, they are not introduced in sufficient concentrations to \n     cause harm. These conclusions raise several questions:\n       1. The data presented in the June 2004 EPA study identifies \n     potential harmful effects from the chemicals listed by the \n     Agency in this report. Has the Agency or does the Agency plan \n     to incorporate the results of this study and the fact that \n     these chemicals are present in hydraulic fracturing agents \n     into the CCL development process, and if not, why not?\n       2. In the June 2004 EPA study, the Agency concludes that \n     hydraulic fracturing fluids do not contain most of the \n     chemicals identified. This conclusion is based on two items--\n     ``conversations with field engineers'' and ``witnessing three \n     separate fracturing events'' (June 2004 EPA Study, p. 4-17.)\n       a. How did the Agency select particular field engineers \n     with whom to converse on this subject?\n       b. Please provide a transcript of the conversations with \n     field engineers, including the companies or consulting firms \n     with which they were affiliated.\n       c. How did the Agency select the three separate fracturing \n     events to witness?\n       d. Were those events representative of the different site-\n     specific characteristics referenced in the June 2004 study \n     (June 2004 EPA Study, p. 4-19) as determining factors in the \n     types of hydraulic fracturing fluids that will be used?\n       e. Which companies were observed?\n       f. Was prior notice given of the planned witnessing of \n     these events?\n       g. What percentage of the annual number of hydraulic \n     fracturing events that occur in the United States does ``3'' \n     represent?\n       h. Finally, please explain why the Material Safety Data \n     Sheets for the fluids identified as potentially being used in \n     hydraulic fracturing list component chemicals that the EPA \n     does not believe are present.\n       The Agency concludes in the June 2004 study that even if \n     these chemicals are present, they are not present in \n     sufficient concentrations to cause harm. The Agency bases \n     this conclusion on assumed flowback, dilution and \n     dispersion, adsorption and entrapment, and biodegradation. \n     The June 2004 study repeatedly cites the 1991 Palmer \n     study, ``Comparison between gel-fracture and water-\n     fracture stimulations in the Black Warrior basin; \n     Proceedings 1991 Coalbed Methane Symposium,'' which found \n     that only 61 percent of the fluid injected during \n     hydraulic fracturing is recovered. Please explain what \n     data EPA collected and what observations the Agency made \n     in the field that would support the conclusion that the 39 \n     percent of fluids remaining in the ground are not present \n     in sufficient concentrations to adversely affect \n     underground sources of drinking water.\n       After identifying BTEX compounds as the major constituent \n     of concern (June 2004 EPA study, page 4-15), the Agency \n     entered into the MOU described above as its mechanism to \n     eliminate diesel fuel from hydraulic fracturing fluids.\n       3. a. How does the Agency plan to enforce the provisions in \n     the MOD and ensure that its terms are met?\n       b. For example, will the Agency conduct independent \n     monitoring of hydraulic fracturing processes in the field to \n     ensure that diesel fuel is not used?\n       c. Will the Agency require states to monitor for diesel use \n     as part of their Class II UIC Programs?\n       4. a. Should the Agency become aware of an unreported \n     return to the use of diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing by \n     one of the parties to the MOU, what recourse is available to \n     EPA under the terms of the MOU?\n       b. What action does the Agency plan to take should such a \n     situation occur?\n       c. Why did EPA choose to use an MOU as opposed to a \n     regulatory approach to achieve the goal of eliminating diesel \n     fuel in hydraulic fracturing?\n       d. What revisions were made to the June 2004 EPA study \n     between the December 2003 adoption of the MOU and the 2004 \n     release of the study? Which of those changes dealt \n     specifically with the use and effects of diesel fuel \n     hydraulic fracturing?\n       e. The Agency also states that it expects that even if \n     diesel were used, a number of factors would decrease the \n     concentration and availability of BTEX. Please elaborate on \n     the data EPA collected and the observations the Agency made \n     in the field that would support the conclusion that the 39 \n     percent of fluids remaining in the ground (1991 Palmer), \n     should they contain BTEX compounds, would not be present in \n     sufficient concentrations to adversely affect underground \n     sources of drinking water.\n       We are also concerned that the EPA response to the court \n     remand leaves several unanswered questions. The Court \n     decision found that hydraulic fracturing wells ``fit squarely \n     within the definition of Class II wells,'' (LEAF II, 276 F.3d \n     at 1263), and remanded back to EPA to determine if the \n     Alabama underground injection control program under section \n     1425 complies with Class II well requirements. On July 15, \n     2004, EPA published its finding in the Federal Register that \n     the Alabama program complies with the requirements of the \n     1425 Class IT well requirements. (69 FR No. 135, pp 42341.) \n     According to EPA, Alabama is the only state that has a \n     program specifically for hydraulic fracturing approved under \n     section 1425. Based on this analysis, it seems that in order \n     to comply with the Court's finding that hydraulic fracturing \n     is a part of the Class II well definition, the remaining \n     states should be using their existing Class IT, EPA--approved \n     programs, under 1422 or 1425, to regulate hydraulic \n     fracturing.\n       To date, EPA has approved Underground Injection Control \n     programs in 34 states. Approval dates range from 1981-1996.\n       5. Do you plan to conduct a national survey or review to \n     determine whether state Class IT programs adequately regulate \n     hydraulic fracturing?\n       At the time that these programs were approved, the \n     standards against which state Class IT programs were \n     evaluated did not include any minimum. requirements for \n     hydraulic fracturing. In its January 19, 2000 notice of EPA's \n     approval of Alabama's 1425 program, the Agency stated, ``When \n     the regulations in 40 CFR parts 144 and 146, including the \n     well classifications, were promulgated, it was not EPA's \n     intent to regulate hydraulic fracturing of coal beds. \n     Accordingly, the well classification systems found in 40 CFR \n     144.6 and 146.5 do not expressly include hydraulic fracturing \n     injection activities. Also, the various permitting; \n     construction and other requirements found in Parts 144 and \n     146 do not specifically address hydraulic fracturing.'' (65 \n     FR No. 12, p. 2892.)\n       Further, EPA acknowledges that there can be significant \n     differences between hydraulic fracturing and standard \n     activities addressed by state Class IT programs. In the \n     January 19, 2000 Federal Register notice, the Agency states:\n\n     ``. . . since the injection of fracture fluids through these \n     wells is often a one-time exercise of extremely limited \n     duration (fracture injections generally last no more than two \n     hours) ancillary to the well's principal junction of \n     producing methane, it did not seem entirely appropriate to \n     ascribe Class II status to such wells, for all regulatory \n     purposes, merely due to the fact that, prior to commencing \n     production, they had been fractured.'' (65 FR No. 12, p. \n     2892.)\n       Although hydraulic fracturing falls under the Class II \n     definition, the Agency has acknowledged that hydraulic \n     fracturing is different than most of the activities that \n     occur under Class II and that there are no national \n     regulations or standards on how to regulate hydraulic \n     fracturing.\n       6. In light of the Court decision and the Agency's July \n     2004 response to the Court remand, did the Agency consider \n     establishing national regulations or standards for hydraulic \n     fracturing or minimum requirements for hydraulic fracturing \n     regulations under state Class II programs?\n       7. a. If so, please provide a detailed description of your \n     consideration of establishing these regulations or standards \n     and the rationale for not pursuing them.\n       b. Do you plan to establish such regulations or standards \n     in the future?\n       c. If not, what standards will be used as the standard of \n     measurement for compliance for hydraulic fracturing under \n     state Class IT programs?\n       We appreciate your timely response to these questions in \n     reaction to the three recent actions taken by the EPA in \n     relation to hydraulic fracturing--the adoption of the MOU, \n     the release of the final study, and the response to the Court \n     remand. Clean and safe drinking water is one of our nation's \n     greatest assets, and we believe we must do all we\n\n[[Page S7277]]\n\n     can to continue to protect public health. Thank you again for \n     your response.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jim Jeffords.\n     Barbara Boxer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     U.S. Environmental Protection\n\n\n                                                       Agency,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 7, 2004.\n     Hon. Jim Jeffords,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Jeffords: Thank you for your letter to \n     Administrator Michael Leavitt dated October 14, 2004, \n     concerning the recent actions that the Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA) has taken in implementing the \n     Underground Injection Control (UIC) program with respect to \n     hydraulic fracturing associated with coalbed methane wells.\n       The Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water (OGWDW) has \n     prepared specific responses to your technical and policy \n     questions regarding how we conducted the hydraulic fracturing \n     study, the reasons behind our decisions pertaining to the \n     recommendations contained in the study, and any plans or \n     thoughts we may have on the likelihood for future \n     investigation, regulation, or guidance concerning such \n     hydraulic fracturing.\n       Since the inception of the UIC program, EPA has implemented \n     the program to ensure that public health is protected by \n     preventing endangerment of underground sources of drinking \n     water (USDWs). The Agency has placed a priority on \n     understanding the risks posed by different types of UIC \n     wells, and worked to ensure that appropriate regulatory \n     actions are taken where specific types of wells may pose a \n     significant risk to drinking water sources. In 1999, in \n     response to concerns raised by Congress and other \n     stakeholders about issues associated with the practice of \n     hydraulic fracturing of coalbed methane wells in the State of \n     Alabama, EPA initiated a study to better understand the \n     impacts of the practice.\n       EPA worked to ensure that its study, which was focused on \n     evaluating the potential threat posed to USDWs by fluids used \n     to hydraulica11y fracture coalbed methane wells was carried \n     out in a transparent fashion. The Agency provided many \n     opportunities to all stakeholders and the general public to \n     review and comment on the Agency study design and the draft \n     study. The study design was made available for public comment \n     in July 2000, a public meeting was held in August 2000, a \n     public notice of the final study design was provided in the \n     Federal Register in September 2000, and the draft study was \n     noticed in the Federal Register in August 2002. The draft \n     report was also distributed to all interested parties and \n     posted on the internet. The Agency received more than 100 \n     comments from individuals and other entities.\n       EPA's final June 2004 study, Evaluation of Impacts to \n     Underground Sources of Drinking Water by Hydraulic Fracturing \n     of Coalbed Methane Reservoirs, is the most comprehensive \n     review of the subject matter to date. The Agency did not \n     recommend additional study at this time due to the study's \n     conclusion that the potential threat to USDWs posed by \n     hydraulic fracturing of coalbed methane wells is low. \n     However, the Administrator retains the authority under the \n     Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) section 1431 to take \n     appropriate action to address any imminent and substantial \n     endangerment to public health caused by hydraulic fracturing.\n       During the course of the study, EPA could not identify any \n     confirmed cases where drinking water was contaminated by \n     hydraulic fracturing fluids associated with coalbed methane \n     production. We did uncover a potential threat to USDWs \n     through the use of diesel fuel as a constituent of fracturing \n     fluids where coalbeds are co-located with a USDW. We reduced \n     that risk by signing and implementing the December 2003 \n     Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with three major service \n     companies that carry out the bulk of coalbed methane \n     hydraulic fracturing activities throughout the country. This \n     past summer we confirmed that the companies are carrying out \n     the MOA and view the completion of this agreement as a \n     success story in protecting USDWs.\n       In your letter, you asked about the Agency's actions with \n     respect to hydraulic fracturing in light of LEAF v. EPA. In \n     this case, the Eleventh Circuit held that the hydraulic \n     fracturing of coalbed seams in Alabama to produce methane gas \n     was ``underground injection'' for purposes of the SDWA and \n     EPA's UIC program. Following that decision, Alabama \n     developed--and EPA approved--a revised UTC program to protect \n     USDWs during the hydraulic fracturing of coalbeds. The \n     Eleventh Circuit ultimately affirmed EPA's approval of \n     Alabama's revised UIC program.\n       In administering the UIC program, the Agency believes it is \n     sound policy to focus its attention on addressing those wells \n     that pose the greatest risk to USDWs. Since 1999, our focus \n     has been on reducing risk from shallow Class V injection \n     wells. EPA estimates that there are more than 500,000 of \n     these wells throughout the country. The wastes injected into \n     them include, in part, storm water runoff, agricultural \n     effluent, and untreated sanitary wastes. The Agency and \n     States are increasing actions to address these wells in order \n     to make the best use of existing resources.\n       EPA remains committed to ensuring that drinking water is \n     protected. I look forward to working with Congress to respond \n     to any additional questions, or the concerns that Members of \n     Congress or their constituents may have. If you have further \n     comments or questions, please contact me, or your staff may \n     contact Steven Kinberg of the Office of Congressional and \n     Intergovernmental Relations at (202) 564-5037.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Benjamin H. Grumbles,\n                                   Acting Assistant Administrator.\n       Attachment.\n\n   EPA Response to Specific Questions Regarding Hydraulic Fracturing\n\n       The data presented in the June 2004 EPA study identifies \n     potential harmful effects from the chemicals listed by the \n     Agency in this report. Has the Agency or does the Agency plan \n     to incorporate the results of this study and the fact that \n     these chemicals are present in hydraulic fracturing agents \n     into the Contaminant Candidate List (CCL) development \n     process, and if not, why not?''\n       Although the EPA CBM study found that certain chemical \n     constituents could be found in some hydraulic fracturing \n     fluids, EPA cannot state categorically that they are \n     contained in all such fluids. Each fracturing procedure may \n     be site specific or basin specific and fluids used may depend \n     on the site geology, the stratigraphy (i.e. type of coal \n     formation), depth of the formation, and the number of coal \n     beds for each fracture operation. The Agency's study did not \n     develop new information related to potential health effects \n     from these chemicals; it merely reported those potential \n     health effects indicated on the Material Safety Data Sheet \n     (MSDS) or other information we obtained from the service \n     companies.\n       As noted in the final report, ``Contaminants on the CCL are \n     known or anticipated to occur in public water systems. . .'' \n     The extent to which the contaminants identified in fracturing \n     fluids are part of the next CCL process will depend upon \n     whether they meet this test.\n       2. In the June 2004 EPA study, the Agency concludes that \n     hydraulic fracturing fluids do not contain most of the \n     chemicals identified. This conclusion is based on two items--\n     ``conversations with field engineers'' and ``witnessing three \n     separate fracturing events''.\n       a. How did the agency select particular field engineers \n     with whom to converse on this subject?\n       The Agency did not ``select'' any of the engineers; we \n     talked with the engineers who happened to be present at the \n     field operations. In general those were engineers from the \n     coalbed methane companies and the service companies who \n     conducted the actual hydraulic fracturing. When we scheduled \n     to witness the events, we usually conversed with the \n     production company engineer to arrange the logistics and only \n     spoke with the field engineers from the service companies at \n     the well site.\n       b. Please provide a transcript of the conversations with \n     field engineers, including the companies or consulting firms \n     with which they were affiliated.\n       EPA did not prepare a word-for-word transcript of \n     conversations with engineers.\n       c. How did the Agency select the three separate fracturing \n     events to witness?\n       The events selected were dependent on the location of the \n     fracturing events, the schedules of both EPA OGWDW staff and \n     EPA Regional staff to witness the event, and the preparation \n     time to procure funding and authorization for travel. EPA \n     witnessed the 3 events because the planning and scheduling of \n     these happened to work for all parties. In one event, only \n     EPA HQ staff witnessed the procedure, in another event only \n     EPA Regional staff witnessed it, and in one event both EPA HQ \n     and Regional staff attended with DOE staff.\n       d. Were those events representative of the different site-\n     specific characteristics referenced in the June 2004 study \n     (p. 4-19) as determining factors in the types of hydraulic \n     fracturing fluids that will be used?\n       Budget limitations precluded visits to each of the 11 \n     different major coal basins in the U.S. It would have proven \n     to be an expensive and time-consuming process to witness \n     operations in each of these regions. Additionally, even \n     within the same coal basin there are potentially many \n     different types of well configurations, each of which could \n     affect the fracturing plan. EPA believed that witnessing \n     events in 3 very different coal basin settings--Colorado, \n     Kansas, and south western Virginia--would give us an \n     understanding of the practice as conducted in different \n     regions of the country.\n       e. Which companies were observed?\n       EPA observed a Schlumberger hydraulic fracturing operation \n     in the San Juan basin of Colorado, and Halliburton hydraulic \n     fracturing operations in southwest Virginia and Kansas.\n       f. Was prior notice given of the planned witnessing of \n     these events?\n       Yes, because it would have been very difficult to witness \n     the events had they not been planned. To plan the visit, EPA \n     needed to have prior knowledge of the drilling operation, the \n     schedule of the drilling, and the scheduling of the services \n     provided by the hydraulic fracturing service company. Wells, \n     in general, take days to drill (in some cases weeks and \n     months depending on depth of the well) and the fracturing may \n     take place at a later date depending on the availability of \n     the service company and other factors beyond anyone's \n     control.\n       g. What percentage of the annual number of hydraulic \n     fracturing events that occur in the United States does ``3'' \n     represent?\n       Because of a limited project budget, EPA did not attempt to \n     attend a representative\n\n[[Page S7278]]\n\n     number of hydraulic fracturing events; that would have been \n     beyond the scope of this Phase I investigation. The primary \n     purpose of the site visits was to provide EPA personnel \n     familiarity with the hydraulic fracturing process as applied \n     to coalbed methane wells. The visits served to give EPA staff \n     a working-level, field experience on exactly how well-site \n     operations are conducted, how the process takes place, the \n     logistics in setting up the operation, and the monitoring \n     and verification conducted by the service companies to \n     assure that the fracturing job was accomplished \n     effectively and safely. EPA understands that thousands of \n     fracturing events take place annua1ly, for both \n     conventional oil and gas operations and for coalbed \n     methane production, and that three events represent an \n     extremely small fraction of that total.\n       h. Finally, please explain why the Material Safety Data \n     Sheets for the fluids identified as potentialIy being used in \n     hydraulic fracturing list component chemicals that the EPA \n     does not believe are present.\n       In Table 4-1 of the final study, EPA identified the range \n     of fluids and fluid additives commonly used in hydraulic \n     fracturing. Some of the fluids and fluid additives may \n     contain constituents of potential concern, however, it is \n     important to note that the information presented in the MSDS \n     is for the pure product. Each of the products listed in Table \n     4-1 is significantly diluted prior to injection. The MSDS \n     information we obtained is not site specific. We reviewed a \n     number of data sheets and we noted that many of them are \n     different, contain different lists of fluids and additives, \n     and thus we concluded in the final report that we cannot say \n     whether one specific chemical, or chemicals, is/are present \n     at every hydraulic fracturing operation.\n       3. a. How does the Agency plan to enforce the provisions in \n     the MOU and ensure that its terms are met?\n       There is no mechanism to ``enforce'' a voluntary agreement \n     such as the MOA signed by EPA and the three major service \n     companies. The MOA was signed in good faith by senior \n     managers from the three service companies and the Assistant \n     Administrator for Water, and EPA expects it will be carried \n     out. EPA has written all signers of the MOA and asked if they \n     have implemented the agreement and how will they ensure that \n     diesel fuel is not being used in USDWs. All three have \n     written back to EPA, stating that they have removed diesel \n     from their CBM fracturing fluids when a USDW is involved and \n     intend to implement a plan to ensure that such procedures are \n     met. EPA intends to follow up with the service companies on \n     progress in implementing such plans.\n       b. For example, will the Agency conduct independent \n     monitoring of hydraulic fracturing processes in the field to \n     ensure that diesel fuel is not used?\n       It is unlikely that EPA will conduct such field monitoring. \n     First, in most oil and gas producing states, and coalbed \n     methane producing states, the State Oil and Gas Agency \n     generally has UIC primary enforcement responsibility, and the \n     state inspectors are the primary field presence of such \n     operations. Second, EPA has a very limited field staff and in \n     most cases they are engaged in carrying out responsibilities \n     related to Class I, III and V wells in states in which they \n     directly implement the UIC program. EPA plans to work with \n     several organizations, including the Ground Water Protection \n     Council and the Independent Petroleum Association of America \n     to determine if there are other smaller companies conducting \n     CBM hydraulic fracturing with diesel fuel as a constituent \n     and will explore the possibility of including them in the \n     MOA.\n       c. Will the Agency require states to monitor for diesel use \n     as part of their Class II programs?\n       Given limited funds for basic national and state UIC \n     program requirements, EPA does not have plans to include the \n     states as parties to the MOA or require them to monitor for \n     diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturiug fluids. The State of \n     Alabama's EPA-approved UIC program prohibits the hydraulic \n     fracturing of coalbeds in a manner that allows the movement \n     of contaminants into USDWs at levels exceeding the drinking \n     water MCLs or that may adversely affect the health of \n     persons. Current federal UIC regulations do not expressly \n     address or prohibit the use of diesel fuel in fracturing \n     fluids, but the SDWA and UIC regulations allow States to be \n     more stringent than the federal UIC program.\n       4. a. Should the Agency become aware of an unreported \n     return to the use of diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing by \n     one of the parties to the MOU, what recourse is available to \n     EPA under the terms of the MOU?\n       There are no terms in the MOA that would provide EPA a \n     mechanism to take any enforcement action should the Agency \n     become aware of an unreported return to the use of diesel \n     fuel in hydraulic fracturing by one of the parties to the \n     MOA. However, EPA would work c1osely with the companies to \n     determine why such action occurred and discuss possible \n     termination procedures. The agreement defines how either \n     party can terminate the agreement. EPA would make every \n     effort to work with such a company to maintain their \n     participation in the agreement. EPA entered the agreement \n     with an assumption that the companies would honor the \n     commitments they have made about diesel use in hydraulic \n     fracturing fluids.\n       b. What action does the Agency plan to take should such \n     action occur?\n       If such a situation does happen, and EPA learns that diesel \n     fuel used in hydraulic fracturing fluid may enter a USDW and \n     may present an imminent and substantial threat to public \n     health, EPA may issue orders or initiate litigation as \n     necessary pursuant to SDWA section 1431 to protect public \n     health. Otherwise, EPA would take the actions described under \n     the previous question.\n       c. Why did EPA choose to use an MOU as opposed to a \n     regulatory approach to achieve the goal of eliminating diesel \n     fuel in hydraulic fracturing?\n       While the report's findings did not point to a significant \n     threat from diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing fluids, the \n     Agency believed that a precautionary approach was \n     appropriate. EPA chose to work collaborative1y with the oil \n     service companies because we thought that such an approach \n     would work quicker and be more effective than other \n     approaches the Agency might employ (i.e. rulemaking, \n     enforcement orders, etc.). We believed that once the service \n     companies became familiar with the issue, they wouid \n     willingly address EPA's concerns. After several months of \n     meetings and negotiations between representatives of the \n     service companies and high level management in EPA's \n     Office of Water, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was \n     drafted and signed by all parties effective December 24, \n     2003.\n       We believe that the MOA mechanism accomplished the intended \n     goal of removing diesel from hydraulic fracturing fluids in a \n     matter of months, whereas proposing a rule to require removal \n     would have taken at least a year or more.\n       d. What revisions were made to the June 2004 EPA study \n     between the December 2003 adoption of the MOU and the 2004 \n     release of the study? Which of those changes dealt \n     specifically with the use and effects of diesel fuel in \n     hydraulic fracturing?\n       During the specified time-frame, EPA focused on making \n     editorial changes to the report and clarifying information \n     relative to its qualitative discussion of the mitigating \n     effects of dilution, dispersion. adsorption, and \n     biodegradation of residual fluids. With respect to tbe use \n     and effects of diesel fuel. changes in the study primarily \n     focused on including language in the text of the report which \n     acknowledged that we had successfully negotiated an MOA with \n     the service companies. Specifically, EPA referenced this \n     agreement in the text of the report in the Executive Summary \n     at page ES-2 and on page ES-17, and further discussed the MOA \n     in Chapter 7 in the Conclusions Section of the study.\n       e. The Agency also states that it expects that even if \n     diesel were used, a number of factors would decrease the \n     concentration and availability of BTEX. Please elaborate on \n     the data EPA collected and the observations the Agency made \n     in the field that would support the conclusion that 39 \n     percent of fluids remaining in the ground (1991 Palmer), \n     should they contain BTEX compounds, would not be present in \n     sufficient concentrations to adversely affect underground \n     sources of drinking water.\n       EPA reiterates that the 39 percent figure from the 1991 \n     Palmer paper is only one instance where it has been \n     documented what quantity of the hydraulic fracturing fluids \n     injected into wells will remain behind. Dr. Palmer, who \n     conducted the original research, estimated that coalbed \n     methane production wells flow back a greater percentage of \n     fracturing fluids injected during the process. Where \n     formations are dewatered or produced for a substantial period \n     of time, greater quantities of formation and fracturing \n     fluids would presumably be removed. We used 39 percent \n     remaining fluids as a ``worst case'' scenario while doing our \n     qualitative assessment, since it was the only figure we had \n     from research conducted on coalbed methane wells.\n       With respect to the BTEX compounds, we no longer believe \n     that they are a concern owing to the MOA negotiated between \n     EPA and the three major service companies.\n       5. Do you plan to conduct a national survey or review to \n     determine whether state Class II programs adequately regulate \n     hydraulic fracturing?\n       At this time, EPA has no plans to conduct such a survey or \n     review regarding the adequacy of Class II programs in \n     regularing hydraulic fracturing. In its final study design, \n     EPA indicated that it would not begin to evaluate existing \n     state regulations concerning hydraulic fracturing until it \n     decided to do a Phase III investigation. The Agency, however, \n     reserves the right to change its position on this if new \n     information warrants such a change.\n       6. In light of the Court decision and the Agency's July \n     2004 response to the Court remand, did the Agency consider \n     establishing national regulations or standards for hydraulic \n     fracturing or minimum requirements for hydraulic fracturing \n     regulations under Class II programs?\n       When State UIC programs were approved by the Agency--\n     primarily during the early 1980s--there was no Eleventh \n     Circuit Court decision indicating that hydraulic fracturing \n     was within the definition of ``underground injection.'' Prior \n     to LEAF v. EPA. EPA had never interpreted the SDWA to cover \n     production practices, such as hydraulic fracturing. After the \n     Court decision in 1997, the Agency began discussions with the \n     State of Alabama on revising their UIC program to include \n     hydraulic fracturing. The net result of that process was the \n     EPA approval of Alabama's revised section 1425 SDWA UIC \n     program to include specific regulations addressing CBM\n\n[[Page S7279]]\n\n     hydraulic fracturing. This approval was signed by the \n     Administrator in December 1999. and published in the Federal \n     Register in January 2000.\n       In light or the Phase I HF study and our conclusion that \n     hydraulic fracturing did not present a significant public \n     health risk, we see no reason at this time to pursue a \n     national hydraulic fracturing regulation to protect USDWs or \n     the public health. It is also relevant at the three major \n     service companies have entered into an agreement with EPA to \n     voluntarily remove diesel fuel from their fracturing fluids.\n       7. a. If so, please provide a detailed description of your \n     consideration of establishing these regulations or standards \n     and the rationale for not pursuing them.\n       b. Do you plan to establish such regulations or standards \n     in the future?\n       c. If not, what standards will be used as the standard of \n     measurement for compliance for hydraulic fracturing under \n     state Class II programs?\n       EPA has not explored in any detailed fashion minimum \n     national or state requirements for hydraulic fracturing of \n     CBM wells, except when it evaluated the revised UIC program \n     in Alabama.\n       Considering and developing national regulations for \n     hydraulic fracturing would involve discussions with numerous \n     stakeholders. the states, and the public and it would require \n     an intensive effort to arrive at regulatory language that \n     could be applied nation-wide. As EPA's study indicates, \n     coalbeds are located in very distinct geologic settings and \n     the manner in which they are produced for methane gas may be \n     very different in each locale. The proximity of USDW to the \n     coal formations. and the regional geology and hydrology all \n     play roles in how hydraulic fracturing operations are \n     conducted.\n       If EPA receives information of drinking water contamination \n     incidents and follow-up investigations point to a problem, \n     EPA would then re-evaluate its decision to not continue with \n     additional stndy relating to CBM hydraulic fracturing.\n       Should additional states submit revised UIC programs for \n     EPA's review and approval which include hydraulic fracturing \n     regulations, we would evaluate these programs under the \n     ``'effectiveness.'' standards of the SDWA section 1425 as we \n     did or the State of Alabama.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Oil and Gas Accountability Project\n\n                                       Durango, CO, June 14, 2005.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Jeffords: Please accept this letter of \n     endorsement for S. 1080, the Hydraulic Fracturing Safey Act \n     of 2005.\n       Hydraulic fracturing is the industry practice of injecting \n     fluids and other substances underground in order to increase \n     production of oil and gas. While the industry refuses to \n     fully list the chemicals it injects underground, the EPA has \n     found that many of these chemicals are known to be toxic to \n     humans and some are actually considered hazardous under \n     federal law. Yet, the EPA and all states except Alabama have \n     refused to regulate the toxics that are used during hydraulic \n     fracturing operations. What this, means, in practice, is that \n     is it legal for hydraulic fracturing companies to inject \n     toxic chemicals into or close to drinking water aquifers. The \n     EPA has even admitted that a number of toxic hydraulic \n     fracturing chemicals can be injected into drinking water \n     sources at concentrations that pose a threat to human health.\n       With thousands of new oil and gas wells being drilled each \n     year, the impacts of hydraulic fracturing are beginning to \n     show up. In western Colorado, hydraulic fracturing literally \n     blew up one homeowner's water well and contaminated it with \n     methane. In Alabama, hydraulic fracturing turned water wells \n     black, and citizens have experienced health problems \n     following contact with the affected water. The true scope of \n     the problem, is not known, however, because state agencies do \n     not monitor groundwater for chemicals used in hydraulic \n     fracturing operations.\n       Despite the fact that unregulated hydraulic fracturing may \n     be poisoning our drinking water. Senator Inhofe has \n     introduced a bill, S.837, on behalf of the oil and gas \n     industry, that would completely exempt hydraulic fracturing \n     from EPA regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n       Thank you and Senators Lautenberg, Boxer and Lieberman for \n     introducing the Hydraulic Fracturing Safety Act of 2005 (S. \n     1080). requiring the use of nontoxic products in hydraulic \n     fracturing operations during oil and gas production. This \n     important bill will help to protect our precious underground \n     drinking water sources.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Gwen Lachelt,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 National Wildlife Federation,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 2005.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Environment and Public Works \n         Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ranking Member Jeffords: On behalf of the National \n     Wildlife Federation, and the millions of hunters, anglers and \n     outdoor enthusiasts we represent, I am writing to thank you \n     for introducing the Hydraulic Fracturing Safety Act of 2005.\n       I am pleased that your legislation would ban the use of \n     diesel or other priority pollutants listed under the Federal \n     Water Pollution Control Act in hydraulic fracturing for oil \n     or natural gas exploration and production and also require \n     the EPA to regulate hydraulic fracturing.\n       EPA does not currently regulate hydraulic fracturing, a \n     common technique used to stimulate oil and gas production \n     that can potentially compromise groundwater resources and \n     reserves. An EPA whistle-blower and other experts agree that \n     hydraulic fracturing is a serious threat to drinking water. \n     Hydraulic fracturing has already impacted residential \n     drinking water supplies in at least three states (Colorado, \n     Virginia and Alabama) and incidents have been recorded in \n     other states (New Mexico, West Virginia and Wyoming) where \n     residents have recorded changes in water quality or quantity \n     following hydraulic fracturing operations near their homes.\n       I am disappointed that the U.S. House of Representatives \n     passed an energy bill that exempts the oil and gas industry \n     from being regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act for \n     hydraulic fracturing. The House passed bill would also exempt \n     all oil and gas construction activities from the Clean Water \n     Act; cut the heart out of environmental reviews by allowing \n     for numerous National Environmental Policy Act exemptions; \n     and require the BLM to rush to judgment on complex energy \n     permitting decisions. These provisions would harm America's \n     wildlife and Americans' water resources and recreational \n     opportunities. I urge you to remain steadfast and oppose any \n     amendments on the Senate floor that would provide egregious \n     exemptions to the laws that protect water resources, wildlife \n     and their habitat.\n       NWF and the millions of hunters, anglers and outdoor \n     enthusiasts we represent commend you for your leadership on \n     safeguarding our water resources and wildlife habitat. If you \n     have further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Jim Lyon,\n                              Senior Vice President, Conservation.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President. I thank Senator Grassley, Senator Baucus \nand the other members of the Senate Finance Committee for agreeing to \nmy recycling amendment, which I call the Recycling Investment Saves \nEnergy, RISE, provisions. These provisions were added to the tax title \nof the energy bill last week and have now been incorporated into the \nEnergy bill as section 1545 of H.R. 6.\n  The current Senate Energy bill contains important provisions to \npromote the use of energy savings in vehicles, appliances, new homes, \nand commercial buildings. As we move forward with fostering energy \nefficiency, we must not neglect recycling. Recycling should be an \nintegral component of our nation's energy efficiency strategy.\n  The RISE provisions will create jobs, increase productivity, and \nconserve energy by establishing a tax credit to preserve and expand \nAmerica's recycling infrastructure. Specifically, the provisions \nestablish a 15 percent tax credit for the purchase of qualified \nrecycling equipment used to sort or process packaging and printed \nmaterials, such as beverage containers, cardboard boxes, glass jars, \nsteel cans and newspapers.\n  The tax credit could be claimed by material recovery facilities, \nmanufacturers or other persons that purchase recycling equipment that \nsorts or processes residential or commercial recyclable materials, even \nif such equipment also is used to handle material from industrial \nfacilities.\n  This national investment in our recycling infrastructure is necessary \nto reverse the declining recycling rate of many consumer commodities, \nincluding aluminum, glass and plastic, which are near historic lows. \nFor example, 55 billion aluminum cans were wasted by not being recycled \nin 2004, which represents approximately $1 billion of aluminum lost to \nindustry. The recycling rate of paper is estimated to be roughly 50 \npercent, glass containers 35 percent, and PET plastic bottles less than \n20 percent.\n  The energy savings from greater recycling are significant. Increasing \nthe recycling of containers, packaging and paper could save the \nequivalent energy output of 15 medium-sized power plants on an annual \nbasis. Recycling aluminum cans, for example, saves 95 percent of the \nenergy required to make the same amount of aluminum for its virgin \nsource. Increasing the U.S. recycling rate to 35 percent would result \nin annual energy savings of 903 trillion BTUs, enough to meet the \nannual energy needs of 8.9 million homes.\n  Due to the diminishing quantity and quality of available recyclable \nmaterials, many companies are not able to obtain the volume of quality \nrecycled feedstock needed to meet demand. This\n\n[[Page S7280]]\n\nnew economic challenge makes it even harder for recycled products to \ncompete in the marketplace. For example, two Michigan plastic recycling \nfacilities recently closed, affecting 100 jobs, as a result of \ninconsistent supply of recycled plastic. Similarly 17 percent of the \nrecycling capacity at U.S. paper mills has been shut down, in part due \nto insufficient quality recyclable materials. One leading glass \nmanufacturer also reports that they are able to obtain only a small \nfraction of the volume of recycled glass that their facilities can use.\n  In some cases, recyclers have been forced to shut down their \noperations in the United States and relocate to other countries due in \npart to insufficient or poor quality recycled feedstocks. This is \nparticularly unfortunate as, on a per-ton basis, sorting and processing \nrecyclables are estimated to sustain 10 times more jobs than \nlandfilling or incineration.\n  The RISE provisions aim to reverse the declining recycling rate and \nresulting energy loss by incentivizing greater collection of quality \nrecyclable materials. The bill would expand collection efforts by \nmaking innovative technology more affordable, such as reversible \nvending machines that collect and process empty containers. It could \nalso be used to finance equipment at recycling collection centers.\n  This targeted tax credit would address quality concerns by reducing \nthe barriers hindering investment in optical sorting and other state of \nthe art equipment needed at material recovery facilities. By reducing \nmaterial loss and improving quality, RISE will increase both the \nquantity and quality of recycled feedstock available to manufacturers.\n  Reducing the barriers to recycling also serves a number of \nenvironmental goals, including lessening the need for new landfills, \npreventing emissions of many air and water pollutants, reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and stimulating the development of green \ntechnology. But most importantly, recycling helps preserve resources of \nour children's future. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport these provisions.\n  Mr. President, last night the Senate narrowly defeated the Kerry \namendment No. 844, sense-of- the-Senate resolution on climate change. I \nwas unable to be present for the vote, but I strongly supported this \nsense of the Senate. The United States has consistently failed to \nconstructively engage in international discussions in a manner \nconsistent with our obligations under the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change or even under a basic good neighbor \npolicy. The Bush administration policy on global warming is \nineffective, unproductive, and irresponsible.\n  The administration's voluntary approach and efforts to address global \nwarming have been underfunded and will not produce real emissions \nreductions in the timeframe necessary. Fortunately, many of the States \nhave taken up the mantle of leadership, since there is a tremendous \nvacuum in the White House. By reversing his pledge to control carbon \ndioxide from powerplants, walking away from the Kyoto Protocol, and now \nsnubbing British Prime Minister Tony Blair's request for assistance \nfrom the United States on this critical climate change problem, the \nPresident is reneging on this Nation's responsibility and opportunity \nto be a world leader.\n  Carbon dioxide levels have never been higher and the United States \ndisproportionately contributes to the global warming problem. We need \nto reengage with the world in producing a binding global plan that \nreduces greenhouse gases below levels that would cause dangerous \ninterference with the Earth's climate.\n  The administration and the world should pay close attention to the \npassage of the Bingaman-Specter resolution that committed the Senate to \nadopting legislation containing mandatory controls on carbon dioxide. \nThis is an important resolution and it should serve as a wakeup call to \nthe administration and those among the carbon-intensive industries. We \nmust shoulder our moral responsibility to reduce the risks of global \nwarming.\n  Mr. President, I thank the bill managers, Senator Domenici and \nSenator Bingaman, for agreeing to accept my amendment in the managers' \npackage that was agreed to last night by unanimous consent. My \namendment directs the Architect of the Capitol to study the feasibility \nof installing energy and water conservation measures on the rooftop of \nthe Dirksen building, specifically the roof area above the cafeteria in \nthe center of the building.\n  Today, all that exists is open space in the center of the building. \nMy amendment will assist the Architect in obtaining information that \nwill allow this space to be used in a more efficient manner and save \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  During debate on the energy bill, the Senate has heard numerous \narguments on the importance of conserving energy. In August of 2003, \nnearly 50 million people in the Northeast and Midwest were affected by \na massive power outage. This event emphasized the vulnerability of the \nU.S. electricity grid to human error, mechanical failure, and weather-\nrelated outages. Failure to maintain a reliable grid had a huge impact \non our Nation's economy, businesses, and individuals' everyday lives.\n  It is vital, then, that we here in the Senate do our part and put \nmeasures in place to make the Nation's Capitol a more secure and \nsustainable user of electricity. The Capitol Complex is largely \ndependent upon the electrical grid for power. Our daily operations \nshould not be compromised by grid failure.\n  My amendment moves us forward in the right direction. Technology \nalready exists to ensure that our operating systems can continue to \noperate despite loss of a main power supply. By creating onsite \ngenerating capacity through the installation of cogeneration equipment \nat the power plant and using solar powered equipment, like photovoltaic \npanels, we could produce energy to operate essential systems during a \nblackout or significant loss of power. We can start slowly by powering \nemergency lighting and notification systems in hallways so the \noccupants know how to exit the building safely or upgrade the \nelectrical generating capacity of the complex. Technology is only \ngetting better. My amendment asks the Architect of the Capitol to \nexplore the use of this new technology to ensure that the Nation's \nCapitol always has reliable power.\n  In addition, this new technology also has the potential to provide \nsignificant savings in the Capitol's operating budget. We are all \nlooking for ways to save the taxpayers money and reduce the Nation's \ndeficit. We have the opportunity today to set an example and practice \nwhat we preach. As Members of Congress, we can educate ourselves and \nour staff on the benefits of energy efficiency, and see first hand the \nsavings it can generate. The Nation's Capitol can join those already \nutilizing this technology and help encourage others to adopt it as \nwell.\n  My amendment requires a feasibility study be conducted to look at the \nDirksen building rooftop, including the open space in the center of the \nbuilding directly above the cafeteria. The study will focus on more \nefficient use of the space while providing energy and water savings to \nthe Capitol Complex.\n  I envision a wonderful park and garden area that Members and staff \ncan actually use. These gardens would not only provide a beautiful \nenvironment by utilizing native plants, but they would also reduce \nenergy use, and provide insulation for the building to reduce heat and \nenergy loss.\n  These gardens would also provide a collection system for rainwater to \nlimit the amount of stormwater runoff in the area. This collected water \ncould be utilized for basic plumbing, watering the vegetation, or even \nthe fire sprinkler systems; thereby reducing the use of water in the \nCapitol Complex.\n  Installation of technology, like photovoltaic panels, could collect \nthe rays of the sun and provide energy to the building. These can be \ninstalled on the rooftops of our buildings in many different areas. \nThese panels are now made to blend into any environment\n  There is even technology that exists to funnel natural daylight into \nthe cafeteria in the basement. Imagine enjoying natural daylight as you \nconsume your lunch or hold that quick meeting. Preliminary studies show \nthat exposure to daylight improves worker productivity and results in \nless absenteeism due to illness.\n  The Architect of the Capitol is currently updating the master plan \nfor the\n\n[[Page S7281]]\n\nCapitol Complex. This small project fits into that plan. The Architect \nis making great strides to update our operating systems with newer and \nefficient technology with sustainable features. I appreciate his \nefforts and encourage him to continue doing so.\n  Before I conclude, I would like to thank a former staffer who helped \nme develop this great idea, Mary Katherine Ishee. Mary Katherine was \ncreative enough to look beyond the barren view from the committee \noffices on the fourth floor of the Dirksen building and realize the \nopportunity it presented.\n  It is about time we bring our home, the Capitol Complex, up to date \nwith the rest of the world. This language is a step in that direction. \nWe have the potential to use the latest technology to save energy, \naddress security concerns, conserve our resources, and make more \nefficient use of this space.\n  We will all benefit from a wonderful, efficient, and useful park in \nthe middle of the Dirksen building, and the taxpayers will benefit from \nour reduced energy and water use in the form of lower utility bills. I \nam very pleased that this measure has been added and I hope it will be \nretained by the conferees.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Senators Domenici and Bingaman for \nadopting my amendment No. 774, as part of the Senate Energy bill. The \namendment authorizes up to $20 million a year for 7 years for the \nestablishment of a new Department of Energy grant program to aid local \ngovernments, municipal utilities, rural electric cooperatives, and not-\nfor-profit agencies. The cost of repairing transmission lines is \nproving particularly difficult for small communities in Vermont and \nacross America.\n  I became interested in creating such a program due to the challenges \nthat communities in my State are facing with respect to the upgrading \nand siting of transmission and distribution lines. For example, \nresidents in Lamoille County, VT, have been struggling to find ways to \nexpand the transmission system to accommodate the demands of a growing \ntourism industry without overly burdening local residents with the cost \nof such an upgrade. Currently, the transmission system that delivers \nelectricity to this area of my State is at peak capacity, leaving the \nlocal community in jeopardy should a single event like a fallen power \nline or damage to a key piece of equipment occur.\n  Not only must communities afford the costs of the infrastructure \nitself, but also the costs of integrating these new technologies into \nthe rural landscape in a way that does not destroy their scenic quality \nand protects their lifestyle.\n  These grants will help rural communities meet these needs. They can \nbe used for increasing energy efficiency, siting or upgrading \ntransmission lines, or providing modernizing electric generating \nfacilities to serve rural areas. Under the generation grants portion of \nthe program, preference will be given to renewable facilities such as \nwind, ocean waves, biomass, landfill gas, incremental hydropower, \nlivestock methane, or geothermal energy.\n  By adopting my legislation as part of this Energy bill, small \nelectric cooperatives and local governments in Lamoille County, VT, \nwill be eligible to apply for Federal grants to construct new \nfacilities and transmission upgrades. This is a good amendment and it \nshould be retained by the conferees.\n  Mr. President, last night the Senate defeated amendment No. 961 that \nwould have banned the siting of windmills in many areas in the lower 48 \nStates and made them ineligible to receive Federal tax subsidies. Had I \nbeen present to vote, I would have opposed this amendment. In my 30 \nyears in Congress, I have been a strong proponent of renewable energy \nsources including wind power. I am very optimistic about the role wind \nenergy can play in satisfying a growing proportion of this Nation's \nenergy needs.\n  If the objective of this amendment was to protect scenic qualities of \nAmerica's lands and shorelines, it did not achieve that goal. The \namendment only targeted the siting of windmills within 20 miles of \nFederal public lands, but did not address the siting of coal-fired \npowerplants and other energy sources that have far greater impacts to \nour public lands. Just look at the impacts that air pollution blowing \nin from coal-fired Midwest powerplants is currently having on the Great \nSmoky Mountain National Park, Shenandoah National Park, and the \nprotected areas in the beautiful green mountains of Vermont.\n  This amendment also failed to treat all public lands and wildlife \nrefuges equally. As ranking member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, the committee with jurisdiction over our Nation's wildlife \nrefuges, I was concerned that, had this amendment been approved, no \nwind turbine situated anywhere near Federal lands in the lower 48 \nStates would have been eligible to receive Federal tax subsidies, \nthereby severely limiting the expansion of wind power in the United \nStates. Oddly, this amendment specifically exempted some other \nfederally protected areas such as coastal wildlife refuges in Louisiana \nand Alaska. By defeating this amendment by a wide margin, the Senate \nsends a strong message that wind power has a role to play in satisfying \nthis Nation's energy needs.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, families in Arkansas want and deserve a \nnational energy policy that truly moves us towards energy independence. \nWe must look beyond oil, gas, and coal and develop cleaner alternatives \nand new sources of energy, especially renewable fuels.\n  This bill offers a good starting point in achieving this goal, and I \nam pleased the Senate has agreed to adopt my amendment that embraces \nthe potential of biodiesel and hythane as part of this effort.\n  My amendment requires that the Department of Energy, in conjunction \nwith universities throughout the country, prepare two reports. These \nreports would evaluate the potential markets, infrastructure \ndevelopment needs and possible impediments to commercialization for two \nalternative fuels: biodiesel and hythane.\n  Biodiesel can substitute directly for petroleum-based diesel fuel, \nusually with no engine modifications, and offers a number of health and \nenvironmental benefits. It produces less carbon monoxide, less sulfur \noxides emissions, and less particulate or soot emissions from some \nengines. It allows for safer handling. It is an agricultural-based \nfeedstock may be produced anew every year, unlike fossil fuels which \nhave declining reserves. And in Arkansas and other agricultural states, \nthe robust commercializing of biodiesel would mean an economic boon to \nour farmers.\n  The promise of biodiesel as a fuel source is just beginning to show. \nBiodiesel only currently accounts for less than 0.1 percent of diesel \nfuel consumption in the U.S. But total U.S. diesel fuel use was \nestimated at 39.5 billion gallons in 2001, including 33.2 billion of \non-road highway use.\n  The enhanced commercialization of biodiesel can help reverse this \ntrend, but only if we enable this industry to get off the ground on a \nsolid footing. We have seen an enormous amount of federal assistance \nhelp support and catapult the ethanol industry. Our soybean farmers and \nour Nation could benefit from similar treatment.\n  My amendment also requires a study on the feasibility of hythane \ndeployment, which is a blend of hydrogen and methane. Hythane is \nconsidered a stepping stone or bridge to the hydrogen economy because \nit represents an initial commercial application of hydrogen as a \nlegitimate fuel option. It reduces nitrogen oxide, NOx, \nemissions by 95 percent relative to diesel, and makes significant \nreductions in carbon dioxide.\n  China is now leading the way in developing hythane-powered vehicles. \nIn preparation for the 2008 Olympics, Beijing, is in the process of \nreplacing 10,000 diesel buses with hythane buses.\n  Additionally, hythane offers a solution to improve waste management \nin our communities. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, \nmunicipal solid waste landfills are the largest source of human-related \nmethane emissions in the United States, accounting for about 34 percent \nof these emissions. Landfill gas is created as solid waste decomposes \nin a landfill and consists of about 50 percent methane.\n  Instead of allowing this gas to escape into the air, it can be \ncaptured, converted, and used to make hythane. As\n\n[[Page S7282]]\n\nof December 2004, there are approximately 380 operational Landfill Gas \nenergy projects in the United States and more than 600 landfills that \nare good candidates for projects. Companies ranging from Ford to \nHoneywell to Nestle are converting landfill gas into energy.\n  There is similar potential for chemical plants who also release \nmethane into the atmosphere, contributing to local smog and global \nclimate change. If they sequestered methane to sell to a hythane \nmanufacturer, I believe they would take advantage of the profits it \nwould yield.\n  My State of Arkansas, for example, has significant methane seams, \nincluding the Fayetteville shale bed methane seam, which Southwest \nEnergy and CDX Gas are already using to their advantage. These \nresources could contribute to hythane fuel production as well.\n  Our Nation's energy problems cannot be solved overnight; however, we \nwould be remiss if we did not at least further explore innovative and \npractical solutions, such as biodiesel and hythane. This amendment is a \nwin-win situation for our energy dependence, health, economy and \nenvironment. I thank my colleagues for their support.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I regret that I was unable to take part \nin yesterday's cloture vote because I was testifying before the BRAC \nCommission in St. Louis, MO, along with the senior Senator from \nWisconsin, in an effort to save the Milwaukee-based 440th Airlift Wing \nfrom closing. The fate of the 440th is very important to me and my \nconstituents, and, while I have only missed a handful of votes in my 12 \nyears in the Senate, it is clear to me that testifying in St. Louis was \nthe right decision.\n  If I had been present I would have again voted against the cloture \nmotion on the nomination of John Bolton. Since the motion required 60 \nvotes to pass, my absence did not affect, and could not have affected, \nthe outcome of the vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, for too long, we as a body, and we as a \nNation, have fallen short in our efforts to address some of the most \nprofound and far reaching challenges of our time--global climate change \nand energy security. For too long, we have skirted the issues and have \nshirked our responsibilities. We have convinced ourselves that we are \ndoing something but, in reality, we continue to take no real action. \nRather than lead, we have stood by, paralyzed, undermining any efforts \nto forge an effective response.\n  It is time to pull ourselves out of that quicksand and confront the \ntasks at hand. First, we must establish practical and comprehensive \nsteps to reduce U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases and to reduce our \ndependence on foreign energy sources. Second, we must work in a \npartnership with developing nations to deploy clean energy technologies \nthat can meet their urgent development needs while reducing their own \ncontribution to global climate change and their growing energy \ndependency. Third, we must commit ourselves to the fundamental task of \nforging an effective and sound international agreement to guide a truly \nglobal effort to confront this most daunting problem, global climate \nchange.\n  In 1997, during the 105th Congress, the Senate passed S. Res. 98, by \na vote of 95 to 0. As the primary author, along with Senator Hagel, of \nS. Res. 98, I sought at that time to express the sense of the Senate \nregarding the provisions of any future binding, international agreement \nthat would be acceptable to the Senate.\n  However, almost from the day of that vote, those on both sides of the \nissue have misrepresented and misconstrued its intent. What was meant \nas a guide for action has instead been invoked, time and again, as an \nexcuse for inaction. Yet no one has misrepresented and misconstrued S. \nRes. 98 more so than this present administration. Rather than employing \nit as a tool to positively influence the international negotiations, \nthe administration used it as cover to simply walk away from the \nnegotiating table.\n  For the U.S., the issue should no longer be about the Kyoto Protocol. \nCertainly, everyone in this Chamber knows that the United States will \nnot join the Kyoto Protocol. The rest of the world has come to accept \nthat fact as well. So let us exorcize the specter of the Kyoto Protocol \nfrom this debate. The real question is what comes next. How do we \narrive at a credible, workable strategy, one compatible with the best \ninterests of the United States and of the other major emitting \nindustrial and developing countries? That must be the question now \nbefore us.\n  We must send a clear signal that we recognize our responsibilities, \nand we must be prepared to work toward a fair and effective framework \nfor action. We must be bold leaders. We owe this to ourselves; we owe \nit to the other nations of the world; and we owe it most of all to our \nchildren and to future generations.\n  Technology is a critical component to resolving the climate change \nchallenges in the U.S. and around the world. But let me be clear. Even \nas the administration has touted technology as the solution, it \ncontinues to woefully underfund these very programs. Technology \npolicies by themselves cannot be the silver bullet. Technology policies \nmust be paired with commonsense, market-based solutions to create \nincentives for innovation and adoption of new and improved technologies \nthat will provide a signal to reduce emissions.\n  There must be a broader approach. I want to commend Senators McCain \nand Lieberman for their diligence and hard work to find a middle \nground. I want to commend Senator Bingaman on his efforts as well. Like \nthem, I believe that we face a problem, and it requires that we craft \nan economically and environmentally sound solution.\n  The McCain-Lieberman amendment did not pass in its current form. \nWhile I did not vote for their amendment, I want to make it very clear \nto the administration and to others who just want to say ``no'' that I \nwill work with Senator McCain, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Bingaman, \nand other Republican and Democratic Senators who want to craft a \nconstructive solution.\n  I have long said that global warming and our energy security are \nmajor challenges in the U.S. and around the world. Troubling things are \nhappening in our atmosphere, and we should wake up. I am not alone in \nthis belief. The U.S. cannot bury its head in the sand and hope that \nthese problems will simply go away.\n  I have insisted on a rational and cost-effective approach for dealing \nwith climate change, both domestically and internationally. I have no \ndoubt that the far right and the far left will oppose any moderate \napproach on this issue, but it is time to get the right architecture \nand solid funding in place to make a first step a reality. I am \nconcerned that the McCain-Lieberman approach, in its present form, will \nnegatively impact my State, but that does not mean that we will not be \nable to find some common ground in the future. I hope that my friends \nin the energy industry will decide to work with them as well.\n  Mr. President, we cannot just stand still. I know Senator McCain. He \nis tenacious, and Senators Lieberman and Bingaman are equally \ntenacious. If 14 Senators in the middle can come together to diffuse \nthe Nuclear Option, then I am certain that a solid center of Senators \ncan find a new path forward to address global climate change and our \nNation's energy security needs. I would certainly not support actions \nthat would harm the economy or the people of my State of West Virginia \nor the United States in general. Yet, I repeat, I believe that there is \na middle path forward, and I stand ready to work with those who share \nthat view.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to speak to a particular section of \nH.R. 6, the Energy bill that would lead to Nevada and Washington \nratepayers being relieved of $480 million in fees under fraudulent \ncontracts entered into with Enron, the defunct energy company.\n  The largest utility in my State, Nevada Power, had a $326 million \ncontract with Enron for power. The contract was terminated once it \nbecame impossible for Enron to hide its financial frauds any longer and \ninstead was forced to declare bankruptcy. Nonetheless, Enron has \nasserted before the bankruptcy court the right to collect all of the \nprofits it would have made under the contract through so-called \n``termination payments.'' Enron has made this claim even though Enron \nnever delivered the power under the\n\n[[Page S7283]]\n\ncontract, even though Enron had obtained its authority to sell power \nfraudulently, and even thought Enron was in gross violation of its \nlegal authority to sell power at the very time the contract was entered \ninto.\n  The energy bill ensures that the proper government agency will \ndetermine whether Enron is entitle to more money from Nevada. That \nagency is the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC. When FERC was \nestablished by Congress, its fundamental mission was, and remains, to \nprotect ratepayers. FERC has specialized expertise required to resolve \nthe issues surrounding some of the contracts that Enron entered into \nand eventually terminated. The provision is an outgrowth of the Enron \ncriminal conspiracy to rip off ratepayers throughout the West.\n  Enron is still seeking to extract an additional $326 million in \nprofits from my State's utilities for power that was never delivered. \nEnron, after all of its market manipulation and financial fraud, is \nstill trying to profit from its wrong-doing at the expense of every \nNevadan.\n  Starting in December 2000, Nevada utilities entered into long-term \ncontracts with Enron to meet a significant portion of their long-term \nneeds. No one was aware of Enron's fraudulent activities to manipulate \nelectricity markets. The prices that Nevada Power agreed to pay were \nthree times as high as the threshold that FERC had established as a \nceiling price. In November 2001, Nevada Power asked FERC to review the \nrate to determine whether those contracts were just and reasonable. Two \ndays after the complaint was filed against Enron, Enron filed for \nbankruptcy. There is an issue in the bankruptcy case as to whether \nEnron can enforce contracts that it terminated. The bankruptcy court is \nresponsible for enhancing the bankruptcy estate for the benefit of \ncreditors. FERC, on the other hand, sees a more complete picture which \nincludes protecting the interests of the general public.\n  This issue is of paramount concern to my constituents. It will decide \nwhether they will be on the hook for more than a hundred million \ndollars, an amount that when spread out over a relatively small number \nof ratepayers, would translate into rate increases. It is critical that \nthis issue be decided by the forum with the specialized expertise in \nmatters relating to the sale of electricity with a stated mission of \nprotecting ratepayers, and that is the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission.\n  I would like to especially thank Senators Bingaman, Cantwell, \nDomenici, and Ensign for their assistance on this provision. I thank my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle for their support up until this \npoint, and for their continuing support in making sure that this \ncritical measure is included in the legislation that emerges from the \nconference committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am not aware of any further amendments. \nTherefore, I ask for a third reading of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask unanimous consent that the vote on passage of the \nbill occur at 9:45 a.m, on Tuesday, June 28, with paragraph 4 of rule \nXII waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, before I yield the floor, let me extend a \nvery special thanks to all who have participated in the crafting and \nthe final work product that we now have before us, a national energy \npolicy for our country. A good many have contributed and most assuredly \nthe chairman of the committee, Pete Domenici, and the ranking member, \nSenator Bingaman, have done an excellent job, in a very bipartisan way, \nto bring us to where we are at this moment.\n  Let me also extend a special thanks to the staff of the committee who \nhave expended extraordinary time and hours to get us to this point. I \nthank my personal staff for a near 5-year effort, as we have worked \nover a long period of time to winnow out, shape, and bring before us \nwhat I think I can say is a very fine work product.\n  I am anxious to see its final passage, which will occur on Tuesday, \nand a conference with the House. I hope we can have this bill on the \nPresident's desk sooner, rather than later. The American people deserve \na national energy policy that allows this country to get back into the \nproduction of energy of all of the types that have been addressed in \nthis legislation.\n  I thank all of my colleagues for their work effort, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               KARL ROVE\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to join many of my colleagues to \nexpress my dismay concerning the deplorable comments by Karl Rove that \nsuggest that--indeed states that Democrats did not respond to the \nattack on this country on 9/11, that they did not join in with other \nAmericans who not only recognized the consequences but came together to \nwork together to attack those who attacked us and to bring to justice \nthose who had callously attacked and killed thousands of Americans. \nSuch a statement is beyond the pale.\n  Mr. President, 9/11 is a moment in which the Nation was attacked, and \nwe all came together, not as Democrats or Republicans, liberals or \nconservatives, but as Americans. We all came together.\n  The record itself clearly undercuts this contention of Mr. Rove. \nWithin days of the attack of 9/11, we passed in this Senate an \nauthorization for the use of military force. The vote was 98 to \nnothing. Every Republican and every Democratic Senator voting cast his \nor her vote to give the President of the United States the authority \nand the power to go forward, seek our enemies, and destroy them.\n  I can recall going up to Providence, RI, my State capital, that \nafternoon, and standing with every one of the elected officials in the \nState, Republican and Democrat, before a crowd of 25,000 people. My \nmessage was very simple. The Senate unanimously has authorized the \nPresident to seek out and destroy those who attacked us. That is what \nhappened on 9/11. It was not as Mr. Rove tries to distort, to spin some \nsituation in which we did not recognize the consequences or respond to \nthe responsibilities of that dreadful moment.\n\n  Mr. Rove suggests that our response was simply to suggest therapy, to \nunderstand our attackers. That is a misstatement of the fact. In fact, \nfollowing that authorization of the use of force, we succeeded in this \nSenate, acting with virtual unanimity on measure after measure, to give \nthe President and this Nation what we all needed to defend ourselves \nand to inflict upon our adversaries the justice which they so richly \ndeserved.\n  We passed the Aviation Transportation Security Act. We passed the \nfiscal year Intelligence Authorization Act--unanimously, the fiscal \nyear Defense Authorization Act, the fiscal year Defense Appropriations \nAct, on and on and on, with virtual unanimity.\n  We did this because we recognized that we are Americans. Today, Mr. \nRove seeks to distort this historic record, to suggest we did not come \ntogether as Americans, but that there were those who knew the way and \ntook it and those who tried to ignore the reality. That is a gross \nmisstatement of history, of the facts, and he should apologize for it. \nIt is inappropriate that an individual who works in the White House \nshould make such callous and clearly erroneous statements for political \neffect.\n  Mr. Rove suggests, in the article I have seen in the newspaper \ndescribing his speech, that our response was one of moderation and \nrestraint. Nothing could be further from the truth. Our response was \none voice authorizing the President to attack, giving him the tools to \ncarry out the attack. Mr. Rove suggested that conservatives saw 9/11 \nand said we will defeat our enemies. That is exactly what all Americans \nsaid or did. He goes on to suggest that what liberals saw prompted \nliberals to say: We must understand our enemies.\n\n  Again, that is not the reality. I hope Mr. Rove is not suggesting \nunwittingly that we should go about without respecting and \nunderstanding our enemies. He should look back at Sun Tzu,\n\n[[Page S7284]]\n\nthe Chinese philosopher whose ``Art of War'' speaks to us today as it \ndid centuries ago. As Sun Tzu said:\n\n       If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear \n     the results of 100 battles.\n\n  In fact, some might suggest we are learning about our enemy too late \nin Iraq today.\n  The point I make is this type of attack has no place, it does not \nconform to history, it undercuts the spirit of that moment, a moment in \nwhich every American came together as one people, indeed, as the world \nresponded to us. That unanimity may have lessened over the last several \nmonths, but it was there. To view September 11 any other way is a gross \ndistortion. Mr. Rove should apologize for it.\n  He went on to attack my colleague, the Senator from Illinois, Mr. \nDurbin. Senator Durbin has apologized for his comments, and that \napology is appropriate. But to continue to attack this individual does \nnothing to advance any of the ideals or aspirations or policies that we \nmust be engaged with. What it does is distort a person, someone I have \ncome to know, respect, and admire. Someone who is caring and concerned \nfor people, whose thoughtfulness, whose intense commitment to doing \nwhat is appropriate for all Americans, and who is particularly \nsensitive to the needs of our military forces has impressed me.\n  Like anyone who has had the privilege of serving and understanding in \nthe U.S. Army or any uniformed service, I had the privilege of \ncommanding paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division. We understand \nthe extraordinary courage and bravery and valor of those individuals.\n  I have been impressed many times with Senator Durbin's commitment to \nhelp those individuals in meaningful ways by providing the equipment \nthey need, by ensuring that our veterans who have served with \ndistinction are not ignored. The attacks on him are without correlation \nto the person and to the service of this individual.\n  I hope Mr. Rove would apologize for these remarks and would refrain \nin the future from distorting the historial record. I don't think that \nis too much to ask of someone who is in such a position of power in the \nWhite House.\n  At this point, it is sufficient to conclude by saying I hope, indeed, \nthat we can avoid this kind of personalized attack, this gross \ndistortion, which is untrue, misleading, and divides a nation and does \nnot unite it. I hope we move on to substantive policy as we face real \nproblems that face this Nation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/23/senate-section/article/S7284-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I rise today to read from an e-mail sent \nto me in May of this year:\n\n       Our presence here is not just about Iraq. It is sending a \n     message to the oppressed peoples of the world that freedom \n     can be a reality. Freedom is the greatest gift that we, the \n     U.S., have been granted, and as such, it is our \n     responsibility to spread it. For it to become a permanent \n     fixture in our future and our children's future, we must give \n     it to all those that desire it.\n\n  Mr. President, that is an e-mail to me from 1LT Noah Harris, of \nEllijay, GA, from Baghdad, Iraq.\n  On Saturday of this past week, First Lieutenant Harris died in the \nservice of his country. His e-mail to me expressed democracy and \nfreedom far better than I am capable of doing.\n  Noah Harris served as an intern in Congressman Deal's office 2 years \nago, which is where I had the occasion to meet him.\n  When I received his e-mail, I sat down at my desk in my office and \nwrote him a note thanking him for his service to his country and his \nfellow man.\n  This morning, I rise to pay tribute to the life that has been given \non behalf of the greater good. Noah Harris was the type of young man \nwho serves without desire for credit or acclaim in Iraq today but on \nbehalf of his country and everything we stand for.\n  At the age of 23, he embodied the hope of the future. His sacrifice, \nin fact, ensures that the future for others will be brighter.\n  He captained his high school football team, was never beaten in the \nState in wrestling, went to the University of Georgia and captained the \ncheerleaders at that institution.\n  He came to Washington to serve as an intern. Shortly after September \n11, 2001--struck, as all of us were, by the tragedy of that day--Noah \nHarris volunteered to serve in the U.S. military and, to the greater \ngood, the people of the world.\n  On Saturday, at noon of this week, in Ellijay, GA, I and hundreds of \nother Georgians will pause in the northwest Georgia mountains to pay \ntribute to the life of Noah Harris.\n  I am privileged and pleased to stand on the floor of the Senate today \nin advance of that to acknowledge our thanks, on behalf of this Senate, \nand all who serve in this Congress, and our President, for the life, \nthe times, the service, and the gift of 1LT Noah Harris.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I stand before this body tonight with a \nheavy heart. One of Georgia's best and brightest young soldiers has \npaid the ultimate sacrifice in the service of his country in the War on \nTerror. Tonight the people of Ellijay, GA are grieving the loss of one \nof their bravest sons on the battlefield of freedom.\n  In our Nation's noble struggle to spread democracy, First Lieutenant \nNoah Harris gave his life in Baqubah, Iraq.\n  Noah, a member of the 2nd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment, 3rd \nInfantry Division, died of wounds suffered as a result of an explosion \nnear his armored vehicle around midnight, June 17, 2005.\n  Noah's death came one week before his birthday. Most young men his \nage would be making plans for a celebration; however, this young hero \nchoose the battlefield instead.\n  Nearly 24 years old, this brave patriot was eager to serve his \ncountry and to spread our message of freedom and democracy to oppressed \nnations. His tragic and untimely death is a testimony of his passion \nand dedication to freedom's call.\n  The only child of Rick and Lucy Harris, Noah was a state champion \nwrestler and the captain of his high school football team. A natural \nleader and athlete, Noah took these skills to the University of Georgia \nwhere he was the captain of the cheerleading squad.\n  As a 1999 graduate of Gilmer High School, Noah's gifts were not \nmerely athletic. He was honored as a scholar athlete during the Peach \nBowl. These are but a few of the admirable accomplishments and \nachievements that endeared Noah to all of those with whom he came in \ncontact.\n  While a student at UGA, Noah was motivated by the attack on our \ncountry on September 11th. Noah walked in to the ROTC office \nimmediately after\n9/11 asking to serve. Told he was too far along in his studies, Noah \npersisted until he was allowed to join the ROTC. You see, Noah believed \npassionately that there were no exemptions from serving in the cost of \nfreedom.\n  A personal longing to promote liberty and help the Iraqi people who \nhad long suffered under Saddam Hussein were a constant theme in Noah's \nletters home to his family and friends, but ever humble, Noah shrugged \noff the gravity of his commitment adopting the simple mantra ``I do \nwhat I can'' in response to being called a hero.\n  Noah believed that a greater good was worth fighting for and \nrecognized the power of leading by example which exemplifies the \nqualities in each one of our Nation's treasured soldiers.\n  Noah's vision and passion to achieve a greater good for the people of \nIraq is an excellent model for those who come after him to continue the \nfight against freedom's foes.\n  Noah aspired to serve in public office, and he was also interested in \nreal estate as a personal career. A passionate advocate for the mission \nin Iraq, Noah expressed the urgency of the cause\n\n[[Page S7285]]\n\nwhen he was home visiting friends and family during his leave in May.\n  It is clear that Noah had a caring heart, as his friends recount that \nhe was known to give Beanie Babies to the children in Iraq.\n  In tribute to Noah, members of the Gilmer County community will \nassemble at Gilmer High School Friday June 24 at 2 p.m. to distribute \nyellow ribbons across Gilmer County in preparation for the celebration \nof Noah's life on Saturday June 25, what would be his 24th birthday.\n  The ribbons will line highway 52 East in Ellijay to Highway 515, \nwhich stretches from the county line to the Ellijay First United \nMethodist Church, the site of the memorial service.\n  Another soldier in the vehicle was killed, and the driver was injured \nseverely in the explosion. Noah and his fellow soldiers were \ntransporting two captured insurgents during night operations in the \nBaquba neighborhood of Buhritz.\n  Noah's fellow soldier, Corporal William A. Long of Lilburn, GA, also \ndied from injuries sustained in the blast. Three years ago, after \ntalking with his stepfather and stepbrother, who are former members of \nthe military, William joined the Army.\n  After his enlistment expired, he was very aware that his unit would \nbe deployed to Iraq. His desire to serve our country and free the Iraqi \npeople, however, led him to re-enlist.\n  A resident of Atlanta for most of his life and a Berkmar High School \nalumnus, William was well-mannered and well-liked by all. His family \ndescribes him as a ``perfectionist'' and ``basketball-lover.''\n  Ironically, before going to Iraq, William participated in more than \n700 funerals as a member of the prestigious ``Old Guard.'' Many of \nthose funerals were held at Arlington National Cemetery, the cemetery \nwhere William will be buried.\n  President Ronald Reagan once said:\n\n       Putting people first has always been America's secret \n     weapon.\n\n  That secret weapon drives the American spirit to dream and dare, and \ntake great risks for a greater good. Noah and William represented the \ntrue heart of servant leadership. Their desire was to first, serve \nothers, not themselves.\n  My wife Julianne and I wish to extend our sympathies and our prayers \nto both Noah's and William's family, friends, and fellow soldiers. \nTheir sacrifice will not be lost or forgotten. May God bless Noah \nHarris and William Long.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/23/senate-section/article/S7285-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7285-S7289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this morning in the Armed Services \nCommittee, Secretary Rumsfeld and Generals Myers, Casey, and Abizaid \nbriefed us on the status of the war effort.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld said, once again, that it is a tough road ahead \nbut that we must persevere and he sees reasons to be hopeful. Secretary \nRumsfeld was describing a different war than most persons are concerned \nabout. The war in Iraq they see is one of mistake after mistake after \nmistake. Whatever our position on the Iraq war, we should all be \nconcerned that the administration has not handled it competently.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld needs to see what the American people see very \nclearly: The President does not have a winning strategy in Iraq. Our \ntroops have been asked to do more with less. Our current strategy isn't \nworking and the Congress and the American people know it.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld insists today that it is false to say the \nadministration is painting a rosy picture. But that is exactly what he \ncontinues to do. It is time for Secretary Rumsfeld to take off his \nrose-colored glasses and admit to the American people and to our men \nand women in uniform who are paying the price with their lives for its \nfailures that he had no realistic strategy for success.\n  It is time to level with the American people instead of continuing to \npaint an optimistic picture that has no basis in reality because of his \nfailed strategy. And it is time for Secretary Rumsfeld to resign.\n  Despite the elections last January and the formation of a new \ntransitional Iraqi government, many are increasingly concerned that the \nadministration has no effective or realistic plan to stabilize Iraq. It \ncontinues to underestimate the strength and the deadly resilience of \nthe Iraqi insurgency and it has failed shamefully to adequately protect \nour troops. More than 1,700 American service men and women have been \nkilled in Iraq so far and over 13,000 more have been wounded. The \nfamilies of these courageous soldiers know all too well that the \ninsurgents are not desperate or dead-enders or in their last throes, as \nadministration officials have repeatedly claimed.\n  Instead, General Casey indicated that the insurgency is around 26,000 \nstrong, an increase over the 5,000 the Pentagon believed were part of \nthe insurgency 1 year ago.\n\n  As General Myers said in April, the capacity of the insurgents ``is \nwhere they were almost a year ago.'' General Abizaid told the committee \ntoday that the overall strength of the insurgency is ``about the same \nas it was'' 6 months ago. Looking ahead, as General Vines said this \nweek, ``I'm assuming that the insurgency will remain at about its \ncurrent level.''\n  In the last 2 months, America has lost an average of three soldiers a \nday in Iraq, and no end is in sight. As General Myers said on May 12.\n\n       I wouldn't look for results tomorrow . . . One thing we \n     know about insurgencies is that they last from . . . three, \n     four years to nine years.\n\n  Because of the war, our military has been stretched to the breaking \npoint.\n  The Department of Defense has had to activate a stop-loss policy, to \nprevent service members from leaving the military as soon as they \nfulfill their commitment.\n  Nearly 50 percent of the persons serving in the regular Armed Forces \nhave been deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan since December 2001, and \nnearly 15 percent of them have been deployed more than once.\n  Thirty six percent of all those serving in the Armed Forces, \nincluding in the National Guard and the Reserves, have been deployed to \nIraq or Afghanistan of since December of 2001.\n  The alarm bell about the excessive strain on our forces has been \nringing for at least a year and a half. In January 2004, LTG John Riggs \nsaid it bluntly:\n\n       I have been in the Army 39 years, and I've never seen the \n     Army as stretched in that 39 years as I have today.\n\n  As LTG James Helmley, head of the Army Reserve, warned at the end of \n2004, the Army Reserve ``is rapidly degenerating into a `broken' \nforce'' and is ``in grave danger of being unable to meet other \noperational requirements.''\n  These continuing deployments are taking their toll not only on our \nforces in the field but also on their families here at home. The \ndivorce rate in the active-duty military has increased 40 percent since \n2000.\n  The war in Iraq and the casualties and the strain on families have \nseriously undermined the Pentagon's ability to attract new recruits and \nretain members already serving. Both the Regular and Reserve components \nof the Armed Forces are increasingly unable to meet recruitment goals. \nMG Michael Rochelle, head of the Army Recruiting Command, stated the \nproblem succinctly in May when he said that this year is ``the toughest \nrecruiting climate ever faced by the all-volunteer Army.''\n  In March, the Pentagon announced it was raising the maximum age for \nArmy National Guard recruits from 34 to 39, and was also offering \ngenerous new health benefits for Guard and Reserve members activated \nafter the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n  Despite these facts, Secretary Rumsfeld insisted today that we will \nnot have a broken Army as a result of the war.\n  The severe strain the war is placing on our Armed Forces and on our \nability to protect our national security interests in other parts of \nthe world concerns us all.\n  The Army has been forced to go to all-time new lengths to fill its \nranks. In May, it began offering a 15-month active duty enlistment, the \nshortest enlistment tour in the history of the Army.\n  To recruit and retain more soldiers, the National Guard has increased \nits retention bonus from $5,000 to $15,000. The first-time signing \nbonus has gone up from $6,000 to $10,000. GEN Steven Blum, Chief of the \nArmy National Guard, said:\n\n       Otherwise, the Guard will be broken and not ready the next \n     time it's needed, either here at home or for war.\n\n\n[[Page S7286]]\n\n\n  We all know that these problems of recruiting and retention cannot be \nfixed through enlistment bonuses, health benefits, and raising the age \nof service. These are short-term Band-Aids on the much larger problem \nof the war. Only progress in bringing the war to an honorable \nconclusion will lead to a long-term solution to the problem which is \nclearly undermining our ability to respond to crises elsewhere in the \nworld.\n  Despite claims by the administration of progress, Iraq is far from \nstable and secure. We have made very little progress on security since \nsovereignty was transferred to the interim Iraqi Government 1 year ago.\n  Today, Secretary Rumsfeld insisted we are not stuck in a quagmire in \nIraq. He insisted that ``the idea that what's happening over there is a \nquagmire is so fundamentally inconsistent with the facts.'' What planet \nis he on? Perhaps he is still living in the ``Mission Accomplished'' \nworld.\n  By last June, 852 American service members had been killed in action. \nToday, the number has doubled to more than 1,700.\n  By last June, 5,000 American service members had been wounded in \naction. Today, the number has more than doubled, to over 13,000.\n  DIA Director Admiral Jacoby told the Armed Services Committee in \nMarch that:\n\n     the insurgency in Iraq has grown in size and complexity over \n     the past year. Attacks numbered approximately 25 per day one \n     year ago.\n\n  Just last week, General Pace said:\n\n       the numbers of attacks country-wide in Iraq each day is \n     about 50 or 60.\n\n  A year ago, the United States had 34 coalition partners in Iraq. Nine \nof those partners have pulled out in the past year. Today, we have just \n25. By the end of the year, another five countries that are among the \nlargest contributors of troops are scheduled to pull out.\n  One year ago, 140,000 American troops were serving in Iraq. Today, we \nhave the same number of troops.\n  The training of the Iraqi security forces continues to falter. The \nadministration still has not given the American people a straight \nanswer about how many Iraqi security forces are adequately trained and \nequipped. They continue to overestimate the number of Iraqis actually \nable to fight. In the words of the General Accounting Office:\n\n       U.S. government agencies do not report reliable data on the \n     extent to which Iraqi security forces are trained and \n     equipped.\n\n  In February last year, Secretary Rumsfeld preposterously said:\n\n       We accelerated the training of Iraqi security forces, now \n     more than 200,000 strong.\n  In fact, the numbers of Iraqis who are adequately trained is far, far \nlower. As General Meyers conceded a year later, only about 40,000 Iraqi \nsecurity forces ``can go anywhere and do anything.''\n  It is still far from clear how many Iraqi forces are actually capable \nof fighting without American help and assistance.\n  Our reconstruction effort has faltered as well over the last year--\nand faltered badly. The misery index in Iraq continues to rise. As of \nJune 15, only $6 billion--one third--of the $18 billion provided by \nCongress last summer for Iraq reconstruction had been spent.\n  The Iraqi people desperately need jobs. But we are unable to spend \nfunds quickly, because the security situation is so dire. Of the amount \nwe do spend, it is far from clear how much is actually creating jobs \nand improving the quality of life. We need greater focus on small \nprojects to create jobs for Iraqis, not huge grants to multinational \ncorporations that create more profits for corporate executives than \nstability in Iraq.\n  By the State Department's own accounting, up to 15 percent of \nreconstruction funding is being used to provide security for the \nreconstruction. That estimate itself may be too low. A Department of \nEnergy analysis this month says that perhaps 40 percent or more is \nactually being spent on security, as opposed to actual reconstruction.\n  These costs have increased--not decreased--over the past year as \ninsurgent attacks have continued to escalate. We are spending ever-\nincreasing amounts of assistance on security to guard against an \ninsurgency that the Vice President insists is in its last throes.\n  A joint survey by the United Nations Development Program and the \nIraqi Government released last month shows Iraq is suffering from high \nunemployment, widespread poverty, deteriorating infrastructure, and \nunreliable water, sewage, sanitation, and electricity services--despite \nits immense oil wealth and access to water.\n  Estimates of the number of unemployed range between 20 and 50 percent \nof the population. Every unemployed person is ripe for recruiting by \nthe insurgents, who offer as little as $50 a person for those willing \nto plant explosives on a highway or shoot a policeman.\n  Iraq still suffers heavily from severe electricity shortages. \nAccording to the Department of Energy assessment, the causes are \nnumerous, ``including sabotage, looting, lack of security for workers, \ndisruptions in fuel supplies . . .''\n  A year ago, Iraqis had an average of 12 hours of electricity per day. \nToday, they have just over 10 hours a day.\n  Almost all of Baghdad's households suffer from an unstable supply. In \nparts of the city, electricity is turned on for 3 hours and then turned \noff for 3 hours. As a result, 29 percent rely on private generators for \nelectricity. In areas with high incidences of poverty, many families \nhave no alternative supply to turn to.\n  Water and sanitation are enormous problems as well. Just this week, \nwater was unavailable in many parts of Baghdad because insurgents blew \nup the water pipes.\n  According to the United Nations Development Program, only 54 percent \nof families in Iraq have safe drinking water, and 80 percent of \nfamilies in rural areas use unsafe drinking water.\n  What happened to all of the oil that was supposed to pay for the \ncosts of reconstruction and drive the recovery of Iraq's economy? Last \nyear, the Iraqi Oil Minister said that 642 attacks on the oil system \nhad cost the economy $10 billion. In 2005, pipelines are still under \nattack, and analysts believe it will be 2 to 3 years before Iraq is \nable to increase its oil production.\n  The administration has been consistently wrong about Iraq. They \nwrongly insisted there was no guerilla war. They repeatedly--and \nwrongly--called the insurgents dead-enders who are in their last \nthroes. They repeatedly--and wrongly--sent our service men and women on \npatrol without proper armor, a shortage that continues with the marines \neven today. When Secretary Rumsfeld was challenged about it by a \nsoldier, to huge applause from the troops, on the Secretary's visit to \nIraq last December, he responded:\n\n       You go to war with the army you have. They're not the army \n     you might want or wish to have at a later time.\n\n  That response from the troops says it all. Surely, no Secretary of \nWar or Secretary of Defense in our history has ever been so humiliated \nby his troops or received such a resounding vote of no confidence.\n  The Secretary's failed strategy has created an impossible situation \nfor our forces. The administration has undermined our national security \nand undermined our ability to protect our national security interests \nelsewhere in the world.\n  Our colleague, Senator Hagel, summed it up brilliantly when he told \nU.S. News and World Report last week:\n\n       Things aren't getting better; they're getting worse. The \n     White House is completely disconnected from reality . . . \n     It's like they're just making it up as they go along. The \n     reality is that we're losing in Iraq.\n\n  Mr. President, next Tuesday marks the 1-year anniversary of the \ntransfer of sovereignty in Iraq, and to mark the occasion, President \nBush will address the Nation.\n  When he does, all of us hope that he will state a new, more realistic \nand more effective strategy for the United States to succeed in Iraq.\n  The war has clearly made America less safe in the world. It has \nstrengthened support for al-Qaida and made it harder to win the real \nwar against terrorism--the war against al-Qaida.\n  The President needs an effective strategy to accelerate the training \nof a capable Iraqi security force.\n  The President needs an effective strategy to rescue the faltering \nreconstruction effort and create jobs and hope for the Iraqi people, \nand neutralize the temptation to join the insurgents.\n  The President needs an effective strategy for serious diplomacy to \nbring\n\n[[Page S7287]]\n\nthe international community into Iraq, to support the adoption of a \nconstitution that protects all the people of Iraq.\n  He needs an effective strategy to repair the damage the war has \ncaused to our reputation in the world and to our military. Our men and \nwomen in uniform deserve no less.\n  We are muddling through day by day, hoping for the best, and fearing \nthe worst. Our men and women in uniform deserve better--and so do the \nAmerican people.\n\n\n                                ASBESTOS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to talk briefly \nabout the contents of S. 852 to provide for asbestos reform. This is a \nsubject which has been before the Senate in one way or another for the \nbetter part of two decades. I recall my first contact with the issue \nwhen then-Senator Gary Hart of Colorado was soliciting members of the \nJudiciary Committee because of the deep problems of Johns- Mansville.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States, on a number of occasions, has \nimportuned the Congress to take over the subject because the asbestos \ncases are flooding the courts and because class actions are \ninappropriate to address the issue.\n  The result of the avalanche of asbestos litigation has seen some 77 \ncompanies in the United States go into bankruptcy and thousands of \npeople suffering from asbestos-related injuries--mesothelioma, deadly \ndiseases--and unable to collect any compensation because of the fact \ntheir employers or those who would be liable for their injuries are in \na state of bankruptcy.\n  Senator Hatch took the lead as chairman of the Judiciary Committee in \nthe 108th Congress in structuring a bill which created a trust fund \nwhich has been established at $140 billion to pay asbestos victims. \nThis is a sum of money which has been agreed to by the insurance \ncompanies and by the manufacturers and had the imprimatur of the \nleadership of the Senate.\n  In the fall of last year, 2004, Senator Frist and Senator Daschle \ncame to terms as that being a figure which would take care of the \nneeds. The victims have never been totally satisfied with that figure, \nbut it represents a very substantial sum, obviously, and according to \nthe filings of the Goldman Sachs analysis, should be adequate to \ncompensate the victims.\n  They made a detailed analysis and came to the conclusion that $125 \nbillion was the figure necessary. Then when we removed the smokers, a \nfigure of $7 billion, it came to a net of $118 billion, leaving a \nsubstantial cushion between $118 billion on the projection and $140 \nbillion.\n  When the bill was passed out of the Judiciary Committee in late July \nof 2003, largely along party lines, the aid of a senior Federal judge \nwas enlisted to serve as a mediator. Chief Judge Edward R. Becker had \ntaken senior status the preceding May and was willing to convene the \nparties, the so-called stakeholders, in his chambers in Philadelphia in \nAugust of 2003. He brought together the insurers, the trial lawyers, \nthe AFL-CIO representing claimants, and the manufacturers, a group of \nfour interest groups who are very powerful in our community.\n  From those two meetings, there have been a series of approximately 40 \nconferences in my offices where we have worked through a vast number of \nproblems where I think we have accommodated many of the interests.\n  In May, the Judiciary Committee voted the bill out of committee on a \n13-to-5 vote, with bipartisan support, and during the course of the \nmarkup some 70 amendments were agreed to. There are still some \noutstanding issues, but we have been soliciting cosponsors and have \nfound very substantial interest in the Senate on trying to move through \nlegislation on this important issue. There is no denial that this is a \nvery major national problem. There is no denial that there are many \nvictims of asbestos who are now destitute because the people who were \nresponsible for their damages have gone into bankruptcy. There is no \ndenial that there has been a tremendous drain on the U.S. economy and \nthat if we could solve this issue it would be a bigger boost to the \neconomy than a gigantic tax break or most any other remedy which might \nbe found to stimulate our economy.\n  There are, obviously, risks in any bill. We have worked through the \ncomplexities of a startup procedure where the people who have exigent \nclaims--that is, where they may die within a year--we have an elaborate \nsystem of offers and inducements to try to settle those cases within a \nbrief period of time, some 9 months. Obviously, we cannot have a stay \nof judicial proceedings forever, so there has to be some resort to the \ncourts if we are unable to get the program set up.\n  Without going into greater detail, we have worked assiduously to try \nto resolve this issue. We either have it solved or are very close to a \nsolution. We have worked through complex questions on subrogation, \ncomplex questions on the Federal Employers Liability Act, and there are \nstill ongoing decisions with a controversy as to how the $90 billion \nwill be divided up among the manufacturers. That essentially is the \nquestion that only the manufacturers themselves can guarantee.\n  Similarly, there are issues as to how the $46 billion will be divided \nup among the insurers. Candidly, the insurance industry is split on the \nissue, but we are still working, and I have meetings in the course of \nthe next week to 10 days with people who have outstanding concerns to \ntry to resolve those issues.\n  When the vote came out of committee, some of those who voted in favor \nof the bill did so with reservations. We have worked through this, and \nI think those issues are either resolved or resolvable.\n  Senator Leahy and I have worked very closely. It is a bipartisan bill \nwhich had the 10 members of the Judiciary Committee on the Republican \nside voting in favor--to repeat again, subject to some reservations--\nand three Democrats voting in favor of the bill. Senator Leahy and I \nare determined to retain our core provisions, but we are open to \nsuggestions.\n  It is my hope that this bill will come to the Senate right after the \nFourth of July recess. That, of course, is a decision which the \nmajority leader has to make in setting the calendar. There is a \nmomentum in hand where it would be very much in the national interest, \nfor the reasons I stated, to move ahead.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Dear Colleague letter \nsent by Senator Leahy and myself to Members of the Senate be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my presentation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 2005.\n       Dear Colleague: We write to detail the problem our nation \n     now faces with the asbestos crisis and to inform you on the \n     substance of Senate Bill 852, the Fairness in Asbestos Injury \n     Resolution Act of 2005, which was voted out of committee on \n     May 26 with a bipartisan 13-5 majority. We urge you to \n     support this bill, and reiterate our interest in working with \n     you to improve this legislation while preserving its core \n     provisions. This is more detailed than the customary ``Dear \n     Colleague'' letter, but we felt this extensive discussion was \n     necessary because of the complexities of the issues and \n     proposed legislation.\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       The asbestos issue has been before the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee for more than twenty years, since Senator Gary Hart \n     of Colorado sought the assistance of Judiciary Committee \n     members in enacting federal legislation to address Johns-\n     Manville's asbestos claims.\n       Since that time: asbestos litigation has overwhelmed both \n     federal and state court systems; 77 companies have gone into \n     bankruptcy, with more on the brink, due to the rising tide of \n     asbestos claims; and thousands of impaired asbestos victims \n     have received pennies on the dollar since many of the \n     companies liable for their exposure have gone into \n     bankruptcy.\n       Since the 1980's, the number of asbestos defendants has \n     risen from about 300 to more than 8,400, spanning \n     approximately 85 percent of the U.S. economy. As a result, \n     some 60,000 workers lost their jobs. Employees' retirement \n     funds have shrunk by an estimated 25 percent. This is a \n     problem that extends beyond the victims of asbestos disease \n     alone. It has a growing impact on the average American and \n     little question remains that it is a crisis of serious \n     proportions.\n\n\n                 The Courts Enlist the Help of Congress\n\n       In 1997, the Supreme Court commented for the first time on \n     the growing asbestos problem by stating (in the context of \n     holding that asbestos litigation was not susceptible to class \n     action treatment):\n       The most objectionable aspects of this asbestos litigation \n     can be briefly summarized: dockets in both federal and state \n     courts continue to grow; long delays are routine; trials\n\n[[Page S7288]]\n\n     are too long; the same issues are litigated over and over; \n     transaction costs exceed the victims' recovery by nearly two \n     to one; exhaustion of assets threatens and distorts the \n     process; and future claimants may lose altogether. . . .\n       Given the escalating problem, the Supreme Court has \n     repeatedly called upon Congress to act through national \n     legislation: ``[T]he elephantine mass of asbestos cases . . . \n     defies customary judicial administration and calls for \n     national legislation.'' The current asbestos crisis ``cries \n     out for a legislative solution.'' ``Members of this Court \n     have indicated that Congress should enact legislation to help \n     resolve the asbestos problem. Congress has not responded.'' \n     As recently as 2003, the high court observed that ``this \n     Court has recognized the danger that no compensation will be \n     available for those with severe injuries caused by asbestos . \n     . . It is only a matter of time before inability to pay for \n     real illness comes to pass.''\n\n\n                          The 2005 Rand Report\n\n       On May 10, 2005, the Rand Corporation issued a report \n     highlighting the problems that many asbestos victims face in \n     today's tort system. In addition to discussing the number of \n     corporate bankruptcies, and other alarming economic \n     consequences of asbestos liability, the report summarized the \n     average disbursements on asbestos payments to claimants for \n     the year 2002, the most recent year available: Asbestos \n     victims filing claims receive an average of forty-two (42) \n     cents for every dollar spent on asbestos litigation; Thirty-\n     one (31 cents) cents of every dollar have gone to defense \n     costs; and Twenty-seven (27 cents) cents have gone to \n     plaintiffs attorneys and related court cost.\n\n\n                 Legislative History Leading to S. 852\n\n       The current bipartisan bill is the product of years of \n     negotiations, discussion, and compromise. On May 22, 2003, \n     then-Chairman Hatch introduced S. 1125, the Fairness in \n     Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2003. He deserves great \n     credit for establishing in that bill a national trust fund \n     with a schedule of payments, analogous to workers' \n     compensation. We have built on that aspect of S. 1125, ever \n     mindful that the primary objective of legislation must be to \n     ensure fair and timely compensation to victims of asbestos \n     disease.\n       In July 2003, the Judiciary Committee voted out S. 1125, \n     largely along party lines, in an effort to move the \n     legislation forward. However, the bill foundered on \n     unresolved issues. In August, Judge Edward R. Becker, who had \n     recently taken senior status after being Chief Judge of the \n     Third Circuit, and having authored the opinion in the \n     asbestos class action suit which was affirmed by the U.S. \n     Supreme Court, convened a two-day conference in \n     Philadelphia--with manufacturers, labor (AFL-CIO), insurers, \n     and trial lawyers to determine if some common ground could be \n     found. Subsequently, from September 2003 through January \n     2005, we held 36 stakeholder meetings here, with Judge Becker \n     as a pro bono mediator. These meetings were usually attended \n     by at least 25 stakeholder representatives with as many as 75 \n     representatives attending on some occasions. These \n     stakeholder sessions have included many Senators, as well the \n     staffs of Senators Feinstein, Carper, Cornyn, DeWine, Ben \n     Nelson, Baucus, Biden, Chambliss, Craig, Dodd, Durbin, \n     Feingold, Graham, Grassley, Kennedy, Kohl, Kyl, Landrieu, \n     Levin, Lincoln, Murray, Pryor, Schumer, Sessions, Snowe, \n     Stabenow, and Voinovich.\n       Over the last few months, in anticipation of bill \n     introduction and during Committee markup, we convened 26 \n     meetings with our Judiciary Committee colleagues to address \n     their concerns with the bill. During these deliberative \n     sessions, we addressed issues including disease categories, \n     award amounts, Fund sunset, and judgments and verdicts \n     pending at the time of enactment.\n       After hundreds of hours of extensive analysis and \n     deliberation, we found we could accommodate many, if not \n     most, of the myriad issues raised by stakeholders and \n     Senators before formal introduction of S. 852. After \n     introduction, the Judiciary Committee held six markups \n     lasting over a month. During this bipartisan process, \n     and through continuing meetings, we were able to further \n     resolve a number of complex issues, including medical \n     criteria, Fund start-up, insurer allocation, the Equitas \n     hardship issue, and Fund contribution transparency. \n     Indeed, the markup process resulted in the Committee's \n     acceptance of over 70 amendments from Republican and \n     Democratic members. After extensive deliberation, the \n     Committee discharged S. 852 on a solid bipartisan vote of \n     13-5.\n\n\n                                 S. 852\n\n       We have sought an equitable bill which takes into account, \n     to the maximum extent possible, the concerns of stakeholders \n     and Senators. The bill establishes a privately-funded $140 \n     billion trust fund that compensates asbestos victims through \n     a no-fault system administered by the Department of Labor. S. \n     852 in no way holds the taxpayer responsible for contributing \n     to the Fund. In fact, during markup, the Committee accepted \n     an amendment that explicitly absolves the federal government \n     from any funding obligations or liabilities with respect to \n     the Fund.\n       Once established and capitalized through the private \n     contributions from defendant and insurer participants, \n     asbestos victims will simply submit their claims to the fund \n     through an administrative process designed to compensate them \n     quickly. Claimants would be fairly compensated if they meet \n     medical criteria for certain illnesses and if they show past \n     asbestos exposure.\n       The major features of this bill reflect consensus on core \n     principles, but all are directed to ensuring fair and \n     adequate compensation to the victims of asbestos exposure:\n       Funding: The size of the fund was a principal issue of \n     contention during the 108th Congress. Last October, Majority \n     Leader Frist and then-Democratic Leader Daschle agreed that \n     the Fund should be set at $140 billion, which has been \n     generally accepted as sufficient to ensure adequate payment \n     to victims and is now embodied in S. 852. The manufacturers \n     and insurers have agreed to pay that sum--a guaranteed \n     amount--into the trust fund.\n       Removal of the Old Level VII's: Some members raised \n     concerns about compensating the so-called ``exposure only'' \n     Level VII lung cancers, fearing that this disease category \n     would create a ``smokers'' compensation fund. Without \n     sufficient markers to show a stronger causal connection \n     between asbestos exposure and lung cancer, this disease \n     category could have required $7 billion from the Fund. After \n     serious consideration, we removed this disease category from \n     the bill.\n       No Subrogation: A key issue for to determine compensation \n     for asbestos victims has been workers' compensation \n     subrogation. Allowing for subrogation would permit insurers \n     to impose a lien on Fund awards recovered by claimants. The \n     value of an award to the claimant depends on whether the \n     claimant may have to pay a substantial amount of it to \n     others. To be fair to victims, claimants should be allowed to \n     retain and receive the full value of both their Fund awards \n     and workers' compensation payments.\n       More Effective Start-Up: Perhaps one of the most difficult \n     issues was how pending claims in the tort system will be \n     treated upon S. 852's enactment. With general agreement that \n     if the fund was not up and running within a reasonable amount \n     of time, some or all pending claims could return to the tort \n     system. The bill as introduced provides for a 9 month stay of \n     claims for exigent cases and a 24 month stay for nonexigent \n     cases. Furthermore, the legislation creates a procedure \n     enabling exigent claimants to receive prompt payment even \n     during the initial startup period authored by Senator \n     Feinstein. Taking into consideration concerns raised by \n     victims, insurers, and defendant participants, Senators Kyl \n     and Feinstein worked through compromise language during the \n     markup process that greatly improves the start-up process.\n       Sunset: The stakeholders generally agree that if the Fund \n     cannot pay all valid claims, a claimant's right to a jury \n     trial cannot be barred. But such a sunset should not occur \n     before there is an extensive and rigorous ``program review.'' \n     During markup, Senators Kyl and Leahy worked towards refining \n     the sunset procedures by enabling the Administrator to submit \n     recommendations to Congress regarding possible changes to the \n     medical criteria or the funding formula. In the event of a \n     sunset, the bill now allows claimants to bring their lawsuits \n     only in federal court or in a state court in the state in \n     which the plaintiff resides or where the exposure took place.\n       Attorneys' Fees: Before S. 852 was introduced, and after \n     extensive deliberation with Judiciary Committee members, \n     agreement was reached on a 5% attorneys' fee cap for all \n     monetary awards received by asbestos victims within the Fund. \n     The nature of the claims process justifies this cap, for once \n     the fund is established, recovery is fairly straightforward \n     and there will no longer be a need for substantial and time-\n     consuming attorney involvement. Moreover, fee caps in federal \n     compensation programs are fairly common. We are working on \n     further refinements in the bill to assist claimants in \n     processing their claims through a paralegal program that \n     the Administrator will be authorized to implement.\n       Level VI Claimants: Members raised concerns about the \n     strength of the causal connection between asbestos exposure \n     and the development of cancer in areas other than the lungs \n     (e.g., colon, stomach, esophageal and laryngeal cancers). To \n     assuage these concerns, the bill commissions an Institute of \n     Medicine study to assess this causal connection, which will \n     come out no later than April 2006. The findings of the study \n     will become binding on the Administrator when compensating \n     asbestos victims for each cancer in this disease category.\n       Silica Claims: We heard concerns that many asbestos claims \n     might be ``repackaged'' as silica claims in the tort system. \n     We also, however, heard concerns that liability for non-\n     asbestos diseases not be abrogated simply because S. 852 \n     becomes law. The stakeholders agree that this is an asbestos \n     bill, designed to dispose of all asbestos claims, but that \n     workers with genuine silica exposure disease should be able \n     to pursue their claims in the tort system. A hearing was held \n     on this issue on February 2, 2005, which established that \n     exposure to asbestos and silica are easily distinguishable on \n     x-rays and that markings from asbestos and silica disease are \n     rarely found in the same patient. Consequently, the bill \n     requires claimants, prior to pursuing a silica claim in the \n     tort system, to provide rigorous medical evidence \n     establishing that their injury was caused by exposure to \n     silica, and that asbestos exposure was not a significant \n     contributing factor to their injuries.\n\n[[Page S7289]]\n\n       Medical Screening: Some Committee members were concerned \n     about a medical screening program within the Fund. Although \n     earlier versions of the asbestos bill excluded such a \n     program, we concluded that one was necessary as an offset to \n     the reduced role of a claimant's attorney. It is reasonable \n     to have routine examinations for a discrete population of \n     high-risk workers as a matter of basic fairness. By \n     establishing a program with rigorous standards (such as a \n     provision offered by Senator Coburn requiring service \n     providers to be paid at Medicare rates), as has been done in \n     this bill, unmeritorious claims can be avoided with the fair \n     determination of those entitled to compensation under the \n     statutory standard. This program is vastly different from any \n     screening in the current tort system.\n       Pending Claims and Settlements: Prior to bill introduction, \n     and as a result of the numerous stakeholder meetings, \n     agreement was reached on how the bill affects pending claims \n     and settlements in the tort system. The bill preserves: (1) \n     cases with a verdict or final order or final judgment entered \n     by a trial court; (2) any civil claim that, on the date of \n     enactment, is in trial before a jury or judge at the \n     presentation of evidence phase; and (3) written settlement \n     agreements, executed prior to date of enactment, between a \n     defendant and a specific named plaintiff, so long as the \n     agreement expressly obligates the defendant to make a future \n     monetary payment to the plaintiff and plaintiff fulfills all \n     conditions of the settlement agreement within 30 days.\n       CT Scans: Unlike prior iterations of the asbestos bill, S. \n     852 permits greater use of CT scans. During markup, the \n     Committee accepted an amendment that commissions a study by \n     the Institute of Medicine to evaluate whether CT scans are \n     well accepted and reasonably reliable to diagnose certain \n     lung cancer claims. In addition, after extensive discussions \n     between Senators Leahy and Coburn, the Committee accepted an \n     amendment that calls on the American College of Radiologists \n     to establish guidelines for comparing claimants' CT scans.\n       Transparency: Several members raised concern over the \n     specific sources of defendant funding. After numerous \n     briefing sessions from claims analysts and financial \n     projection experts, the Committee accepted an amendment which \n     provides that within 60 days after the date of enactment the \n     contributors to the Fund must submit to the Administrator \n     information sufficient to determine their contribution \n     levels. The Administrator must publish this funding \n     allocation information in the Federal Register within 60 days \n     of receipt and before the Fund can be deemed operational.\n       Asbestos Ban: Despite the known danger involved with \n     asbestos, a number of products and processes still use \n     asbestos today. As Congress considers creating an alternative \n     compensation program to address past exposures to asbestos, \n     it is only sensible that we also prevent future asbestos-\n     related illnesses from occurring by banning asbestos use. \n     Therefore, this bipartisan bill contains a ban on the \n     commercial manufacture, use and distribution of asbestos and \n     asbestos-containing products, originally authored by Senator \n     Murray. This provision was unanimously modified in Committee \n     last month by the adoption of Senator Kyl's amendment to \n     provide narrow exceptions to the ban for national security \n     purposes.\n       S. 852 has benefited from a thorough process during this \n     Congress. This legislation is complicated, but it is both \n     integrated and comprehensive and reflects a remarkable and \n     widespread will to enact legislation to finally resolve the \n     asbestos crisis. On the state of a 20 year record, the choice \n     we are presented with is not between this bipartisan bill and \n     one that takes a dramatically different approach. The choice \n     is between this bipartisan bill and the continuation of the \n     present chaotic system which leaves thousands of victims \n     suffering from deadly diseases without compensation and \n     scores of companies threatened with bankruptcy.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n     Patrick Leahy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/23/senate-section/article/S7289-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               STRAW PURCHASES AND THE ILLEGAL GUN MARKET\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, a report published last week in the Buffalo \nNews further exposes how reckless gun dealers and the use of ``straw \npurchasers'' contribute to gun violence in our country. It is important \nthat we recognize their role in adding to our Nation's gun violence \nproblem and work to enact commonsense legislation to keep dangerous \nfirearms out of the hands of violent criminals.\n  Under current law, when an individual buys a handgun from a licensed \ndealer, there are Federal requirements for a background check to insure \nthat the purchaser is not an individual who is prohibited by law from \npurchasing or possessing a firearm. ``Straw purchasers'' serve as \nmiddlemen by purchasing firearms with the intent of transferring or \nselling them to other individuals who may be prohibited by law from \npurchasing firearms themselves or who may wish to hide the total number \nof firearms in their possession from Federal authorities. These ``straw \npurchasers'' help to supply the illegal gun market by allowing the true \npurchaser to obtain firearms, oftentimes in large quantities, without \nhaving to pass a background check. This practice is a felony under \nFederal law.\n  As the Buffalo News report points out, individuals using ``straw \npurchasers'' are often aided by gun dealers who turn a blind eye to the \npractice. One of the gun show dealers mentioned in the report has been \nlinked to more than 600 guns recovered by New York City police, a semi-\nautomatic rifle used in the 1999 shootings at Columbine High School, \nand is now prohibited from selling guns in the State of California as a \nresult of a lawsuit brought by several communities there. In addition, \nreportedly nearly 200 handguns that were illegally resold in Buffalo, \nNY, were originally sold by the same dealer. Investigations revealed \nthat the handguns were obtained over a 6-month period by a man and \nseveral accomplices who made ``straw purchases'' on his behalf. Since \nrecords of multiple gun sales must be filed with the Government, the \n``straw purchases'' were apparently made to avoid alerting Federal \nauthorities to the illegal reselling of the guns in Buffalo. According \nto the Buffalo News, the ``straw purchasers'' in this case said that \ntheir role was limited to signing and paying for the handguns that the \ntrue buyer selected.\n  Occurrences like those detailed by the Buffalo News are apparently \nnot uncommon and continue to help fuel the illegal gun market in our \ncountry. Reckless dealers and ``straw purchasers'' indirectly threaten \nthe security of our communities by facilitating the transfer of \ndangerous firearms to potential criminals who may use them in violent \ncrimes. Unfortunately, instead of strengthening our gun safety laws as \nthey apply to reckless dealers and ``straw purchasers,'' some of my \ncolleagues are seeking to provide irresponsible gun manufacturers and \ndealers with immunity from liability, even when their actions \ncontribute to the growth of the illegal gun market. I urge my \ncolleagues to support efforts to help stop guns from falling into the \nhands of violent criminals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/23/senate-section/article/S7289-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each day I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  In Chicago, a bisexual Latina student was threatened by a white male \nat a local university because of her sexual orientation. Sometime after \nthe incident, the victim was walking outside of her dorm when the same \nmale student followed her into an alley and assaulted her. She was \npunched and kicked repeatedly in the stomach.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/23/senate-section/article/S7289-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7289-S7290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          SUPPORT SPLITTING THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to support legislation \nsplitting the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. It is high time Congress \ntook this action. For far too long, the Ninth Circuit has been bogged \ndown by an immense caseload, slowing the wheels of justice. Now we have \nthe opportunity to correct a problem that has been in sore need of a \nsolution for decades. The people of the State of Idaho have long \nrequested this action, but it is not only good for Idaho; it is good \nfor the States of the West represented in the Ninth Circuit, and for \nthe Nation as a whole.\n  Calls for a split in the Ninth Circuit began as early as the 1930s. \nSupport dwindled when the court expanded into Seattle and Portland to \nalleviate travel concerns and caseload burdens. In 1973, the Hruska \nCommission expressed concerns with the size of two circuit\n\n[[Page S7290]]\n\ncourts: the Ninth and the Fifth. Congress compromised in 1978 by \nexpanding the number of judges in both circuits. However, in 1981 the \nsheer size forced Congress to split the Fifth Circuit in two, forming \nthe Eleventh Circuit and the Fifth Circuit in its current \nconfiguration. Interestingly, a 2003 report shows that the Ninth \nCircuit is, today, almost the same size as the Fifth and Eleventh if \nthey were recombined.\n  Legislation was introduced in 1989 to split the Ninth into two \ncircuits, creating a new Twelfth Circuit Court of Appeals. A 1990 \nreport advised against the split without first attempting management \nchanges to ease the caseload burden. Again in 1995, the Senate \nattempted to split the Ninth, and again in 1997.\n  In 1997 the Commission on Structural Alternatives for the Federal \nCourts of Appeals, commonly referred to as the White Commission, was \nformed to determine, among other things, whether there was a need to \nsplit the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. After hearing testimony, \ntaking written statements, and gathering statistical data, the \nCommission published its final report in December 1998.\n  The White Commission report based its decision to oppose a split on \nthe fear that population growth would put other circuits in a position \nsimilar to the Ninth, and that continuing to split circuits would \neventually lead to an unwieldy kaleidoscope of law. The Commission \ninstead proposed a restructuring within the circuit.\n  Today, we can see the result of the repeated failure to address \nFederal circuit court growth. In 1997 there were nearly 52,000 appeals \nfiled in Federal circuit courts. In 2003, there were approximately \n60,500. Of that 8,500 increase, 4,000 are in the Ninth Circuit but \ncontrary to the White Commission's fear, the remaining 4,500 case \nincrease is spread over the other 10 circuit courts. With this key \nCommission conclusion challenged, it is neither prudent nor fair to \nforce Idahoans and other citizens of the West to wait an average of 4.5 \nmonths longer than citizens of other districts for their cases to be \ndecided.\n  Although the 4.5 month wait is a critically important number, there \nare additional numbers that this Senate should take into consideration \nwhen evaluating this issue. For example, the Ninth Circuit has 50 \nauthorized judges, while the average for all other circuits is 20. \nThere are more than 57 million people living within the Ninth Circuit, \nwhile the other Circuits average a population of just over 21 million. \nAnd probably the most telling statistic: the Ninth Circuit has nearly \ntriple the average number of appeals filed by all other circuits. No \nwonder it takes the Ninth 4.5 months longer to resolve an appeal.\n  It is worth noting that over the years, the Ninth Circuit has adopted \na variety of management reforms aimed at coping with the circuit's \nunwieldy size. However, I submit that we have long since reached the \npoint beyond which this crisis can be ``managed'' away. It is a gross \ndisservice to the talented jurists and staff of the Ninth Circuit, and \nan injustice to the citizens of the States it represents, for this \nCongress to stand idly by while caseloads and waiting periods only \nincrease, and increase, and increase.\n  Two versions of corrective legislation are being introduced by \nSenators Murkowski and Ensign, and it is my intention to cosponsor both \nof these proposals. I pledge to do everything within my power to help \nenact a workable plan for splitting the Ninth Circuit, and I urge all \nof our colleagues in the strongest possible terms to support us in this \neffort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/23/senate-section/article/S7290-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              HONORING BURLEY TOBACCO GROWERS COOPERATIVE\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I proudly rise today to recognize \nthe Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative for their extremely generous \ncontribution of $10 million to Phase II payments for Kentucky tobacco \nfarmers. The people of Kentucky are extremely appreciative of this \ngenerous gift.\n  As you may know, Phase II is the second set of payments from the \nMaster Settlement Agreement. This settlement was made between the major \ntobacco companies and the elected officials of the tobacco growing \nStates. Phase II money requires $5.15 billion to be contributed by the \nfour companies over a 12 year period. The Phase II money was meant to \nalleviate some of the financial stress to farmers as quotas were cut.\n  The Phase II compensations due for 2004, however, were not paid \nbecause the tobacco companies requested a refund due to the passage of \nthe tobacco buyout. For Kentucky farmers, this would have been \ndevastating. Fortunately for Kentucky, the Burley Tobacco Growers \nCooperative has donated $10 million to be combined with the $114 \nmillion raised by the Commonwealth to equal $124 million for payments. \nThis means that 164,000 Kentucky farmers will have Phase II payment \nchecks in their hands by the end of June.\n  Mr. President, I find the charitable spirit that was so kindly \ndisplayed by the Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative to be exceptional \nin every way. Kentucky is the only State that has stepped forward to \nproduce Phase II payments, and this is due, in large part, to the \ngenerosity of Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative. I would like to thank \nPresident Henry West and all those involved in the cooperative, \nincluding the members, for making such a positive impact on Kentucky's \ntobacco growers. This extraordinary association has helped ensure that \nthe true spirit of the Phase II agreement is upheld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/23/senate-section/article/S7290-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7290-S7291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MAJOR GENERAL JANET E.A. HICKS\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \ncommend an outstanding patriot and American, Major General Janet Hicks, \nthe Commanding General of the United States Army Signal Center at Fort \nGordon, GA, the first female Chief of the Signal Corps in the history \nof the Army and the first female Commanding General of the U.S. Army \nSignal Center at Fort Gordon, GA. General Hicks will be retiring from \nthe Army on July 15, 2005, after a 30 year distinguished military \ncareer.\n  Originally from Iowa, General Hicks was commissioned into the Army's \nSignal Corps on March 17, 1975, after receiving her bachelor of arts \ndegree in French language and literature from Simpson College in \nCentral Iowa. Her first assignments took her to Korea, then to Hawaii \nwith the 25th ``Tropical Lightning'' Infantry Division, where she \nserved as a platoon leader, division radio signal officer and company \ncommander. Following her attendance at the Advanced Signal Officers \nCourse at Fort Gordon, she joined the faculty and staff there where she \ntaught basic and advanced officer courses. General Hicks was then \nreassigned to Alaska with the Information Systems Command and the 6th \nInfantry Division in key leadership positions before joining the staff \nof the U.S. Central Command at McDill Air Force Base in Tampa, FL.\n  Recognizing her outstanding leadership qualities, General Hicks was \ndesignated for Battalion Command and assigned to command the 125th \nSignal Battalion, 25th Infantry Division at Schofield Barracks, HI, in \nJune 1992. Following her command there, she was selected to attend the \nArmy's War College before being posted as the Chief of the Army's \nSignal Branch at Personnel Command in Alexandria, VA. In June 1997 she \nwas promoted to Colonel and assumed command of the 516th Signal Brigade \nin Hawaii, with concurrent duties as the Deputy Chief of Staff for \nInformation Management, US Army Pacific. In June 2000, she was promoted \nto Brigadier General and became the Director of Command, Control, \nCommunications and Computer Systems, the J-6 for the United States \nPacific Command, covering the joint communications for all of the \nPacific Theatre. Major General Hicks assumed command of the United \nStates Army Signal Center and School and Fort Gordon on August 7, 2002.\n  Throughout her career General Hicks has been decorated with many \nmilitary and civilian awards and citations. But, completing her \nmilitary career as the Army's Chief of Signal is truly an awesome \nresponsibility and honor. Since assuming command General Hicks has\n\n[[Page S7291]]\n\nimproved the training of soldiers, campaigned for better equipment and \nupgraded the facilities and quality of life for soldiers and their \nfamilies on Fort Gordon. She also claims that besides her demanding \nmilitary life, she credits her successes to two wonderful people in her \nlife--her husband Ron and her daughter Jennifer.\n  Throughout her military career General Hicks has always taken the \ninitiative, faced the challenges and resolved problems. Her leadership \nstyle has always impressed her superiors. She has always dealt with \npeople--young soldiers, senior military leaders and civilians with \nequity, candidness and resolve. She is highly respected by the soldiers \nof her command, people of the Central Savannah Regional Area and the \ncitizens of Georgia.\n  I feel that it is most appropriate to recognize this outstanding \nAmerican for her 30 years of dedicated and honorable service to this \nNation as a military leader. I ask that all of my colleagues join me in \nthanking and commending Major General Hicks, her husband Ron and their \ndaughter Jennifer on the completion of a distinguished military career. \nWe also wish her and her family the best in their well deserved \nretirement and a happy and prosperous future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/23/senate-section/article/S7291-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING HAZEL HANON\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrise today to honor Mrs. Hazel Hanon and the incredible work that she \nhas done over these past 60 years with the Marshall Post No. 3507 \nLadies Auxiliary of Britton, SD.\n  Hazel gained membership to the auxiliary sponsorship of both her \nhusband, Leon, who served in the U.S. Navy during WWII, and her \nbrother, Dempsy, also a WWII veteran and member of the U.S. Air Force. \nAs one of the auxiliary's charter members, save for a short hiatus in \nher membership, Hazel as been with Marshall Post No. 3507 since is \nfounding in 1945. Despite the auxiliary's declining membership over the \npast few years, it is clear the organization and Hazel are still \nwholeheartedly committed to supporting America's brave war heroes.\n  Over the years the auxiliary has hosted Post Suppers, served \nbanquets, sold poppies, organized bake sales, compiled and sold \ncookbooks, and even run an annual Turkey Raffle during Thanksgiving, \nall to raise money for our Nation's veterans. Proceeds from these \nevents are then donated to VA Hospitals or used to buy supplies so the \nwomen can bake cookies and cakes and then personally deliver the \ngoodies to veterans in hospitals throughout South Dakota.\n  Since the post's founding, Hazel has been extremely giving of her \ntime, and her generosity will forever be appreciated. I am pleased that \nher dedication and patriotism are being publicly recognized, and I am \ncertain that Hazel's achievements and commitment to the auxiliary will \nserve as inspiration to future generations of passionate and patriotic \nSouth Dakotans.\n  Mr. President, Hazel Hanon is a remarkable person who richly deserves \nthis distinguished recognition.

Mr. President, it is with great honor that I rise \ntoday to publicly commend Grace Siers, charter member of Marshall Post \nNo. 3507 Ladies Auxiliary in Britton, SD, for her many years of devoted \nservice to our Nation's veterans.\n  Sixty years ago, in 1945, Grace joined the VFW Ladies Auxiliary, and \nhas been an irreplaceable asset to the organization ever since. Grace \nis part of a long line of military patriots, as she joined the \nauxiliary under the sponsorship of her husband, William Siers, who \nserved in WWI, as well as her three brothers, Vance, John, and Clarence \nHunscher, all veterans of WWII. Not surprisingly, the tradition of \nserving our country continues with Grace's five sons, Le Roy, Donald, \nVirgil, Gary, and Robert, and even her grandson and granddaughter, all \nof whom served in the military. Regrettably, her son, Robert, died \nwhile fighting in Vietnam.\n  Although decades have passed and auxiliary members are no longer as \nactive as they once were, Grace's hard work and dedication over the \nyears enabled the auxiliary to raise thousands of dollars, bring smiles \nto the faces of countless injured and recovering veterans, and educate \ninnumerable South Dakotans about the importance of supporting America's \nbrave veterans.\n  In early years, Grace recalls hosting Post Suppers, serving banquets, \nselling poppies, organizing bake sales, compiling and selling \ncookbooks, and even manning the post during the annual Turkey Raffle on \nThanksgiving, all to raise money for the auxiliary. In turn, the funds \nwere donated to VA hospitals and used to buy supplies so the women \ncould bake cookies and cakes and then personally deliver the goodies to \nveterans in hospitals throughout South Dakota.\n  Grace's tremendous contributions to the Britton community set her \napart from other outstanding citizens. Her extraordinary service and \ncommitment to Marshall Post No. 3507 Ladies Auxiliary is to be \ncommended. Through Grace's remarkable community involvement and \ndedication to America's veterans, the lives of countless South Dakotans \nhave been enormously enhanced.

The Agreement represents an \nhistoric development in our relations with Central America and the \nDominican Republic and reflects the commitment of the United States to \nsupporting democracy, regional integration, and economic growth and \nopportunity in a region that has transitioned to peaceful, democratic \nsocieties.\n  In negotiating this Agreement, my Administration was guided by the \nobjectives set out in the Trade Act of 2002. Central America and the \nDominican Republic constitute our second largest export market in Latin \nAmerica and our tenth largest export market in the world. The Agreement \nwill create significant new opportunities for American workers, \nfarmers, ranchers, and businesses by opening new markets and \neliminating barriers. United States agricultural exports will obtain \nbetter access to the millions of consumers in Central America and the \nDominican Republic.\n  Under the Agreement, tariffs on approximately 80 percent of U.S. \nexports will be eliminated immediately. The Agreement will help to \nlevel the playing field because about 80 percent of Central America's \nimports already enjoy duty-free access to our market. By providing for \nthe effective enforcement of labor and environmental laws,\n\n[[Page S7292]]\n\ncombined with strong remedies for noncompliance, the Agreement will \ncontribute to improved worker rights and high levels of environmental \nprotection in Central America and the Dominican Republic.\n  By supporting this Agreement, the United States can stand with those \nin the region who stand for democracy and freedom, who are fighting \ncorruption and crime, and who support the rule of law. A stable, \ndemocratic, and growing Central America and Dominican Republic \nstrengthens the United States economically and provides greater \nsecurity for our citizens.\n  The Agreement is in our national interest, and I urge the Congress to \napprove it expeditiously.\n                                                      George W.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice to the Federal Reqister for publication, stating that \nthe Western Balkans emergency is to continue in effect beyond June 26, \n2005. The most recent notice continuing this emergency was published in \nthe Federal Reqister on June 25, 2004, 69 FR 36005.\n  The crisis constituted by the actions of persons engaged in, or \nassisting, sponsoring, or supporting (i) extremist violence in the \nRepublic of Macedonia, and elsewhere in the Western Balkans region, or \n(ii) acts obstructing implementation of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia or \nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of June 10, 1999, in \nKosovo, that led to the declaration of a national emergency on June 26, \n2001, has not been resolved. Subsequent to the declaration of the \nnational emergency, I amended Executive Order 13219 in Executive Order \n13304 of May 28, 2003, to address acts obstructing implementation of \nthe Ohrid Framework Agreement of 2001 in the Republic of Macedonia, \nwhich have also become a concern. The acts of extremist violence and \nobstructionist activity outlined in Executive Order 13219, as amended, \nare hostile to U.S. interests and pose a continuing unusual and \nextraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the \nUnited States. For these reasons, I have determined that it is \nnecessary to continue the national emergency declared with respect to \nthe Western Balkans and maintain in force the comprehensive sanctions \nto respond to this threat.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to provide for the acquisition of subsurface mineral \ninterests in land owned by the Pascua Yaqui Tribe and land held in \ntrust for the Tribe; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Pascua Yaqui \nMineral Rights Act of 2005 to provide for acquisition of subsurface \nmineral interests in land owned by the Pascua Yaqui tribe and land held \nin trust for the Tribe.\n  The Pascua Yaqui tribe has purchased in fee four parcels of land, \ntotaling approximately 436 acres, from the State of Arizona. These \nparcels are adjacent to the Tribe's reservation near Tucson, AZ. The \nTribe subsequently applied to have these lands taken into trust \npursuant to the 25 CFR Part 151 process. The Bureau of Indian Affairs \napproved the trust application. However, the State of Arizona objected \nbecause it still owns the subsurface mineral rights when it conveys its \nTrust lands. Based on the State of Arizona's objection, the Tribe's \ntrust application was stayed pending resolution of the mineral rights \ntitle issue. Arizona law prevents the State from selling these mineral \ninterests and I understand that the only way they can be acquired is \nthrough an act of condemnation brought by the United States pursuant to \n40 U.S.C. Sec. 3113. The State of Arizona has conditionally consented \nto a condemnation action.\n  It has since been discovered that an additional 140 acres of the \nreservation was also former State of Arizona trust land that was \npurchased in fee by the Tribe and taken into trust without obtaining \nthe mineral estate. The State of Arizona has also conditionally \nconsented to a condemnation action with regard to these additional 140 \nacres.\n  In additional to the mineral interests condemnation, this legislation \ncovers another subject. Under 360 acres of the reservation, the United \nStates owns the mineral interests for itself, rather than in trust for \nthe tribe. Although that acreage was originally purchased in fee, it \nwas previously patented by the U.S. and the U.S. retained the mineral \ninterests to that property for its own benefit, currently administered \nby the Bureau of Land Management. This legislation would authorize the \nBureau of Land Management to transfer those mineral interests to the \nU.S., to be held in trust for the Pascua Yaqui tribe.\n  The result of the legislation I introduce today would be to allow the \nUnited States to obtain and/or consolidate ownership of the mineral \ninterest only, in its name, in trust for the Pascua Yaqui tribe. These \nmineral interests are under the surface of land already either owned by \nthe Pascua Yaqui tribe, or held in trust for the Tribe by the United \nStates.\n  Finally, under the terms of its current gaming compact with the State \nof Arizona, the Tribe has already constructed the maximum number of \ncasinos it can operate on its reservation at this time. This bill will \nnot authorize additional reservation casinos.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1291\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit against income tax for expenses incurred in tele-working; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that \nwould help people who ``telework'' or work from home, to receive a tax \ncredit. Teleworkers are people who work on-line from home--whether a \nfew days a week or their entire work schedule--using computers and \nother information technology tools. Nearly 40 million Americans \ntelework today, and according to experts, 40 percent of the nation's \njobs are compatible with telework.\n  I am introducing the Telework Tax Incentive Act to provide a $500 tax \ncredit for telework. The legislation provides an incentive to encourage \nmore employers to consider telework for their employees. Telework \nshould be a regular part of the 21st century workplace.\n  The best part of telework is that it improves the quality of life for \neveryone--both the employee, the employer and the community. Telework \nreduces traffic congestion and air pollution. It reduces gas \nconsumption and our dependency on foreign oil. Encouraging telework is \ngood for families--giving working parents the flexibility to meet \neveryday demands. Telework provides people with disabilities greater \njob opportunities. It can also be a good option for retirees and others \nwho choose to work part-time.\n  A task force on telework initiated by former Virginia Governor James \nGilmore recommended the establishment of a tax credit toward the \npurchase and installation of electronic and computer equipment that \nallow an employee to telework. For example, the cost of a computer, fax \nmachine, modem, phone, printer, software, copier, and other expenses \nnecessary to enable telework could count toward a tax credit, provided \nthe person worked at home a minimum number of days per year.\n  My legislation would provide a $500 tax credit ``for expenses paid or \nincurred under a teleworking arrangement for furnishings and electronic \ninformation equipment which are used to enable an individual to \ntelework.'' An employee must telework a minimum of 75 days per year to \nqualify for the tax credit. Both the employer and employee are eligible \nfor the tax credit, but the tax credit goes to whomever absorbs the \nexpense for setting up the at-home worksite.\n  On October 9, 1999, President Clinton signed into law legislation \nthat I introduced in coordination with Representative Frank Wolf from \nVirginia as part of the annual Department of Transportation \nappropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2000. S. 1521, the National \nTelecommuting and Air Quality Act, created a pilot program to study the \nfeasibility of providing incentives for companies to allow their \nemployees to telework in five major metropolitan areas including \nPhiladelphia, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Houston and Denver.\n  President Bush signed legislation on July 14, 2000, that included an \nadditional $2 million to continue telework efforts in the 5 pilot \ncities, including Philadelphia, to market, implement, and evaluate \nstrategies for awarding telecommuting, emissions reduction, and \npollution credits established through the National Telecommuting and \nAir Quality Act. I am excited that Philadelphia continues to use this \nopportunity to help to get the word out about the benefits of \ntelecommuting for many employees and employers.\n  Telecommuting improves air quality by reducing pollutants, provides \nemployees and families flexibility, reduces traffic congestion, and \nincreases productivity and retention rates for businesses while \nreducing their overhead costs. It's a growing opportunity and option \nwhich we should all include in our effort to maintain and improve \nquality of life issues in Pennsylvania and around the Nation. According \nto statistics available from 1996, the Greater Philadelphia area ranked \nnumber 10 in the country for annual person-hours of delay due to \ntraffic congestion. Because of this reality, all options including \ntelecommuting should be pursued to address this challenge.\n  The 1999 Telework America National Telework Survey, conducted by Joan \nH. Pratt Associates, found that today's 19.6 million teleworkers \ntypically work 9 days per month at home with an average of 3 hours per \nweek during normal business hours. Teleworkers seek a blend of job-\nrelated and personal benefits to enable them to better handle their \nwork and life responsibilities; however these research findings \ndemonstrate the impact on the bottom line for employers as well. \nEmployers may save more than $10,000 per telework employee simply from \nreduced absenteeism and increased employee retention. Thus an \norganization with 100 employees, 20 of whom telework, could potentially \nrealize a savings of $200,000 annually, or more, when productivity \ngains are added.\n  When I introduced this legislation in the 107th Congress, it was \nendorsed by a number of groups including including the International \nTelework Association and Council (ITAC), Covad Communications, National \nTown Builders Association, Litton Industries, Orbital Sciences \nCorporation, Consumer Electronic Association, Capnet, BTG Corporation, \nElectonic Industries Alliance, Telecommunications Industry Association, \nAmerican Automobile Association Mid-Atlantic, Dimensions International \nInc., Capunet, TManage, Science Applications International Corporation, \nAT, Northern Virginia Technology Council, Computer Associates \nIncorporated, and Dyn Corp.\n  Work is something you do, not someplace you go. There is nothing \nmagical about strapping ourselves into a car and driving sometimes up \nto an hour and a half, arriving at a workplace and sitting before a \ncomputer, when we can access the same information from a computer in \nour homes. Wouldn't it be great if we could replace the evening rush \nhour commute with time spent with the family, coaching little league or \nvolunteering at a local charity?\n  I urge my colleagues to consider cosponsoring this legislation that \npromotes telework and helps encourage additional employee choices for \nthe workplace.\n                                 6_____\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUNNING (for himself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Lott, Mr. Smith, and \n        Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 1293. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permit \nthe consolidation of life insurance companies with other companies; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nallow affiliated life and non-life insurance companies to file \nconsolidated tax returns. The current outdated rules do not allow such \nconsolidation.\n  Consolidated return provisions under current law were enacted so that \nthe members of an affiliated group of corporations could file a single \ntax return. The right to file a ``consolidated'' return is generally \navailable to businesses of all natures conducted by the affiliated \ncorporations. The purpose behind consolidated returns is simply to tax \na complete business as a whole rather than its component parts \nindividually. Whether an enterprise's businesses are operated as \ndivisions within\n\n[[Page S7298]]\n\none corporation or as subsidiary corporations with a common parent \ncompany, a business entity should generally be taxed as a single entity \nand be allowed to file its return accordingly.\n  Corporate groups which include life insurance companies are denied \nthe ability to file a single consolidated return until they have been \naffiliated for at least 5 years. Even after this 5-year period, they \nare subject to two additional limitations that are not applicable to \nany other type of group. First, non-life insurance companies must be \nmembers of the affiliated group for five years before their losses may \nbe used to offset life insurance company income. Second, non-life \ninsurance affiliate losses, including current year losses and any \ncarryover losses, that may offset life insurance company taxable income \nare limited to the lesser of 35 percent of life insurance company's \ntaxable income or 35 percent of the non-life insurance company's \nlosses.\n  There are no clear reasons why affiliated groups that include life \ninsurance companies are denied the same unrestricted ability to file \nconsolidated returns that is available to other financial \nintermediaries, and corporations in general. Allowing members of an \naffiliated group of corporations to file a consolidated return prevents \nthe business enterprise's structure from obscuring the fact that the \ntrue gain or loss of the business enterprise is the conglomeration of \neach of the members of the affiliated group. The limitations contained \nin current law are clearly without policy justification and should be \nrepealed.\n  Our legislation will repeal the two 5-year limitations for taxable \nyears beginning after this year, and it will phase out the 35 percent \nlimitation over 7 years. The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation \nhas recommended repeal of two of the three limitations addressed by my \nbill on the grounds of needless complexity. The third limitation is, in \neffect, merely a minimum tax on life insurance company income. That \nlimitation should have been repealed when the alternative minimum tax \nwas enacted, and certainly has no place in the current tax laws. I \nshould also note that Congress included in the tax cut vetoed by then-\nPresident Clinton in 1999 much of what is contained in this \nlegislation.\n  I thank Senators Conrad, Lott, Smith and Lincoln for joining me in \nsponsoring this legislation. We hope you will join us as cosponsors of \nthis bipartisan, much-needed legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 1294. A bill to amend the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to \npreserve and protect the ability of local governments to provide \nbroadband capability and services; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Community \nBroadband Act of 2005.'' I am pleased to be joined in this effort by \nSenator McCain of Arizona.\n  This legislation will promote economic development, enhance public \nsafety, increase educational opportunities, and improve the lives of \ncitizens in areas of the country that either do not have access to \nbroadband or live in a location where the cost for broadband is simply \nnot affordable.\n  A recent study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment shows that the United States has dropped to 12th place \nworldwide in the percentage of people with broadband connections. Many \nof the countries ahead of the United States have successfully combined \npublic and private efforts to deploy municipal networks that connect \ntheir citizens and businesses with high-speed Internet services.\n  It is in this context that President Bush has called for universal \nand affordable broadband in the United States by the year 2007. If we \nare going to meet President Bush's goals, we must not enact barriers to \nbroadband development and access. Unfortunately, fourteen States have \npassed legislation to prohibit or significantly restrict the ability of \nlocal municipalities and communities to offer high-speed Internet to \ntheir citizens. More States are considering such legislation. The \n``Community Broadband Act'' is in response to those efforts by States \nto tell local communities that they cannot establish networks for their \ncitizens even in communities that either have no access to broadband or \nwhere access is prohibitively expensive.\n  The ``Community Broadband Act'' is a simple bill. It says that no \nState can prohibit a municipality from offering high-speed Internet to \nits citizens; and when a municipality is a provider, it cannot abuse \nits governmental authority as regulator to discriminate against private \ncompetitors. Furthermore, a municipality must comply with Federal and \nstate telecommunications laws.\n  Mr. President, this bill will allow communities to make broadband \ndecisions that could: Improve their economy and create jobs by serving \nas a medium for development, particularly in rural and underserved \nurban areas; aid public safety and first responders by ensuring access \nto network services while on the road and in the community; strengthen \nour country's international competitiveness by giving businesses the \nmeans to compete more effectively locally, nationally, and \ninternationally; encourage long-distance education through video \nconferencing and other means of sharing knowledge and enhancing \nlearning via the Internet; and create incentives for public-private \npartnerships.\n  A century ago, there were efforts to prevent local governments from \noffering electricity. Opponents argued that local governments didn't \nhave the expertise to offer something as complex as electricity. They \nalso argued that businesses would suffer if they faced competition from \ncities and towns. But local community leaders recognized that their \neconomic survival depended on electrifying their communities. They knew \nthat it would take both private investment and public investment to \nbring electricity to all Americans.\n  We face a similar situation today. Municipal networks can play an \nessential role in making broadband access universal and affordable. We \nmust not put up barriers to this possibility of municipal involvement \nin broadband deployment.\n  Some local governments will decide to do this; others will not. Let \nme be clear this is not going to be the right decision for every \nmunicipality. But there are clearly examples of municipalities that \nneed to provide broadband, and those municipalities should have the \npower to do so.\n  Today's Wall Street Journal notes the small town of Granbury, TX, \npopulation 6,400, that initiated a wireless network after waiting years \nfor private industry to take an interest. In Scottsburg, IN, a city and \nits 6000 residents north of Louisville, KY, could not get broadband \nfrom an incumbent telephone company. When two important businesses \nthreatened to leave unless they could obtain broadband connectivity, \nmunicipal officials stepped forward to provide wireless broadband \nthroughout the town. The town retained the two businesses and gained \nmuch more. There are many Granburys and Scottsburgs across the country.\n  There are also underserved urban areas, where private providers may \nexist, but many in the community simply cannot afford the high prices. \nDianah Neff, Philadelphia's chief information officer, knows this all \ntoo well. ``The digital divide is local,'' Neff has said, commenting \nthat while 90 percent Philadelphia's affluent neighborhoods have \nbroadband, just 25 percent in low-income areas have broadband. When the \ncity of Philadelphia announced plans for wireless access, it \nimmediately faced opposition and the Pennsylvania legislature passed \nlegislation to counter this municipal power.\n  Community broadband networks have the potential to create jobs, spur \neconomic development, and bring a 21st century utility to everyone.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join in sponsoring the \nCommunity Broadband Act of 2005. In the simplest of terms, this bill \nwould ensure that any town, city, or county that wishes to offer high-\nspeed Internet services to its citizens can do so. The bill also would \nensure fairness by requiring municipalities that offer high-speed \nInternet services do so in compliance with all Federal and State \ntelecommunications laws and in a nondiscriminatory manner.\n  This bill is needed if we are to meet President Bush's call for \n``universal, affordable access for broadband technology by the year \n2007.'' When President Bush announced this nationwide goal in 2004, the \ncountry was ranked 10th in the world for high-speed Internet \npenetration. Today, the country is ranked 16th. This is unacceptable \nfor a country that should lead the world in technical innovation, \neconomic development, and international competitiveness.\n  Many of the countries outpacing the United States in the deployment \nof high-speed Internet services, including Canada, Japan, and South \nKorea, have successfully combined municipal systems with privately \ndeployed networks to wire their countries. As a country, we cannot \nafford to cut off any successful strategy if we want to remain \ninternationally competitive.\n  I recognize that our Nation has a long and successful history of \nprivate investment in critical communications infrastructure. That \nhistory must be respected, protected, and continued. However, when \nprivate industry does not answer the call because of market failures or \nother obstacles, it is appropriate and even commendable, for the people \nacting through their local governments to improve their lives by \ninvesting in their own future. In many rural towns, the local \ngovernment's high-speed Internet offering may be its citizens only \noption to access the World Wide Web.\n  Despite this situation, a few incumbent providers of traditional \ntelecommunications services have attempted to stop local government \ndeployment of community high speed Internet services. The bill would do \nnothing to limit their ability to compete. In fact, the bill would \nprovide them an incentive to enter more rural areas and deploy services \nin partnership with local governments. This partnership will not only \nreduce the costs to private firms, but also ensure wider deployment of \nrural services. Additionally, the bill would aid private providers by \nprohibiting a municipality when acting as both ``regulator'' and \n``competitor'' from discriminating against competitors in favor of \nitself.\n  Several newspapers have endorsed the concept of allowing \nmunicipalities to choose whether to offer high speed Internet services. \nUSA Today rightfully questioned in an editorial, ``Why shouldn't \ncitizens be able to use their own resources to help themselves?'' The \nWashington Post editorialized that the offering of high speed Internet \nservices by localities is, ``. . . the sort of municipal experiment we \nhope will spread.'' The San Jose Mercury News stated that a ban on \nlocalities ability to offer such services is ``bad for consumers, bad \nfor technology and bad for America's hopes of catching up to other \ncountries in broadband deployment.'' Finally, the Tampa Tribune \nlectured Federal and State legislators, ``don't prohibit local elected \nofficials from providing a service their communities need.''\n  My home State of Arizona boasts the largest approved municipal \nbroadband system in the United States, for example. The city of Tempe's \nwireless system will serve all of the city's 40 square miles and a \npopulation of 159,000, including the campus of Arizona State \nUniversity. Citizens will have Internet access from anywhere at any \ntime, and police, fire, water and traffic services personnel will use \nthe system to enhance their efficiency.\n  In addition to Tempe, several Native American tribal governments \noffer high-speed Internet access services to their citizens. This bill \nwould ensure that such offerings could continue to assist Indian \ncountry and their ability to connect to the Internet.\n  Our country faces some real challenges. We need to find ways to use \ntechnology to help our citizens better compete. We need to help our \nbusinesses capitalize on their ingenuity so that they can become more \ninternationally competitive. That is why we need to do all we can to \neliminate barriers to competition and create incentives for the \ndelivery of high-speed Internet services for public suppliers of \nbroadband services, private suppliers of broadband services, and \npublic-private partnerships as well.\n  I hope my colleagues will join us in sponsoring the Community \nBroadband Act of 2005.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 1295. A bill to amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to provide \nfor accountability and funding of the National Indian Gaming \nCommission; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the National \nIndian Gaming Commission Accountability Act of 2005 to amend provisions \nof the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act regarding NIGC funding and \naccountability.\n  The Indian gaming industry has undergone tremendous growth since the \nenactment of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in 1988. The regulatory \nresponsibilities of the NIGC, the Federal agency responsible for \noversight of the industry, has likewise grown. In recent years the \nNIGC's budgeting needs have consistently exceeded the $8 million \nstatutory cap, necessitating short-term authorizations to exceed the \ncap to enable it to adequately enforce the Act.\n  Rather than merely raising the cap on funding, this legislation \namends IGRA's equation for funding the NIGC by allowing the funding to \nadjust in direct proportion to the revenues of the Indian gaming \nindustry, with funding expanding or contracting as the Indian gaming \nindustry grows or recedes. Under that equation--which provides that \nfees cannot exceed .08 percent of gross gaming revenues--the NIGC's \nbudget for fiscal 2007 would be capped at approximately $14.5 million.\n  As the agency's needs have grown, so has the scrutiny of the \nregulated community and affected parties. It is therefore appropriate \nthat the agency's budgetary choices and program plans be subject to \ntransparency. Therefore, this legislation increases not only the \nagency's funding, but also its accountability by directing that the \nNIGC be subject to the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). \nAs a result, the agency would be required to develop a Strategic Plan, \nand annual performance plans and performance reports, all of which will \nprovide critical information to the regulated stakeholders.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to enact this timely and balanced legislation. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7300]]\n\n                                S. 1295\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nreduce the work hours and increase the supervision of resident \nphysicians to ensure the safety of patients and resident-physicians \nthemselves; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce my \nlegislation, the Patient and Physician Safety and Protection Act of \n2005, to limit medical resident work hours to 80 hours a week and to \nprovide real protections for patients and resident physicians who are \nnegatively affected by excessive work hours. I feel strongly that as \nCongress begins to consider proposals to reduce medical malpractice \npremiums and improve quality of care, we must consider the role that \nexcessive work hours play in exacerbating medical liability problems \nand reducing quality of care.\n  It is very troubling that hospitals across the Nation are requiring \nyoung doctors to work 36 hour shifts and as many as 120 hours a week in \norder to complete their residency programs. These long hours lead to a \ndeterioration of cognitive function similar to the effects of blood \nalcohol levels of 0.1 percent. This is a level of cognitive impairment \nthat would make these doctors unsafe to drive--yet these physicians are \nnot only allowed but in fact are required to care for patients and \nperform procedures on patients under these conditions. In fact, a study \nby Harvard Medical School researchers published in the October 28, 2004 \nissue of the New England Journal of Medicine found that medical \nresidents made 35.9 percent more serious medical errors when they \nworked extended shifts of more than 24 hours.\n  The Patient and Physician Safety and Protection Act of 2005 will \nlimit medical resident work hours to 80 hours a week. Not 40 hours or \n60 hours--80 hours a week. It is hard to argue that this standard is \nexcessively strict. In fact, it is unconscionable that we now have \nresident physicians, or any physicians for that matter, caring for very \nsick patients 120 hours a week and 36 hours straight with fewer than 10 \nhours between shifts. This is an outrageous violation of a patient's \nright to quality care.\n  In addition to limiting work hours to 80 hours week, my bill limits \nthe length of any one shift to 24 consecutive hours, while allowing for \nup to three hours of patient transition time, and limits the length of \nan emergency room shift to 12 hours. The bill also ensures that \nresidents have at least one out of seven days off and `on-call' shifts \nno more often than every third night.\n\n  Since I first introduced the Patient and Physician Safety and \nProtection Act in the 107th Congress, the medical community and the \nAccreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, ACGME, \nspecifically have taken critical steps to address the problem of \nexcessive work hours. On July 1, 2003, the ACGME issued resident work-\nhour guidelines aimed at addressing this important issue. While I \ncommend ACGME leadership for taking the initiative, I remain very \nconcerned that the ACGME's policy lacks the enforcement mechanisms that \nare essential to ensure compliance with the new work hour rules. The \nACGME's only sanction against hospitals that overwork residents or \nprovide inadequate supervision is the threat of lost accreditation of \nresidency programs. Medical residents who have already ``matched'' into \na program and invested years there are understandably reluctant to \nreport violations that might result in the closure of their residency. \nFurthermore, the ACGME usually gives hospital administrators 90-100 \ndays notice before inspecting a residency program. While the ACGME \npolicy establishes more stringent work hours regulations, it fails to \ncreate effective enforcement and oversight tools. These rules are \nmeaningless without enforcement mechanisms.\n  That is why Federal legislation is necessary. The Patient and \nPhysician Safety and Protection Act of 2005 not only recognizes the \nproblem of excessive work hours, but also creates strong enforcement \nmechanisms. The bill also provides funding support to teaching \nhospitals to implement new work hour standards. Without enforcement and \nfinancial support, efforts to reduce work hours are not likely to be \nsuccessful.\n  Finally, my legislation provides meaningful enforcement mechanisms \nthat will protect the identity of resident physicians who file \ncomplaints about work hour violations. The ACGME's guidelines do not \ncontain any whistleblower protections for residents that seek to report \nprogram violations. Without this important protection, residents will \nbe reluctant to report these violations, which in turn will weaken \nenforcement.\n  My legislation also makes compliance with these work hour \nrequirements a condition of Medicare participation. Each year, Congress \nprovides $8 billion to teaching hospitals to train new physicians. \nWhile Congress must continue to vigorously support adequate funding so \nthat teaching hospitals are able to carryout this important public \nservice, these hospitals must also make a commitment to ensuring safe \nwork conditions for these physicians and providing the highest quality \nof care to the patients they treat.\n  In closing I would like to read a quote from an Orthopedic Surgery \nResident from Northern California, which I think illustrates why we \nneed this legislation.\n  I quote, ``I was operating post-call after being up for over 36 hours \nand was holding retractors. I literally fell asleep standing up and \nnearly face-planted into the wound. My upper arm hit the side of the \ngurney, and I caught myself before I fell to the floor. I nearly put my \nface in the open wound, which would have contaminated the entire field \nand could have resulted in an infection for the patient.''\n  This is a very serious problem that must be addressed before medical \nerrors like this occur.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Federal Government, through the medicare program, \n     pays approximately $8,000,000,000 per year solely to train \n     resident-physicians in the United States, and as a result, \n     has an interest in assuring the safety of patients treated by \n     resident-physicians and the safety of resident-physicians \n     themselves.\n       (2) Resident-physicians spend as much as 30 to 40 percent \n     of their time performing activities not related to the \n     educational mission of training competent physicians.\n       (3) The excessive numbers of hours worked by resident-\n     physicians is inherently dangerous for patient care and for \n     the lives of resident-physicians.\n       (4) The scientific literature has consistently demonstrated \n     that the sleep deprivation of the magnitude seen in residency \n     training programs leads to cognitive impairment.\n       (5) A substantial body of research indicates that excessive \n     hours worked by resident-physicians lead to higher rates of \n     medical error, motor vehicle accidents, depression, and \n     pregnancy complications.\n\n[[Page S7302]]\n\n       (6) The medical community has not adequately addressed the \n     issue of excessive resident-physician work hours.\n       (7) The Federal Government has regulated the work hours of \n     other industries when the safety of employees or the public \n     is at risk.\n       (8) The Institute of Medicine has found that as many as \n     98,000 deaths occur annually due to medical errors and has \n     suggested that 1 necessary approach to reducing errors in \n     hospitals is reducing the fatigue of resident-physicians.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I come before the Senate today about a \nvery serious issue that is threatening the disbursal of justice in the \nwestern United States.\n  My home State of Nevada, along with eight other States, has been part \nof an unbelievable population boom over the last several decades. As a \nresult, we face the frustrating challenges of increased traffic \ncongestion, crowded schools, and a shortage of many services. However, \nthere is one consequence of that growth that has reached a critical \nlevel because it is delaying and denying justice for too many \nAmericans.\n  That is the situation with the Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit. The largest circuit in the country, it encompasses 20 percent \nof the entire Nation's population. The Ninth Circuit has the highest \ncases per jurist ratio. And the trend is not changing. The Circuit is \njust too large. Each of the States covered by the Ninth Circuit saw \npopulation growths over the last decade, and three of the States--\nNevada, Idaho, and Arizona--are in the top five in the country for \npopulation growth. Something must be done, or the Ninth Circuit will \ncontinue to bust at the seams.\n  That is why I am introducing legislation today that would divide the \ncurrent Ninth Circuit into 3 new circuits. The new Ninth Circuit would \ninclude California, Hawaii, Guam, and the Northern Marianas Islands. \nThe new\n\n[[Page S7303]]\n\nTwelfth Circuit would be comprised of Arizona, Nevada, Idaho, and \nMontana. And the new Thirteenth Circuit would contain Oregon, \nWashington, and Alaska.\n  This splitting of the Ninth Circuit is absolutely necessary if the \nresidents of Nevada and the other western states are to have equal \naccess to justice. Right now, citizens living under the Ninth Circuit \nface incomparable delays and judicial inconsistencies. Recently, the \nNinth Circuit had more cases pending for more than one year than all \nother circuits combined.\n  And because of the sheer magnitude of the number of judges in the \nNinth Circuit, it has become increasingly difficult for judges to track \nthe opinions of the other judges in the circuit. In fact, it happened \nthat on the same day, 2 different 3-judge panels in the Ninth Circuit \nissued different legal standards to resolve the same issue. Can you \nimagine the headache this causes for district judges who are supposed \nto follow the standard set by the Ninth Circuit? It compromises the \nsystem of justice that is the cornerstone of our democracy.\n  As a Nevadan, I am also angered by some of the decisions made by the \nNinth Circuit Court. I know how Nevadans feel about issues such as the \nPledge of Allegiance. Like me, they were outraged that the phrase \n``under God'' was ruled unconstitutional by the Ninth Circuit. This \nwasn't the only case of the Ninth Circuit misinterpreting the \nConstitution and our laws. In 1997 alone, the United States Supreme \nCourt overruled 27 out of 28 Ninth Circuit decisions. I wish I could \nsay that was just an ``off' year for the court, but their track record \nwasn't much better in the 6 years before that.\n  Rather than continue down this path of judicial destruction, it is \ntime to use a forward looking approach to the access of justice in the \nwestern United States. I urge my colleagues to join me in our \nConstitutional duty to establish courts for the sake of justice in this \ncountry. Failure to act will cost the citizens of my state, and many \nother western states, dearly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeMINT (for himself, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Graham, Mr. Crapo, \n        Mr. Coburn, Mr. Sununu, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. \n        Lott, Mr. Brownback, and Mr. Craig).\n  S. 1302. A bill to amend the Social Security Act and the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 to stop the Congress from spending Social Security \nsurpluses on other Government programs by dedicating those surpluses to \npersonal accounts that can only be used to pay Social Security \nbenefits; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, it's time to stop the raid on Social \nSecurity. For over twenty years, Congress has maintained the misguided \npractice of over-collecting Social Security taxes and spending them on \nother government programs. Congress has used the Social Security Trust \nFund to promote the false notion that Social Security actually saves \nthe money workers pay in, and it is time to end this abusive practice. \nIt is time we start saving these resources in personal accounts that \npoliticians cannot spend.\n  Money cannot have 2 masters--it either belongs to the government or \nto individual Americans. The only way to prevent Congress from spending \nSocial Security surpluses is to rebate these funds back to a worker in \na personal account with their name on it. The only true lock-box is a \npersonal account.\n  President Bush has done a good job helping Americans understand the \nproblem. Now it is up to Congress to build consensus around some \nsolutions. Every American and nearly everyone in Congress agree on at \nleast one core principle: Social Security money should only be spent on \nSocial Security. Before we can have an honest debate on long-term \nsolutions, we must restore trust with Americans.\n  Stopping the raid will strengthen Social Security and is the first \nstep toward long-term reform.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1302\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) President Franklin Roosevelt's January 17, 1935, \n     message on Social Security declared that, ``First, the system \n     adopted, except for the money necessary to initiate it, \n     should be self-sustaining in the sense that funds for the \n     payment of insurance benefits should not come from the \n     proceeds of general taxation.''.\n       (2) Social Security's financial integrity is maintained by \n     requiring that benefit payments do not exceed the program's \n     dedicated tax revenues and the interest earned on the \n     balances in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust \n     Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund over the \n     long term.\n       (3) The separation of Social Security from other budget \n     accounts also serves to protect Social Security benefits from \n     competing against other Federal programs for its funding \n     resources.\n       (4) Comprehensive reforms should be enacted to--\n       (A) fix Social Security permanently;\n       (B) ensure that any use of general revenues for the program \n     is temporary; and\n       (C) provide for the eventual repayment of any revenue \n     transfers from the general fund to the Federal Old-Age and \n     Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability \n     Insurance Trust Fund.\n\n     TITLE I--SOCIAL SECURITY PERSONAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS PROGRAM\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to guarantee \ncomprehensive health care coverage for all children born after 2006; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today with my friends and \ncolleagues--Senators Reed, Lautenberg, Corzine, Sarbanes, and Kerry--to \nintroduce an important piece of legislation, the MediKids Health \nInsurance Act of 2005. This legislation will provide health insurance \nfor every child in the United States by 2012, regardless of family \nincome. My long-time friend from California, Congressman Stark, is \nintroducing a companion bill in the House. He has worked tirelessly to \nimprove access to health care for all Americans, and I am pleased to be \njoining him once again to advocate on behalf of America's children.\n  We have introduced this legislation in each of the last three \nCongresses because we know how vital health insurance is to a child. \nChildren with untreated illnesses are less likely to learn and \ntherefore less likely to move out of poverty. Such children have an \ninherent disadvantage when it comes to being productive members of \nsociety. We can have a positive impact on our children's lives today as \nwell as tomorrow by guaranteeing health insurance coverage for all. \nChildren are inexpensive to insure, but the rewards for providing them \nwith health care during their early education and development years are \nenormous.\n  Despite the well-documented benefits of providing health insurance \ncoverage for children, there are still over 8 million uninsured \nchildren in America. We can and must do better. Our children are our \nfuture. No child in this country should ever be without access to \nhealth care. This is why I am proud to reintroduce the MediKids Health \nInsurance Act of 2005.\n  This legislation is a clear investment in our future--our children. \nEvery child would be automatically enrolled at birth into a new, \ncomprehensive Federal safety net health insurance program beginning in \n2007. The benefits would be tailored to meet the needs of children and \nwould be similar to those currently available to children through the \nMedicaid Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) \nprogram. Families below 150 percent of poverty would have no premiums \nor co-payments, and there would be no cost sharing for preventive or \nwell-child visits for any child.\n  MediKids children would remain enrolled in the program throughout \nchildhood. When families move to another state, Medikids would be \navailable until parents can enroll their children in a new insurance \nprogram. Between jobs or during family crises, Medikids would offer \nextra security and ensure continuous health coverage to our Nation's \nchildren. During that critical period when a family is just climbing \nout of poverty and out of the eligibility range for means-tested \nassistance programs, MediKids would fill in the gaps until the parents \ncan move into jobs that provide reliable health insurance coverage. The \nkey to our program is that whenever other sources of health insurance \nfail, MediKids would stand ready to cover the health needs of our next \ngeneration. Ultimately, every child in America would be able to grow up \nwith consistent, continuous health insurance coverage.\n  Like Medicare, MediKids would be independently financed, would cover \nbenefits tailored to the needs of its target population, and would have \nthe goal of achieving nearly 100 percent health insurance coverage for \nthe children of this country--just as Medicare has done for our \nNation's seniors and disabled population over its 40-year history. At \nthe time we created Medicare, seniors were more likely to be living in \npoverty than any other age group. Most were unable to afford needed \nmedical services and unable to find health insurance in the market even \nif they could afford it. Today, it is our Nation's children who \nshoulder the burden of poverty. Children in America are nearly twice as \nvulnerable to poverty as adults. It's time we make a significant \ninvestment in the future of America by guaranteeing all children the \nhealth coverage they need to make a healthy start in life.\n  Congress cannot rest on the success we achieved by expanding Medicaid \nand passing the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). \nAlthough each was a remarkable step toward reducing the ranks of the \nuninsured, particularly uninsured children, we still have a long way to \ngo. Even with perfect enrollment in CHIP and Medicaid, there would \nstill be a great number of children without health insurance. What's \nmore troubling is the fact that both Medicaid and CHIP are in serious \njeopardy because of the budget cuts being proposed by the current \nAdministration.\n  It's long past time to rekindle the discussion about how we are going \nto provide health insurance for all Americans. The bill we are \nintroducing today--the MediKids Health Insurance Act of 2005--is a step \ntoward eliminating the irrational and tragic lack of health insurance \nfor so many children and adults in our country. I urge my colleagues to \nmove beyond partisan politics and to support this critical step toward \nuniversal coverage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1303\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Report on long-term revenues\n\n       (c) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) More than 9 million American children are uninsured.\n       (2) Children who are uninsured receive less medical care \n     and less preventive care and have a poorer level of health, \n     which result in\n\n[[Page S7309]]\n\n     lifetime costs to themselves and to the entire American \n     economy.\n       (3) Although SCHIP and Medicaid are successfully extending \n     a health coverage safety net to a growing portion of the \n     vulnerable low-income population of uninsured children, they \n     alone cannot achieve 100 percent health insurance coverage \n     for our nation's children due to inevitable gaps during \n     outreach and enrollment, fluctuations in eligibility, \n     variations in access to private insurance at all income \n     levels, and variations in States' ability to provide required \n     matching funds.\n       (4) As all segments of society continue to become more \n     transient, with many changes in employment over the working \n     lifetime of parents, the need for a reliable safety net of \n     health insurance which follows children across State lines, \n     already a major problem for the children of migrant and \n     seasonal farmworkers, will become a major concern for all \n     families in the United States.\n       (5) The medicare program has successfully evolved over the \n     years to provide a stable, universal source of health \n     insurance for the nation's disabled and those over age 65, \n     and provides a tested model for designing a program to reach \n     out to America's children.\n       (6) The problem of insuring 100 percent of all American \n     children could be gradually solved by automatically enrolling \n     all children born after December 31, 2006, in a program \n     modeled after Medicare (and to be known as ``MediKids''), and \n     allowing those children to be transferred into other \n     equivalent or better insurance programs, including either \n     private insurance, SCHIP, or Medicaid, if they are eligible \n     to do so, but maintaining the child's default enrollment in \n     MediKids for any times when the child's access to other \n     sources of insurance is lost.\n       (7) A family's freedom of choice to use other insurers to \n     cover children would not be interfered with in any way, and \n     children eligible for SCHIP and Medicaid would continue to be \n     enrolled in those programs, but the underlying safety net of \n     MediKids would always be available to cover any gaps in \n     insurance due to changes in medical condition, employment, \n     income, or marital status, or other changes affecting a \n     child's access to alternate forms of insurance.\n       (8) The MediKids program can be administered without \n     impacting the finances or status of the existing Medicare \n     program.\n       (9) The MediKids benefit package can be tailored to the \n     special needs of children and updated over time.\n       (10) The financing of the program can be administered \n     without difficulty by a yearly payment of affordable premiums \n     through a family's tax filing (or adjustment of a family's \n     earned income tax credit).\n       (11) The cost of the program will gradually rise as the \n     number of children using MediKids as the insurer of last \n     resort increases, and a future Congress always can accelerate \n     or slow down the enrollment process as desired, while the \n     societal costs for emergency room usage, lost productivity \n     and work days, and poor health status for the next generation \n     of Americans will decline.\n       (12) Over time 100 percent of American children will always \n     have basic health insurance, and we can therefore expect a \n     healthier, more equitable, and more productive society.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to protect pension \nbenefits of employees in defined benefit plans and to direct the \nSecretary of the Treasury to enforce the age discrimination \nrequirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a piece of \nlegislation to fix a huge oversight in pension policy.\n  In the early 1990s, a large number of U.S. companies began a process \nof switching their traditional defined benefit pension plans to what's \nreferred to as ``cash balance'' pension plans. A cash balance pension \nis insured, like a traditional plan, through the PBGC. However, it \nlooks more like a defined contribution plan to participants because the \nbenefit is expressed as some percent of play plus some guaranteed \ninterest rate. This isn't necessarily a bad idea, in and of itself. \nHowever, in practice, many of the employees working for these companies \nwere not told what these changes would mean for them. Some companies \nhad their employees work for years without earning any more benefits. \nMany of those employees didn't figure that out for a very long time. \nUnfortunately, their lack of understanding in this situation was a key \nbenefit to management. However, once they figured out what was \nhappening, the retirees were furious.\n  As two consultants who helped put these plans together said at an \nActuaries conference in 1998:\n\n       ``I've been involved in cash balance plans five or six \n     years down the road and what I have found is that while \n     employees understand it, it is not until they are actually \n     ready to retire that they understand how little they are \n     actually getting.''\n       ``Right, but they're happy while they're employed.''\n\n  One of the most abusive practices in cash balance conversions is \nknown as ``wear away. `` The company freezes the value of the benefits \nemployees already earned, which by law cannot be taken away once given. \nHowever, the employer opens a cash balance account for that worker at a \nmuch lower dollar level. So they end up working for years contributing \nto this lower cash balance account, not realizing that contribution is \nmeaningless because their old benefits were higher. At the same time, \nyounger workers do get money added to their account every day. This is \nclearly age discrimination, and bad pension policy.\n  In 1999, I introduced a bill to make it illegal for corporations to \nwear away the benefits of older workers during conversions to cash \nbalance plans. I offered my bill as an amendment. Forty-eight Senators, \nincluding 3 Republicans, voted to waive the budget point of order so we \ncould consider this amendment. We did not have enough votes then, but I \nbelieve the tide is turning.\n  After that vote, more and more stories came out about how many \nworkers were losing their pensions. In September of 1999, the Secretary \nof the Treasury put a moratorium on conversions from defined benefit \nplans to cash balance plans. That moratorium has\n\n[[Page S7313]]\n\nbeen in effect now for over three years. In April of 2000, I offered a \nSense-of-the-Senate resolution to stop this practice, and it passed the \nSenate unanimously.\n  There are hundreds of age discrimination complaints currently pending \nbefore the EEOC based on some of these abusive cash balance \nconversions. Clearly, something must be done to address this issue \nthat's been floating around now unresolved for over five years.\n  Before, I said that wear-away is the least fair practice during \nconversion. And I have to say that now, public sentiment is really \ncoming around to acknowledge that unfairness. However, aside from wear-\naway, there's another problem in shifting from a traditional pension to \ncash balance. In a traditional plan, you accrue most of the benefits \ntoward the end of your career, because there's usually some kind of \nformula that multiplies top pay times years of service. People tend to \nearn more salary toward the end of their careers, and if that is \nmultiplied times more years served, the pension grows quickly in later \nyears. But in a cash balance plan, younger workers do better because \nthey are given a flat percent of pay plus some guaranteed interest \ncredit. Interest is good for young people, they have many years to \naccrue and compound it. So if you get caught in mid-life, mid-career in \none of these transitions, you get the downside of both plans.\n  Before I go any further, I want to be clear on one point--cash \nbalance pensions can be a great deal for workers. Some. And they may \nhelp fill a needed niche in the pension world to cover the half of the \nworkforce that currently has no pension. But I will continue my long \nbattle to oppose the unilateral decision of a company to cut off a \npromise for an older worker, give that money to a younger worker, and \nnot view it as age discrimination.\n  That is what this issue is all about. It is fairness. It is equity. I \nknow discussion of pension law can become very convoluted. But this can \nbe boiled down pretty simply. It is about what we think a promise from \nan employer ought to mean.\n  There is one thing that has distinguished the American workplace from \nothers around the world. We have valued loyalty. At least we used to. \nThat is one of the reasons pension plans exist--the longer you work \nsomewhere, the more you earn in your pension program. Obviously, the \nlonger you work someplace, the better you do your job, the more you \nlearn about it, the more productive you are. We should value that \nloyalty.\n  But here, companies are able to take away the benefits of the longest \nserving workers. What kind of a signal does that send to the workers? \nIt tells workers they are fools if they are loyal because if you put in \n20 or 25 years, the boss can just change the rules of the game, and \nbreak their promise. It tells younger workers that it would be crazy to \nwork for a company for a long time, that it's best to hedge your bets \nand move on as soon as it is convenient. It's crazy to trade current \npay for the promise of future benefits. So why even take into account \nthe fact that you're being offered a pension plan? This is a very \ndangerous road to go down.\n  This destroys the kind of work ethic we have come to value and that \nwe know built this country. But some of these cash balance conversions \ncounter all of that. Here is an analogy. Imagine I hire someone for 5 \nyears with a promise of a $50,000 bonus at the end of 5 years of \nservice. At the end of 3 years, however, I renege on the $50,000 bonus. \nBut the employee has 3 years invested. Had they known that the deal was \ngoing to be off, perhaps they would not have gone to work for me. They \ncould have gone to work someplace else for a total higher compensation \npackage. Now imagine that they hire a new guy to join the team, and \nthey give him part of that $50,000 bonus they promised me. Is that the \nway we want to treat workers in this country, where the employer has \nall the cards and employees have none, and employers can make whatever \ndeal they want, but can change the rules at any time?\n\n  That is why I am introducing this legislation. It is simple. It says \nthat you have to give older, longer serving employees a choice, at \nretirement, when their pension plan is converted to a cash balance plan \nto get the benefits earned in the old plan instead. It also says that \nemployers must start counting the new cash balance benefits where the \nold defined benefit plan left off, instead of starting the cash balance \nplan at a lower level than an employee had already earned.\n  This isn't a radical idea. I was very pleased that in February of \n2004, the Administration came out with a cash balance proposal that \nrecognized that these transitions are hard on workers. It not only \nprohibits wear-away but provides for 5 year transition credits for \nworkers caught in the middle of a conversion. Treasury reaffirmed its \ncommitment to this approach in this year's budget request.\n  I was excited when Treasury first came to the table with a proposal \nto do more to protect workers here. I was so encouraged by this that I \nconvened a series of meetings over the course of last summer to get all \ninterested parties to the table--everyone from participant rights \nadvocates to industry groups to consultants. I heard some really great \nideas, and some that I didn't agree with. But I think there is still \nroom to find answers to this problem. So I'm putting my plan back on \nthe table today. And I really hope that we can continue a meaningful \ndialog on this issue.\n  If we do that, this year, we can enact meaningful participant \nprotections moving forward so that there is another pension option out \nthere to cover the roughly half of Americans with no pension at all. \nBut I also want to make it clear that this Senator will never sit idly \nby as older workers get the rug pulled out from under them just as they \nthought they were on solid ground for their retirement. I won't stand \nidly by and watch their money redistributed in an age-discriminatory \nway. We can have this dialog and we can find a way to fix what's broken \nhere, but not by blessing some of these blatant abuses.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK:\n  S. 1305. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease tax benefits for parents with children, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Parents \nTax Relief Act.\n  The Parents Tax Relief Act would help restore to families the pride-\nof-place, which they enjoyed during the early days of the income tax.\n  This important legislation would relieve the growing tax burden on \nfamilies with children; provide a realistic option for one parent to \nstay at home and care for the children; and acknowledge the \nindispensable social value of the time and effort that parents put into \nrearing and forming their children.\n  Letting parents keep more of their hard-earned money for family-\nrelated expenses leaves the childcare decision to parents. Given this \nopportunity to make their own decision about childcare, many will \nchoose to stay at home and care for their children themselves.\n  This legislation is necessary because parents have been hit \nespecially hard by increasing taxes over the past half-century. In \n1948, the average family with children paid 3 percent of its income in \nFederal taxes; today, that same average family with children pays \nalmost 25 percent of its income in Federal taxes.\n  It is time for the Federal Government to step back and recognize the \ncontributions of the American family. As a matter of policy, I believe \nwe should work to further reduce taxes on families with children in \norder to make it easier for parents to be parents and care for their \nown children at home. Outside of abusive situations, nothing is better \nfor our children than spending time with their parents.\n  The Parents Tax Relief Act takes a modest step towards empowering and \nstrengthening the family. It builds on Marriage Penalty Tax Relief and \nthe Child Tax Credit, making both permanent. While the Child Tax Credit \nwas significant in leveling a three-decade trend of an increasing \npercentage of married mothers with preschool children who work outside \nthe home full-time, more needs to be done to give parents the chance to \ndecrease this percentage.\n  To accomplish this end, the Parents Tax Relief Act would increase \ndeductions for young and elderly dependents.\n\n[[Page S7314]]\n\nIt would equalize existing Federal preferences between parents who \nchoose to stay at home with their children and parents Who choose to \nwork outside of the home and place their children in paid daycare.\n  The bill would make it easier for a parent to spend more time with \ntheir children through provisions that encourage telecommuting and home \nbusinesses. And it recognizes the societal contributions of parents by \ngranting 10 years worth of Social Security credits to a spouse who \nleaves the workforce during their prime-earning years to care for a \nyoung child.\n  The Parents Tax Relief Act is about investing in human capital. The \nhard-working American family, instilling traditional values to \nchildren, has been the bedrock of American society. As the family goes, \nso goes the Nation.\n  In recent years, the Federal Government has engaged in a massive \nexperiment with paid, out-of-home daycare. As a national policy, \nthrough Federal subsidies, we have encouraged parents to place their \nchildren in daycare, and further, we have increasingly become a Nation \nwhere it is necessary for both husband and wife to be in the workforce \njust to cover a family's basic needs. The end result is that children \nare getting less of their parents' time when they need their parents \nthe most.\n  Make no mistake, both men and women have made valuable contributions \nto our national workforce. Our Nation's productivity is strong, and we \nhave enjoyed a great period of national prosperity. But how long will \nit last when our children are spending less time with mom and dad? \nSociological data confirms time and again that children do best when \nraised by a mother and a father, where one spouse works and the other \nspouse stays at home with the children.\n  Unfortunately--and I believe that most mothers, especially, would \ntend to agree--we have reached a point where a family has to make a \ntruly great sacrifice for one parent to stay at home to raise the \nchildren. I have heard so many stories of mothers wanting to stay home \nwith their children, but between paying a mortgage and taxes, they feel \nhelpless. They feel that they must work in order that their family can \nenjoy and maintain a middle-class lifestyle.\n  It is time for us to acknowledge, through Federal policy, the \nsacrifices that parents make to invest in the upbringing of their \nchildren when they stay at home. That is goal of the Parents Tax Relief \nAct, and it is the reason why I am introducing this important measure.\n  It costs a great sum to raise children these days, and it is \nessential to our Nation's social and economic welfare that we ensure \nFederal tax policy does not infringe on a parent's ability to afford \nthat great sum.\n  The Parents Tax Relief Act would establish a new national tax policy \nthat would allow parents to invest more time and effort in the \nformation of their children. In the end, this type of investment in \nhuman capital may be the most effective way for the Federal Government \nto ensure our future economic growth and competitiveness.\n  The legislative road to this new policy begins today, and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nmake it a reality.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1306. A bill to provide for the recognition of certain Native \ncommunities and the settlement of certain claims under the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, at the very beginning of the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act of 1971 there are a series of findings and \ndeclarations of Congressional policy which explain the underpinnings of \nthis landmark legislation.\n  The first clause reads, ``There is an immediate need for a fair and \njust settlement of all claims by Natives and Native groups of Alaska, \nbased on aboriginal land claims.'' The second clause states, ``The \nsettlement should be accomplished rapidly, with certainty, in \nconformity with the real economic and social needs of Natives.''\n  Thirty three years have passed since the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act became law and still the Native peoples of five \ncommunities in Southeast Alaska--Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee \nand Wrangell--the five ``landless communities'' are still waiting for \ntheir fair and just settlement.\n  The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act awarded approximately $1 \nbillion and 44 million acres of land to Alaska Natives and provided for \nthe establishment of Native Corporations to receive and manage such \nfunds and lands. The beneficiaries of the settlement were issued stock \nin one of 13 regional Alaska Native Corporations. Most beneficiaries \nalso had the option to enroll and receive stock in a village, group or \nurban corporation.\n  For reasons that still defy explanation the Native peoples of the \n``landless communities,'' were not permitted by the Alaska Native \nClaims Settlement Act to form village or urban corporations. These \ncommunities were excluded from this benefit even though they did not \ndiffer significantly from other communities in Southeast Alaska that \nwere permitted to form village or urban corporations under the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act. This finding was confirmed in a February \n1994 report submitted by the Secretary of the Interior at the direction \nof the Congress. That study was conducted by the Institute of Social \nand Economic Research at the University of Alaska.\n  The Native people of Southeast Alaska have recognized the injustice \nof this oversight for more than 33 years. An independent study issued \nmore than 11 years ago confirms that the grievance of the landless \ncommunities is legitimate. Legislation has been introduced in the past \nsessions of Congress to remedy this injustice. Hearings have been held \nand reports written. Yet legislation to right the wrong has inevitably \nstalled out. This December marks the 34th anniversary of Congress' \npromise to the Native peoples of Alaska--the promise of a rapid and \ncertain settlement. And still the landless communities of Southeast \nAlaska are landless.\n  I am convinced that this cause is just, it is right, and it is about \ntime that the Native peoples of the five landless communities receive \nwhat has been denied them for more than 30 years.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today would enable the Native \npeoples of the five ``landless communities'' to organize five ``urban \ncorporations,'' one for each unrecognized community. These newly formed \ncorporations would be offered and could accept the surface estate to \napproximately 23,000 acres of land. Sealaska Corporation, the regional \nAlaska Native Corporation for Southeast Alaska would receive title to \nthe subsurface estate to the designated lands. The urban corporations \nwould each receive a lump sum payment to be used as start-up funds for \nthe newly established corporation. The Secretary of the Interior would \ndetermine other appropriate compensation to redress the inequities \nfaced by the unrecognized communities.\n  It is long past time that we return to the Native peoples of \nSoutheast Alaska a small slice of the aboriginal lands that were once \ntheirs alone. It is time that we open our minds and open our hearts to \ncorrecting this injustice which has gone on far too long and finally \ngive the Native peoples of Southeast Alaska the rapid and certain \nsettlement for which they have been waiting.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1306\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Unrecognized Southeast \n     Alaska Native Communities Recognition and Compensation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 1971, Congress enacted the Alaska Native Claims \n     Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (referred to in this \n     section as the ``Act'') to recognize and settle the \n     aboriginal claims of Alaska Natives to the lands Alaska \n     Natives had used for traditional purposes.\n       (2) The Act awarded approximately $1,000,000,000 and \n     44,000,000 acres of land to Alaska Natives and provided for \n     the establishment of Native Corporations to receive and \n     manage such funds and lands.\n       (3) Pursuant to the Act, Alaska Natives have been enrolled \n     in one of 13 Regional Corporations.\n\n[[Page S7315]]\n\n       (4) Most Alaska Natives reside in communities that are \n     eligible under the Act to form a Village or Urban Corporation \n     within the geographical area of a Regional Corporation.\n       (5) Village or Urban Corporations established under the Act \n     received cash and surface rights to the settlement land \n     described in paragraph (2) and the corresponding Regional \n     Corporation received cash and land which includes the \n     subsurface rights to the land of the Village or Urban \n     Corporation.\n       (6) The southeastern Alaska communities of Haines, \n     Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and Wrangell are not listed \n     under the Act as communities eligible to form Village or \n     Urban Corporations, even though the population of such \n     villages comprises greater than 20 percent of the \n     shareholders of the Regional Corporation for Southeast Alaska \n     and display historic, cultural, and traditional qualities of \n     Alaska Natives.\n       (7) The communities described in paragraph (6) have sought \n     full eligibility for lands and benefits under the Act for \n     more than three decades.\n       (8) In 1993, Congress directed the Secretary of the \n     Interior to prepare a report examining the reasons why the \n     communities listed in paragraph (6) had been denied \n     eligibility to form Village or Urban Corporations and receive \n     land and benefits pursuant to the Act.\n       (9) The report described in paragraph (8), published in \n     February, 1994, indicates that--\n       (A) the communities listed in paragraph (6) do not differ \n     significantly from the southeast Alaska communities that were \n     permitted to form Village or Urban Corporations under the \n     Act;\n       (B) such communities are similar to other communities that \n     are eligible to form Village or Urban Corporations under the \n     Act and receive lands and benefits under the Act--\n       (i) in actual number and percentage of Native Alaskan \n     population; and\n       (ii) with respect to the historic use and occupation of \n     land;\n       (C) each such community was involved in advocating the \n     settlement of the aboriginal claims of the community; and\n       (D) some of the communities appeared on early versions of \n     lists of Native Villages prepared before the date of the \n     enactment of the Act, but were not included as Native \n     Villages in the Act.\n       (10) The omissions described in paragraph (9) are not \n     clearly explained in any provision of the Act or the \n     legislative history of the Act.\n       (11) On the basis of the findings described in paragraphs \n     (1) through (10), Alaska Natives who were enrolled in the \n     five unlisted communities and their heirs have been \n     inadvertently and wrongly denied the cultural and financial \n     benefits of enrollment in Village or Urban Corporations \n     established pursuant to the Act.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to redress the \n     omission of the communities described in subsection (a)(6) \n     from eligibility by authorizing the Native people enrolled in \n     the communities--\n       (1) to form Urban Corporations for the communities of \n     Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and Wrangell under \n     the Act; and\n       (2) to receive certain settlement lands and other \n     compensation pursuant to the Act.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF ADDITIONAL NATIVE CORPORATIONS.\n\n       Section 16 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1615) is amended by adding at the end thereof the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(e)(1) The Native residents of each of the Native \n     Villages of Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and \n     Wrangell, Alaska, may organize as Urban Corporations.\n       ``(2) Nothing in this subsection shall affect any \n     entitlement to land of any Native Corporation previously \n     established pursuant to this Act or any other provision of \n     law.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated such sums as shall \n     be necessary to carry out this Act and the amendments made by \n     this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 1308. A bill to establish an Office of Trade Adjustment \nAssistance, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I introduce the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance for Firms Reorganization Act.\n  The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms program assists hundreds of \nmostly small and medium-sized manufacturing and agricultural companies \nin Montana and nationwide when they face layoffs and lost sales due to \nimport competition. Qualifying companies develop adjustment plans and \nreceive technical assistance to become more competitive, so that they \ncan retain and expand employment.\n  The program is very cost effective. It requires the firms being \nhelped to match the Federal assistance with their own funds, and it \npays the government back in federal and State tax revenues when the \nfirms succeed.\n  For example, TAA for Firms is helping Montola Growers from \nCulbertson, Montana, to develop cosmetic applications for its safflower \noil. And it is helping Porterbilt Company of Hamilton to expand its \nproduct line.\n  Currently, TAA for Firms clients receive assistance preparing \npetitions and adjustment plans from twelve Trade Adjustment Assistance \nCenters, which are Commerce Department contractors. Program and policy \ndecisions are made by a small headquarters staff in the Commerce \nDepartment's Economic Development Administration.\n  In the Trade Act of 2002, Congress voted to reauthorize this \nimportant program for seven years and to increase its authorized \nfunding level. The program seemed headed toward some years of smooth \nsailing. But it turns out that is not the case.\n  For reasons unrelated to TAA for Firms, EDA began more than a year \nago to move all its headquarters programs to its six regional offices. \nFor TAA for Firms, that means clients will still get the same local \nservices from the TAACs, but decisions will be made in six regional \noffices plus a national policy office. The likely result is more \npersonnel needed to run the program, more layers of government, less \ncentralized and consistent decision making, and less accountability--\nall without any likely improvement in customer service.\n  In preparation for this reorganization, EDA transferred or otherwise \neliminated most of its experienced TAA staff in the Washington office. \nBut to date it has not completed the transfer and hired or trained the \nnecessary regional staff. So the program is in limbo.\n  Meanwhile, the President recently announced a multi-agency \nconsolidation of economic development programs that will eliminate EDA \nand its regional offices. Not surprisingly, the latest word from EDA is \nthat plans to complete the move of TAA for Firms to the regional \noffices are now on indefinite hold. The President's fiscal year 2006 \nbudget zeroes out TAA for Firms, even though Congress has authorized \nthe program through fiscal year 2007. With funding in doubt and the \nWashington-based management structure for TAA for Firms already largely \ndismantled, this program is on the verge of a crisis.\n  TAA for Firms was not broken until someone decided to fix it. Now it \nis doomed to stay in limbo unless Congress acts to clean up the mess.\n  The bill I am introducing today solves these problems by moving \nadministration of the TAA for Firms program from EDA into a different \npart of the Commerce Department--the International Trade \nAdministration. I introduced this same bill last year with 15 co-\nsponsors.\n  Relocating the program to ITA makes sense. ITA has experience running \nthis program, which was located there prior to 1990. Relocating TAA for \nFirms to ITA will result in fewer lays of government and more \ncentralized and accountable program management than running it through \nEDA's regional offices or some new economic development agency.\n  Relocating the program also creates synergies by allowing better \ncoordination of the TAA for Firms program with other trade and trade \nremedy programs administered by ITA.

A bill to amend the Trade Act of 1974 to extend the trade \nadjustment assistance program to the services sector, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I introduce the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Equity for Service Workers Act.\n  Frankly, I am disappointed to be here introducing this bill yet \nagain.\n  Just last week, the substance of the bill was adopted by a majority \nof members of the Finance Committee as an amendment to the implementing \nlegislation for the United States-Central America-Dominican Republic \nFree Trade Agreement. But today, the administration sent us the final \nimplementing bill with the amendment stripped out.\n  President Bush likes to say that trade is for everyone. That we all \nshare the benefits, including workers. And he claims to care a lot \nabout having a skilled workforce that can keep American businesses \ncompetitive in global markets.\n  This amendment presented the President with the perfect opportunity \nto put his money where his mouth is.\n  He could have said to the American people--as President Clinton did \nwhen Congress considered the NAFTA--that just as all Americans share in \nthe benefits of trade, we all bear a responsibility for its costs. \nTrade liberalization and trade adjustment go hand in hand. And then he \ncould have provided America's service sector workers with access to the \none program designed to make that happen--Trade Adjustment Assistance.\n  But by submitting the CAFTA implementing bill stripped of the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance amendment passed by the Finance Committee, he \nchose not to.\n\n[[Page S7317]]\n\n  Since 1962, Trade Adjustment Assistance--what we call ``TAA''--has \nprovided retraining, income support, and other benefits so that workers \nwho lose their jobs due to trade can make a new start.\n  The rationale for TAA is simple. When our government pursues trade \nliberalization, we create benefits for the economy as a whole. But \nthere is always some dislocation from trade.\n  When he created the TAA program, President Kennedy explained that the \nFederal Government has an obligation ``to render assistance to those \nwho suffer as a result of national trade policy.''\n  For more than 40 years, we have met that obligation through TAA, \nwhich is principally a retraining program designed to update worker \nskills.\n  The TAA program has not been static over time. Congress periodically \nrevises the program to meet new economic realities. Most recently, in \nthe Trade Act of 2002, Congress completed the most comprehensive \noverhaul and expansion of the TAA program since its inception.\n  I am proud to have played a leading role in passing this landmark \nlegislation. But I am also the first to admit that our work is not \ndone. Economic realities continue to change, and TAA must continue to \nchange with them.\n  One fundamental aspect of TAA that has remained unchanged since 1962 \nis its focus on manufacturing. We only give TAA benefits to workers who \nmake ``articles.''\n  Excluding service workers from TAA may have made sense in 1962, when \nmost non-farm jobs were in manufacturing and most services were not \ntraded across national borders.\n  But today, most American jobs are in the service sector. And the \nmarket for many services is becoming just as global as the market for \nmanufactured goods.\n  In 2002, the service sector accounted for three quarters of U.S. \nprivate sector gross domestic product and nearly 80 percent of non-farm \nprivate employment.\n  Trade in services is a net plus for the U.S. economy. Although trade \nin goods continues to dominate, services accounted for 29 percent of \nthe value of total U.S. exports in 2002 and the service sector \ngenerated a trade surplus of $74 billion.\n  Just as we have seen with trade in manufactured goods, however, there \nare winners and losers from trade. Trade in services will inevitably \ncost some workers their jobs.\n  Indeed, there have been some well-publicized examples in the papers. \nSoftware sign. Technical support. Accounting and tax preparation \nservices. Not long ago, a group of call center workers in Kalispell, MT \nsaw their jobs move to Canada and India.\n  Examples abound of service sector jobs--even high tech jobs--\nrelocating overseas. A series of studies estimate that between a half \nmillion and over 3 million U.S. service sector jobs would be moved \noffshore in the next 5 to 10 years.\n  That doesn't mean the total number of jobs in the U.S. economy is \nshrinking. But the fact that jobs may be available in a different field \nis cold comfort to a worker whose own skills are no longer in demand.\n  That is why this legislation is so important. It is a simple matter \nof equity.\n  When a factory relocates to another country, those workers are \neligible for TAA. But when a call center moves to another country, \nthose workers are not eligible for TAA. They should be.\n  The benefits service workers will receive under this legislation \nwould be exactly the same as those that trade-impacted manufacturing \nworkers now receive. They include retraining, income support, job \nsearch and relocation allowance, and a health coverage tax credit.\n  Hard working American service workers deserve this safety net. These \nbenefits will always be second best to a job. But they can really make \na difference in helping workers make a new start.\n  Truthfully, I am mystified by why the President so cavalierly dropped \nthe TAA for Services amendment and let this opportunity pass him by. \nHis actions are entirely inconsistent with his stated desire to make \ntrade benefit all Americans. But, sadly, this has become a pattern.\n  Despite the obvious benefits of the TAA program, the Bush \nAdministration fought tooth and nail against every penny, and against \nevery provision in what became the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform \nAct of 2002. Extending TAA to service workers was one of many needed \nimprovements that was struck in the final version of the bill.\n  Again in the last Congress, the extension of TAA to service workers \nwas offered as an amendment to the JOBS Act and opposed by the \nAdministration. It garnered 54 votes from both sides ofthe aisle--\nfailing only on a technicality.\n  The world is changing and TAA must keep up with the times. Last \nyear's Senate vote and this year's Finance Committee vote make clear \nthat there is wide support for extending TAA to service workers. I \ntruly believe this bill's time has come. I will work hard to move this \nlegislation this year.\n  I want to thank Senators Coleman and Wyden for co-sponsoring this \nlegislation. They have been stalwart supporters in the fight to bring \nequity to service workers. I look forward to working with them to make \nTAA for service workers a reality.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1309\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, tomorrow, the Senate will begin \nconsideration of the Interior appropriations bill. Under a previous \nagreement, we will consider amendments to the bill tomorrow and Monday, \nand we will begin votes in relation to amendments to the bill on \nTuesday of next week. Therefore, there will be no rollcall votes during \ntomorrow's session. Senators who have amendments to the Interior \nappropriations bill, however, should make themselves available to come \nto the floor tomorrow and Monday to offer their first-degree \namendments.\n  Mr. President, we had a great success today in the completion of the \nEnergy bill, although we will not have the final vote on that bill \nuntil Tuesday morning. I congratulate the chairman and ranking member \nof the Energy Committee for their tremendous work--tremendous work--in \ngetting the Energy bill to the finish line. Through their hard work and \nwith the cooperation and hard work of our colleagues, we were able to \ndispose of all amendments and take the bill to third reading in 2 \nweeks, just as we had planned. We had said that was our goal about a \nmonth ago. And, indeed, that goal has been accomplished.\n  We will have the vote on passage on Tuesday morning of next week. The \nvote on passage will occur between 9:45 a.m. and 10 a.m. on Tuesday, \nand that will be our next vote. Both the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Energy Committee will be there for that vote on Tuesday morning.\n  Tomorrow, Mr. President, I will update everyone with respect to next \nweek's schedule. It will be the last week of our session prior to the \nFourth of July holiday, and thus we can expect a very busy week.\n  At the beginning of this 4-week block, we said we would spend the \nlast week on appropriations bills. And, indeed, with the completion of \nthe Energy bill, we will do just that--in fact, starting a day early by \nbeginning the Interior appropriations bill tomorrow. Also during the \nweek, we will have other legislative or executive matters we will deal \nwith once they have been cleared.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/23/senate-section/article/S7330-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
