A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for an offset from the Medicaid clawback for State prescription \ndrug expenditures for covered part D drugs for Medicare beneficiaries; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Medicare State \nReimbursement Act along with my colleagues, Senators Snowe, Schumer, \nColeman, Feinstein, Pryor, DeWine, Boxer, Menendez, Collins, Dayton, \nReed, Jeffords, Lincoln, Leahy, Wyden, Stabenow, Johnson, Kennedy, \nDorgan, Lieberman, Clinton, Chafee and Dodd.\n  There have been many difficulties surrounding implementation of the \nMedicare prescription drug benefit, however, few have experienced the \nseverity of the problems that those who are dually eligible for both \nMedicare and Medicaid have faced.\n  ``Dual Eligibles'' are the Nation's poorest seniors and the disabled. \nMany suffer from multiple, chronic, debilitating conditions and on \naverage take between five and ten medications per day. Missing even one \ndose of medication could result in a life threatening situation.\n  Across America, countless beneficiaries who tried to have their \nprescriptions filled for the first time under the new system were told \nthat their enrollment could not be verified, their drugs were not \ncovered, or they would be charged larger co-payments or deductibles \nthan they could afford. As a result, many were at risk of not receiving \nlifesaving prescription drugs.\n  Regardless of how Senators voted on the Medicare Drug bill, I think \nall Senators can agree on one thing: the flaws in the startup of this \nprogram are unacceptable.\n  Fortunately, a number of States including New Jersey have taken \nactions to help those who have experienced problems with access to \nmedications under the new prescription drug benefit. As of Wednesday \nthis week, New Jersey had already spent $16.6 million dollars.\n  Congress has been asking the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices whether New Jersey and other States will be paid back for its \nexpenditures. The answers we have gotten so far are not satisfactory.\n  That is why we need to legislate on this issue. It must be crystal \nclear to the Federal Government that it needs to repay these States \nthat are bailing them out.\n  Accordingly, I am introducing emergency legislation today that will \nreimburse States for the cost they have incurred for filling this \nunanticipated gap in coverage.\n  Specifically, this legislation would: require the Federal Government \nto reimburse the states for the cost of prescriptions for low income \nseniors and people with disabilities (``dual eligibles'') who were \neligible for coverage under Medicare Part D, but were improperly denied \nFederal coverage.\n\n[[Page S24]]\n\n  Reimburse states through an equivalent reduction in funds owed by \neach state under the ``claw back'' provision of the new Medicare law.\n  Reimbursement will be at a rate equal to 100 percent of all State \ncosts plus an interest rate equal to the market rate on 3-month \nTreasury Securities plus 0.1 percent.\n  Directs the Secretary of HHS to recover overpayments by states to \nprivate prescription drug plans and return that money to the Medicare \nTrust Fund.\n  This is not just about access to the Federal entitlement program--\nit's about life and death.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this \nlegislation and move for its immediate passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 2181\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare State Reimbursement \n     Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FEDERAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR STATE PRESCRIPTION DRUG \n                   EXPENDITURES FOR COVERED PART D DRUGS FOR \n                   MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES.\n\n       Section 1935(c) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1396v(c)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1)(A), by striking ``Each of the 50 \n     States'' and inserting ``Subject to paragraph (7), each of \n     the 50 States''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(7) Offset for state prescription drug expenditures for \n     covered part d drugs for medicare beneficiaries.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The amount of payment for a month \n     (beginning with January 2006) under paragraph (1) shall be \n     reduced by an amount equal to the sum of--\n       ``(i) the amount (as documented by the State) that the \n     State expended during the month for payment for covered part \n     D drugs for part D eligible individuals who are enrolled in a \n     prescription drug plan under part D of title XVIII but were \n     unable to access on a timely basis prescription drug benefits \n     to which they were entitled under such plan; and\n       ``(ii) interest on such amount (for the period beginning on \n     the day after the date on which an expenditure described in \n     subparagraph (A) is made and ending on the date on which \n     payment is made under paragraph (1)) at a rate equal to the \n     weighted average of interest on 3-month marketable Treasury \n     securities determined for such period, increased by 0.1 \n     percentage point.\n       ``(B) Recovery of reduced payment from prescription drug \n     plans.--The Secretary shall provide for recovery of payment \n     reductions made under subparagraph (A) from those \n     prescription drug plans under part D of title XVIII or MA-PD \n     plans under part C of such title that would otherwise be \n     responsible for the expenditures described in subparagraph \n     (A)(i). Any such amounts recovered shall be deposited into \n     the Medicare Prescription Drug Account in the Federal \n     Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund.''.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator \nLautenberg today to introduce urgent legislation to assist the many \nStates which have stepped forward to provide an essential safety net to \nour Medicare Part D beneficiaries. Our States have acted as ``payers of \nlast resort''--as beneficiaries faced unaffordable costs when errors in \nimplementing their coverage denied them access to vital medications. \nThe Medicare State Reimbursement Act will reimburse our States for \ntheir costs in assuring that millions receive their medications. So \nmany of our colleagues have recognized the crisis which was averted--\nSenators Coleman, Schumer, DeWine, Feinstein, Collins, Jeffords and \nmany more have joined us in this bipartisan effort to support the \nStates in the vital role they have played in countering a deficit of \naction by the Federal bureaucracy.\n  The introduction of the prescription drug benefit is a landmark step \nin the progress of Medicare. This benefit will save the average senior \nabout $1,000 per year. This is the relief that millions have needed for \nso long. It must eliminate the terrible choices so many have had to \nmake between vital medications and the other essentials of life--not \ncreate new dilemmas.\n  As we worked to ensure a prescription drug benefit, many of us worked \nhard to assure special help to those with the most limited resources. \nWe enacted a benefit which provided additional help for those on \nlimited incomes, including millions who rely on both Medicare and \nMedicaid--our ``dual eligibles''. It was essential that these \nindividuals would see uninterrupted coverage of their essential \nmedications. So we needed to ensure each would be enrolled in a drug \nplan. To do this, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, \nrandomly assigned each of them to a plan. In a program based on \ncompetition--based on choices--plans are going to differ. To find the \nbest plan, one must make an educated choice, not a random assignment.\n  So the result of random assignment was predictable. Many \nbeneficiaries wound up in plans which did not cover their drugs. My \nState of Maine immediately stepped forward to work to assure that every \nbeneficiary was matched with the plan which best met their needs. As \nplans were reviewed, my State found a third of those reviewed--15,000 \nbeneficiaries--were not enrolled in the most appropriate drug plan. \nGetting each into the plan that met their medication requirements was \nessential to meeting their needs.\n  Despite these best efforts to improve the situation, some \nbeneficiaries were not in a plan at all, while others were in plans \nwhich seemed not to understand that every beneficiary was to be allowed \na refill of their existing medications. So as beneficiaries came to \ntheir local pharmacies to get prescription refills, many faced great \nobstacles in getting the drugs they needed. We had heard of some \nproblems in validating enrollment eligibility, but at year end, these \njust became worse, and we found beneficiaries were not properly \nenrolled, plans were not giving the proper transition refills, and co-\npayments charged were often excessive. As individual faced co-payments \nof $100 or more--instead of the $5 or less they should have been \ncharged--many simply couldn't afford their medications. Thankfully, our \nStates have stepped in to make sure low income seniors received their \nmedications. In Maine alone, approximately $5 million in assistance has \nbeen given to ensure medications are dispensed.\n  This drug benefit must increase access, not make it more difficult. I \nam appalled, that with all the technology we have, so many have faced \nsuch difficulties in the implementation of this benefit. I salute the \nforbearance of our pharmacies, as they strived to meet essential needs, \nand the efforts of my State and others which have assured that these \nmost vulnerable Americans not suffer from the failures of either the \nFederal bureaucracy or the plan administrators.\n  So what this legislation does is simple. It authorizes CMS to \nreimburse the States their costs which they paid for providing \nmedications to those who did not receive the benefits to which they \nwere entitled. It does this by a simple mechanism: an adjustment in the \n``claw back'' payments which States make as their contribution for \ntheir dual eligibles. Accordingly, CMS is authorized to collect those \nfunds from those who were obligated to serve our beneficiaries--the \ndrug plans and managed care plans which deliver the drug benefit.\n  It has been confirmed that CMS does not presently have this \nauthority, and it simply is not acceptable to propose that CMS will \nsimply help the States collect from the plans. It was CMS which \napproved the plans, and it is CMS which administers Part D. They are in \nthe best position to assure plan compliance.\n  I look forward to prompt consideration of this legislation, and look \nforward to continuing work with my colleagues to assure that the \nMedicare drug benefit meets the needs of all our beneficiaries, and \nthat none of our most vulnerable citizens should suffer from such \nadministrative failures as we have seen here.\n  I call on my colleagues to join us in assuring our States are justly \ncompensated.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators \nLautenberg, Snowe, Schumer, Coleman and many others to introduce \nlegislation to reimburse States for prescription drug expenses they \nhave incurred for their residents who are dually eligible for Medicare \nand Medicaid. States have had no other option but to step in and ensure \nseniors can still get their drugs because the implementation of the new \nMedicare drug benefit has been so poorly handled by the Bush \nadministration.\n  The faulty implementation of the new drug benefit has caused a major\n\n[[Page S25]]\n\nhealth emergency in California and States across the country, \nparticularly for seniors with chronic and debilitating diseases who \nrely on multiple medications every day to keep them alive.\n  It is incomprehensible to me that with all the money and time given \nto the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, to implement \nthis new drug benefit, stories emerge every day of seniors and disabled \nindividuals being hospitalized because they are being told they have to \npay hundreds of dollars for their medications which they cannot afford \nand thus don't take.\n  Because of severe glitches in the database run by CMS, these \nindividuals are leaving pharmacies without their medications or are \nmaking undue sacrifices to pay for costs they should not have incurred \nin the first place.\n  So far, more than 24 States and the District of Columbia have stepped \nin to say they will cover the cost of prescription drugs for their \nresidents who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid and who \ncannot access lifesaving and life sustaining drugs as a result of \nFederal incompetence.\n  Earlier this week, the Governor of California and California's State \nlegislative leaders announced a plan to make $150 million available for \n30 days to cover drug costs for dual eligible individuals who have \nfallen through the system. In California, these individuals account for \nmore than 1 million of the State's 4 million total Medicare recipients.\n  Problems with the Bush administration's implementation of the drug \nbenefit have cost California $5.5 million to fill 63,000 prescriptions, \nas of January 18. I have no doubt these costs are just the beginning.\n  Unless these significant implementation errors are fixed immediately, \nthe new drug benefit amounts to a massive unfunded mandate. The Bush \nadministration must reimburse States, in full, for the drug costs they \nhave absorbed as a result of major implementation errors that occurred \non their watch.\n  The legislation I am introducing today with Senators Lautenberg, \nSnowe, Schumer and Coleman will ensure that States are repaid in full \nby the Federal Government for all costs associated with prescription \ndrugs for dual eligible individuals. The States did not create the \ncrisis felt by our Nation's poorest and most vulnerable seniors and \ndisabled and the States should not be responsible for costs associated \nwith a Federal program that was intended to provide these individuals \nwith comprehensive prescription drug coverage at little or no cost.\n  It is simply unacceptable for the Bush administration to tell States \nand the Congress not to worry because the private health insurance \nplans will reimburse States for the costs they've incurred. States \nshould not be made to wait to be reimbursed because of implementation \nfoul-ups caused by CMS.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Reid) Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Schumer, \n        Mr. Pryor, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Harkin, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mr. Johnson, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Lieberman, \n        Mr. Kohl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Sarbanes, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 2183.

Res. 349\n\n       Whereas the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \n     reported in November 2003 that Iran had been developing an \n     undeclared nuclear enrichment program for 18 years and had \n     covertly imported nuclear material and equipment, carried out \n     over 110 unreported experiments to produce uranium metal, \n     separated plutonium, and concealed many other aspects of its \n     nuclear facilities;\n       Whereas, in November 2004, the Governments of the United \n     Kingdom, France, and Germany entered into an agreement with \n     Iran on Iran's nuclear program (commonly known as the ``Paris \n     Agreement''), successfully securing a commitment from the \n     Government of Iran to voluntarily suspend uranium enrichment \n     operations in exchange for discussions on economic, \n     technological, political, and security issues;\n       Whereas Article XII.C of the Statute of the IAEA requires \n     the IAEA Board of Governors to report the noncompliance of \n     any member of the IAEA with its IAEA obligations to all \n     members and to the Security Council and General Assembly of \n     the United Nations;\n       Whereas Article III.B-4 of the Statute of the IAEA \n     specifies that ``if in connection with the activities of the \n     Agency there should arise questions that are within the \n     competence of the Security Council, the Agency shall notify \n     the Security Council, as the organ bearing the main \n     responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and \n     security'';\n       Whereas, in September 2005, the IAEA Board of Governors \n     adopted a resolution declaring that Iran's many failures and \n     breaches constitute noncompliance in the context of Article \n     XII.C of the Statute of the IAEA;\n       Whereas, on January 3, 2006, the Government of Iran \n     announced that it planned to restart its nuclear research \n     efforts in direct violation of the Paris Agreement;\n       Whereas, in January 2006, Iranian officials, in the \n     presence of IAEA inspectors, began to remove United Nations \n     seals from the enrichment facility in Natanz, Iran;\n\n[[Page S28]]\n\n       Whereas Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom Jack Straw \n     warned Iranian officials that they were ``pushing their \n     luck'' by removing the United Nations seals that were placed \n     on the Natanz facility by the IAEA 2 years earlier;\n       Whereas President of France Jacques Chirac said that the \n     Governments of Iran and North Korea risk making a ``serious \n     error'' by pursuing nuclear activities in defiance of \n     international agreements;\n       Whereas Foreign Minister of Germany Frank-Walter Steinmeier \n     said that the Government of Iran had ``crossed lines which it \n     knew would not remain without consequences'';\n       Whereas Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice stated, ``It is \n     obvious that if Iran cannot be brought to live up to its \n     international obligations, in fact, the IAEA Statute would \n     indicate that Iran would have to be referred to the U.N. \n     Security Council.'';\n       Whereas President of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stated, ``The \n     Iranian government and nation has no fear of the Western \n     ballyhoo and will continue its nuclear programs with \n     decisiveness and wisdom.'';\n       Whereas the United States has joined with the Governments \n     of Britain, France, and Germany in calling for a meeting of \n     the IAEA to discuss Iran's non-compliance with its IAEA \n     obligations;\n       Whereas President Ahmadinejad has stated that Israel should \n     be ``wiped off the map'';

which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 350\n\n       Whereas the Bill of Rights to the United States \n     Constitution was ratified 214 years ago;\n       Whereas the Fourth Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution guarantees to the American people the right ``to \n     be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, \n     against unreasonable searches and seizures'';\n       Whereas the Fourth Amendment provides that courts shall \n     issue ``warrants'' to authorize searches and seizures, based \n     upon probable cause;\n       Whereas the United States Supreme Court has consistently \n     held for nearly 40 years that the monitoring and recording of \n     private conversations constitutes a ``search and seizure'' \n     within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment;\n       Whereas Congress was concerned about the United States \n     Government unconstitutionally spying on Americans in the \n     1960s and 1970s;\n       Whereas Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), commonly \n     referred to as ``FISA'', to provide a legal mechanism for the \n     United States Government to engage in searches of Americans \n     in connection with intelligence gathering and \n     counterintelligence;\n       Whereas Congress expressly enacted the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978, and specified provisions of the \n     Federal criminal code (including those governing wiretaps for \n     criminal investigations), as the ``exclusive means by which \n     domestic electronic surveillance . . . may be conducted'' \n     pursuant to law (18 U.S.C. 2511(2)(f));\n       Whereas the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 \n     establishes the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \n     (commonly referred to as the ``FISA court''), and the \n     procedures by which the United States Government may obtain a \n     court order authorizing electronic surveillance (commonly \n     referred to as a ``FISA warrant'') for foreign intelligence \n     collection in the United States;\n       Whereas Congress created the FISA court to review \n     wiretapping applications for domestic electronic surveillance \n     to be conducted by any Federal agency;\n       Whereas the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 \n     provides specific exceptions that allow the President to \n     authorize warrantless electronic surveillance for foreign \n     intelligence purposes (1) in emergency situations, provided \n     an application for judicial approval from a FISA court is \n     made within 72 hours; and (2) within 15 calendar days \n     following a declaration of war by Congress;\n       Whereas the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 \n     makes criminal any electronic surveillance not authorized by \n     statute;\n       Whereas the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 \n     has been amended over time by Congress since the September \n     11, 2001, attacks on the United States;\n       Whereas President George W.

Mr. President, today I am submitting this resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that the Authorization for Use of \nMilitary Force, which Congress passed to authorize military action \nagainst those responsible for the attacks on September 11, 2001, did \nnot authorize warrantless eavesdropping on American citizens.\n  As Justice O'Connor underscored recently, even war ``is not a blank \ncheck for the President when it comes to the rights of the Nation's \ncitizens.''\n  Now that the illegal spying of Americans has become public and the \nPresident has acknowledged the 4-year-old program, the Bush \nadministration's lawyers are contending that Congress authorized it. \nThe September 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force did no such \nthing. Republican Senators also know it and a few have said so \npublicly. We all know it. The liberties and rights that define us as \nAmericans and the system of checks and balances that serve to preserve \nthem should not be sacrificed to threats of terrorism or to the \nexpanding power of the government. In the days immediately following \nthose attacks, I said, and I continue to believe, that the terrorists \nwin if they frighten us into sacrificing our freedoms and what defines \nus as Americans.\n  I well remember the days immediately after the 9/11 attacks. I helped \nopen the Senate to business the next day. I said then, on September 12, \n2001:\n\n       ``If we abandon our democracy to battle them, they win. . . \n     . We will maintain our democracy, and with justice, we will \n     use our strength. We will not lose our commitment to the rule \n     of law, no matter how much the provocation, because that rule \n     of law has protected us throughout the centuries. It has \n     created our democracy. It has made us what we are in history. \n     We are a just and good Nation.''\n\n  I joined with others, Republican and Democrats, and we engaged in \nround-the-clock efforts over the next months in connection with what \ncame to be the USA PATRIOT Act. During those days the Bush \nadministration never asked us for this surveillance authority or to \namend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to accommodate such a \nprogram.\n  Just as we cannot allow ourselves to be lulled into a sense of false \ncomfort when it comes to our national security, we cannot allow \nourselves to be lulled into a blind trust regarding our freedoms and \nrights. The Framers built checks and balances into our system \nspecifically to counter such abuses and undue assertions of power. We \nmust remain vigilant on all fronts or we stand to lose these rights \nforever. Once lost or eroded, liberty is difficult if not impossible to \nrestore. The Bush administration's after-the-fact claims about the \nbreadth of the Authorization to Use Military Force--as recently as this \nweek, in a document prepared at the White House's behest by the \nDepartment of Justice--are the latest in a long line of manipulations \nof the law.\n\n[[Page S29]]\n\nWe have also seen this type of overreaching in that same Justice \nDepartment office's twisted interpretation of the torture statute, an \nanalysis that had to be withdrawn; with the detention of suspects \nwithout charges and denial of access to counsel; and with the \nmisapplication of the material witness statute as a sort of general \npreventive detention law. Such abuses serve to harm our national \nsecurity as well as our civil liberties.\n\n  In addition, the press reports that the Pentagon maintains secret \ndatabases containing information on a wide cross-section of ordinary \nAmericans, and that the FBI is monitoring law-abiding citizens in the \nexercise of their First Amendment freedoms. When I worked with Senator \nWyden and others in 2003 to stop Admiral Poindexter's Total Information \nAwareness program, an effort designed to datamine information on \nAmericans--and we meant it. And when I added a reporting requirement on \nCarnivore, the FBI's\ne-mail monitoring program, to the Department of Justice Authorizations \nlaw in 2002, we meant it. We demanded that Congress be kept informed \nand that any such program not proceed without congressional \nauthorization.\n  The New York Times reported that after September 11, 2001, when \nformer Attorney General John Ashcroft loosened restrictions on the FBI \nto permit it to monitor Web sites, mosques, and other public entities, \n``the FBI has used that authority to investigate not only groups with \nsuspected ties to foreign terrorists, but also protest groups suspected \nof having links to violent or disruptive activities.'' When I learned \nof such efforts and that they reportedly included monitoring Quakers in \nFlorida and possibly Vermont, I wrote to the Secretary of Defense \ndemanding an answer. That was a month ago. So far he has refused to \nprovide that answer.\n  Now we have learned that President Bush has, for more than four \nyears, secretly allowed the warrantless wiretapping of Americans inside \nthe United States. And we read in the press that sources at the FBI say \nthat much of what was forwarded to them to investigate was worthless \nand led to dead ends. That is a dangerous diversion of our \ninvestigative resources away from those who pose real threats, while \nprecious time and effort is devoted to looking into the lives of law-\nabiding Americans.\n  The United States Supreme Court has consistently held for nearly 40 \nyears, since its landmark decision in Katz v. United States, that the \nmonitoring and recording of private conversations constitutes a \n``search and seizure'' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. \nCongress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, \nFISA, to provide a legal mechanism for the government to engage in \nelectronic surveillance of Americans in connection with intelligence \ngathering. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, along with the \ncriminal wiretap authority in title 18 of the United States Code, \ntogether provide the exclusive means by which the Government may \nintercept domestic electronic communications pursuant to the rule of \nlaw.\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has been amended over time, \nand it has been adjusted several times since the 9/11 attacks. Indeed, \nmuch of the PATRIOT Act was devoted to modifying FISA to make it easier \nto obtain FISA warrants. But the PATRIOT Act did not amend FISA to give \nthe Government the authority to conduct warrantless surveillance of \nAmerican citizens.\n\n  If the Bush administration believed that the law was inadequate to \ndeal with the threat of terrorism within our boundaries, it should have \ncome to Congress and sought to change the law. It did not. Indeed, \nAttorney General Gonzales admitted at a press conference on December \n19, 2005, that the Administration did not seek to amend FISA to \nauthorize the NSA spying program because it was advised that ``it was \nnot something we could likely get.''\n  I chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2001 and 2002, when the \nPresident's secret eavesdropping program apparently began. I was not \ninformed of the program. I learned about it for the first time in the \npress last month. I thank heaven and the Constitution that we still \nhave a free press.\n  The Bush administration is now arguing that when Congress authorized \nthe use of force in September 2001 to attack al Qaeda in Afghanistan, \nit authorized warrantless searches and eavesdropping on American \ncitizens. I voted for that authorization, and I know that Congress did \nnot sign a blank check. The notion that Congress authorized warrantless \nsurveillance in the AUMF is utterly inconsistent with the Attorney \nGeneral's admission that Congress was not asked for such authorization \nbecause it was assumed that Congress would say no.\n  Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, who helped negotiate the \nuse of force resolution with the White House, has confirmed that the \nsubject of warrantless wiretaps of American citizens never came up, \nthat he did not and never would have supported giving authority to the \nPresident for such wiretaps, and that he is ``confident that the 98 \nsenators who voted in favor of authorization of force against al Qaeda \ndid not believe that they were also voting for warrantless domestic \nsurveillance.''\n  Senator Daschle also noted that the Bush administration sought to add \nlanguage to the resolution that would have explicitly authorized the \nuse of force ``in the United States,'' but Congress refused to grant \nthe President such sweeping power. Maybe that was this Administration's \ncovert way to seek the authority to spy on Americans, but Congress did \nnot grant any such authority.\n  Spying on Americans without first obtaining the requisite warrants is \nillegal, unnecessary and wrong. No President can simply declare when he \nwishes to follow the law and when he chooses not to, especially when it \ncomes to the hard-won rights of the American people.\n  The resolution I submit today is intended to help set the record \nstraight. It is an important first step toward restoring checks and \nbalances between the co-equal branches of government. I urge all \nSenators to support it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, what is past is prologue. Today, we see \nhistory repeating itself. In 1978, President Carter signed into law the \n``Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act,'' successfully concluding \nyears of debate on the power of the President to conduct national \nsecurity wiretapping.\n  As a result of lengthy hearings and consultation, Congress enacted \nthat law with broad bipartisan support. Its purpose was clear--to put a \ncheck on the power of the President to use wiretaps in the name of \nnational security. One of the clear purposes of that law was to require \nthe government to obtain a judicial warrant for all electronic \nsurveillance in the United States in which communications of U.S. \ncitizens might be intercepted. The Act established a secret court, the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court, to review wiretapping \napplications and guarantee that any such electronic surveillance \nfollowed the rule of law. Since 1979, the special court has approved \nnearly 19,000 applications and denied only 4. Last year, the \nAdministration reached an all-time-high with the number of applications \ngranted.\n  In the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Congress established \nthe exclusive means by which electronic surveillance could be conducted \nin the United States for national security purposes. One of the \nprincipal goals of the legislation was to ensure that information \nobtained from illegal wiretaps could not be used to obtain a warrant \nfrom the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. We even made sure \nthat there would be criminal penalties for anyone who failed to comply \nwith these rules.\n  The PATRIOT Act did not give the President the authority to spy on \nanyone without impartial judicial review--and neither did the Joint \nResolution, enacted in 2001, authorizing the use of force against those \nresponsible for the attacks of September 11th.\n  The President seemed to agree. In 2004, in Buffalo he stated \ncategorically that ``any time that you hear the United States talking \nabout a wiretap, it requires a court order.'' He said that ``Nothing \nhad changed--when we're talking about chasing down terrorists, we're \ntalking about getting a court order before we do so.''\n  Now, however, the President and the administration claim they do not \nhave to comply with the law. Just yesterday, the administration again \nasserted\n\n[[Page S30]]\n\nits constitutional authority to eavesdrop on any person within the \nUnited States--without judicial or legislative oversight and it claims \nthat the Congress implicitly granted such power in the Joint Resolution \nof 2001.\n  But that Joint Resolution says nothing about domestic electronic \nsurveillance. As Justice O'Connor has said, ``A state of war is not a \nblank check for the president when it comes to the rights of the \nnation's citizens.''\n  The bipartisan 9/11 Commission made clear that the Executive Branch \nhas the burden of proof to justify why a particular governmental power \nshould be retained--and Congress has the responsibility to see that \nadequate guidelines and oversight are made available.\n  The Executive Branch has failed to meet the 9/11 Commissioners' \nburden of proof. The American people are not convinced that these \nsurveillance methods achieve the right balance between our national \nsecurity and protection of our civil liberties.\n  These issues go to the heart of what it means to have a free society. \nIf President Bush can make his own rules for domestic surveillance, Big \nBrother has run amok. If the President believes that winning the war on \nterror requires new surveillance capabilities, he has a responsibility \nto work with Congress to make appropriate changes in existing law. He \nis not above the law.\n  Congress and the American people deserve full and honest answers \nabout the Administration's domestic electronic surveillance activities. \nOn December 22, 2005, I asked the President to provide us with answers \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee began hearings on Judge Alito's \nnomination to the Supreme Court. We got no response. The Senate \nJudiciary Committee is scheduled to begin separate hearings on February \n6 on the President's actions. Instead of providing us with the \ndocuments the Administration relied upon, the Justice Department \ncontinues to circulate summaries and ``white papers'' on the legal \nauthorities it purports to have to ignore the law. It now appears that \nthe President did so on at least thirty occasions after September 11. \nThere is no legitimate purpose in denying access by Members of Congress \nto all of the legal thought and analysis that the President relied upon \nwhen he authorized these activities.\n  Every 45 days, the President ordered these activities to be reviewed \nby the Attorney General, the White House Counsel and the Inspector \nGeneral of the National Security Agency. That's not good enough. These \nare all executive branch appointees who report directly to the \nPresident.\n  Congress spent seven years considering and enacting the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act. It was not a hastily conceived idea. We \nhad broad agreement that both Congressional oversight and judicial \noversight were fundamental--even during emergencies or times of war, \nwhich is why we established a secret court to expedite the review of \nsensitive applications from the government.\n  Now, the administration has made a unilateral decision that \nCongressional and judicial oversight can be discarded, in spite of what \nthe law obviously requires. We need a thorough investigation of these \nactivities. Congress and the American people deserve answers, and they \ndeserve answers now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/20/senate-section/article/S30-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S30-S31]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 351--RESPONDING TO THE THREAT POSED BY IRAN'S NUCLEAR \n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. BAYH submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 351\n\n       Whereas Iran is precipitating a grave nuclear crisis with \n     the international community that directly impacts the \n     national security of the United States and the efficacy of \n     the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Treaty \n     on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at \n     Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into \n     force March 5, 1970 (commonly referred to as the ``Nuclear \n     Non-Proliferation Treaty'');\n       Whereas the United States welcomes a diplomatic solution to \n     the nuclear crisis, but the Government of Iran continues to \n     reject a peaceful resolution to the matter;\n       Whereas, although the Government of Iran agreed to suspend \n     uranium enrichment activities and to sign and ratify the \n     IAEA's Additional Protocol on expansive, intrusive no-notice \n     inspections in 2003, it has repeatedly failed to live up to \n     its obligations under this agreement;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran broke IAEA seals on some \n     centrifuges in September 2004, converted uranium to a gas \n     needed for enrichment in May 2005, limited IAEA inspectors to \n     a few sites, and said it would restart uranium conversion \n     activities;\n       Whereas the Board of Governors of the IAEA declared in \n     September 2005 that Iran was in non-compliance of its Nuclear \n     Non-Proliferation Treaty obligations;\n       Whereas Iran announced on January 3, 2006, that it would \n     resume uranium ``research'' activities at Natanz and invited \n     IAEA to witness the breaking of IAEA seals at the facility;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has acknowledged deceiving \n     the IAEA for the past 18 years for not disclosing an uranium \n     enrichment facility in Natanz and a heavy water production \n     plant in Arak;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran's human rights practices and \n     strict limits on democracy have been consistently criticized \n     by United Nations reports;\n       Whereas the Department of State stated in its most recent \n     Country Reports on Human Rights Practices that Iran's already \n     poor human rights record ``worsened'' during the previous \n     year and deemed Iran a country ``of particular concern'' in \n     its most recent International Religious Freedom Report;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran funds terror and \n     rejectionist groups in Gaza and the West Bank, Lebanon, Iraq, \n     and Afghanistan and is providing material support to groups \n     directly involved in the killing of United States citizens;\n       Whereas Iran has been designated by the United States as a \n     state sponsor of terrorism since 1984, and the Department of \n     State said in its most recent Country Reports on Terrorism \n     that Iran ``remained the most active state sponsor of \n     terrorism in 2004'';\n       Whereas President of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has made \n     repeated anti-American and anti-semitic statements, including \n     denying the occurrence of the Holocaust and Israel's right to \n     exist, and called on people to imagine a world without the \n     United States;\n       Whereas Iran's recent acquisition of new anti-ship \n     capabilities to block the Strait of Hormuz at the entrance to \n     the Persian Gulf and the decision by the Government of Russia \n     to sell the Government of Iran $1,000,000,000 in weapons, \n     mostly for 29 antiaircraft missile systems, is most \n     regrettable and should dampen United States-Russian \n     relations;\n       Whereas the behavior of the Government of Iran does not \n     reflect that country's rich history and the democratic \n     aspirations of most people in Iran;\n       Whereas the people of the United States stand with the \n     people of Iran in support of democracy, the rule of law, \n     religious freedom, and regional and global stability;\n       Whereas, although Iran is subject to a range of unilateral \n     sanctions and some third country and foreign entities \n     sanctions, these sanctions have not been fully implemented;\n       Whereas Iran remains vulnerable to international sanctions, \n     especially with respect to financial services and foreign \n     investment in its petroleum sector and oil sales, few foreign \n     nations have joined the United States in attempting to \n     isolate the regime in Iran and compel compliance with Iran's \n     international obligations;\n       Whereas, although Iran may be one of the world's largest \n     exporters of oil, it does not have the refining capacity to \n     make the gasoline necessary to make its economy run and \n     currently imports 40 percent of its refined gasoline from \n     abroad;\n       Whereas more complete implementation of United States \n     sanctions laws and the adoption of additional statutes would \n     improve the chances of a diplomatic solution to the nuclear \n     crisis with Iran;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush has for 4 years given too \n     little attention to the growing nuclear problem in Iran \n     beyond rhetorical sound bites and has carried out an Iran \n     policy consisting of loud denunciations followed by minimal \n     action and ultimate deference of managing the crisis to \n     Europe, a policy that has been riddled with contradiction and \n     inconsistency and damaging to United States national \n     security;\n       Whereas, had President Bush effectively marshaled world \n     opinion in 2002 and not wasted valuable time, diverted \n     resources, and ignored the problem in Iran, the United States \n     would not be faced with the full extent of the current \n     nuclear crisis in Iran;\n       Whereas action now is imperative and time is of the \n     essence; and\n       Whereas the opportunity the United States has to avoid the \n     choice between military action and a nuclear Iran may be \n     measured only in months: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States should cut assistance to countries \n     whose companies are investing in Iran's energy sector, \n     including pipelines to export Iranian crude;\n       (2) supplies of refined gasoline to Iran should be cut off;\n       (3) there should be a worldwide, comprehensive ban on sales \n     of weapons to Iran, including from Russia and China;\n       (4) the United Nations Security Council should impose an \n     intrusive IAEA-led weapons of mass destruction inspection \n     regime on Iran similar to that imposed on Iraq after the 1991 \n     Persian Gulf war;\n\n[[Page S31]]\n\n       (5) the United Nations Security Council should adopt \n     reductions in diplomatic exchanges with Iran, limit travel by \n     some Iranian officials, and limit or ban sports or cultural \n     exchanges with Iran;\n       (6) the President should more faithfully implement the Iran \n     and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note) \n     (commonly known as ``ILSA''), and Congress should--\n       (A) increase the requirements on the President to justify \n     waiving ILSA-related sanctions;\n       (B) repeal the sunset provision of ILSA;\n       (C) set a 90-day time limit for the President to determine \n     whether an investment constitutes a violation of ILSA; and\n       (D) make exports to Iran of technology related to weapons \n     of mass destruction sanctionable under ILSA;\n       (7) the United States should withdraw its support for \n     Iran's accession to the WTO until Iran meets weapons of mass \n     destruction, human rights, terrorism, and regional stability \n     standards; and\n       (8) the United States must make the Government of Iran \n     understand that if its nuclear activity continues it will be \n     treated as a pariah state.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/20/senate-section/article/S31-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S31]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 76--CONDEMNING THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN FOR \n   ITS FLAGRANT VIOLATIONS OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE NUCLEAR NON-\n PROLIFERATION TREATY, AND CALLING FOR CERTAIN ACTIONS IN RESPONSE TO \n                            SUCH VIOLATIONS\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Allen, Mr. \nDeWine, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Nelson of Florida, \nand Mrs. Feinstein) submitted the following concurrent resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 76\n\n       Whereas the Government of Iran concealed a nuclear program \n     from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the \n     international community for nearly two decades until it was \n     revealed in 2002;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has repeatedly deceived the \n     IAEA about a variety of nuclear-related activities, including \n     uranium enrichment and laboratory-scale separation of \n     plutonium;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran recently removed IAEA seals \n     from a uranium enrichment facility at Natanz and announced \n     the resumption of ``research'' on nuclear fuel in a brazen \n     affront to the international community;\n       Whereas members of the international community have agreed \n     that the pursuit of uranium enrichment capabilities comprises \n     a ``red line'' for United Nations Security Council referral \n     that has now been unequivocally crossed by Iran;\n       Whereas this provocation represents only the latest action \n     by the Government of Iran in a long pattern of intransigence \n     relating to its nuclear program, including its violation of \n     an October 2003 agreement with the United Kingdom, Germany, \n     and France (the ``EU-3'') only months after the agreement was \n     signed, its unilateral violation of the 2004 agreement with \n     the EU-3 to suspend its enrichment program (commonly known as \n     the ``Paris Agreement''), its failure to provide IAEA \n     inspectors access to various nuclear sites, and its refusal \n     to answer outstanding questions related to its nuclear \n     program;\n       Whereas the regime in Iran has made clear the nefarious \n     intentions behind its nuclear program in a series of \n     inflammatory and reprehensible statements, including calling \n     for Israel to be ``wiped off the map'' at a conference titled \n     ``A World without Zionism'' and asserting that the Holocaust \n     was a ``myth'' and that Israel should be transferred to \n     Europe;\n       Whereas previous activities of the regime, including the \n     sponsorship of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and \n     Islamic Jihad through the provision of funding, training, \n     weapons, and safe haven and the destabilization of \n     neighboring countries such as Iraq, Israel, and Lebanon, \n     indicate that a nuclear-armed Iran would pose an \n     unprecedented threat to the national security of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the Director General of the IAEA, Mohamed El \n     Baradei, has publicly stated that once the Government of Iran \n     perfects its capability to produce nuclear material and \n     completes a parallel weaponization program, it would be only \n     months away from building a nuclear bomb;\n       Whereas the Institute for Science and International \n     Security, a Washington, D.C., nonproliferation advocacy \n     group, released a January 2, 2006, satellite photograph \n     showing extensive new construction at the Natanz facility;\n       Whereas the IAEA Board of Governors passed a resolution on \n     September 24, 2005, indicating that Iran's noncompliance with \n     its IAEA obligations would result in the referral of Iran to \n     the United Nations Security Council under Article XII.C of \n     the Statute of the IAEA;\n       Whereas each member of the EU-3, the leading partner of the \n     United States in diplomatic efforts regarding Iran's nuclear \n     program, has publicly stated its intention to refer Iran to \n     the United Nations Security Council and called for an \n     ``extraordinary meeting'' of the IAEA Board of Governors on \n     February 2, 2006;\n       Whereas the Governments of China and Russia have expressed \n     agreement with the United States and the EU-3 that the \n     Government of Iran has violated its commitments to the IAEA;\n       Whereas China and Russia sit on the United Nations Security \n     Council, and their cooperation would be required to enact any \n     substantive Security Council measures against the Government \n     of Iran; and\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has demonstrated no interest \n     in Russia's offer to enrich Iran's uranium feedstock into \n     power plant fuel on Russian territory, further demonstrating \n     its aversion to compromise:\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) categorically condemns the Government of Iran for its \n     flagrant violations of its obligations under the Treaty on \n     the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, \n     London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into force March \n     5, 1970 (commonly referred to as the ``Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty'');\n       (2) calls for the immediate suspension of all uranium \n     enrichment activities of the Government of Iran;\n       (3) supports calls for an emergency meeting of the Board of \n     Governors of the IAEA for the purpose of immediately \n     referring Iran to the United Nations Security Council;\n       (4) calls on all nuclear suppliers to cease immediately \n     cooperation with Iran on nuclear materials, equipment, and \n     technology;
