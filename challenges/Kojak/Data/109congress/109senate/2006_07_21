Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to the consideration of S. 403, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 403) to amend title 18, United States Code, to \n     prohibit taking minors across State lines in circumvention of \n     laws requiring the involvement of parents in abortion \n     decisions.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Majority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a few minutes, we will begin \nconsideration of S. 403, the Child Custody Protection Act. Over the \nlast 2 days, we have been working on an agreement which would allow us \nto conclude that bill on Tuesday. I hope we will be able to work out \nthe final details of that agreement early today, and at that point in \ntime I will announce the schedule for the child custody protection bill \nfor next week.\n  We had a remarkable day yesterday, finishing last night the debate \nand vote on the voting rights reauthorization bill, four judges, the \nchild predator legislation, and therefore I announced no rollcall votes \nfor today. I will be updating Members as to Monday and Tuesday's \nschedules shortly, after we work out a unanimous-consent agreement on \nseveral matters for early next week.\n\n\n                         Senate Accomplishments\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in walking over here just a few moments \nago, I ran into my counterpart from the Australian Senate, and we were \ncommenting--or he was commenting--he said: You had a productive day \nyesterday. And I said: Indeed, we had a very productive day, not only \nyesterday but over the course of this week.\n  On Monday and Tuesday, we had a very important debate, a powerful \ndebate on stem cell research, a debate which is uncomfortable to a lot \nof people because it addresses so strongly that nexus between ethics \nand morality and religion and faith with science, advancing science, \nwhich is moving at breathtaking speed, thank goodness. As a scientist, \nI see great hope in those dreams which one day can become realities for \ncures and for treatments that come from the field of science. The \nissues are tough, though, but very important for us to have in this \nbody, representing the 280 million people\n\n[[Page S8096]]\n\naround the country, because science will continue to advance and we do \nhave the opportunities to understand the molecular and cellular basis \nof disease in a way that will improve the lives of everybody listening \nto me right now. So it is a very important debate.\n  We will increasingly have those sorts of issues come before this \nbody. It used to be that we would hit these tough ethical issues in \nscience about once every 10 years, and it has gotten down to about once \nevery 5 years, and I predict--again, this is good news because science \nis developing so quickly, medical science--that we will be debating \nthose issues about once every year. So this body needs to get used to \nit, get accustomed to it.\n  We did pass the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act overwhelmingly. The \nPresident has already signed that bill into law.\n\n  We passed the Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act this week, which \nsupports alternative--or alternate--ways of developing these very \npowerful embryonic stem cell-like cells, what we call pluripotential \ncells, to support the type of research that can derive those \npluripotential cells, short of having to dismember an embryo--exciting \nresearch. The House has not yet acted on that particular bill. I hope \nthey do so in the near future so that the President can sign it into \nlaw, so that we can further support our research dollars in what to me \nis very exciting research that, in many ways, if successful--and I \nbelieve it will be--will some day eliminate the more contentious debate \nof having to derive embryonic stem cells from blastocysts themselves.\n  We also passed the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, a bill I \nsupported. It was not unanimously supported in this body, but there was \noverwhelming support in this body. I feel strongly that this particular \nbill, which supports embryonic stem cell research for blastocysts that \nare going to be discarded with 100 percent certainty, clearly falls \nwithin certain moral and ethical guidelines, and that bill passed I \nthink by 63 votes in the Senate.\n  On Tuesday evening, we shifted a bit and expressed our support for \nIsrael by passing S. Res. 534 by unanimous consent, expressing strong \nsupport in this body for Israel. Hezbollah and Hamas are terrorist \norganizations, confirmed enemies of the United States, and it is \nimportant that they and their state sponsors realize we will stand with \nIsrael and hold them accountable for their actions. This body spoke \nloudly, boldly, clearly on Tuesday evening.\n  Later Tuesday evening and on Wednesday, we addressed the Water \nResources Development Act under the superb leadership of Chairman Jim \nInhofe and Senator Kit Bond and others in the body. But I told Chairman \nInhofe again and again that this bill, which I strongly support, which \nengages and further supports conservation and development of water and \nwater-related resources, which strengthens our Nation's waterways and \nthe infrastructure of our waterways, is going to be a tough bill. There \nare going to be too many amendments; it is going to take a long time on \nthe floor. But by working very hard in a bipartisan fashion, we limited \nthe number of amendments to the substantive ones and brought it to the \nfloor in a very reasonable, very efficient period of time, so we were \nable to address that important issue.\n  Then, as I mentioned earlier, yesterday we reauthorized the expiring \nprovisions of the Voting Rights Act. As we all talked about, we have \ncome a long way in 41 years since it was first enacted. We put aside \nwhatever partisan differences there might be to ensure that \ndiscrimination at the voting booth remains a relic of the past, to \nensure that no American citizen and no election law of any State could \ndeny access to the ballot box because of race or ethnicity or language \nminority status. We have ensured that progress continues, that we are \nprotecting the civil liberties of each and every American.\n  Protecting the vulnerable--that is what the Voting Rights Act did 41 \nyears ago, and that is what the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety \nAct will soon do. Last night, we passed that Adam Walsh bill as well. \nThis bill arguably is the most comprehensive child crime and protection \nlegislation in recent history.\n  The Adam Walsh bill establishes a national sex offender registry \nwhich is publicly available and which is searchable by ZIP Code. \nParents shouldn't have to live in fear that a neighbor somewhere down \nthe street is waiting for an opportunity to victimize their children. \nNow parents are going to have those tools they need to protect their \nchildren from harm.\n  Last night, late last night at about 11 o'clock, I received a phone \ncall from two individuals who have worked with Child Help, who started \nthis organization called Child Help, and their call was to congratulate \nthis body for addressing a specific issue that was also in the Adam \nWalsh bill, and that is the creation of a national child abuse \nregistry. The bill also toughens the penalties for crimes against \nchildren, and it cracks down on the growing crisis of Internet \npredators and child pornography--huge progress in passing this \nparticular bill. It will go to the House of Representatives in the \nearly part of next week, and I am very hopeful the President will be \nable to sign that bill by July 27, which is the very tragic anniversary \nof the death of Adam Walsh. But out of that tragedy, if the President \nsigns the bill on that day, there is great hope and a great willingness \nto address and confront an issue we know is destroying people's lives, \nwith effective tools to combat the tragedies that occur every day in \nthis country in a direct way.\n  Judicial nominations last night: We confirmed four exceptionally \nqualified nominees to the Federal bench: Neal Gorsuch, Bobby E. \nShephard, Daniel Porter Jordan III, and Gustavo Antonia Gelpi. Next \nweek, we are going to continue our constitutional duty of advice and \nconsent in nominations and take up Jerome Holmes for the Tenth Circuit.\n  Today as we open, we are beginning debate on legislation that \nprotects vulnerable young women from exploitation. It is the Child \nCustody Protection Act. This bill prohibits taking a minor across State \nlines, from State to State, for an abortion in circumvention of a \nparticular State law, and it does so by requiring parental notification \nfor that child's abortion.\n  Right now, the victims of such exploitation have absolutely no means \nof restitution within our legal system. It is time to fix that. Thus, \nwe are taking that bill to the floor to do just that. We will have that \ndebate over the course of the morning--we won't be able to complete \nthat debate today--and we will have some understanding here shortly in \nterms of how that debate will be conducted in the early part of next \nweek.\n  Next week is going to be a busy week. There will be a lot going on \nover the course of the week and many challenges in the weeks ahead. We \nhave to finish the Child Custody Protection Act next week, and we have \nto confirm the nomination of Jerome Holmes.\n  Last night, language was finalized on another very important issue; \nthat is, energy. I say energy is important because it has national \nsecurity implications, and it affects each individual in this body and \ntheir families and families all across America because it will impact \nover the long term the price of gas, the price of natural gas, and the \nprice of energy in this country. The issue is deep sea energy \nexploration in a region called Area 181 in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Americans are feeling the pain at the pump. They are feeling it each \nand every day. And they expect us to act. It is interesting that in \nthat area of 181 and just south of that in an area called 182 in the \nGulf of Mexico, there is estimated to be over 1.2 billion barrels of \noil--1.2 billion barrels of oil--that would be subjected potentially to \nexploration; 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in that area. That \nis how important it is to obtain that supply. We all know that pricing \nis a product of supply and demand and that new influx of homegrown, \ndomestic supply will have an impact.\n\n  Before the August recess, we need to take up the Department of \nDefense appropriations. We need to make sure that our troops overseas \ndo have the equipment and technology they need to be safe and \nsuccessful.\n  As all of our colleagues know, we are addressing, every day, \npensions. We will have that legislation ready before recess. We also \nneed to address the issues surrounding port security, to further secure \nour homeland, as well as\n\n[[Page S8097]]\n\nsmall business health plans, which also have a direct impact, similar \nto what we are doing in energy, in affecting the cost of living that \nsqueezes everyday Americans.\n  If we can lower those health care costs, make health care both \naffordable and available, that will take some of that squeeze off \nindividuals and their families and they will be able to benefit from \nwhat we know is a very productive, growing economy out there with over \n5.4 million jobs created in the last 2\\1/2\\ years and unemployment at \nhistorically low--4.6 percent--levels. The average American doesn't \nquite feel how good our economy is because of energy prices, which we \nare going to address, and because of health care costs, which we are \ngoing to address. Americans need to know they are safe and secure. They \nneed to know their futures are safe and that their health care is \naffordable and secure.\n  We have a lot of issues to address. Again, we have had a very \nproductive week. If we continue that productivity we will be able to \naddress those issues. It is our job in the Senate to deliver these \nmeaningful solutions to the challenges and the needs of people across \nthis country. It is our duty and our privilege to do just that, and I \nam confident, by continuing the progress we made this week, that we \nwill be able to do just that.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/21/senate-section/article/S8097-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8097-S8099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHILD CUSTODY PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am glad the majority leader has called \nup and allowed us to consider the Child Custody Protection Act today. I \nwas involved, in 1998, when then-Senator Spence Abraham, later \nSecretary of Energy Spence Abraham, offered this bill. We had a press \nconference and made a number of efforts to pass it and always had a \ngood deal of support but, frankly, to my frustration and surprise, it \nnever became law. It has, in every respect, strong support among the \nAmerican people and in the Congress.\n  I am pleased that Senator John Ensign of Nevada has taken up this \npiece of legislation. He has directed his considerable talents to \npressing it forward. We now have it on the floor. We will soon have a \nvote on it. I believe it should pass. I expect it to pass. I think \nthose who would object to it have a high burden to show what is \nunreasonable about the legislation that is before us today.\n  The Child Custody Protection Act deals with an important subject. It \ndeals with how young girls are being secretly taken across State lines \nfor the purpose of abortion, without the consent of their parents or \neven the knowledge of their parents, in violation of the laws of the \nState in which they live. Forty-five States have enacted some sort of \nparental consent laws or parental notification law. By simply secreting \na child across State lines, one can frustrate the State legislature's \nrules. It is, in fact, effectively subverting and defeating valid, \nconstitutionally approved rights parents have with regard to being \ninvolved in the health care of their children, emotionally and \nphysically. It is a very important issue, and I think it is one we need \nto continue to discuss.\n  This bill does not in any way deal substantively with abortion or the \nright to abortion. It does not really expand additional restrictions on \nabortion. What it does, though, is to stop an abominable practice by \nwhich someone--usually an adult, often an adult male who has gotten a \nyoung girl pregnant without wanting the parents to know about it--takes \nthem across a State line to some foreign jurisdiction to seek an \nabortion without the parents' involvement, an abortion that could not \nbe performed in their home State without the approval of the parent.\n  In fact, the abortion clinics in those States know that they must \nhave a parent's consent. They seek that consent. If they don't have it, \nthey don't perform the abortion--at least most of them don't. That is \nwhat the law is and that is what the situation is. But that is being \nsubverted by moving them across the State line.\n  I submit this is a commonsense proposal. It is consistent with \nFederal prohibitions on interstate transportation, in violation of law, \nand it is something we should act on now. It is past due, in fact.\n  I submit the American people care about this issue. It is something \nthat is important. And well they should because they love their \ndaughters. They care about them. They will be involved with them \nmedically, physically, and emotionally the rest of their lives. It \nwon't be some abortion clinic in some distant State that will be \ninvolved with their emotional problems, their psychological problems, \ntheir physical problems, which arise from having had an abortion. The \nparents are the ones who care about their child and have the \nresponsibility to raise her.\n  As we all know, a child cannot be given an aspirin in a school \nwithout parental consent. I have heard recently that you can't even \ngive them sunscreen, in some schools, without parental consent. So we \nhave this kind of legal procedure for a child's medical protection, but \nwe have a circumstance in which a valid parental consent for a very \nserious procedure such as an abortion can be conducted without parental \nconsent if you go across State lines and avoid the existing State law \nin the home State.\n  The Supreme Court, I hasten to add, has considered parental consent \nlaws. They have considered a number of those cases. Parental consent \nlaws have been enacted in many big States such as Pennsylvania and \nTexas. In Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Supreme Court of the United \nStates upheld consent laws and said they are valid restrictions on \nabortion. This is not too much of a restriction or an undue burden.\n  They also say that if somehow the parent is a problem--if there is a \nquestion of incest or child abuse or dysfunctional parents--there must \nbe a judicial procedure which allows a judge to bypass the parental \nconsent requirement of that State. So all the State laws in existence \nthat require parents to be notified have a judicial bypass option. If a \nchild does not believe they could tell their parents for whatever \nreason, they can go to a court and seek court approval without telling \nthat parent, if there is a real basis for it.\n  In fact, this legislation provides in unusual circumstances that \njudicial bypass would take place. It is responsible in that regard.\n  The ability of parents to be involved in the health of their children \nis a fundamental parental right. It is being undermined today--and we \nought to strengthen that right and that responsibility.\n  In fact, one of the great threats to our Nation is legal undermining \nof parental rights and parental abdication of responsibility for their \nchildren and how they develop. We need to strengthen families, we need \nto strengthen the responsibility of parents, and we need to protect \nchildren. We need better involvement of parents with their children.\n  Some say this is painful, if we required young people to tell their \nparents that they are pregnant. But I submit to you that out of that \npain can come healing, can come good decisions, can come a change in \nbehavior, a recognition that a child is in trouble and has problems, a \nrecognition by parents, perhaps, that they need to be more involved and \nmore engaged in their children's activities.\n  How is that bad? How is it bad that a child would be required to \nengage with their parents once they get in this kind of serious \ntrouble? We are talking about minor children, minor girls, often taken \nadvantage of by much older men.\n  I think it is the right thing to do. But regardless of that, \nregardless of how you feel about parental consent, it is State policy \nby State laws that have been passed in States throughout this Nation \nthat parents should be informed, and in some cases have consent. These \nconstitutional State laws are being undermined in a real way. I will \ntalk about that in a minute and show you some points on it. But it is a \nvery real problem. It is not imaginary.\n  Let's look at some of the advertisements, fliers, and brochures that \nare\n\n[[Page S8098]]\n\nbeing passed out around the country to promote interstate \ntransportation of minor children to promote abortion.\n  Here is one. Metropolitan Medical Associates is in New Jersey which \ndoes not have a parental consent law, but many States such as \nPennsylvania and others nearby do. Here is the flier:\n\n       We accept all insurance and credit cards.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       All calls and appointments are confidential. Parental \n     consent is not required.\n\n  They passed this out in the region to people in surrounding States \nwhich do have to have parental consent. The word gets out that they can \ncome and avoid that requirement.\n  I think that is unhealthy. I think that is an attempt to undermine \nthe laws of the States of this country.\n  Here is another one, South Jersey Women's Center. It mentions all of \ntheir promotions, their abortion procedures. I will highlight this \nphrase: ``No 24-hour wait. . . .''\n  In some States, it is required that you wait 24 hours after being \ninformed about the abortion procedures before you go forward. ``No 24-\nhour wait or parental consent required.''\n  That is in New Jersey.\n  Again, there is promotion in the other States to come into that State \nto obtain an abortion that would otherwise be illegal in the minor's \nhome State.\n  Here is an advertisement in, I believe, a Pennsylvania phone book. \nPennsylvania has a parental consent law. This one is from a clipping in \nBuffalo, NY. It is Planned Parenthood Women's Health Center. But they \nrun an ad in the Pennsylvania phone book for a Buffalo, NY, abortion \nclinic. It says: ``No parental consent or waiting period.''\n  We have many of those. There are lots of those. I just show these ads \nto show that we are not talking about a rare or insignificant event. \nThere is a studied policy to promote abortion in distant States where \nparental consent is not required to undermine existing law of the State \nwhere the child may have become pregnant.\n  The attorney for the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, Kathryn \nKolbert, stated:\n\n       There are thousands of minors who cross State lines for an \n     abortion every year and who need assistance from adults to do \n     that.\n\n  We see several examples of abortion clinics which openly place \nadvertisements in phone books and otherwise.\n  I chair the Administrative Oversight and the Courts Subcommittee of \nthe Judiciary Committee, and I chaired a hearing in June a couple of \nyears ago where we heard a number of stories that deal with this issue. \nOne particularly moving story involved a young woman named Crystal Lane \nwho exhibited a maturity beyond her years when she testified before the \ncommittee. When Crystal was just 13 years old, she was secretly \ntransported across the State line by adults seeking to hide the fact of \nher pregnancy from her mother. Crystal was taken across State lines \nfrom Pennsylvania, a State which had a consent statute, to New York, a \nState which did not. Crystal testified that she suffered serious \ncomplications from this ``legal'' abortion that was botched and which \nresulted in ``the most terrifying time'' in her life.\n  Crystal's mother, Mrs. Joyce Farley, testified that her daughter was \ntaken out of State for an abortion by one Rosa Marie Hartford.\n  Is this just a friend, Mrs. Hartford? Is this just a neighbor trying \nto take care of her? That is not really the pattern. Mrs. Hartford was \nactually the mother of a 19-year-old young man whose statutory rape of \nthe then-12-year-old girl caused the pregnancy. In other words, the \nwoman was trying to cover up the criminal activity of her son. The son \nlater pleaded guilty to statutory rape.\n  Thus, the clinics are openly encouraging evasion of State laws. The \nChild Custody Protection Act would shut those practices down.\n  The question of parental notification and consent is an important \none. The American people care about it.\n  I would like to show a chart which shows the depth of the feeling of \nthe American people on this issue, which has remained strong for a \ndecade or more. Just last year, in a Fox NEWS Dynamics Opinion Poll, \nthe question was:\n\n       Do you think a female under age 18 should be required by \n     State law to notify at least one parent or guardian before \n     having an abortion?\n\n  Seventy-eight percent said yes. Only 17 percent said no.\n  How about this one, a Quinnipiac University poll of just last year:\n\n       Do you favor or oppose requiring parental notification \n     before a minor could get an abortion?\n\n  Seventy-five percent say yes; eighteen percent say no.\n  How about this one, a CNN-USA Today poll conducted by Gallop:\n\n       Do you favor or oppose each of the following proposals? How \n     about a law requiring women under 18 to get parental consent \n     for any abortion?\n\n  You see how they changed that language a little bit; you would affect \nthe numbers a little bit. It did--73 to 24. But still three-fourths of \nthe people say a parent should know and consent before their minor \ndaughter can get an abortion.\n  How about this one. This is the Wirthlin Worldwide poll from several \nyears ago:\n\n       Do you favor or oppose requiring one parent of a girl who \n     is under the age of 18 years of age to be notified before an \n     abortion is performed on the girl?\n\n  Eighty-three percent to fifteen.\n  Here is another one, the Los Angeles Times:\n\n       Should girls under the age of 18 be required to get the \n     consent of at least one parent before having an abortion?\n\n  Eighty-two to twelve.\n  Here is CBS News-New York Times:\n\n       Would you favor or oppose requiring parental consent before \n     a girl under the age of 18 could have an abortion?\n\n  Seventy-eight to seventeen percent. That one was 1998, 8 years ago.\n  The numbers have been strong. They haven't gone down. They remain so. \nWhy? Because it is good policy.\n  For Heaven's sake, shouldn't a parent know if their child is having \nthis kind of medical procedure? I think so. Some may think that a 13-\nyear-old should just be allowed to be taken away by some 29-year-old, \nsome 40-year-old man to have an abortion to cover up his statutory \nrape. They may think that is good policy. I don't.\n  But I would just say this: This law that we are considering today, \nthe Child Custody Protection Act, really does not deal with that. It \nsimply says that if a State of this United States passes a law, and \nsomeone takes a child across State lines to avoid that law, they would \nbe implicated in a Federal violation. The Federal Government would \nsimply be affirming and supporting the States that choose to have a \nparental consent law. It does not make any new law. It does not set any \nparental consent standard. It does not put any new constraints on \nabortion. It simply says that if you try to avoid the State law, the \nFederal Government will be of assistance.\n  I think the statute is drafted in a good way. I was a Federal \nprosecutor for 15 years and very familiar with many of the questions \nthat come up with regard to prosecuting Federal cases. We have had some \nrecent federalism decisions by the Supreme Court. They basically raise \nconcerns that we in Congress have become too careless in how we draft \nlegislation by attempting to make criminal acts solely within a State \nthat have no interstate connection.\n  When I was a young prosecutor, some of the first cases I got to \nprosecute were automobile theft cases. But it is not automobile theft \nin Federal court, it is interstate transportation of a stolen motor \nvehicle. That is the crime--interstate transportation of that vehicle. \nIf you just stole a car in Alabama, and you caught the person in \nAlabama, they never crossed a State line, it is not a Federal crime. It \ncan only be prosecuted in Alabama.\n  The Supreme Court raised some concerns about that.\n  Theft from an interstate shipment is also a Federal crime. It is a \nFederal crime for people to steal from a railroad going through the \ncommunity, if it is an interstate shipment. But if you steal from a \nfarmer, and you don't get out of State with the produce, it is not a \nFederal crime. It is theft from interstate transportation of stolen \nproperty, ITSP. And that is a Federal offense.\n\n  So that is how this statute is written. This statute does not say we \nare going to micromanage what goes on within a State. What we are \nsaying is, if someone travels in interstate commerce--because the \nConstitution of the\n\n[[Page S8099]]\n\nUnited States provides that this Congress, this Federal Government, has \nthe authority to regulate interstate commerce--for the purpose of \navoiding a State law to help a minor child get an abortion without the \nknowledge of their loving parents, who are raising the child and will \nhave to raise them in the future, they are guilty a Federal offense.\n  I think that is perfectly sound constitutionally and something we \nshould do. It is past time we do it. I would urge my colleagues to \nconsider this. If there is one circumstance in which we should be most \nconcerned about abortion, it is that of the young lady I described who \ntestified at our hearing. Crystal Lane was impregnated and having sex \nwith an older man when she was 12 years of age, and had an abortion at \n13 years of age, and her parent did not know about it. How did it \nhappen? The young man's mother and young man got together and secreted \nher across State lines to have an abortion, so he would not be found \nout, so he would not be prosecuted for statutory rape. This was not \ndone out of any interest in the child's welfare.\n  That is a very real problem that should not continue. We have the \nability to do something about it. I urge my colleagues to study this \nact and to make sure we stop those who would usurp State law, usurp \nparental rights, and damage children without the knowledge of their \nparents.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Wyden are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. WYDEN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I support S. 403, the Child Custody \nProtection Act. This bill is a commonsense measure that says simply \nthat families, parents, and children are important in America and that \nwe will respect them and protect them. The bill also demonstrates the \nimportance of respecting our citizens who have spoken in State after \nState by the adoption of parental notification and parental consent \nrequirements before a minor child can be subjected to invasive medical \nprocedures with both physical and emotional consequences.\n  The Child Custody Protection Act would make it a Federal misdemeanor \nto transport a minor across State lines to obtain an abortion, in order \nto circumvent a home State law requiring notification of one or both \nparents prior to an abortion.\n  This bill does not permit the prosecution of the child or his \nparents, but it does permit the prosecution of outside third parties \nwho would interfere with the parent-child relationship in order to \nfurther a political or ideological agenda.\n  In addition to criminal penalties, the bill allows any parent who \nsuffers harm from a violation of this act may seek and obtain an \nappropriate civil remedy.\n  At a time when children in public schools cannot obtain so much as an \naspirin from a school nurse without parental consent, America has \noverwhelmingly insisted that before permitting minors to undergo a \nmajor medical procedure, such as an abortion, their parents should \nconsent or at the very least, be notified. Thirty-four States have \nenacted parental consent or notification laws. Parental notification is \nsupported by 83 percent of the American people.\n  Yet, too often, outside third parties have intentionally sought to \ncircumvent these profamily State laws and invade the parent-child \nrelationship by transporting children across State lines for the \npurpose of having an abortion.\n  This bill will serve as a real deterrent to such efforts. It \nreaffirms the parent-child relationship which is so important to the \noverwhelming majority of Americans. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupport of this bill.\n  I yield back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/21/senate-section/article/S8099-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I have already announced that I will do \neverything I can to block Senate consideration of the major overhaul of \nthe telecommunications laws until it contains language to ensure there \ncannot be discrimination on the Internet.\n  Last week, I outlined a number of examples of the kind of \ndiscrimination that could take place unless there is language known as \nNet neutrality in the legislation. I am going to give additional \nexamples this morning of what will happen if discrimination is allowed \non the Net. I also intend to start laying out answers to some of the \nmost frequently asked questions about Net neutrality.\n  The major phone and cable companies that are now spending enormous \nsums trying to prevent Net neutrality so outspend the folks who share \nmy views that I think it is important for the Senate to get a sense of \nwhat is going on. That is why it is my intent to come to the floor of \nthe Senate again and again and again to outline what is at stake with \nrespect to ensuring that the Internet is kept free of discrimination.\n  Let me begin by first addressing this question of what exactly is Net \nneutrality. If you listen to some of the so-called experts about \ncommunications, they would suggest this is so complicated, so arcane, \nso difficult for anybody to understand, you ought to let the lawyers \nand the lobbyists sort this out. Of course, that is traditionally what \nhas gone on in this field. You have lawyers and lobbyists being paid \nvery handsomely to battle it out with each other, usually in \nWashington, DC, or in courtrooms across the country.\n  Somehow, the typical person, the typical citizen, who has become \nempowered using the Internet, does not get to participate in these \ndiscussions. I will tell you, Mr. President, I do not think the \nAmerican people are going to buy that any longer. The Internet, which, \nof course, has opened up so many doors for our citizens in terms of \nhealth care and business opportunities, education, and culture, has \nalso ensured they get a lot of information about these communications \ndebates that used to be reserved for lawyers and lobbyists.\n  The people of this country--and the hundreds and hundreds of \norganizations that want to keep the Internet discrimination free--are \nno longer going to accept a notion that a handful of insiders in \nWashington, DC, can have these debates about the future of the \ncommunications systems they depend on, and that the people of this \ncountry will have to take what these so-called experts decide. So this \nis going to be a debate, in my view, that is going to be driven by the \ngrassroots of this country, by thousands of people getting involved and \ncoming to their legislators, and others, to talk about the future of \ntelecommunications--why so much communication power is concentrated in \nso few hands.\n  I am going to try to advance this debate here on the floor of the \nSenate every so often so we can make sure somebody is getting the \nmessage out about what is at stake, other than those big cable and \nphone companies that seem to be spending almost $150 for every $1 spent \nby folks who share my views.\n  The first question I want to talk about this morning is what exactly \nis Net neutrality? It is not that complicated. It is a pretty \nstraightforward proposition. What Net neutrality means is you cannot \ndiscriminate on the Internet. The people who are against Net \nneutrality--I call them ``the discriminators'' because that is their \nagenda--want to discriminate. They want to be in a position to play \nfavorites. They want to say: We will give certain people a good deal, \nboth in terms of service and all the considerations that go into folks \nmaking their choices on line.\n  I do not think we should have that kind of discrimination. I think it \nought to be, as it is today, possible for our citizens to go with their \nbrowser where they want to go, when they want to go, and everybody \nwould be treated equally. That is the way it works today. I do not \nthink there ought to be any changes.\n  Today, somebody pays a fee to get on the Net. They go where they \nwant,\n\n[[Page S8100]]\n\nwhen they want. And if you want to buy something online from Harry & \nDavid--their wonderful fruit, which we know a lot about in the State of \nOregon--you pay your Internet provider for the connection, Harry & \nDavid pays its Internet provider for its connection, and that is that. \nOnce you pay your Internet access fee, no one stops you from shopping \nat Harry & David because you did not pay an extra fee.\n  Without a clear policy preserving Net neutrality and ensuring there \nis no discrimination on the Net, the Net would be forever changed. And, \nin my view, it would be forever changed if discrimination is allowed on \nthe Internet.\n  So that is why I have indicated I am going to use every procedural \ntool I have as a Senator to block Senate consideration of the \ntelecommunications overhaul until it ensures there is Net neutrality \nand no discrimination online.\n  Now, a second question I am often asked is people want to know, as a \nconsumer: How will Net neutrality affect me? For starters, keeping \nthings the way they are, keeping Net neutrality, is not going to change \nanything about the Net for millions and millions of our consumers who \nrely on it. Net neutrality has been the way we have enjoyed the Net \nsince day one. And it is only in the last year that there has been this \nnew front opened up where folks say: We have to be allowed to \ndiscriminate. It has only been in the last year where the basic \nnondiscriminatory nature of the Internet has been under attack.\n  So it is not going to change the world for the consumer if Net \nneutrality is preserved. But I will tell you, it is surely a troubling \nquestion for consumers if we do not have Net neutrality. Consumers, in \nmy view, without Net neutrality, would immediately feel the effects. \nThey would have fewer choices, and they would pay higher prices. And I \nam going to try, again, to use some examples this morning of why that \nis the case.\n  Currently, consumers pay a fee for connecting to the Internet. The \nfee is for a certain amount of bandwidth. The more bandwidth you buy, \nthe faster the speed with which you connect to the Internet. So with a \ndial-up connection at 56 kilobits per second of bandwidth, it is going \nto take a lot longer to get your favorite Web sites than with a high-\nspeed connection at 6 megabits per second. That is why some folks call \nbroadband high speed. A broader bandwidth can accommodate more bits, \nand they can move faster down the pipes. A growing number of our \ncitizens want the higher speed or broadband connection to the Net.\n  If the large phone and cable lobbies are able to stop Net neutrality, \nconsumers would no longer have access to all the content available on \nthe bandwidth they buy. Rather, those that provide content on the Net--\nand that is everybody with a Web site, from small nonprofits and \nuniversities to large corporations--would be forced to pay the big \nphone and cable companies an extra fee for access to the consumer's \nbandwidth. If they did not pay or could not afford to pay these extra \nfees, their content would be waylaid, it would be off on the Internet \nslow lane.\n  This would mean consumers would have fewer Web site choices. Some \nsmall businesses that depend on the Net for sales, in my view, will end \nup closing down. Many of the bloggers--and we know that now blogging is \nawfully popular; these are folks who write just to be heard--they are \ngoing to find it hard to continue without Net neutrality if they have \nto pay those extra fees. Nonprofits--I am not sure we will see all \ntheir Web sites. At the end of the day, without Net neutrality, \nconsumers will be left with fewer choices.\n  That is not all that consumers will be left with. Because the loss of \nNet neutrality is double-barreled discrimination, consumers would also \nbe left with higher prices. Those companies that choose to pay fees to \nthe larger phone and cable companies are going to pass those fees on to \nthe consumer. The price of goods sold online is going to rise because \ncompanies will pass on the fees to consumers. And because no one can \ndetermine now how high the fees are going to go, no one can predict how \nhigh the price of goods sold online would go either.\n  So that is a little bit of what all this means to the typical \nconsumer. It does mean, in my view, higher prices and fewer choices for \nthe reasons I outlined. But I thought I would continue what I started \nlast week; that is, bringing some specific examples I think we will see \non the Internet if there is an absence of Net neutrality.\n  The first example I am going to cite this morning is somebody I am \ngoing to call Josh Nelson. Josh Nelson wants to get Internet broadband \nfor himself and his family at home. ``Local Cable'' is the only choice \nfor Internet access, and we will say it charges $49.99 for a 6 megabit \nper second connection.\n  In a world with Net neutrality, when Josh buys his connection from \n``Local Cable,'' he gets to visit any Web site he wants, when he wants, \nand how he wants. If he wants, for example, to download movies from the \npopular Vongo for $10 a month, he can do that. If he wants to search \nthe Web using Yahoo or book a family vacation online at Travelocity, \nJosh can do that, too.\n  Under the bill that has come from the Senate Commerce Committee--the \nbill that does not protect Net neutrality--Josh will not be able to do \nany of those kinds of things I have described unless content providers \npay a new priority access fee on top of the $49.99 Internet access \ncharge Josh already pays, and the fees the content providers pay to get \non the Net.\n  Unless Travelocity pays the additional priority fee, booking that \nvacation at Travelocity could take 20 minutes to process because they \nare not paying the extra fee to ``Local Cable'' for priority access. \nDownloading movies at Vongo could cost more as well, could cost $20 \nrather than $10 because Vongo is passing on the costs of paying ``Local \nCable'' the priority access fee.\n  Josh at this point--and this is as sure as night follows day in terms \nof what is ahead--is going to want to switch to another broadband \nprovider, given all these extra costs he would have to eat. But he is \nstuck. There are no other choices for many people across the land.\n  The second example I want to outline involves somebody I am calling \nMary Smith. Mary goes on line now through a broadband connection with a \nlocal Bell company to purchase a television from her local electronics \nstore, Barnes Electronics. In a world with net neutrality, when Mary \ngoes to Barnes Electronics web site, the site works properly and she \ncan purchase the new television with ease. Under the legislation that \ncame from the Senate Commerce Committee, it is going to be a different \nworld for Mary. When she types in the web address for Barnes \nElectronics, the site may not immediately load. Instead a page could \nload asking her if she would prefer to shop at Big Box Electronics web \nsite which paid the local Bell to interrupt Mary's browsing. After \nclicking no, she is directed to Barnes Electronics web site. However, \nthe site takes a long time to load and she becomes so frustrated, she \nsays: Well, I will just go shopping at Big Box and eat all those higher \nprices.\n  In each of these examples, those who own the pipes extend their reach \nto the detriment of the American people. According to the business \nplans--and these have not exactly been hidden--of the big phone and \ncable companies and what they tell Wall Street, the kind of world I \ndescribe is what we are heading for. Without net neutrality, neither of \nthe people in the examples I just outlined would enjoy the Internet the \nway they enjoy it today.\n  One last question for purposes of this morning. I am often asked now: \nIf we have net neutrality, does that mean we are not going to have \nsophisticated communications networks built in my neighborhood? Of \ncourse, we all want these sophisticated communications systems. Folks \nwant them in Georgia, in Oregon, across the land. We all understand the \nvalue of constantly trying to upgrade our communications systems. \nNobody wants policies that create disincentives to building new and \nimproved communications networks. For years cable companies have been \ndigging up the streets in neighborhoods across the land to build more \nsophisticated networks, even though net neutrality protections were in \nplace. For all these years, when we have said we were not going to \nallow discrimination on the Internet, we have had the cable companies \nout there digging up the streets putting in these systems. So it is not \nas if we don't have some evidence of what you can do when the Internet \nis free of discrimination.\n\n[[Page S8101]]\n\n  We have seen these sophisticated networks built by cable companies \nright now. They are doing it when there is an absence of discrimination \non the net. The reason I cited this is, it proves that if consumers \ndemand it, the communications companies are going to build it because \nthey can make a profit. The Bells, for example, would rather build a \nnetwork with discrimination in it because they can make billions of \ndollars of extra profit. That is why they are threatening not to build \nnetworks and to try to hold hostage consumers and businesses across \nAmerica. I don't think that is right. There is concrete evidence that \nthis notion that we will not have sophisticated communications networks \nunless we allow discrimination on the net makes no sense at all.\n  I have tried to make a focus of my career in public service to \nkeeping the Internet free from discrimination. It has paid real \ndividends already, particularly in regard to taxation. I was a Senate \nsponsor of the legislation that prohibited discrimination in taxes on \nline. When we started, it was a very simple proposition. We would see, \nfor example, that if you bought a newspaper on line, you paid taxes. \nBut if you bought the snail mail version of that newspaper, you didn't \npay any taxes. So Congress came together on a bipartisan basis and \nsaid: We are not going to allow discrimination and taxation with \nrespect to the Internet. We have done it. It has made sense.\n  For all those who claimed there were going to be dire consequences, \nthat the States and localities wouldn't have any money, that it was \ngoing to kill the traditional retailer, the main street retailer, we \nhaven't seen any of that. The Internet Nondiscrimination Act as it \nrelates to taxation has made a huge difference. I worked with Senator \nAllen on the other side of the aisle on that. Our mutual friend, former \nCongressman Chris Cox, who now heads the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, he and I began this effort when he was serving in the other \nbody. We have seen already, with respect to ensuring that the net is \nfree from multiple and discriminatory taxes, why it makes sense to keep \nthe Internet a discrimination free zone.\n  For the life of me, I can't figure out why we want to bring \ndiscrimination back to the telecommunications world, which is what this \ntelecommunications overhaul will do, unless net neutrality is \nprotected. The major cable and phone companies have spent more than $40 \nmillion since January of this year to make the American people think \nthat net neutrality is what they call a lose-lose proposition. I am \nhere to say that the absence of net neutrality will be the lose-lose \nproposition. The American people will see discrimination in Internet \ncontent, higher prices for consumers, and that is why hundreds of \norganizations that span the political spectrum, who disagree with each \nother on virtually everything, have come together to say: We are going \nto pull out all the stops to try to protect the Internet from \ndiscrimination.\n  I do not want to see the American consumer face the double barrel \ndiscrimination on the net of reduced choices in content, diminished \nservices, and the additional prospect of higher prices. As a result, it \nis my intent to keep my hold on this major telecommunications rewrite \nuntil it ensures true net neutrality and an Internet free of \ndiscrimination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/21/senate-section/article/S8101-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            AMERICA'S OPPORTUNITY SCHOLARSHIPS FOR KIDS ACT\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, earlier this week, I introduced the \nAmerica's Opportunity Scholarships for Kids Act, S. 3682, on behalf of \nPresident Bush. I was joined in introducing this legislation by \nSenators Ensign, Gregg, and Santorum. This bill provides meaning to the \npromise of the No Child Left Behind Act by giving low-income families \nwhose children are stuck in low-performing schools the same \nopportunities other families already enjoy.\n  President Bush proposed the America's Opportunity Scholarships \nProgram as part of his fiscal year 2007 budget. The bill authorizes \n$100 million in competitive grants to State and local educational \nagencies or private nonprofit groups to provide low-income students in \nlow-performing schools with scholarships to attend the school of their \nchoice or receive tutoring. Thousands of eligible students would \nreceive up to $4,000 in scholarship funds to apply to tuition and costs \nat the school of their choice or up to $3,000 worth of intensive \ntutoring to help them improve their academic achievement.\n  Eligible low-income students are those who attend schools in \n``restructuring,'' which means they have missed their student \nachievement goals under No Child Left Behind for 6 years in a row. The \nU.S. Department of Education reports that in the 2004-2005 school year, \n1,065 schools were identified for restructuring. Preliminary estimates \nsuggest that an additional 1,000 schools will be identified for \nrestructuring in the 2005-2006 school year.\n  Parents want the best possible schools for their children. A recent \nsurvey by the Educational Testing Service showed that 62 percent of \npublic school parents either transferred a child out of one school into \na better school or have decided where to live based on the schools in \nthat district. This bill offers a way out for students whose families \ndon't have the money for tuition or the luxury of moving.\n  For those who think school choice is not important, I ask you to \nconsider what you would do if the government or circumstances said you \nhad no choice in the matter. Imagine what would happen if we passed a \nlaw that said that no American parent could choose a school for their \nchild, and instead the government assigned each child to a specific \npublic or private school. There would be a revolution in this country \nby middle- and upper-income parents who want to preserve their right to \nchoose what is best for their child's education.\n  Low-income parents are increasingly voicing a demand for the same \nquality educational options that wealthier families have. In Milwaukee, \nWI, low-income families' demand for better choices led to the creation \nof a citywide private school choice program in 1990. Today, Milwaukee \nis one of the most vibrant education marketplaces in the Nation, and \nparents can choose from traditional public schools, charter schools, \nand private schools. Here in Washington, DC, frustrated low-income \nparents led an active campaign to establish the DC School Choice \nIncentive Program, which increases educational options for low-income \nstudents, including scholarships to attend private schools. Over 2,600 \napplications were received for 1,200 available scholarships in 2004, \nthe first year of that program. This school year, 1,713 students are \nenrolled at the private school of their choice. Their parents report \nsignificant improvements in their children's academic performance, \nbehavior, and prospects for the future.\n  Our Nation gives families choices in educational institutions nearly \neverywhere but in grade school and high school. After World War II, the \nGI bill enabled veterans to attend the educational institutions of \ntheir choice--public or private, secular or nonsecular. Today, Federal \ndollars for higher education still follow students to the school of \ntheir choice. It is this choice--along with autonomy and competition--\nthat has made our system of higher education the best in the world. We \nalso allow Federal funding to follow preschoolers to the childcare \nprogram of their choice.\n  Unfortunately, we have gotten in a rut with K-12 schools. We have \ncreated local monopolies where dollars flow directly to schools with \nlittle or no say from parents. The ones paying the highest price are \nthe poor children of America.\n  America's opportunity scholarships are a way out for families who \nhave waited too long. I hope my colleagues will support this important \nlegislation so we can help our neediest children achieve a brighter \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/21/senate-section/article/S8101-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8101-S8102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          GUN SAFETY EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. President, high profile school shootings across this country in \nrecent years have focused the Nation's attention on easy access to guns \nby children, especially in the home. Each day in the United States, an \naverage of 80 people die as a result of homicide, suicide, and \nunintentional injuries that involve a firearm. Even more tragically ten \nof those who die everyday are children. The epidemic of firearm \nviolence affects us all.\n\n[[Page S8102]]\n\n  Steps to Prevent Firearm Injury In the Home, STOP 2, developed by the \nCenter to Prevent Handgun Violence, supplies health care providers \nacross a wide range of disciplines including nurses, social workers, \npsychologists, health educators, and counselors, with the tools to \neducate diverse populations about the dangers of guns in the home and \nproper gun storage. Health care providers routinely discuss ways to \nprevent many types of injury, such as using child car seats, wearing \nbicycle safety helmets, and locking up prescription drugs. STOP 2 helps \nhealth care providers incorporate firearm injury prevention along with \nthese other safety messages. Health care providers, as important \nmessengers of health and safety information, are able to speak with \npatients and their families about the dangers of guns in their own \nhomes as well as the homes of relatives or friends they visit. The \nprogram also assists health care providers in alerting families to the \ntypical warning signs of gang involvement and suicide, and outlines \naction steps that can help prevent these possible tragedies.\n  STOP 2 expands on the original STOP program, which was launched in \n1994 as a joint effort of the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, CPHV, \nand the American Academy of Pediatrics. STOP was designed specifically \nfor pediatricians. STOP 2 broadens the program's scope to include other \nhealth care providers and health educators who work in a wide range of \ndisciplines with diverse populations. With funding through the \nMetropolitan Life Foundation, CPHV is providing STOP 2 kits free of \ncharge to the health care community. Health care providers can request \na free STOP 2 kit that contains patient/client brochures, waiting room \nposters, and other gun violence prevention information, by contacting \nthe Center to Prevent Handgun Violence.\n  I commend all of those who fight gun violence through safety \neducation. Their common sense approach provides parents with practical \nsteps to help protect themselves and their families from tragedy. I am \nhopeful that the 109th Congress will do more to support their efforts \nby taking up and passing sensible gun safety legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/21/senate-section/article/S8102-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          COMMITMENT TO ISRAEL\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, we have all learned in our personal lives \nthat in times of difficulty and challenge, all the extraneous matters \nof life disappear and we wisely cling to those relationships and values \nwe hold most dear. As we as a nation confront a dangerous set of \ncircumstance in the Middle East, we would be wise to do the same thing.\n  The United States made a solemn, unequivocal, irrevocable commitment \nto the State of Israel in 1948. We did so for two reasons. First, we \nwere responding in moral revulsion to centuries of persecution of the \nJewish people around the world and specifically in Nazi Germany. \nSecond, we were affirming the formation of a democratic society in the \nMiddle East because we believed, then and now, the democracy is, in \nLincoln's words, ``the last best hope of Earth.''\n  That commitment had absolutely nothing to do with politics, \npartisanship or the price of a gallon of gasoline. Today on this floor \nwe renew that commitment to Israel, and by doing so, remain faithful to \nour own creeds and national moral identity.\n  We as a nation are committed to democracy and the rule of law. We \nbelieve that governments derive their just powers from the consent of \nthe governed. We know from our own history that many disagree with that \ncommitment. We know that those values are not self-actualizing. \nSometimes free nations have to fight violent people to preserve the \ncircumstances under which they can live in peace and freedom. We stand \nwith Israel today to support its right to defend itself against \nterrorists and those who support them.\n  Israel is a small country, surrounded by many who are hostile to \ntheir existence. Over the last six decades, Israel has made risky \nterritorial concessions to its neighbors in hopes that moderate Arab \nvoices would prevail over extremists. Those extremists' view of peace \nin the Middle East are predicated on the destruction and removal of \nIsrael.\n  Despite the fact that southern Lebanon and the Gaza Strip have been \nthe launching point for violence against Israel in the recent past, \nIsrael agreed to withdraw from them in the hope of peace. That hope has \nbeen dashed by Hamas and Hezbollah, both in the abduction of Israeli \nsoldiers and the launching of rocket attacks.\n  Some in the European community and even in the United States have \nsaid criticized Israel's response as ``disproportionate'' and urged \nIsrael to negotiate. When their very survival is at stake, how do you \nmeasure proportionality? With whom do they suggest Israel negotiate?\n  I am not saying there is not role for diplomacy or a diplomatic \nsolution.\n  But the foundation of such a solution must be No. 1, Israel has an \nabsolute right to defend itself and No. 2, we must make absolutely \ncertain that our actions do not embolden terrorists to continue their \ninexcusable tactics.\n  No one supports armed conflict or the injury of civilians. A terrible \nprice is always paid by those who bear the least guilt for the battles. \nBut when Israel is faced with terrorists who work for its destruction, \nfirm steps must be taken.\n  I commend the President for his active work with the leaders in the \nregion, the United Nations and Europe. This is a situation where public \nstatements should be few and maximum influence exerted in private \nnetworks of diplomacy.\n  I believe the President is honoring our Nation's commitment to Israel \nand forcefully pursuing our Nation's wider objectives in the War on \nTerror in this situation.\n  I think the American people can be reassured and proud that the \nUnited States is acting as a great power, in pursuit of high moral \nprinciples. We hope that through our strength and advocacy, those who \ninitiated this conflict in Lebanon and Gaza will cease their actions, \nthat their ability to continue to inflict terror and destabilize the \nregion is eliminated or at least severely curtailed, and those who work \nfor peace can regain control.\n  Israel is the only democracy in the region and they need our \nfriendship and support right now. By demonstrating our resolve, we help \nensure that our other friends in the region will work for a solution \nwhich is best for Israel and all the legitimate forces in the Middle \nEast.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/21/senate-section/article/S8102-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8102-S8103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               TRIBUTE TO REAR ADMIRAL JAMES E. MCPHERSON\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and pay \ntribute to RADM James E. McPherson, the Judge Advocate General of the \nU.S. Navy. Admiral McPherson will retire from the Navy on July 28, \n2006, having completed over 27 years of distinguished service to our \nNation.\n  Admiral McPherson, a native of San Diego, is a graduate of San Diego \nState University and University of San Diego Law School. He also earned \na master of laws degree from the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General's \nLegal Center and School.\n  Admiral McPherson began his military career as an enlisted man in the \nU.S. Army. He served over 3 years as a military policeman at the \nPresidio of San Francisco, with the Eighth Army in South Korea, and \nwith the First Infantry Division. Notably, he is the first Navy Judge \nAdvocate General to begin his career as an enlisted man. After \nreceiving his commission as an ensign and completing Naval Justice \nSchool in Newport, RI, Admiral McPherson was assigned as an Assistant \nForce Judge Advocate for Commander, Naval Air Force, U.S. Atlantic \nFleet. He continued his distinguished career with assignments at the \nNaval Legal Service Office in Norfolk, VA; the Naval Air Station, Cubi \nPoint in the Philippines; and as Command Judge Advocate onboard the USS \nTheodore Roosevelt. Following completion of graduate school, Admiral \nMcPherson returned to the Naval Legal Service Office in Norfolk and \nserved tours as senior defense counsel and senior trial counsel. He was \nthen assigned as Force Judge Advocate for Commander, Submarine Force, \nU.S. Atlantic Fleet; the assistant for legal and legislative matters \nfor the vice chief of Naval Operations; and as special counsel to the \nChief of Naval Operations. In September 2000,\n\n[[Page S8103]]\n\nAdmiral McPherson assumed command of Trial Service Office East in \nNorfolk, and in October 2002, he was promoted to rear admiral and \nassigned as the Deputy Judge Advocate General and Commander, Naval \nLegal Service Command. Admiral McPherson assumed his current duties as \nthe 39th Judge Advocate General of the Navy in November 2004.\n  The Nation, the United States Navy, and the Judge Advocate General's \nCorps have been fortunate to enjoy the talents and dedication of such a \ndistinguished and wonderful gentleman. Admiral McPherson's commitment \nto the rule of law strengthened the Navy, and he has served this Nation \nwell. I know all of my colleagues join me in congratulating Admiral \nMcPherson on the occasion of his retirement, and we wish him fair winds \nand following seas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/21/senate-section/article/S8103-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/21/senate-section/article/S8103-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/21/senate-section/article/S8103-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:32 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Chiappardi, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nhas passed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of \nthe Senate:\n\n       H.R. 5684.

Con. Res. 113\n\n       Whereas international humanitarian law is, \n     quintessentially, about principle, establishing standards of \n     conduct that can not be breached under any circumstance, or \n     for any calculation of political efficacy or utility;\n       Whereas the International Red Cross and Red Crescent \n     Movement is a worldwide institution in which all national Red \n     Cross and Red Crescent societies have equal status, whose \n     mission is to prevent and alleviate human suffering wherever \n     it may be found, without discrimination;\n       Whereas the Magen David Adom (Red Shield of David) Society \n     is the national humanitarian society in Israel and has \n     performed heroically, aiding all in need of assistance, on a \n     purely humanitarian basis, without bias, even those \n     responsible for acts of horrific violence against Israeli \n     civilians;\n       Whereas, since 1949, the Magen David Adom Society has been \n     refused admission into the International Red Cross and Red \n     Crescent Movement and has been relegated to observer status \n     without a vote because it has used the Red Shield of David, \n     the only such national organization denied membership in the \n     Movement;\n       Whereas the red cross symbol was intended as the visible \n     expression of the neutral status enjoyed by the medical \n     services of the armed forces and the protection thus \n     conferred, and there is not, and has never been, any implicit \n     religious connection in the cross;\n       Whereas, since its establishment in 1930, the Magen David \n     Adom Society has worked under its own symbol, the Red Star of \n     David, as an expression of the humanitarian values the Magen \n     David Adom Society shares with the Red Cross and Red Crescent \n     societies;\n       Whereas Israel acceded to the Geneva Conventions in 1951 \n     with a reservation specifying their intent to continue to use \n     the Magen David Adom;\n       Whereas international consultations among nations and \n     national Red Cross Societies ensued until 1999, when the \n     International Committee of the Red Cross formally called for \n     adoption of a protocol to the Geneva Conventions creating a \n     third neutral symbol, allowing the use of either the Red \n     Cross, the Red Crescent, or the third neutral symbol, and \n     allowing for the third neutral symbol to be used in \n     combination with other national Red Cross Society symbols, \n     including the Magen David Adom;\n       Whereas a diplomatic conference to adopt this proposal into \n     the Geneva Conventions was scheduled for October 2000, but \n     was prevented by the outbreak of the second Palestinian \n     intifada;\n       Whereas the United States, the American Red Cross, and the \n     American Friends of Magen David Adom have worked ceaselessly \n     to resolve the issue of the third neutral symbol and achieve \n     full membership in the International Red Cross and Red \n     Crescent Movement for the Magen David Adom Society;\n       Whereas Congress has insisted that funds made available to \n     the International Committee of the Red Cross be contingent on \n     a certification by the Secretary of State confirming that the \n     Magen David Adom Society is a full participant in the \n     activities of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent \n     Movement;\n       Whereas the American Red Cross has stood alone among all \n     the national humanitarian aid societies, and has withheld \n     over $45,000,000 in dues to the International Federation of \n     the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to protest the \n     exclusion of the Magen David Adom;\n       Whereas the Government of Switzerland, the depositary state \n     for the Geneva Conventions, convened a Diplomatic Conference \n     of the states party to the Geneva Conventions in December \n     2005 for the purpose of adopting a Third Additional Protocol \n     and rightly resisted efforts to block the broad international \n     consensus in favor of resolving the third neutral symbol \n     question;\n       Whereas the efforts by the United States and the American \n     Red Cross at the Diplomatic Conference in December 2005 were \n     critical to achieving both an overwhelming positive vote in \n     favor of adopting the Third Additional Protocol, as well as \n     an extremely important memorandum of understanding between \n     the Magen David Adom and the Palestinian Red Crescent \n     Society;\n       Whereas sustaining international support for the adoption \n     of the third neutral symbol against efforts to divert the \n     conference into unrelated political matters required \n     extraordinary diplomatic efforts by the United States and the \n     American Red Cross;\n       Whereas the Third Additional Protocol adopted in Geneva in \n     December 2005 established the new third neutral symbol, the \n     ``red crystal'' that can be used in conjunction with the Red \n     Shield of David and cleared the way for Israeli membership in \n     the international movement;\n       Whereas, in June 2006, the states party to the Geneva \n     Conventions, the national humanitarian aid societies, the \n     International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent \n     Societies, and the International Committee of the Red Cross \n     met in Geneva to adopt rules implementing the Third \n     Additional Protocol; and\n       Whereas, at the June 2006 meeting in Geneva, the \n     International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement accepted \n     the Magen David Adom Society as a full member: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) commends the Magen David Adom Society for its long and \n     distinguished record of providing humanitarian assistance to \n     all those in need of aid, even those responsible for heinous \n     atrocities against Israeli civilians;\n       (2) congratulates the Magen David Adom Society, and the \n     Government and people of Israel, for securing full membership \n     in the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, 57 \n     years past due;\n       (3) thanks the President, the Secretary of State, and \n     United States diplomatic representatives for their tireless \n     pursuit and maintenance of the international consensus that \n     culminated in the recent acceptance of the Magen David Adom \n     Society as a full member in the International Red Cross and \n     Red Crescent Movement;\n       (4) thanks the American Red Cross for its unwavering and \n     unyielding insistence within the International Red Cross and \n     Red Crescent Movement that the principles of international \n     humanitarian law could not be reconciled with continued \n     exclusion of the Magen David Adom Society;\n       (5) thanks the Government of Switzerland and officials of \n     the International Committee of the Red Cross for helping to \n     prepare the necessary consensus and carrying to completion \n     the adoption of the Third Additional Protocol by the states \n     party to the Geneva Conventions and the rules for its \n     implementation; and\n       (6) commends the President for--\n       (A) submitting the Third Additional Protocol to the Senate \n     for its advice and consent; and\n       (B) pending approval by the Senate, preparing for \n     congressional consideration and enactment of legislation \n     necessary to carry into effect the Third Additional Protocol.\n\n

Mr. President, this resolution concerns a pro se civil \naction filed against Senator Jeff Bingaman, the United States Senate, \nRepresentative Steve Pearce, and the United States House of \nRepresentatives, in which plaintiff challenges as unconstitutional the \nfact that he does not have a guaranteed right to have his appeals heard \nby the United States Supreme Court nor a right to have a three-judge \ndistrict court hear his challenges to Federal statutes at the trial \ncourt level.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 448, which was \nreceived from the House.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \nconcurrent resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 448) commending the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration on the \n     completion of the Space Shuttle's second Return-to-Flight \n     mission.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the House has passed and sent to the \nSenate, H. Con. Res. 448, which commends NASA and the crew of the Space \nShuttle Discovery on the successful completion of the STS-121 mission \nearlier this week.\n  I support this resolution and urge my colleagues to join with me and \nprovide the Senate concurrence to this resolution. I also note that the \nHouse passed this resolution on July 20, the 37th anniversary of the \nApollo 11 lunar landing, adding special significance to the action we \nare being asked to endorse.\n  The resolution recognizes and applauds the very successful STS-121 \nmission, which accomplished all of its test objectives regarding on-\norbit repair procedures, as well as delivering 14 tons of equipment and \nsupplies to the International Space Station, and a third space station \ncrew member. This restores the space station to its full crew \ncomplement since the Columbia accident and allows for additional crew \ntime to be spent doing on-orbit research.\n  The mission also demonstrated that changes made to the external tank, \nwhile still not fully completed, resulted in the least amount of foam \nshedding during lift-off and the cleanest, most undamaged underside of \nthe shuttle yet seen.\n  The successful completion of this second Return-to-Flight test \nmission is especially significant because it means the Shuttle Program \nis once again on the threshold of completing the important work of \nassembling the International Space Station.\n  If all goes as expected, the next mission to the Space Station will \ntake place in just a little over 5 weeks from now, near the end of \nAugust. That mission will deliver additional supplies and equipment to \nthe space station, including a new structural truss element and an \nadditional set of solar arrays. Once the solar arrays are deployed, \nthey will not only provide additional power to the space station, which \ncan be used for an increasing number of scientific experiments during \nthe ongoing assembly period, but they will begin to make the space \nstation one of the brightest objects in the night sky. By the time the \nspace station is completed, it will be brighter than any other object \nin the night sky besides the Moon, an ever-present reminder that we are \na species no longer confined to the Earth and able to make use of that \nunique environment of low-Earth orbit for research that can benefit all \nof humanity.\n  I applaud the crew of Discovery and the team at NASA who all worked \ntogether to restore this Nation's ability\n\n[[Page S8106]]\n\nto conduct the human exploration and utilization of space.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe concurrent resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we have had a productive week. I don't know \nif I could say an unusually productive week, as we always have good \nweeks, but a very strong week in terms of both the range of issues that \nwe have debated on the floor as well as pieces of legislation, \nimportant pieces of legislation that have passed. The range is quite \nremarkable. As I outlined earlier this morning, we began this week \nstudying and talking about and discussing and debating three bills that \naddressed issues that are challenging in that they address the ethical \nconcerns surrounding science and the tremendous and remarkable advances \nin science. I have been a beneficiary of this because of my profession \nas a doctor and as a scientist. We all recognize\n\n[[Page S8108]]\n\nthe great power and the great potential for science to bring cures, to \nbring treatment, and to bring a better quality of life to people in \nthis country and, indeed, around the world. Our challenge is to make \nsure that as we allow that science to advance, not just allow it, we \npropel it, we push it, we do so in a way that is consistent with our \nmoral values and with a framework of ethics that we all respect. It is \na challenge. It is the sort of thing that traditionally legislators \nhave not had to deal a lot with it. They would deal with it on a \nperiodic basis.\n  Now the reality is, with science moving so fast, we are going to have \nto be accustomed to dealing with these tough issues, struggling with \nthem. We all struggle with them. It is easy to vote yes or no at the \nend of the day. But those ``yes'' or ``no'' votes do represent real \nstruggles, both internally and as we talk to family and talk to \nfriends, and as we talk to scientists. It is clearly something that is \nvery powerful in our own lives.\n  We moved through confirming four judges--I mentioned that last \nnight--the Water Resources Development Act, which we passed under the \nleadership of Chairman Inhofe last night--yesterday afternoon, last \nnight--and passing the Voting Rights Act after 41 years of real \nsuccess. Then we went on this child custody protection bill which has \nto do with parental consent, with people taking minors across the \nborder, without their parents' consent, for an abortion. That is a very \nimportant issue. That comes on the heels of an issue we passed last \nnight, the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, which arguably \ncould be considered the most comprehensive child crime protection bill \nthat we passed in a generation. So it is quite remarkable as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/21/senate-section/article/S8108-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VISITING FAMILY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I am blessed today to have with me, although I haven't \nseen them yet--I will be with them here in about 3 or 4 minutes--\nmembers of my own family. I say that in part because it is a real \npleasure and honor for us to be here, occupying these positions, \nwhether it is majority leader, which I clearly understand I am here for \njust a period of time in this position, or having that opportunity to \nserve our 6 million constituents back in Tennessee or as Senators \nrepresenting, indeed, the entire Nation, for us to be able to welcome \nvisitors here or family members here and share with them the enduring \nvalues of freedom and democracy that are represented in this Capitol \nbuilding as we walk through it and work through this working edifice, \nthis emblem and symbol of democracy around the world but also a working \nbuilding where we conduct the Nation's business that I just outlined, \nor I go down the hall to my office, the Howard Baker Majority Leader's \nSuite. And as I work there all day and a lot of nights, I look out that \nwindow and look out on that expansive mall with the Smithsonian \nInstitutions on either side and the Washington Monument reaching for \nthe sky and the Lincoln Memorial. That is all right here.\n  So I have with me today my niece, Mary Lauren Allen, the daughter of \nmy sister Mary, and her husband Lawson Allen, and for the first time \ntogether, they have all three of their children, Cole Allen, Frist \nAllen, and Harrison Allen. They have been here separately. And it is so \nmuch fun for me to walk them over to that window and look out at the \nSmithsonian and look out at that Lincoln Memorial out there and the \nWashington Monument. It is a real honor and delight for me to have Mary \nLauren and Lawson and especially Harrison and Frist and Cole to walk \nthem through these marble halls in the great Rotunda. Lawson's parents \nSam and Phyllis are here as well. I have had the pleasure of having \nthem in the past and hosting them here as well. It is a big family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/21/senate-section/article/S8108-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THANKING THE PAGES\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
