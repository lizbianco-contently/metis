Mr. President, this morning, we will be in a period of \nmorning business to allow Senators to make statements. As announced by \nthe majority leader last night, there will be no rollcall votes during \ntoday's session. Under the order, we will begin consideration of the \nbudget resolution on Monday at 10 a.m. The chairman and ranking member \nexpect amendments to be offered during Monday's session and, therefore, \nthe next vote will occur at approximately 5:30 Monday evening.\n  I will reiterate what I said last night and remind my colleagues it \nwill be a very busy week next week. The budget resolution will have 45 \nhours of debate remaining for its consideration. That will require late \nnights with many votes. I believe all Senators would like to avoid the \nvote-arama that often occurs prior to adoption of the budget \nresolution. In order to do so, we will need to keep a steady pace each \nday and evening next week and work together to finish the number of \nvotes required to complete the bill. Next week is the last legislative \nweek prior to the Easter break, so all Senators should plan to remain \nclose to the Chamber so we can complete our work on time.\n  Let me reiterate what I said last evening with regard to next Friday. \nI know Members like to be ready to depart on Fridays normally, and \nparticularly on Fridays before a recess, but this is budget week. \nUnless we have an extraordinary occurrence that I have not witnessed in \nrecent years, we will be here through the day Friday and up into the \nevening Friday night. So I would say to all of our colleagues, be \nprepared for an unusual Friday a week from today in which we are here \nthroughout the day voting, and well up into the evening voting, unless \nsomething truly extraordinary occurs that allows us to reach completion \nbefore that time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized if he \nseeks recognition.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, we have, in effect, agreed to use 5 hours of \nthe time on the budget today. The real work on\n\n[[Page S2506]]\n\nit will start Monday at 10 o'clock in the morning. It is one of the \nrare instances in this body where we have a set time. That time is 50 \nhours. We are now down to 45 hours. It is also unique in that the time \nfor voting does not count against the budget resolution. So there is a \nlot of work to do on this budget, and there will be a lot of amendments \noffered.\n  A couple of days ago I met with a group of ministers from a host of \nProtestant denominations. The reason they came to meet with me is they \nare extremely concerned about President Bush's budget. They shared with \nme their observations of it, and they based their presentation to me on \na story from the Gospel of Luke in the New Testament.\n  In this story, there is a rich man and a poor man who lived in the \nsame vicinity, and the poor man, Lazarus, was very poor. In life, the \nrich man lived a grand life and paid no attention to the poor man, or \npoor people generally, refusing to come to the poor man's aid when he \nshould have. But in death, we are told in Scripture, it was Lazarus who \nwent to Heaven and the rich man who did not.\n  Their purpose in sharing this story with me was to point out the \nimmorality--that was their word: ``immorality''--of turning a blind eye \nto economic injustice. And they wanted to make a larger point about the \nBush 2006 budget, which, as they put it, has ``much for the rich man \nand little for Lazarus.''\n  When you examine the Bush budget through a moral lens, as they were \ndoing, you can clearly see the injustice and the lack of values in this \nbudget.\n  The President is proposing that we make deep cuts in many programs \nthat are important to working men and women, for those in real need. \nAnd why? To pay for large tax breaks for the very wealthy and to \nprovide a variety of giveaways to special interests.\n  In his budget, the President is ignoring the lessons of the Gospel, \nthe lessons there of the rich man. For example, the President's budget \ncuts health care for the most vulnerable citizens. The budget would cut \nMedicaid, which ensures that more than 50 million children, pregnant \nwomen, elderly, and people with disabilities have access to the medical \nservices they need. At the same time, the budget maintains a slush fund \nwith billions for HMOs. That is not right.\n  The President's budget also calls for cutting education. More than 48 \neducation programs will be affected, with the cuts exceeding $1 \nbillion. So our children will suffer. At the same time, the budget \ncalls for opening a precious wilderness area in Alaska for the oil and \ngas industry. That is not right.\n  The budget cuts benefits for veterans. The men and women who served \nour Nation with such bravery and courage over the decades, the people \nwho have put their lives on the line on behalf of this Nation, are \ngoing to have to pay more for their health care. At the same time, the \nadministration wants to protect the drug industry by denying Medicare \nthe right to bargain for lower prices. That is not right.\n\n  The budget cuts the COPS Program. It is an over 90-percent cut. That \nis the program that helps communities hire police officers to keep \nstreets safer. So our men and women in uniform and the neighborhoods \nthey serve will suffer. At the same time, the budget does little to \nclose the special interest loopholes that are allowing big corporations \nto avoid paying taxes. That is not right.\n  The budget underfunds environmental protection. At the same time, it \nlets big polluters off the hook from paying the cost of cleanups. That \nis not right.\n  The budget fails to adequately fund the National Family Planning \nProgram, which provides critical health care services to low-income \nwomen and helps reduce the number of unintended pregnancies. At the \nsame time, it continues to support so-called health savings accounts, \nwhich are tax shelters for the wealthy that fail to meet the needs of \nthose of modest means. That is not right.\n  America is a country that values everyone, the worker just as much as \nthe CEO of the largest company in America. And most Americans would \nagree it is not right to cut health care for children and the elderly, \ncut education, cut benefits for veterans, cut law enforcement, while \nhanding out a wide variety of giveaways to special interests and the \npowerful. That is not just bad policy, it is wrong, it is immoral.\n  Unfortunately, the budget resolution approved yesterday by the Budget \nCommittee, with a few changes in the margins, is based largely on the \nPresident's deeply flawed budget. I think we can do better. I think we \ncan create a budget that is as good for Lazarus as it is for the rich \nman.\n  Next week, we will take up the budget resolution, as I have \nindicated. We will work to make it better. But if the last couple weeks \nis an indication, there will be marching orders given to the majority, \nand they will march down here and vote against veterans, against \nchildren, against women, and against education generally.\n  So we will do our best. We will present these issues to the American \npeople, and the American people will see what is happening in this \ncountry. The programs that are important to this country are being \nstarved, starved at the expense of the American people. And the tax \ncuts go on.\n  Our goal is to turn this budget into a moral document for which we \ncan all be proud, a document that truly reflects our Nation's \npriorities and the values of the American people.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

Mr. President, I rise today to share with the Senate a \nstory that I truly hope is the exception to the rule. It begins last \nyear, when a member of one of Kansas's local fire departments was \ncalled to active duty in Iraq. Certainly, that is no unique happening \nwhere today in every State people are called to service, whether they \nbe in the service or National Guard. This gentleman, Mr. Steven Welter, \nand his wife have worked hard to make a good life for themselves and \ntheir three children. They live in the small community of Osawatomie, \nKS--it is a very fine community--where they are surrounded by friends \nand family. They recently purchased their first home.\n  Well, knowing that with Mr. Welter called to active duty they might \nface some real challenges meeting their mortgage payment, they \ncontacted their mortgage provider to make them aware of their situation \nand to seek relief under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.\n  Now, Congress has long recognized the burden that military duty \nplaces on soldiers' lives when they are called to active duty. During \nthe Civil War, Congress placed a moratorium on civil actions that were \nbrought against servicemembers. Today, through the Service-members \nCivil Relief Act, Congress provides important rights and legal \nprotections to lessen the burden on military servicemembers. A key \ncomponent of that act, initially passed by Congress 40 years ago as the \nSoldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act, is to provide the protection \nfor servicemembers whose military service makes it difficult for them \nto meet financial obligations incurred prior to being called up for \nactive duty. That seems pretty simple. It does not forgive debt. It \ndoes not relieve a servicemember of their obligation to meet their \nfinancial responsibilities.\n  Among other protections, the act shields a servicemember or their \nfamily from eviction or from losing their home. The Welters sought \nrelief under the act, requesting that their mortgage company work with \nthem to help them\n\n[[Page S2507]]\n\nmeet their financial obligation. However, the mortgage company \nresponded by sending notice to Mrs. Keira Welter that the company had \ninitiated court proceedings to foreclose on her home. You can imagine \nthis lady's distress. Not only is she worried about the safety of her \nhusband in Iraq, she is now faced with losing her home, with three \nchildren, the very scenario the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act is \ndesigned to prevent.\n  Not knowing who to turn to--and she thought pretty hard about it and \ndidn't know who to call--she contacted my office and requested our \nassistance. After numerous conversations with her mortgage lender, \nWells Fargo, I believe we have resolved her situation. I remain \nconcerned, however, that those responsible for complying with the \nServicemembers Civil Relief Act are not fully educated about their \nobligations, and that that problem is nationwide.\n\n  What is particularly appalling about this situation is that the \nmortgage company initially claimed they were unaware of the \nServicemembers Civil Relief Act, a law that has been on the books for \n40 years. They further claimed that ``they just can't be expected to \nkeep up with everything that goes on in Washington.''\n  I can appreciate that last sentiment on a lot of different fronts. \nBut ignorance is no excuse. Every financial institution has a \ncompliance officer whose job it is is to ensure that financial \ninstitutions comply with laws and the regulations. Lord knows, I often \nhear from our financial institutions, banks, savings and loans, and \nothers, about the regulatory burden our Government does place on them. \nNot only do they have to read all of the paperwork and the burdens and \nregulations; I think they have to weigh them. I appreciate those \nconcerns, especially in the small banking community. I once spent an \nentire day in my hometown bank in Dodge City learning the ins and outs \nof what a compliance officer does. She described her job as being a \n``bad news bear.'' She had to go to loan officers and say, whoops, here \nis another regulation you have to put up with. I know that is not an \neasy task.\n  However, today's example of egregious disregard for a 40-year-old \nlaw, and one we amended 2 years ago to provide additional protection to \nour military men and women, is simply unacceptable.\n  Let me be clear. I know our Nation's financial institutions do \nsupport our men and women in uniform. That is a given. I am also \nconfident that they understand their obligation and responsibility to \ncomply with this act, and that most do so. In Kansas, I know many \nfinancial service providers, and they all know that the Servicemembers \nCivil Relief Act is not only the law, but it is the morally right thing \nto do. They live in the same town. They attend the same church. They \nshare the military family's concerns when somebody from their hometown \nis called to active duty, and they are so rightfully proud when they \ncome home.\n\n  I also want to be clear it is not only financial institutions that \nare responsible for complying with this act. Landlords and other \ncreditors also have certain obligations in this regard as well. I \nrecognize that with many service members called to active duty, raising \nawareness of the requirements of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act is \nnecessary. We need a lot more education. Congress should encourage \nanybody who is working with a service-member called to active duty, or \nthat servicemember's family, to make sure they are aware of their \nobligation under this act.\n  Let me also take this opportunity to commend the efforts of many \norganizations who are working with the military families on base, \nveterans organizations, support organizations, and others, to ensure \nthey receive the protections that are provided for under this act, and \nto provide other assistance to families of our servicemembers. That is \na real win-win story all across this Nation.\n  I recently learned from a member of the VFW, who works with military \nfamilies, who stressed that ``education about the protections that are \nprovided under the act is key.'' Too many military families have \nexperienced instances where a landlord, unaware of this act, sought to \nevict the family while the soldier was on active duty. That is \negregious.\n  I am calling on the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the \nOCC. I hope they can see their way clear as to what they should be \ndoing in this regard, and others who have responsibility for enforcing \nthis act--by the way, the acronym is SCRA--to strengthen their \nenforcement in education of this important law. Any military family who \nhas a mortgage with a national bank and who needs relief under this act \ncan contact the OCC's consumer assistance group if they have difficulty \nwith their bank. That number is 1-800-613-6743. Right off the bat, I \ncan suggest that they need an easier number to remember. I feel as \nthough I am on television trying to sell something here--and I am. It \nis education for our service members. Again, the number is 1-800-613-\n6743.\n  I am also going to visit with my colleagues on the Veterans \nCommittee, the Banking Committee, Armed Services Committee, upon which \nI serve, and all who have jurisdiction under this act, and ask them to \nreview what Congress can do to ensure that this situation doesn't \nhappen to other military families.\n  So today I share this story to reassure our military men and women in \nuniform that we will make certain the protections provided in the \nServicemembers Civil Relief Act are enforced. This act is intended to \nensure that when a wage earner is called to active duty, their family \nhas financial security and other protections provided for in the act \nwhile they are deployed. It means a soldier fighting in Iraq can better \nfocus on his or her mission, without the added stress of wondering if \ntheir family is financially secure at home. We owe nothing less to our \nmen and women in uniform who answer the call to duty.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning because \nof the misinformation being spread, particularly through the press, in \nthe past weeks on what is called ANWR. It is the area in the 1\\1/2\\ \nmillion acres of our arctic coast that has been set aside since 1980 \nfor oil and gas development. I have been involved in this issue almost \nsince the beginning of my career. I want to talk a little bit about the \nhistory of this area.\n  In 1923, President Harding withdrew 23 million acres for the Naval \nPetroleum Reserve Number 4. That did not include the area of the arctic \nwe are dealing with today, but it was the first indication to the \nNation that there was tremendous oil and gas potential in the northern \nregion of Alaska. We were a territory then, and this withdrawal came \nright after the teapot dome scandal. So even then there were \nindications of places in the United States where there were areas that \ncould be explored or developed for oil.\n  This withdrawal was important because the Navy used a great deal of \noil. They used to take it right out of the ground in Alaska and pump it \nright into Navy vessels. They burned the real crude oil at that time. \nIt was essential to develop and use the Alaska resources for national \ndefense. The whole concept of Alaska has played a strategic role in \nnational security throughout its history, particularly beginning in \n1923. Incidentally, that was the year of my birth. So I have been \naround during this whole period.\n  In 1943, as World War II was going on, the Secretary of the Interior \nissued Public Land Order 82, which withdrew all of the public and non \npublic lands in Northern Alaska--encompassing over 48 million acres. \nOne of the reasons stated by the Secretary at that time was that \ntremendous amount of oil and gas that might be in northern Alaska were \nnecessary for use in connection with the prosecution of the war.\n  As a matter of fact, history shows that in about 1919, there was a \ngroup of people who went to the northern area of Alaska along the \narctic coast and started staking mining claims, claiming the oil in \nthose lands. That led\n\n[[Page S2508]]\n\nCongress, in 1920, to enact the Mineral Leasing Act. Particularly the \nTexans didn't want to see Alaskan oil developed through a patenting \nprocess where they didn't have to deal with the national concern.\n  As a matter of fact, it was, I think, basically the southwestern oil \nbloc that led to the two orders I mentioned. They were afraid of the \nreal development of northern Alaska. There were oil seeps all the way \nalong the arctic coast. People knew there was oil. The question was, \nwhere were the areas which could be commercially developed?\n  Public Land Order 82 was still in existence when I went to the \nInterior Department in the 1950s. I was Legislative Counsel and \nAssistant to then Secretary of the Interior Fred Seaton. At the end of \nthe Eisenhower administration, I was the Solicitor of the Interior \nDepartment.\n  I worked with Secretary Seaton at the time he decided to revoke \nPublic Land Order 82 because there were vast areas up there that we \nthought had oil and gas potential, and we wanted to get to them.\n  Our Statehood Act, which came about in 1958, required approval of the \nPresident of the United States to have any development north of the \nline, what is called the pick line. The Porcupine and Yukon Rivers \nbasically made that line. President Eisenhower, again, in the interest \nof national security, said nothing should take place, no action should \ntake place up there of a national nature without consideration of \nnational security. It took approval of the President to revoke that \nPublic Land Order 82 and to start allowing the State of Alaska to \nselect lands.\n  After Secretary Seaton had issued the order to revoke Public Land \nOrder 82, the State of Alaska did, in fact, select a portion of land \nbetween the Naval Petroleum Reserve and an area Secretary Seaton \ncreated in 1960 which was the Arctic National Wildlife Range.\n  Again I want to say, the Range, which included the 1.5 million acres \nof Arctic coast we are debating today, was created to assure the \nFairbanks Women's Garden Club that there would be protection of the \nflora and fauna of northeastern Alaska. At that time, what was not \nwithdrawn--the 25 million acres on one side of the Naval Petroleum \nReserve to the west and the Arctic wildlife range to the east--was a \ncorridor that later became known as the Prudhoe Bay area.\n  From that area, after discovery of oil in 1968, we have now produced \nover 16 billion barrels of oil, although at the time the estimate of \nthose involved in making the survey was that up to 1 billion barrels of \noil might be recoverable from this area.\n  When Secretary Seaton revoked Public Land Order 82 in 1960, he also \ncreated the 8.9-million-acre Range. I helped draw up that order. That \norder specifically permitted oil and gas activities to take place under \nstipulations to protect the fish and wildlife.\n  After the Eisenhower administration came to an end, President Kennedy \nwas elected. On the first day of that new administration, I visited \nwith Stewart Udall who was to be the new Secretary of Interior. I told \nhim the background of what we had done. His brother was in the House of \nRepresentatives. He disagreed with me about what was to happen in that \narea.\n  At the time in 1960 when we issued the order creating the Range, the \nUnder Secretary of Interior, Elmer Bennett, who used to be a staff \nmember of the Senate, assured Alaskans that ``this Department has every \nintention to foster legitimate oil and gas activity within this area, \nif any potential is discovered.''\n  There is no question about it, the Eisenhower administration strictly \napproved the concept of setting aside an area to protect the fish and \nwildlife but also mandated in the order that oil and gas leasing would \nbe protected.\n  I was appalled this last week when some of the Eisenhower family came \nforward and sort of indicated that it was the intention of President \nEisenhower that this area be a wilderness. Nothing is further from the \ntruth. That is not the truth at all. We did not withdraw a wilderness; \nwe withdrew a wildlife range.\n  I believe there is no question about this: We are heading into an \narea about which people ought to know the history. Let me go further \nthan that. As Assistant to the Secretary and then Solicitor, I studied \nthe Alaska Native claims. I was from Alaska, and Secretary Seaton, on \nthe floor of this Senate, as a Senator, made only one speech, and that \nwas a speech to urge Congress to admit Alaska into the Union as a \nState. He was committed to Alaska statehood, and he asked me to come \ndown and join him in the Department. I readily did that. Elmer Bennett, \nwho was the Under Secretary, was a friend of mine. We started off to \ndevelop the concept of getting Alaska into the Union.\n  Section 4 of the Statehood Act, which I also helped draft along with \nmy predecessor Senator Bartlett, who was a delegate from Alaska to the \nHouse of Representatives, specifically required that Congress take \naction to settle the Alaska Native land claims.\n\n  I say parenthetically, prior to that time, Alaska statehood was \ndefeated because the Alaska Native people and their representatives \nopposed statehood because they had substantial claims against the \nUnited States and they were afraid of concepts of land grants to the \nnew State that might harm them. We wrote in section 4 of the Statehood \nAct that Congress would take that act, and nothing in the Statehood Act \nwould expand or diminish the claims of Alaska Natives against the \nFederal Government.\n  During this time, my predecessors, Senators Gruening and Bartlett, \nintroduced bills to try to settle these claims. They were not enacted \nbecause they were not acceptable to Alaska Natives. When I came to the \nSenate in 1968, I started participating in the activity and introduced \nthe bill to settle Alaska Native land claims.\n  I met with President Nixon later in 1970, along with representatives \nof the Alaska Natives, in order to urge the President to come forward \nand support an enormous land settlement. President Nixon, to his \ncredit, did do that. He agreed with us. With me at the time was a \nperson named Don Wright, who was a member of the State legislature when \nI was there, a distinguished leader of the Gwich'in community.\n  We developed the concept of settling the land claims by the State and \nFederal Government participating together in a billion-dollar cash \nsettlement and the Federal Government recognizing that entitled Alaska \nNatives to 44 million acres and that those lands would come ahead of \nthe statehood selections under the Statehood Act.\n  We proceeded with the land claim settlement, and by 1971 we had a \nbill which was a very good bill. It required the approval for the first \ntime of Alaskans, who voted to accept that bill to become a State. We, \nin fact, developed a compact with the United States in our statehood \nprocess.\n  At the time in 1958 when we required the settlement by Congress, we \nrecognized there were valid claims of the Native people. My bill, along \nwith my colleague, then-Senator Gravel, brought about the settlement of \nthose claims.\n  A byproduct of that was we created a series of regional corporations \nfor the Alaska Native people. Those corporations and their village \ncorporations also--the land was separated between the village \ncorporations and the regional corporations. The net result of it was \nthat the regional corporations were subject to one unique provision I \nauthored, which was that any regional corporation that received income \nfrom resource development--it is called 7(I) in that 1971 act--was \nrequired to share those revenues with the other 11 regional \ncorporations.\n  This was very important because Don Wright, who had been with me at \nthe time of the meetings with President Nixon and represented the \nGwich'in people, decided they did not want to share. They withdrew from \nthe settlement in terms of being an area subject to the concept of a \nregional corporation, and they took the title to their lands, subject \nonly to the control and advice of the Secretary of Interior. But they \ndid not participate in the settlement in any other way. They were \nallowed to take their lands, and they got some of the cash, but they \ndid not come under 7(I).\n  I mention that because often the representatives of the Gwich'in \npeople visit this city. The Gwich'in people live on the South Slope of \nAlaska. It is the North Slope that has the oil. It is the North Slope \nthat had Prudhoe Bay. It\n\n[[Page S2509]]\n\nis the North Slope that has the Arctic coast. But the Gwich'in people, \nparticularly the Arctic village people, withdrew from the settlement \nfor the reason they thought they had the oil. They immediately tried to \nlease their lands, and no one wanted them. They also had coal, and they \nthought they should have coal development. They urged for coal \ndevelopment. No one wanted to develop their coal. Where they are \nlocated, it is almost impossible to have a corridor to the south \nwithout going east and then south. It was just not economically \nfeasible. It might be sometime in the future.\n\n  But the Gwich'in people lost out by their decision to go it alone. \nThey now come to the Congress and say do not allow the Arctic coast to \nbe developed for oil--just a few of them, not all of them. They should \nnot be listened to. The people who should be listened to are the people \nwho live in the area. One of the reasons they oppose oil and gas \ndevelopment in the Arctic plain is that they say it might hurt the \nporcupine caribou herd that comes over their lands. Those herds go over \nto the traditional area. Only a portion are Canadian natives who \nmigrated to Alaska. In Canada, that same caribou herd is subject to \ncommercial hunting. It is being depleted because of the practices in \nCanada, not because of any problem in Alaska. As a matter of fact, \nthere are years during which the caribou do not even go to the North \nSlope in Alaska because of the problems they face in Canada.\n  When the Alaska oil pipeline was authorized by Congress in the \nseventies, we heard these same arguments: The development of the \npipeline is going to destroy the caribou; it is going to destroy the \nenvironment. None of that has been true. The same people who made the \narguments then are making them now. The same organizations that collect \nmoney from Americans throughout the country now--``send in your money \nand help save the Arctic''--tried that then. The 3,000 caribou in the \narea of the pipeline are now 32,000. They have not been harmed at all. \nAlaskans do not allow our wildlife to be harmed. We will protect the \ncaribou when they do come to the Arctic coast.\n  I wonder, Mr. President, if you know that there is no oil and gas \ndrilling activity in the summertime. If there have been production \nfacilities put in during the wintertime, you can produce oil in the \nsummertime as long as you do not interfere with the wildlife. The oil \nindustry wants to do it in the wintertime because the lands are frozen. \nThey can take equipment across the lands easily. They can build ice \nroads. They can develop whatever they want and put them on pads, and \nwhen they leave, they remove the pads, and the roads thaw in the \nsummertime.\n  I challenge anyone to come up and find where the camps were to build \nthe Alaska oil pipeline. When we hear these extreme environmentalists \ntalk, one would think developing the oil and gas of the Arctic plain \nwould harm it. That is not true at all. The new technology we are using \nin oil and gas in Alaska will take an area smaller than Dulles Airport \nto develop this 1.5 million acres. But that is another thing.\n  We experienced an oil crisis in the 1970s precipitated by the Arab \noil embargo. At that time, we were importing about a third of our oil, \nand the embargo devastated our economy. Today, we import 60 percent of \nour oil. Imagine the consequences of an embargo now.\n  In the wake of this energy crisis, Congress debated the Trans-Alaska \nPipeline Authorization Act. During this debate, there was an \nunderstanding on both sides of this aisle, no filibuster.\n  The final pipeline was approved when the Vice President of the United \nStates cast his vote to break the tie of 49 to 49, but there was no \nhint of filibuster from either side. There were people on both sides \nwho disagreed with the pipeline, but they said it has to be an up-or-\ndown vote. This was important for our national security.\n  It was a national security issue because our nation needed oil. And \nthe debate we are currently having now is about oil from this area that \nis known as ANWR. It is not part of a refuge. It will not become a part \nof the refuge until the oil and gas development phase is completed. \nSometime when we have exhausted the oil resources, it will become part \nof the refuge. But today it is managed with the intent that there will \nbe oil and gas leasing there as soon as Congress approves the \nenvironmental impact statement that was passed. That was the compromise \nthat came about in 1980. So I want to skip from 1971 to 1980 by saying \nthat in the Alaska Native Land Claim Settlement Act, section 17(d)(2) \nrequired that there be a study of Alaska's lands in order that we might \ndetermine what lands should be withdrawn.\n  That debate started in 1972 and did not end until 1980. It was a \nbattle between the forces led in the House by Mo Udall and in this body \nby Senators Jackson and Tsongas. I and my colleague, Senator Gravel, \ntried our best to represent Alaska. We had a bill almost completed in \n1978. It had passed the House and the Senate and gone to conference.\n  Both Senator Gravel and I had participated in that conference. Even \nthough I was not a member of the committee at the time, they permitted \nme to be in that conference for a long period of time. After the bill \nhad passed the House in the waning moments that ended the 1978 \nCongress, Senator Gravel blocked that bill. So when we came back in \n1979, we had to go back and deal with it again.\n  After Senator Gravel blocked the bill, President Carter withdrew 100 \nmillion acres of Alaskan land under what is called the Antiquities Act. \nCongress had to pass a bill to lift that withdrawal made by President \nCarter in order that we might proceed with the development of Alaska \nand allow Alaskans to select statehood lands and the Alaskan Native \npeople to get their land claims to those lands.\n  We worked very hard and we finally got a bill that passed the Senate \nand passed the House, went to conference, and came back to the Senate. \nThis is 1980. It passed the Senate as a conference report and went to \nthe House. President Carter asked the House not to pass it before the \nelection because he disagreed with section 1002 that created the 1.5 \nmillion acres in which oil and gas development was permitted.\n  After that election, which President Carter lost, President Carter \nthen asked the House to pass the bill. That bill was signed by him \nafter the election and before he left office. In that election, \nRepublicans gained a majority of the Senate. My constituents asked me \nto do everything I could to block that bill. It had already passed the \nSenate. When the President signed it, it became law.\n  The ink was not dry before President Carter tried to renege on the \nlaw that he had just signed. Even today a letter has come now to us \nfrom President Carter. It is a letter that I am appalled at, as a \nmatter of fact. For a President to have signed a law and said he was \npart of the development of that law, but then urge us not to follow the \nlaw is amazing to me.\n  There has been a similar letter come to me, and that I have shared \nwith the Senate, and that happens to be the letter from former Senator \nJim Buckley. In the 1970s, Jim Buckley, as he left the Senate, became \none of the opponents of the development of this area. As a matter of \nfact, he had voted against it while in the Senate.\n  Unsolicited, on January 24, former Senator Buckley, now Judge \nBuckley, sent me a letter. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. He pointed out:\n\n       Twenty-six years ago, after leaving the Senate, I was a \n     lead signatory in full-page ads opposing oil exploration in \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve that appeared in the New \n     York Times and the Washington Post. I opposed it because, \n     based on the information then available, I believed that it \n     would threaten the survival of the Porcupine caribou \n     populations in the areas of Prudhoe Bay and the Alaskan \n     pipeline have increased, which demonstrates that the \n     Porcupine herd would not be threatened, and new regulations \n     limiting activities to the winter months and mandating the \n     use of ice roads and directional drilling have vastly reduced \n     the impact of oil operations on the Arctic landscape.\n       In light of the above, I have revised my views and now urge \n     approval of oil development in the 1002 Study Area for the \n     following reasons.\n\n  He lists the three reasons, and he specifically says, as he closes:\n\n       Having visited the Arctic on nine occasions over the last \n     13 years (including a recent\n\n[[Page S2510]]\n\n     camping trip on Alaska's North Slope) I don't think I can be \n     accused of being insensitive to the charms of the Arctic qua \n     Arctic. I just don't see the threat to values I cherish.\n\n  It is signed ``Sincerely, Jim.''\n  Now, that represents an informed point of view. I am now in a \nposition where I think we must address what has been said in the \nnewspapers and so many areas about the value of the oil in this area.\n  The coastal plain of ANWR is not a wilderness area. There was a test \nwell drilled in this area, the results of which remain secret under an \nagreement between the oil industry and the Federal Government. It was \ndrilled near Kaktovik.\n  When we hear people such as Senator Feingold say ANWR should not be \nin the budget resolution because the land does not have any value, he \nis wrong. The land does have value. As I said before, when we were \ntrying to develop Prudhoe Bay, the estimate was made that there was a \nbillion barrels of oil at the most in Prudhoe Bay.\n  After producing 16 billion barrels, we know there is oil on the \ncoastal plain of ANWR. There is no question that we have a duty, in the \ninterest of national security, to drill in this area.\n  The budget that is coming before us, and I will be speaking again \nnext week on this, has a provision which deals with the estimate of the \namount of money received by the Federal Government and the State in the \nfirst 5 years of the development of this area. I believe that is $5 \nbillion. Those revenues would be split between the State and the \nFederal Government. In the process of valuing what the oil might be \nworth, the value of $25 a barrel for oil has been used. I asked the \nCBO: Why do you not use the actual amount of oil today, which is over \n$50?\n  They said that was the amount used when they first made the study, \nand they have not had any studies to justify raising that now. As their \nbaseline for oil, they are using $25 a barrel.\n  So anyone who says this is not a valuable thing in the budget because \nof the money that is going to be raised ought to understand the minimum \nthat will come in will be twice that amount. People are going to \nbase their bids on the value of the oil that might be produced.\n\n  I will speak longer on this at a later date, but I want to say one \nthing. At the time President Carter signed this bill in 1980, the \nAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, I was urged to block \nit. President Carter had received about 90 percent of what he wanted in \nthis bill. By preserving rights of access to Alaskans, the right to use \ntraditional means of transportation, and protection of native peoples \nand communities, Alaskans got 10 percent. The only major difference was \nthe 1002 area.\n  The amendment that provided for the 1002 area was authored by Senator \nJackson and Senator Tsongas, not by me. It was authored by them as a \ncompromise with Alaska, and it guaranteed that we would be able to \nexplore this area that is so valuable to our future. This is the area \nthat former President Carter asks Congress now to take back, and some \nmembers of the House want to turn it into a wilderness area now.\n  After we were elected to the majority and getting ready for the \nsession in 1981, I was assistant leader. Senator Baker was the majority \nleader. I had calls from home: Change this law and change it now. I \nsaid, no. In Alaska we have a saying from Robert Service: A promise \nmade is a debt unpaid.\n  I entered into an agreement with Senator Jackson and Senator Tsongas \nthat we would accept what they and President Carter wanted, conditioned \nupon Alaska retaining its rights to explore and develop the Arctic \ncoast of Alaska. In 1981, we could have changed it. I was urged to \nchange it.\n  Now, after 24 years of arguing over this issue, and it has been \nbefore this Congress and this Senate every year since 1981, I told a \ngroup the other day I am distressed that I must argue again and again \nfor Congress to keep its promise to the Alaskan people. This year I \nwill argue that again.\n  My mind goes back to those Alaskans--they put a full page ad in the \npaper saying: Ted, come home. You no longer represent Alaska. Come home \nso someone else can change that law and get some of the things we did \nnot achieve under the 1980 act.\n  Now all we are asking is for the Congress, and particularly this \nSenate, to follow that law to allow us to proceed with this \ndevelopment. But what do we face? We face a filibuster, something that \nwas unheard of when the oil pipeline was considered. We now have the \nissue of oil exploration and development before us, and in an area even \nmore promising than Prudhoe Bay, in my judgment. We know it is a larger \nstructure under the Earth. It could contain more oil than even Prudhoe \nBay, although the estimates are lower.\n  When we look at it, the simple question before the Senate, in my \nmind, is, Is this a national security issue? Is the ability to fill the \nAlaskan oil pipeline a national security issue?\n  During the Persian Gulf war we sent 2.1 million barrels of oil a day \nto what we call the South 48, the continental U.S. Today we are sending \n900,000. The pipeline is not full. The pipeline cannot be full again \nunless we obtain the oil from the Arctic coast.\n  It is still a matter of national security. I challenge my friends who \nwant to filibuster this. I challenge the necessity to try to get 60 \nvotes to make this become a reality. That is why we have to use the \nBudget Act to try to avoid that threat of a filibuster, which did not \nexist in this Chamber on the Alaskan oil pipeline.\n  I will be back again and again, because this may be my last stand at \ntrying to convince Congress to keep its word. It is getting more \ndifficult to serve in a Senate that cannot--cannot, and will not, carry \nout commitments that were made by previous occupants of this body.\n  Thank you very much.\n\n\n                               exhibit 1\n\n                                                 January 24, 2005.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ted: Twenty-six years ago, after leaving the Senate, I \n     was a lead signatory in full-page ads opposing oil \n     exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve that \n     appeared in the New York Times and the Washington Post. I \n     opposed it because, based on the information then available, \n     I believed that it would threaten the survival of the \n     Porcupine caribou herd and leave huge, long-lasting scars on \n     fragile Arctic lands. Since the, caribou populations in the \n     areas of Prudhoe Bay and the Alaskan pipeline have increased, \n     which demonstrates that the Porcupine herd would not be \n     threatened, and new regulations limiting activities to the \n     winter months and mandating the use of ice roads and \n     directional drilling have vastly reduced the impact of oil \n     operations on the Arctic landscape.\n       In light of the above, I have revised my views and now urge \n     approval of oil development in the 1002 Study Area for the \n     following reasons:\n       1. With proper management, I don't see that any significant \n     damage to arctic wildlife would result, and none that \n     wouldn't rapidly be repaired once operation ceased.\n       2. While I don't buy the oil companies' claim that only \n     2,000 acres would be affected, even if all of the 1.5 \n     million-acre Study Area were to lose its pristine quality (it \n     wouldn't), that would still leave 18.1 million acres of the \n     ANWR untouched plus another five million acres in two \n     adjoining Canadian wildlife refuges, or an area about equal \n     to that of the States of Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, \n     and New Hampshire combined. In other words, it is simply \n     preposterous to claim that oil development in the Study Area \n     would ``destroy'' the critical values that ANWR is intended \n     to serve.\n       3. In light of the above, it is economic and (to a much \n     lesser degree) strategic masochism to deny ourselves access \n     to what could prove our largest source of a vital resource.\n       Having visited the Arctic on nine occasions over the past \n     13 years (including a recent camping trip on Alaska's North \n     Slope), I don't think I can be accused of being insensitive \n     to the charms of the Arctic qua Arctic. I just don't see the \n     threat to values I cherish.\n           With best regards,\n                                                 James L. Buckley.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I make a point of order a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/11/senate-section/article/S2510-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2510-S2513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE REAL CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this week there has been more discussion \nin the newspapers and around the country about the issue of Social \nSecurity. As you know, the President continues to move around the \ncountry holding forums on Social Security.\n\n[[Page S2511]]\n\n  One week ago today, in fact, Senator Reid and I, Senator Durbin, and \na couple of other colleagues were in New York. We held a forum in New \nYork City on Social Security. We then went to Philadelphia, PA, and \nheld a forum on Social Security. Then we flew out west and we held one \nin Phoenix, AZ, and another one in Nevada. So there has been a lot of \ndiscussion about Social Security.\n  The President originally said there was a crisis in Social Security, \nwhich seemed to me to be a strange choice of words because, in fact, \nSocial Security will be solvent until George W. Bush is 106 years old. \nLet me say that again. I think that is important. Social Security will \nremain solvent until this President reaches age 106. But he and others \nin the administration have said there is a crisis, it is going to go \nbroke, it is going to be flat busted.\n  Look, Social Security is a program that has been remarkably \nsuccessful, that has lifted tens of millions of senior citizens out of \npoverty over many years. The fact is, people are living longer, \nhealthier lives these days so we will have to make some adjustments, \nperhaps, in the future; but it is not major surgery that is required \nand it is not justification for saying there is a crisis or it is \nbankrupt or other types of language that the President and others have \nused.\n  The kind of adjustments that may have to be made--again they may not \nhave to be made if we have robust economic growth in the coming 75 \nyears--but the kinds of adjustments that may have to be made are not \nmajor. We can do that. But this ought not be a pretext for taking \nSocial Security apart and talking about privatization of Social \nSecurity.\n  I was curious about why this comes up in this context right now. I \nknow it is not about economics. President George W. Bush ran for \nCongress in 1978 and he said then that Social Security would be broke \nin 10 years, by 1988, and we ought to go to private accounts. Well, \nalmost 30 years later, he is saying the same thing. So I think this is \nnot about economics, but rather it is all about philosophy.\n  I respect the President. He has every right to have a philosophical \nobjection or philosophical concern about the Social Security Program.\n  One of the leading voices on the far conservative right said this \nrecently:\n\n       Social Security is the soft underbelly of the liberal \n     welfare state.\n\n  That is part of the political debate, I guess. If you are on the far \nright, you have a right to say that, and a right to think that, and a \nright to manifest your belief that we ought to take Social Security \napart. But I don't happen to share that. I think Social Security has \nbeen a remarkable program that every worker pays into, and when you \nretire, you get something back at a time when you have reached \ndeclining income years in your life. That is the one portion of \nretirement security you can count on.\n  In most cases you aspire to have retirement security by doing three \nthings. No. 1, you pay into Social Security for this insurance. Yes, it \nis insurance, not investment. In the FICA tax that comes out of your \npaycheck, the ``I'' is for ``insurance,'' not ``investments.'' It \nstands for insurance. So one part of retirement security is the \nguaranteed portion, Social Security. It will be there. You know it will \nbe there. You know how much it is going to be. It is the guaranteed \nportion.\n  The second part is hopefully you work for a company that offers a \npension. Only half of the American workers do, but we would like more \ncompanies to offer a pension. But that is a second part, a pension, \nprivate pension: a pension from your work.\n  The third part is private investments: 401(k)s or IRAs or the kinds \nof private investments that you make, much of which go into the stock \nmarket. I strongly support that. But that is not a pretext for taking \napart Social Security. It is one of the three legs of retirement \nsecurity: Social Security, the guaranteed portion, the portion without \nrisk; pensions from your job; and then private investment accounts, \nsuch as 401(k)s and IRAs.\n\n  We are going to have a robust discussion about this in the weeks and \nmonths ahead. It is a worthy discussion for our country to have. This \nis a great country, made better, in my judgment, because of some of the \nthings we have done to address some of our problems. When Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt saw that one-half of our senior citizens were living \nin poverty, he believed something should be done about that. So we \ncreated a Social Security Program that workers paid into and retirees \nare able to draw from, and now less than 10 percent of America's senior \ncitizens are living in poverty. Why? Why that success? Because of \nSocial Security, that is why. I think the task for all of us is to not \ntake it apart but to strengthen it and nurture it and preserve it for \nthe long term. At least that is my interest.\n  I started by talking about the fact that the President describes \nSocial Security as a crisis. It is not a crisis. However, our country \ndoes face a very real, very imminent crisis, in the area of \ninternational trade.\n  This morning it was announced by the Department of Commerce that the \ntrade deficit for the month of January was $58.3 billion. Let me say \nthat again: a $58.3 billion trade deficit in 1 month. That means nearly \nevery single day, Americans have bought about $2 billion worth of goods \nfrom other countries in excess of the amount of goods we sold those \ncountries. Said another way, every day in the month of January other \ncountries ended up owning 2 billion more dollars of our country. Their \nclaim on our country was increased by $58.3 billion, nearly $2 billion \na day, nearly $60 billion in 1 month of increased foreign claims \nagainst American assets. China and others end up owning more and more \nof our country as a result of these pernicious trade deficits.\n  We have a growing, serious, abiding crisis in our international trade \nand this country seems willing to sleep through it. By ``this country'' \nI mean the President and the Congress. They are perfectly willing to \nsleepwalk through this, while every single day and every single month \nChina and Japan and others end up owning more of America.\n  Let me describe why we have this trade deficit that is growing at an \nalarming rate, over a $600 billion trade deficit last year. Why does \nthis exist? Let me give you some examples.\n  American corporations in most cases no longer consider themselves \njust American if they are doing business around the world. They want to \nmaximize profits for their shareholders and they have discovered 1 \nbillion people in the rest of the world--1 billion out of a population \nof 6 billion--1 billion people whom they can employ quite easily for 20 \nor 30 or 40 cents an hour, because technology and capital is instantly \nmoveable now to any place on Earth.\n  That is exactly what has happened. It has happened time and time \nagain in recent years. That is why the American people who used to have \ngood manufacturing jobs have now discovered themselves all too often \njobless, and when they search for a new job they get a job that pays \nonly 70 percent or 80 percent of what their old job used to pay because \nthe good jobs are moving overseas.\n  We have a provision in our Tax Code that says if you move your jobs \noverseas--if you are a company and you shut your American manufacturing \nplant and move your American jobs overseas--we will give you a tax \nbreak. It is unbelievable, unbelievably stupid, that our country would \nhave in its Tax Code incentives for people to shut their American plant \nand move it overseas. Yet that exists. I have tried to close it here on \nthe floor of the Senate with an amendment and I have lost. But we are \ngoing to vote on that again this year and we will see whether any minds \nhave changed.\n\n  Let me give some examples of what is happening. Levis--everybody \nknows about Levis. People like to wear Levis; put on Levis for the \nweekend. Except now Levi doesn't make Levis anymore, not one. Levis \nused to be American. They made Levis in America. Then they moved Levis \nto Mexico and to other parts of the world. Now they don't make any \nLevis. All they do is contract with foreign companies who make Levis \nfor the Levi Company.\n  Fig Newton cookies. I grew up eating Fig Newton cookies. All \nAmerican, right? Want to have some Mexican food tonight? Eat a Fig \nNewton cookie because that left America. Why? Cheaper wages in \nMonterrey, Mexico. Eat a Fig Newton cookie and you are eating Mexican \nfood.\n  What about Huffy bicycles? Twenty percent of the American bike market \nis\n\n[[Page S2512]]\n\nHuffy bicycles. You buy them at Sears, Kmart, Wal-Mart. We had folks in \nOhio who made $11 an hour who made Huffy bicycles, but they got fired. \nDo you know why? Because Huffy bicycles are now made in China at 30 \ncents an hour and American workers can't compete with 30 cents an hour \nand should not have to. But nonetheless they lost their jobs and Huffy \nbicycles are now made in China to ship back to our country, so \nconsumers conceivably have an advantage of a lower cost bicycle.\n  I am not certain the bicycle costs less. I know the profits of the \nmiddlemen are inflated, and I know Americans who honored their \nmanufacturing jobs and loved their jobs got fired from their jobs \nbecause they couldn't compete with a Chinese worker working 7 days a \nweek, 12 to 14 hours a day, who is paid 30 cents an hour. That is what \nis happening to American jobs. And people say, well, that is the new \neconomy, Senator Dorgan. You just don't understand it. No. I don't. We \nspent a century, we spent 100 years in this country fighting about \nimportant things: about child labor, about whether you should go down \nto a coal mine and work next to 12-year-old kids. We decided that is \nnot fair; about whether you should expect to be able to work in a safe \nworkplace and about whether you have the right to organize in America. \nWe had people dying in the streets of this country demonstrating for \nthe right to organize. They died in the streets of America for the \nright to organize as workers and for the right to a fair wage. We went \nthrough all of those things for over a century. It was hard and tough.\n\n  Now a company can decide: You know something, we don't have to care \nabout any of that. We can hire 12-year-old kids, work them 12 hours a \nday, pay them 12 cents an hour, build a manufacturing plant, and throw \nchemicals in the water, throw chemicals in the air, and the \nmanufacturing plant doesn't have to be safe, and if the workers decide \nthey want to organize, we can fire them right now. We can get over all \nof this, we pole vault over all those issues and produce where it is \ncheaper. We are not encumbered by our ability to pollute the air and \nwater. We can fire kids and ship the products to America and have \nAmerican consumers go to Kmart, Wal-Mart, Sears, or Toledo or Fargo or \nLos Angeles or New York, and buy that product, which was in fact \nproduced by someone who took a job from the neighbor of that consumer.\n  This country has not decided whether there is an admission price in \nthe American marketplace. We sign all these trade agreements, and none \nof them is complied with at all. This country has no nerve, no \nbackbone, no will to stand up for its own economic interest. I am not \nsuggesting that we build walls around our country, but I am saying we \nought to pay some attention to the basic conditions of production that \nwe fought over for 100 years. If corporations decide, we can now go to \nBangladesh or Sri Lanka or China and ignore all of those issues and \nhave people fired if they try to organize for collective bargaining, \nthen there is something fundamentally wrong.\n  Question: Why is it that in this country we imported nearly 600,000 \nKorean cars from the country of Korea in the past year but are only \nable to sell 3800 U.S. cars in Korea? Answer: Because the Korean \ngovernment doesn't want U.S. cars in Korea. They want to ship all of \ntheir cars to America, but they don't want U.S. cars to be sold in \nKorea. And our country says that is OK; we will not do anything about \nthat. Our country doesn't have the nerve or the will to stand up for \nits own economic interest.\n  We have a dispute with Europe over beef, so our ranchers and farmers \nand others suffer as a consequence of that dispute. In a rare display \nof backbone, American negotiators decided to get tough with the \nEuropeans, by applying retaliatory tariffs. So what did they do? They \ndecided they were going to impose tariffs on truffles, goose liver, and \nRoquefort cheese. That is going to scare the devil out of our trade \nadversaries--a trade adversary that is taking advantage of us. We are \ngoing to slap tariffs on truffles, goose liver and Roquefort cheese.\n  This country has to decide finally to stand up for its economic \ninterests.\n  I haven't talked about Japan. We have had a $60 billion to $80 \nbillion trade deficit with Japan every single year, year after year \nafter year. They are guilty of horribly unfair trade with this country. \nThe same is true with China. It is even worse with China. There are \nmassive copyright violations going on, counterfeiting, and piracy. But \nin addition to that, their markets still, in many cases, are largely \nclosed to our market.\n  I have raised this issue on the floor several times, but no one seems \nto care very much about this issue of bilateral automobile trade with \nChina.\n  Let me give you an example of what recently happened. Time magazine \nsays that China is revving up a huge new automobile export industry--a \nbig industry to export automobiles from China. We just had a bilateral \ntrade agreement with China about 3 years ago, and our negotiators \nagreed to this. They said to China: You can impose a tariff on U.S. \nautomobiles we try to sell in China that is 10 times higher than we \nwould impose on automobiles China sends to us.\n\n  This is a country with which we now have a $130 billion to $140 \nbillion trade deficit, and we have a trade agreement that was \nincompetently negotiated by our negotiator, who said to China, on \nbilateral automobile trade: You can impose a tariff that is 10 times \nhigher than the tariff we will impose on Chinese automobiles coming \ninto the United States.\n  I do not know who did this, but it is unbelievably incompetent. \nSomebody ought to be fired summarily for negotiating this kind of trade \nagreement with respect to bilateral automobile trade with China.\n  This morning when the announcement was made that we had a $58.3 \nbillion trade deficit in the month of January, if this doesn't wake up \nthe White House and if this doesn't wake up this Congress, shame on all \nof us. That is an annual trade deficit of over $700 billion.\n  Warren Buffett, by the way, in his message to shareholders at \nBerkshire Hathaway this year, said what is going to happen is we are \ngoing to become a nation of sharecroppers, because every single day \nwhen we buy $1 billion more from foreign countries than we sell to \nthem, this means that China, Japan, Korea, and other countries own that \nmuch more every single day of our country, of our stocks, of our \nassets, of our real estate.\n  Even as the value of the dollar has been declining, our trade deficit \nis spiking up, up, way up, and there is no economist in this country \nwho teaches that when your currency declines, your trade deficits \nshould go up. But I think I understand why it is happening--it's \nbecause we don't have the backbone, the will, or the nerve to stand up \nfor this country's economic interests.\n  If you all read the papers last week about textiles coming in from \nChina, the first month the limits were off on textiles, you see what is \nhappening to exacerbate that dramatic increase in trade deficit with \nChina.\n  President Bush wants to travel around the country and talk about \nSocial Security, a Social Security system that will remain solvent \nuntil George W. Bush is 106 years old. There is no crisis there. But \nthere is a crisis with our trade deficit. And it requires--demands, in \nmy judgment--that this President and this Congress get serious.\n  I am sending another letter to the President, suggesting that he hold \nan emergency summit on the trade deficit.\n  This is a serious, abiding crisis that weakens our country \nsignificantly. It is all about jobs.\n  We are going to debate the budget next week. There is no social \nprogram as important as a good job that pays well. That is just a fact. \nThe fact is, good jobs are marching out of this country at an alarming \nrate, and they are moving to parts of the world where those who are \nproducing products find they can hire people for 20 cents an hour or 30 \ncents an hour.\n  Nobody wants to hear these questions much about trade, but it is \ngripping when you understand what is actually happening.\n  I talked on the floor about the young women dying in the \nmanufacturing plants in China. How about the young children who are \nmaking rugs and carpets who have their fingertips burned with \ngunpowder? They put gunpowder on their fingertips, light it with a \nmatch in order to create scarring on\n\n[[Page S2513]]\n\ntheir fingertips--these little kids that are 10 years old--so when they \nsew with needles and stick their fingertips with a needle, they can't \nfeel it because they have been scarred by burned gunpowder, so the kids \ncan continue to sew and not bleed. Then that product, that carpet, is \nsent to the United States, and someone shows up and says: I would like \nto buy that carpet, wouldn't I? It is made with slave labor, in many \ncases, with children whose hands have been burned to prevent the \nbleeding from needles to make that carpet. Is that really what we want? \nIs that really the construct of trade that we believe represents a free \nmarket? I don't think so.\n  There is much more to say, and I will say it at some future point.\n  I think today's announcement--just an hour and a half ago now--about \nthe devastating January trade deficit numbers ought to at least justify \ncalling Air Force One back to this town and asking the President to \njoin us, join labor, and join the National Association of Manufacturers \nin a meeting, a summit to talk about what on Earth we do to repair this \ntrade deficit that is just crushing to the future economic \nopportunities in this country.\n  I will have more to say. I hope that this weekend, the White House \nand the Congress will reflect on what this announcement means for the \nfuture of our country and begin to deal with the crisis that does \nexist. No, not Social Security--it is not a crisis--but the crisis \nexists in these crippling, devastating trade deficit numbers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, thank you for allowing me a few moments to \nspeak about something I care very deeply about; that is, I am going to \nintroduce a bill that would create a commemorative coin in honor of the \n50th anniversary of desegregation of Little Rock Central High School in \nLittle Rock, AR.\n  The bill I am introducing with my colleague, Senator Blanche Lincoln, \nis a companion measure to the work of our Arkansas colleague, Arkansas \nCongressman Vic Snyder.\n  Once again, Congressman Snyder has shown himself to be quiet and \neffective and really able to get things done over in the House, not \njust for our States but for our Nation.\n  Imitation is the greatest form of flattery, and I am here today to \nintroduce identical language to Congressman Snyder's H.R. 358. I was \nexcited to see that 319 members of the House of Representatives \ncosponsored Congressman Snyder's bill. It is my hope that I will have \nsimilar success in the Senate.\n  The bill requires the Secretary of the Treasury to mint a coin in \ncommemoration of the 50th anniversary of the desegregation of Little \nRock Central High School in Little Rock. I believe this will serve as a \ntimeless reminder of an event that provided a landmark change in our \nschool system.\n  Let me remind my colleagues about the desegregation crisis that took \nplace at Little Rock Central High School and why this event is so \nimportant.\n  In 1952, the Little Rock school board wanted to follow the rule of \nlaw and took the Brown v. Board of Education, Topeka, KS, case \nseriously, that momentous decision from 1954. When the U.S. Supreme \nCourt used the phrase ``all deliberate speed,'' the Little Rock school \nboard thought that it could begin to comply with the Supreme Court's \nruling beginning in the 1957 school year.\n  In 1957, nine black teenagers integrated the all white Central High \nSchool in Little Rock, AR, testing the Brown v. Board of Education \nSupreme Court decision that ultimately ended legal segregation in \nschools.\n  As these nine teenagers attempted to enter the doors of Central High, \nthey were confronted with an angry, rampaging mob. President Eisenhower \nordered Federal troops to Little Rock to end the brutal intimidation \ncampaign mounted against the black students and to uphold Brown and \nFederal law.\n  The ``Little Rock Nine''--Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, Gloria Ray \nKarlmark, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Minnijean Brown Trickey, Terrence \nRoberts, Jefferson Thomas, Thelma Mothershed Wair and Melba Pattillo \nBeals--changed the course of American history by claiming and \nexercising the right to receive an equal education.\n  They were helped in this important endeavor by civil rights pioneer \nDaisy Bates who raised public awareness of their plight.\n  Of her experience, Melba Pattillo Beals recalls:\n\n       I had to become a warrior. I had to learn not how to dress \n     the best but how to get from that door to the end of the hall \n     without dying.\n\n  Another one of those students was Ernest Green, who best explains why \nthe Little Rock Nine sacrificed their innocence for a chance at a \nbetter education. He said:\n\n       We wanted to widen options for ourselves and later for our \n     children.\n\n  Mr. Green was the first black student to graduate from Central High \nSchool. He later served as Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban \nAffairs under President Jimmy Carter and as vice president of Lehman \nBrothers.\n  Turning opportunity into achievement is what civil rights pioneer \nDaisy Bates had in mind when she led the Little Rock Nine to break down \nthe barriers that stood between them and an equal education.\n  Despite threats on her life and of financial ruin, Daisy Bates made \nsignificant strides in the courtroom and increased public awareness \nthrough the newspaper she and her husband, L.C. Bates, published.\n  As a former student of Central High--and by the way, I note that we \nhave another student of Little Rock Central High in our presence today \nas one of our pages--I can tell you the impact of the Little Rock Nine \nand Daisy Bates is still felt in my heart and in the halls of Central \nHigh.\n  The acts of courage, self-sacrifice, and grit by the Little Rock Nine \nshould be shared with our current generation and the generations to \nfollow.\n  It took nine young high school students to prove to our Nation that \n``all men are created equal'' and that the rule of law is paramount in \nthe democracy of the United States.\n  Today, children all over America have the right to learn because of \nthe courage and sacrifice of the Little Rock Nine. A commemorative coin \nwill bring national and international attention to the lasting legacy \nof this important event. With this legislation, 500,000 $1 dollar coins \nwill be minted by the Treasury.\n  These coins will be minted with symbols emblematic of the \ndesegregation of the Little Rock Central High School and its \ncontribution to civil rights in America; bear the year ``2007''; and \ninclude the inscripted words ``Liberty'', ``In God We Trust'', ``United \nStates of America'', and ``E Pluribus Unum'', which means, out of many, \none. Little Rock Central High School helped us to become one nation.\n  To cover the cost of the coins, the Secretary of Treasury shall sell \nthe coins at face value with a surcharge to cover the cost of \nproduction and design.\n  The courage of the ``Little Rock Nine'' (who stood in the face of \nviolence, was one of the defining moments of the Civil Rights movement \nand changed American history by providing a foundation upon which to \nbuild greater equality.\n  I hope that the Senate will join me in passing this measure to \ncommemorate the Little Rock Nine and the desegregation of Little Rock \nCentral High School.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill and allow the measure to \nmove forward in an effort to ensure that these extraordinary \nachievements are recorded and shared for future generations.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I rise, along with my friend, \ncolleague and fellow Arkansan, Senator Mark\n\n[[Page S2514]]\n\nPryor, to introduce a bill to direct the Treasury to mint a \ncommemorative coin in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the \nintegration of Central High School in Little Rock, AR.\n  Our colleagues in the House have led the way in this effort with a \nbill written by Representative Vic Snyder and co-sponsored by the \nentire Arkansas delegation.\n  On September 2, 1957, nine African-American students made their way \nto the front doors of Central High School in the city of Little Rock, \nAR. In our modern era, this seems like a very normal moment. And in \ntruth there is nothing particularly special about students making their \nway to school on the first day of class. However, in 1957, this was a \nNation changing event.\n  Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, Jefferson Thomas, Terrence Roberts, \nCarlotta Walls, Minnijean Brown, Gloria Ray, Thelma Mothershed and \nMelba Pattillo showed courage in the face of strong opposition. Their \nprincipled stand helped to move the State and the Nation forward as it \nmarched toward greater equality for all.\n  What happened in Little Rock almost 50 years ago is not only a \ntestament to the Little Rock Nine, but it is also a testament to those \nwho supported them. It is a testament to the people of Little Rock of \nall hues who decided that they would confront their own consciences. \nAnd it is testament to those who, upon reflecting on the matter, \ndecided that doing what is right was worth the cost.\n  Theie decision to move this Nation forward makes me proud to be an \nArkansan. It makes me proud to be an American. That's why I'm \nespecially pleased to introduce this legislation to direct the Treasury \nto issue these commemorative coins. This bill is a small token of \nrecognition of the gift that the Little Rock nine and the entire Little \nRock community has given to this Nation.\n  I believe that someone who was there can say it better than I can. At \nthe 20th anniversary of the integration of Central High, Ralph G. \nBrodie, the '57-58 student body president, spoke at a special ceremony \nwhere he paid tribute to the Little Rock Nine. He addressed the three \nof the Little Rock Nine who were present saying: ``You've done much to \nassure the rights of others. Yours were acts of courage, and I salute \nyou.''\n  I join him. I salute the Little Rock Nine and I salute those, both \nblack and white, who helped to successfully integrate Central High \nSchool.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/11/senate-section/article/S2514-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE GUN INDUSTRY IMMUNITY BILL\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am disappointed to see the Protection of \nLawful Commerce in Arms Act reintroduced. I supported the successful \neffort to defeat the gun industry immunity legislation during the 108th \nCongress and I continue to oppose the legislation.\n  The misnamed ``Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act'' would \nrewrite well-accepted principles of liability law, providing the gun \nindustry legal protections not enjoyed by other industries. In \naddition, this bill would set a dangerous precedent by terminating a \nwide range of pending and prospective civil cases against members of \nthe gun industry. It would give a single industry broad immunity from \ncivil liability and deprive many victims of gun violence with \nlegitimate cases of their day in court.\n  While most gun dealers and manufacturers conduct their business \nresponsibly, this gun industry immunity legislation would provide \nprotection from liability even in cases where gross negligence or \nrecklessness lead to someone being injured or killed.\n  The reintroduction of this bill comes after the Supreme Court \nrecently allowed a civil suit against members of the gun industry to \nprogress in California. Reportedly, the plaintiffs in this case allege \nthat the gun manufacturer being sued distributed guns to dealers who \nwere likely to sell them illegally or through largely unregulated gun \nshows. Judge Richard Paez of the Ninth Circuit wrote of this case: The \nsocial value of manufacturing and distributing guns without taking \nbasic steps to prevent these guns from reaching illegal purchasers and \npossessors cannot outweigh the public interest in keeping the guns out \nof the hands of those who in turn use them in crimes.\n  Last year, in a settlement that marked victory for the 2002 \nWashington, DC, area sniper shooting victims, Bushmaster Firearms, \nmanufacturer of the XM-15 assault rifle used in the sniper attacks, \nagreed to pay $550,000 in damages for negligence leading to criminal \nviolence in connection with the shooting spree.\n  According to reports, Bushmaster continued to sell firearms, \nincluding the XM-15 assault rifle used in the sniper shootings, to \nBull's Eye Shooter Supply in Tacoma, WA, even after several ATF audits \ndocumented the dealer's inability to responsibly account for its \ninventory of weapons. Reports indicate that 238 guns had gone missing \nfrom Bull's Eye's inventory and over 50 had been traced to criminal \nacts since 1997. The victims of the sniper shootings would have lost \ntheir ability to sue Bushmaster Firearms and Bull's Eye Shooter Supply \nhad the gun industry immunity bill become law during the 108th \nCongress.\n  If it is enacted, this bill would substantially weaken the legal \nrights of gun violence victims. In addition, other industries will \nalmost certainly line up for similar protections. This is unwise \nlegislation and it should not be adopted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/11/senate-section/article/S2514-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2514-S2515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     HOOSIER ESSAY CONTEST WINNERS\n\n Mr. LUGAR.

All the \n     ingredients for this meal are produced right here in the \n     Hoosier state!\n       First I will make the dough with flour from an Indiana \n     wheat farm. Over 10,000 farms here grow wheat, generating \n     over $91 million. There's obviously plenty of wheat here.\n       Then I will create the sauce, beginning at Etienne's Farm \n     Market in Washington for tomatoes, peppers, and onions. This \n     family farm has provided the local community with fresh \n     fruits and vegetables for over 25 years.\n       Next I will travel to Elnora for a package or two of \n     Grahams mozarella cheese from the company started by Robert \n     Graham in 1928. This excellent cheese is known statewide!\n       Now come the sausage and pepperoni. The pigs that provide \n     these toppings used to live right here on one of the many pig \n     farms in Daviess County.\n       After gathering the pizza ingredients, I turn to my side \n     dishes. Doty Orchard, also in Daviess County, provides a \n     couple of fresh peaches. A drink would be welcome, so I \n     choose a glass of fresh milk. Considering the many dairy \n     farms in Indiana, milk is no problem for a drink.\n       Now that my pizza is in the oven and the peaches are \n     sliced, let me show you just how nutritious a meal we have: \n     My feast consists of two dairy servings, two vegetable/\n     fruits, and one meat serving. Pretty healthy, if I do say so.\n       Altogether I think this pizza meal is a good source of \n     nutrition and shows just how Indiana farmers keep us healthy.\n\n     2004-2005 District Essay Winners\n\n     District 1\n     Trevor Chrzan\n     Aubri Smeltzer\n     District 2\n     Clayton Gerig\n     Tianna Stieglitz\n     District 3\n     Ty Shrontz\n     Malena Zook\n     District 4\n     Thomas (Trey) Dunn III\n     Jennifer Hunt\n     District 5\n     Carter Morgan\n     Olivia Leonard\n     District 6\n     Will Petrovic\n     Amanda Carter\n     District 7\n     Brandon Hall\n     Brittany Lechner\n     District 8\n     Peter Reding\n     Ashley Lentz\n     District 9\n     Scott Riedford\n     Alyssa Schmitt\n     District 10\n     Tevin Ewing\n     Madeline Smith\n\n     2004-2005 County Essay Winners\n\n     Adams: Clark Faurote and Jane Goebel\n     Allen: Tianna Stieglitz\n     Bartholomew: Logan Pankratz and Ashley Lentz\n     Carroll: Malena Zook\n     Cass: Ty Shrontz and Alesia Brown\n     Clark: Tevin Ewing and Madeline Smith (co-winner) Anna \n           Trotter (co-winner)\n     Clay: Brandon Hall and Megan Vansickle\n     Crawford: Corey Phipps and Tessa Weathers\n     Daviess: Brittney Lechner\n     Dearborn: Carter Grove and Becky Tyler\n     Decatur: Peter Reding\n     DeKalb: Clayton Gerig and Kassandra Wene\n     Dubois: Max Kitten and Lauren Reckelhoff\n     Elkhart: Isaac Vining and Bretta Bachert\n     Fayette: Jacob Rude and Corinne Watson\n     Floyd: John Bolander and Lauren Knight\n     Franklin: Mike Johnston and Teresa Burger\n     Gibson: Scott Riedford\n     Greene: Kyle Cooper and Brittney Rhodes\n     Hamilton: Will Petrovic and Kirsten Sobol\n     Hancock: Rachel Rominger\n     Hendricks: Alison Koelling\n     Henry: Mitchell Halcomb and Amanda Carter\n     Jackson: Caleb Hackman and Courtney Robbins\n     Jasper: Jacob Egan and Marisa Mangas\n     Jay: Thomas (Trey) Dunn III and Jennifer Hunt\n     Jennings: Kyle Hatfield and Linzi Firsich\n     Johnson: Joseph Clady and Alexis Bridges\n     LaGrange: Ryan Lewis and Kara Miller\n     Lake: Daniel Klipper and Kathryn Alleva\n     LaPorte: Jackson Troxel and Aubri Smeltzer\n     Marion: Michael Frost and Brynne Thompson\n     Monroe: Jill Parrott\n     Morgan: Olivia Leonard\n     Newton: Scott Shedrow and Caitlyn Yana\n     Posey: Justin Collins and Alyssa Schmitt\n     Pulaski: Trevor Chrzan and Sabrina Tanner\n     St. Joseph: Jack Chartier and Rebecca Knabenshue\n     Scott: Brett Mayer and Morgan Means\n     Starke: Michael Okray and Katie Kensinger\n     Sullivan: Travis Robbins\n     Switzerland: Beth Abbott\n     Tippecanoe: Elizabeth Byers\n     Tipton: Brock McVeigh and Stephanie Fidler\n     Vermillion: Carter Morgan and Rayven Randolph\n     Vigo: Nathan Thornton and Kayelene Linkenheld\n     Wabash: Neil Bever and Addie Ratcliff\n     Warrick: Clay Wildt and Mackenzie Castleman\n     Washington: Michael Baird\n     Wayne: Jake Sheard and Megan Jester\n     White: Zach Minnicus and Carrie Firkins.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/11/senate-section/article/S2515-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2515-S2517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    BANKRUPTCY ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2005\n\n\n                    credit card company disclosures\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I would like to express my \nconcerns about certain practices of the credit card industry. I am \nespecially concerned about the disclosures credit card companies make \nto their customers. While I am pleased that the bankruptcy reform bill \nincludes new disclosure obligations for credit card companies, I would \nlike to see the Banking Committee examine the credit card industry and \nconsider the need for further reform of the regulations governing the \ncredit card industry.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, through the course of the debate on the \nbankruptcy reform bill, it has become clear there are many Senators who \nhave concerns about the numerous aspects of the credit card industry. I \nwant to point out that I am aware of the Senator from Ohio's concerns \nin particular. I want to indicate for the Record that I recognize these \nconcerns and to note that I have had a longstanding interest in \nexploring these matters more deeply. Therefore, I am willing to commit \nto holding hearings in the Banking Committee later this year to examine \nthe credit card industry and the need to reform credit card \nregulations. I believe the ranking member also shares my interest in \nholding hearings.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Chairman Shelby, I share your interest in holding \nhearings on the credit card industry and would hope that we might hear \nfrom all those Senators who have expressed an interest and may wish to \ntestify before the committee.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I would like to thank the chairman and \nranking member of the Banking Committee for their acknowledgment of my \nconcerns. I also appreciate their interest in this matter and believe \nthat these are serious issues that merit further attention. I look \nforward to working with the chairman and ranking member in examining \nthese issues associated with practices in the credit card \nindustry.\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, while I strongly believe that \nCongress should act to fix the problems in our bankruptcy system, I \nalso believe that this bill is misguided and deeply flawed.\n  This bankruptcy bill fundamentally fails to accord with the \ntraditional purposes of bankruptcy, which recognize that we are all \nbetter off when hard-working people who have suffered financial \ncatastrophe get a ``fresh start'' and a second chance to become \nproductive and contributing members of society. With the passage of \nthis legislation, which makes obtaining this fresh start more expensive \nand more difficult, we are ensuring that many responsible Americans \nwill continue to be buried under mountains of debt, and unable to take \nback control and responsibility for their lives.\n  Our Nation's bankruptcy law developed out of a recognition that the \nworld can be a competitive, often unforgiving place. Bankruptcy reform \nshould therefore be directed toward creating a civil society in which \nvaluing individual responsibility is not incompatible with admitting \nthe enduring truth that sometimes bad things happen to responsible, \nhardworking people. Sometimes, conscientious Americans need help and \nsupport against forces that are too big for them to stand against \nalone. It should be about making sure that both large corporations and \nindividual citizens are held to the same standards of responsibility \nand accountability.\n\n[[Page S2516]]\n\n  This bill is flawed in a number of ways. But I want to begin by \ncommenting on one of its most distressing elements. As many people \nknow, I have long been concerned about the burdens placed on America's \nfamilies by a lack of health care insurance and by rising healthcare \ncosts. In this bill, the Senate had an opportunity to take one \nimportant step to help citizens driven to the point of bankruptcy by \nunavoidable medical problems. Instead, the Senate rejected this \nopportunity to lighten the load on Americans dealing with the twin \nblows of medical and financial difficulties.\n  The Senate's failure to act is all the more striking to me today, \nbecause I must submit this statement into the Record while attending to \na medical situation in my own family. Fortunately, my family is well-\ninsured, and we are not in danger of losing that coverage. I am deeply \naware and profoundly grateful for the good fortune we enjoy in having \naccess to quality medical care in the face of significant medical \nneeds.\n  And I know that many American families are not so lucky. Indeed, \namong those Americans whose illnesses led to bankruptcy, 75.7 percent \nof them had insurance at the onset of the illness. Employees with \nserious long-term illnesses often lose their jobs, which means they \nalso lose their health insurance.\n  Medical bankruptcy has skyrocketed in recent decades. In 1981, only 8 \npercent of personal bankruptcy filings were due to a serious medical \nproblem. By contrast, a recent study by researchers from Harvard Law \nSchool and Harvard Medical School found that half of personal \nbankruptcies filed in this country are now due to medical expenses.\n\n  In this bill, the majority simply refuses to acknowledge this current \ncrisis of medical bankruptcy. It refuses to acknowledge that sometimes \nmedical disaster strikes. ``Life Happens.'' The family breadwinner is \nstruck down by illness, and the entire family's financial future veers \ntoward collapse.\n  This is not a rare occurrence; we all know people who have endured \nhardships like medical emergencies that break the bank, layoffs, or \nvanishing pension plans. These are the people the bankruptcy laws are \ndesigned to protect. They are facing hardships because of forces \noutside of their control.\n  I support real reform that would hold accountable people driven into \nbankruptcy because of their own irresponsibility. But the evidence \nshows that the vast majority of chapter 7 bankruptcy filers are not \nspendthrifts who have run up ther--it cards buying luxury goods. And \nthis bill primarily targets the vast majority of chapter 7 bankruptcy \nfilers who have lived responsibly but are nonetheless facing financial \nruin because of the unavoidable vicissitudes of life.\n  The world has changed since this bill was first considered in 2001. \nDuring the past 4 years, workers have sustained unprecedented job \nlosses, endured termination of pension plans, and faced wage cuts and \nelimination of health care and other benefits as a result of their \nemployer's bankruptcy.\n  Many of these bankruptcies have been the direct result of wrongdoing \nby corporate mismanagement. The people who take the biggest hit when \nbig companies go bankrupt aren't the top executives, but the ordinary \nemployees whose pensions and healthcare coverage disappear overnight.\n  In the last 4 years, the global economy has become relentless. \nWorkers are living with more employment insecurity, and many have to \nretrain mid-career to adjust to the changing dynamics of the American \neconomy.\n  We are now a nation at war. And at a time when they are carrying the \nburden of sending loved ones off to war, military families have become \nthe victims of payday loans charged at 400 percent interest, insurance \nscams, and other forms of financial chicanery that leave them \neconomically devastated.\n  Yet this bill does nothing to help these responsible Americans who \nsuddenly find themselves in dire financial straits. In fact, it makes \nthings harder for these individuals to find refuge in bankruptcy. Why \nis the majority committed to making things harder?\n  Many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle have asked this \nquestion and have received no real answer. So the bottom line is that \nthis bill's proponents, while touting the need for bankruptcy reform \nand accountability, are willing to address only part of the problem, \ndealing only with the most vulnerable in our society, and leaving the \nreform of corporate bankruptcies on the sidelines, requiring no \nadditional accountability with respect to our Nation's companies.\n\n  A number of my colleagues in the minority offered amendments in an \neffort to address many of these changed circumstances, but amendment \nafter amendment was rejected. I simply cannot understand why the \nRepublican majority gave instructions to its caucus to oppose any and \nall amendments, no matter how reasonable they were or the circumstances \nthey were designed to address.\n  I find even more disturbing the fact that the majority refused to \nmore appropriately address the special needs of our troops in the \ncontext of this legislation. I am baffled by the majority's rejection \nof Senator Durbin's ``G.I. Protection Amendment,'' which I was proud to \nco-sponsor, and which was also supported by the Military Officers \nAssociation of America, the Air Force Sergeants Association, the \nNational Association for the Uniformed Services, and the Enlisted \nAssociation of the National Guard of the United States, among other \norganizations. I can't understand why the entire Senate didn't \ncosponsor this amendment to better protect our men and women in uniform \nand their families. It is troubling and incomprehensible to me that \nmost of my colleagues would refuse to vote for it.\n  And while refusing to support an amendment that would have helped \nmilitary families in a meaningful way, the majority of the Senate had \nno problem rejecting an amendment that was designed to make it harder \nfor millionaires to hide their assets from creditors, even after filing \nfor bankruptcy.\n  Even though there appears to be a near universal recognition that the \nbankruptcy law contains a major loophole, one that enables wealthier \nAmericans who file for bankruptcy to shield their assets through what \nare called ``asset protection trusts,'' a majority of the Senate \nrejected a meaningful amendment to close that loophole.\n  To make matters even worse, yesterday the Senate, again led by the \nRepublican leadership, rejected an amendment offered by Senator \nKennedy, which would have outlawed unlimited homestead exemptions. This \nwould have prevented the wealthiest Americans from avoiding \nresponsibility by hiding their assets from creditors.\n  The Senate also rejected an amendment that was intended to reinsert \nlanguage that had been in the legislation the Senate passed in 2001, \nwhich would have prevented the discharge in bankruptcy of all liability \nfor willful violation of protective orders and violent protests of \nproviders of lawful services, such as reproductive health services.\n  Even though this language was in the 2001 Senate-passed bill, it is \nconspicuously absent from the bankruptcy bill that the Senate is now \nconsidering 4 years later.\n  In other words, bill proponents, led by the Republican leadership, \nhave called for additional significant financial accountability, but \nnot if you are a corporate entity, not if you are wealthy, and not if \nyou are an organization that a court has found to have violated the law \nand infringed upon the rights of others.\n  Almost without exception, the majority has voted across the board \nagainst these and other amendments, apparently under strict orders from \nthe Republican leadership to oppose any and all amendments, regardless \nof whether the amendments were designed to help our troops, to remove \nloopholes for millionaires, to help families facing medical and \nfinancial crisis. This is the antithesis of the American and family \nvalues that many of my colleagues so like to talk about.\n  This legislation, especially after refusal, after refusal, after \nrefusal to support amendments to improve it, is unfair and unjust.\n  In short, the legislation that the Senate is voting on today, could \nhave, with more careful and good-faith consideration, been a vehicle in \nwhich we could have thoughtfully addressed abuses in\n\n[[Page S2517]]\n\nthe bankruptcy process by both consumers and corporations. \nUnfortunately, the Senate leadership chose to go down a different road.\n  Because of unforeseen and unavoidable circumstances, I will not be \npresent when the Senate votes on final passage of this bill today. But \nwere I able to be here, I would vote no, because this bill is clearly \nnot in the best interests of the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/11/senate-section/article/S2517-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. DOMENICI, from the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources, with amendments:\n       S. 263.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nauthorize expansion of medicare coverage of medical nutrition therapy \nservices; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in this day of runaway medical costs, I \nwould like to take a moment to highlight one cost-effective component \nof healthcare; Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT). MNT can be used to \npromote health and functionality and effects the quality of life for \nmany Americans. MNT is also an effective disease management component \nthat lessens chronic disease risk, slows disease progression and \nreduces symptoms. Currently, Medicare beneficiaries can have access to \nMNT, but only for the care of diabetes and kidney disease.\n  The legislation that I have introduced, along with Mr. Bingaman and \nother colleagues, would give the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \nServices the authority, using the National Coverage Determination (NCD) \nprocess, to expand the MNT benefit beyond diabetes and renal diseases. \nCurrently, Congress must pass legislation for beneficiaries to receive \nMNT for each and every condition or disease for which MNT proves itself \nto be cost effective. Choosing to rely on the NCD process would allow \nCMS to make decisions based upon the science, and establish the extent \nto which Medicare will cover specific services, procedures or \ntechnologies on a national basis. This is what the NCD is designed to \ndo.\n  CMS reported to Congress last year that there are other conditions, \nsuch as hypertension and dyslipidemia, HIV/AIDS and cancer, where \nevidence supports the cost-effectiveness of MNT as part of the care \nplan. It is time to make the MNT benefit more preventive in nature, and \ncombat diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia in the early stages of \nthe diseases. It makes good sense for CMS, which routinely reviews the \nscience behind recommendations, to direct this benefit appropriately \nwithout having to get Congressional approval for each and every \ndisease.\n  It is important to note that this new language does not mandate any \nexpansion; it only gives CMS the authority in include coverage of MNT \nbased on scientific evidence that the proposed coverage is reasonable, \nnecessary and cost effective. I encourage your support for this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Voinovich, and Mr. \n        Bond):\n  S. 606. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to eliminate methyl \ntertiary butyl ether from the United States fuel supply, to increase \nproduction and use of renewable fuel, and to increase the Nation's \nenergy independence, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, last weekend I joined four of my colleagues \nto travel to Alaska, to see first-hand the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge.\n\n[[Page S2522]]\n\nIt's not a welcoming place--it's cold and icy; vast and empty . . . \neven the Caribou didn't notice our presence. But beneath the icy tundra \nis one of the largest oil fields in the world--an oil field so vast it \ncould power the State of South Dakota for centuries.\n  This week the Senate is moving forward on legislation to explore \nANWR. This is just one piece of finally passing a national energy \npolicy and reducing our dependence on foreign sources of oil.\n  We cannot act fast enough: This week gas prices hit record highs. And \nwith oil hovering around $55 per barrel and threatening to move even \nhigher, it's critical that the Senate act to reduce America's \ndependence on foreign sources oil.\n  ANWR is one piece of the solution. But equally important--and even \nmore important to my State of South Dakota--is investing in renewable \nfuels like ethanol.\n  It is time for the United States Senate to pass the Renewable Fuels \nStandard.\n  The Renewable Fuels Standard has languished for too long. Despite \nstrong bipartisan support and private-sector agreements, past \nCongresses have failed to pass a national energy policy that includes a \nRenewable Fuels Standard. Now, we have another opportunity.\n  This legislation has a special importance to my State. South Dakota \nis a heavily agricultural State and the Nation's fifth largest producer \nof ethanol. The market for ethanol has breathed new life into the small \ntowns and small farms that dot the prairies of South Dakota. When \ndriving through the rural counties of South Dakota, it's not unusual to \nobserve the silos and storage tanks of an ethanol plant silhouetted \nagainst the prairie horizon. In many ways, the ethanol industry and its \nphysical manifestations have become a part of the rural American \nidentity.\n  Make no mistake about it: South Dakota's farmers are relying on the \npassage of the Renewable Fuels Standard to provide a surge in corn \nprices and a guaranteed market for their product.\n  This legislation is an improvement upon what passed out of the United \nStates Senate last Congress. It increases the ethanol gallon \nrequirement to 6 billion gallons, an increase of 1 billion gallons.\n  As we have a tremendous opportunity and responsibility to move this \ncountry forward. This legislation is vital to the ethanol industry, and \nwill strengthen our economy, and our energy security. After so many \nfailed attempts to pass this important legislation, I hope this Senate \nwill finally finish the job and pass a Renewable Fuel Standard.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 607. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with respect to early \nretirement benefits, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that will \nprevent workers from losing a large chunk of their pension when they \nwork for a company that sells their division.\n  This legislation is prompted by articles written by Mary Williams \nWalsh in the New York Times outlining the story of how a group of \nworkers in Olean, NY lost $25 million in promised benefits when their \ndivision was acquired and then spun off.\n  Current law says that if a company wants to amend their pension plan, \nthey have to give workers the share of their early retirement subsidy \nthat they have already earned. However, a company doesn't have to do \nthat if your division is bought and sold--even if the workers are in \nthe same building, sitting at the same desk, and doing the same job the \nwhole time. That's just ridiculous.\n  In this case, Halliburton purchased a division of Dresser Industries, \nand seventeen months later spun off the Olean, NY division, netting \n$215 million. They treated those employees as if they had resigned and \ngone to work for Ingersoll-Rand. While employees who were 55 years old \nwere kept whole, anyone younger lost up to half the value of their \npension overnight, without being informed. They realized what had \nhappened in June 2002 when they got notices in the mail telling them \nthat they had 90 days to either collect a much smaller benefit than \nthey had anticipated, or lose their right to a lump sum payment \nforever. Some recent retirees were even told that they got paid too \nmuch, and had to give back pension money they already received.\n  Meanwhile, the CEO during that period, now Vice President Dick \nCheney, got a special pension deal from the board totaling an estimated \n$10 million in benefits, even though he hadn't worked there long enough \nto qualify for a pension under the usual rules.\n  This is a completely unconscionable way to cheat hard working people \nout of their promised pension benefits.\n  My will would simply require that companies must follow the same \nrules about applying credits toward pension under mergers and \nacquisitions that they do under any other kind of pension plan \namendment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 608. A bill to create an independent office in the Department of \nLabor to advocate on behalf of pension participants, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to reintroduce a bill originally \nintroduced in the 106th Congress that seeks to create an Office of \nPension Participant Advocacy at the Department of Labor.\n  When I first introduced this bill, it was just a good idea. Now, it \nhas become an absolute necessity. Since 2000, unimaginable pension loss \nhorror stories have cropped up in the wake of major corporate \nbankruptcies like Enron and WorldCom. People have lost their guaranteed \npensions to mergers and acquisitions and to misinformation and to just \nplain irresponsibility.\n  On March 3, the New York Times reported that companies are still \ndesperately seeking ways to scrape funds out of their pensions--despite \nmarket downfalls and despite the dire situation at the Pension Benefit \nGuarantee Corporation. And who ultimately ends up paying the price when \nthe company ends up bailing on its obligation? Pension plan \nparticipants pay.\n  Many of these people have absolutely nowhere to turn. People who have \na genuine legal claim to their pension, but have been unfairly denied \nit, can end up spending countless hours calling phone number after \nphone number and getting the run around, and maybe receiving technical \nassistance years later.\n  Individual pension plans are complex, as are the laws that govern \nthem. Currently, multiple Federal agencies share jurisdiction over \npension law. Time and time again, the needs of pension participants are \nignored, and pensioners don't get help in navigating the government's \npension bureaucracy.\n  This office would accelerate good public policy. Several years ago, I \nheard from an employee of a large technology manufacturer that gave \nearly retirees the choice between taking either an annuity of $1,470 \nper month, or an annuity of $200 per month plus $107,300 as a lump sum, \nboth payable at age 55. While the lump sum package may appear more \nlucrative at first glance, the annuity option for a given employee had \na value of approximately $228,000--more than 80 percent greater than \nthe lump sum option touted by the employer.\n  I also heard from a 53 year old man with 26 years of service. He \nshared with me the complicated summary of his pension options he \nreceived from his employer. The first line offers a $423,000 lump sum, \nwhich looks like it is based on the value of the $3,140 per month \nannuity he would normally receive. However, the true actuarial value of \nthe annuity option turns out to be closer to $511,000. Stated another \nway, the $423,000 lump sum offer is equivalent to a monthly benefit of \n$2,590, almost $500 a month less than the annuity option would provide. \nPeople lost half the value of their pensions to this kind of \nmisinformation, many of whom never found out how they had been hurt.\n  Hearing stories like that prompted me to write to the Treasury \nrequesting that they close this loophole and require that employees get \nan apples-to-apples comparison of their benefits, and Treasury did. \nHowever, how many fewer people would have been given misleading \ninformation about their pensions if there were someone within the \ngovernment specifically charged with seeking out problems like these?\n\n[[Page S2523]]\n\n  In the years that I have been working to fight age discriminatory \npractices sometimes used when converting from traditional defined \nbenefit plans to cash balance pensions, I heard from a number of people \nwho lost huge amounts of money in their pensions to ``wear away,'' \nagain, often not realizing what had happened to them until their nest \negg was gone.\n  For example, take Larry Cutrone. He was one of thousands of people \nwho figured out how much they lost in their cash balance conversion. He \nsaid that before AT converted his pension, it was valued at $350,000. \nAfter the conversion, in July 1997, the value dropped to $138,000. The \ncalculation period for his pension was frozen at 1994-1996 salaries, so \nno value to his retirement account was added for any years he worked \nafter the conversion.\n  He said:\n\n       In September 2001, I was ``downsized'' out of AT and \n     decided to take my pension. I discovered that it translated \n     into an annual income of just $23,444 instead of the $47,303 \n     income under the old plan.\n       When these plans were changed over, workers were not \n     informed that this could happen. They woke up one day and \n     found out: they have less than 50 percent of what they \n     thought they were going to get in their retirement.\n\n  Good public policy on pensions should never, ever have allowed that. \nPeople need someone on their side, because large corporations have \nplenty of people on their side.\n  This office would not only provide technical assistance to \nparticipants, but would serve as a voice to advocate for participants' \nrights in general within the Administration. Corporations who cheat \nemployees out of their pensions should not be able to wait for a \nretiree to notice that they've been taken. There should be someone in \nthe Federal government actively pursuing companies who use their \nemployees' pension plans as their own private piggy bank.\n  The Office of Pension Participant Advocacy created in this bill \nwould: actively seek out information and suggestions on pension \npolicies and on Federal agencies which affect pension participants.\n  Evaluate the efforts of Federal agencies, businesses and industry to \nassist pension participants.\n  Identify significant problems faced by employees and retirees.\n  Make annual recommendations documenting significant pension problems \nand recommending legislative and regulatory solutions.\n  And examine existing pension plans and determine the extent to which \ncurrent law serves pensioners in those plans.\n  We need one central place where pension participants can turn to when \nproblems arise. We need one place in government whose sole obligation \nis to look out for the general pension interests of employees and \nretirees concerning their pensions. We need an office that will be an \nadvocate for pension participants. For that reason, I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this critical legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TALENT (for himself, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Thune, Mr. Johnson, \n        Mr. Coleman, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 610.

APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ALLOCATIONS \n                   AND AGGREGATES.\n\n       (a) Application.--Any adjustments of allocations and \n     aggregates made pursuant to this resolution shall--\n       (1) apply while that measure is under consideration;\n       (2) take effect upon the enactment of that measure; and\n       (3) be published in the Congressional Record as soon as \n     practicable.\n       (b) Effect of Changed Allocations and Aggregates.--Revised \n     allocations and aggregates resulting from these adjustments \n     shall be considered for the purposes of the Congressional \n     Budget Act of 1974 as allocations and aggregates contained in \n     this resolution.\n       (c) Budget Committee Determinations.--For purposes of this \n     resolution--\n       (1) the levels of new budget authority, outlays, direct \n     spending, new entitlement authority, revenues, deficits, and \n     surpluses for a fiscal year or period of fiscal years shall \n     be determined on the basis of estimates made by the \n     appropriate Committee on the Budget; and\n       (2) such chairman may make any other necessary adjustments \n     to such levels to carry out this resolution.\n\n     SEC. 406. ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT CHANGES IN CONCEPTS AND \n                   DEFINITIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the Senate, upon the enactment of a \n     bill or joint resolution providing for a change in concepts \n     or definitions, the appropriate chairman of the Committee on \n     the Budget shall make adjustments to the levels and \n     allocations in this resolution in accordance with section \n     251(b) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control \n     Act of 1985 (as in effect prior to September 30, 2002).\n       (b) Pell Grants.--\n       (1) Budget authority.--In the Senate, if appropriations of \n     discretionary new budget authority enacted for the Federal \n     Pell Grant Program are insufficient to cover the full cost of \n     Pell Grants in the upcoming award year, adjusted for any \n     cumulative funding surplus or shortfall from prior years, the \n     budget authority counted against the bill for the Pell Grant \n     Program shall be equal to the adjusted full cost.\n       (2) Application.--This subsection shall apply only to new \n     Pell Grant awards approved in legislation for award year \n     2006-2007 and subsequent award years and shall not apply to \n     the cumulative shortfall through award year 2005-2006.\n       (3) Estimates.--The estimate of the budget authority \n     associated with the full cost of Pell Grants shall be based \n     on the maximum award and any changes in eligibility \n     requirements, using current economic and technical \n     assumptions and as determined pursuant to scorekeeping \n     guidelines, if any.\n\n     SEC. 407. LIMITATION ON LONG-TERM SPENDING PROPOSALS.\n\n       (a) Congressional Budget Office Analysis of Proposals.--The \n     Congressional Budget Office shall, to the extent practicable, \n     prepare an estimate of the costs in each of the four 10-year \n     periods beginning in fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year \n     2055, for each bill or resolution of a public character, \n     except measures within the jurisdiction of the Committee on \n     Appropriations, causing a net increase in direct spending in \n     excess of $5,000,000,000 in any of the four 10-year periods, \n     and shall submit to the committee the estimate of the costs \n     of the legislation.\n       (b) In the Senate.--It shall not be in order to consider \n     any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference \n     report that would cause a net increase in direct spending in \n     excess of $5,000,000,000 in any of the four 10-year periods \n     beginning in 2015 through 2055, as measured against current \n     law out-year estimates prepared by the Congressional Budget \n     Office.\n       (c) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended only \n     by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members, duly \n     chosen and sworn.\n       (d) Appeals.--An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required to sustain \n     an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order \n     raised under this section.\n       (e) Determinations of Budget Levels.--For purposes of this \n     section, the levels of net direct spending shall be \n     determined on the basis of estimates provided by the \n     Committee on the Budget of the Senate.\n       (f) Sunset.--This section shall expire on September 30, \n     2010.\n\n     SEC. 408. EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.\n\n       Congress adopts the provisions of this title--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and the House, respectively, and as such they shall be \n     considered as part of the rules of each House, or of that \n     House to which they specifically apply, and such rules shall \n     supersede other rules only to the extent that they are \n     inconsistent therewith; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change those rules (so far as they relate to \n     that house) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same \n     extent as in the case of any other rule of that House.\n\n                      TITLE V--SENSE OF THE SENATE\n\n     SEC. 501. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING UNAUTHORIZED \n                   APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should--\n       (1) preclude consideration of any bill, joint resolution, \n     motion, amendment, or conference report that would provide an \n     appropriation, in whole or in part, for programs not \n     specifically authorized by law or Treaty stipulation, or the \n     amount of which exceeds the amount specifically authorized by \n     law or Treaty stipulation, or that would provide a limited \n     tax benefit as defined by the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 \n     (Public Law 104-130), and\n       (2) determine a method for effectively containing the \n     extraordinary growth in unauthorized earmarks.\n\n     SEC. 502. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING A COMMISSION TO \n                   REVIEW THE PERFORMANCE OF PROGRAMS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that a commission should be \n     established to review Federal agencies, and programs within \n     such agencies, with the express purpose of providing Congress \n     with recommendations, and legislation to implement those \n     recommendations, to realign or eliminate Government agencies \n     and programs that are wasteful, duplicative, inefficient, \n     outdated, irrelevant, or have failed to accomplish their \n     intended purpose.\n\n     SEC. 503. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TRICARE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should provide \n     sufficient funding to the Department of Defense to offer \n     members of the\n\n[[Page S2530]]\n\n     Reserve Component continuous access to TRICARE, for a \n     premium, regardless of their activation status.\n\n     SEC. 504. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING RESTRAINING MEDICAID \n                   GROWTH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Medicaid program provides essential health care and \n     long-term care services to more than 50,000,000 low-income \n     children, pregnant women, parents, individuals with \n     disabilities, and senior citizens. It is a Federal guarantee \n     that ensures the most vulnerable will have access to needed \n     medical services.\n       (2) Medicaid provides critical access to long-term care and \n     other services for the elderly and individuals living with \n     disabilities, and is the single largest provider of long-term \n     care services. Medicaid also pays for personal care and other \n     supportive services that are typically not provided by \n     private health insurance or Medicare, but are necessary to \n     enable individuals with spinal cord injuries, developmental \n     disabilities, neurological degenerative diseases, serious and \n     persistent mental illnesses, HIV/AIDS, and other chronic \n     conditions to remain in the community, to work, and to \n     maintain independence.\n       (3) Medicaid supplements the Medicare program for more than \n     6,000,000 low-income elderly or disabled Medicare \n     beneficiaries, assisting them with their Medicare premiums \n     and co-insurance, wrap-around benefits, and the costs of \n     nursing home care that Medicare does not cover. The Medicaid \n     program spent nearly $40,000,000,000 on uncovered Medicare \n     services in 2002.\n       (4) Medicaid provides health insurance for more than \\1/4\\ \n     of America's children and is the largest purchaser of \n     maternity care, paying for more than \\1/3\\ of all the births \n     in the United States each year. Medicaid also provides \n     critical access to care for children with disabilities, \n     covering more than 70 percent of poor children with \n     disabilities.\n       (5) More than 16,000,000 women depend on Medicaid for their \n     health care. Women comprise the majority of seniors (71 \n     percent) on Medicaid. Half of nonelderly women with permanent \n     mental or physical disabilities have health coverage through \n     Medicaid. Medicaid provides treatment for low-income women \n     diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer in every State.\n       (6) Medicaid is the Nation's largest source of payment for \n     mental health services, HIV/AIDS care, and care for children \n     with special needs. Much of this care is either not covered \n     by private insurance or limited in scope or duration. \n     Medicaid is also a critical source of funding for health care \n     for children in foster care and for health services in \n     schools.\n       (7) Medicaid funds help ensure access to care for all \n     Americans. Medicaid is the single largest source of revenue \n     for the Nation's safety net hospitals, health centers, and \n     nursing homes, and is critical to the ability of these \n     providers to adequately serve all Americans.\n       (8) Medicaid serves a major role in ensuring that the \n     number of Americans without health insurance, approximately \n     45,000,000 in 2003, is not substantially higher. The system \n     of Federal matching for State Medicaid expenditures ensures \n     that Federal funds will grow as State spending increases in \n     response to unmet needs, enabling Medicaid to help buffer the \n     drop in private coverage during recessions. More than \n     4,800,000 Americans lost employer-sponsored coverage between \n     2000 and 2003, during which time Medicaid enrolled an \n     additional 8,400,000 Americans.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Finance Committee shall not report a reconciliation \n     bill that achieves spending reductions that would--\n       (1) undermine the role the Medicaid program plays as a \n     critical component of the health care system of the United \n     States;\n       (2) cap Federal Medicaid spending, or otherwise shift \n     Medicaid cost burdens to State or local governments and their \n     taxpayers and health providers, forcing a reduction in access \n     to essential health services for low-income elderly \n     individuals, individuals with disabilities, and children and \n     families; or\n       (3) undermine the Federal guarantee of health insurance \n     coverage Medicaid provides, which would threaten not only the \n     health care safety net of the United States, but the entire \n     health care system.\n\n     SEC. 505. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TRIBAL COLLEGES AND \n                   UNIVERSITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) American Indians from over 250 federally recognized \n     tribes nationwide attend tribal college and universities, a \n     majority of whom are first-generation college students.\n       (2) Tribal colleges and universities are located in some of \n     the most isolated and impoverished areas in the Nation and \n     are the Nation's most poorly funded institutions of higher \n     education. While the Tribally Controlled College or \n     University Assistance Act, or ``Tribal College Act'' provides \n     funding based solely on Indian students, the colleges have \n     open enrollment policies providing access to postsecondary \n     education opportunities to all interested students, about 20 \n     percent of whom are non-Indian. With rare exception, tribal \n     colleges and universities do not receive operating funds from \n     their respective States for these non-Indian State resident \n     students. Yet, if these same students attended any other \n     public institutions in their States, the State would provide \n     basic operating funds to the institution.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) this resolution recognizes the funding challenges faced \n     by tribal colleges, and universities and assumes that \n     equitable consideration will be provided to them through \n     funding of the Tribally Controlled College or University \n     Assistance Act, the Equity in Educational Land Grant Status \n     Act, title III of the Higher Education Act of 1965, and the \n     National Science Foundation, Department of Defense, and \n     Housing and Urban Development Tribal College and University \n     Programs; and\n       (2) such equitable consideration reflects Congress intent \n     to continue to work toward statutory Federal funding \n     authorization goals for tribal colleges and universities.\n\n     SEC. 506. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING SUPPORT FOR THE \n                   PRESIDENT'S REQUEST TO CONCENTRATE FEDERAL \n                   FUNDS FOR STATE AND LOCAL HOMELAND SECURITY \n                   ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS ON THE HIGHEST THREATS, \n                   VULNERABILITIES, AND NEEDS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress supports the \n     President's request to ``Concentrat[e] Federal funds for \n     State and local homeland security assistance programs on the \n     highest threats, vulnerabilities, and needs.''.\n\n     SEC. 507. SENSE OF THE SENATE REJECTING PROPOSED ELIMINATION \n                   OF PER DIEM REIMBURSEMENT TO STATE NURSING \n                   HOMES IN THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should reject \n     the President's proposal to eliminate per diem payments to \n     State Veterans Homes for the vast majority of patients that \n     reside in these homes.\n\n     SEC. 508. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING IMPACT AID.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that funding for Impact Aid \n     (Title VIII of Public Law 107-110) should be sufficient to \n     insure that all federally connected school districts are \n     provided a payment under sections 8002 and 8003 of that Act \n     that will allow them to address the increase in program costs \n     in recent years, as this is critical for school districts \n     addressing the emotional and family needs of children of \n     military families who have a parent or parents engaged in \n     conflict in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\n     SEC. 509. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MANDATORY \n                   AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The mandatory farm programs administered by United \n     States Department of Agriculture under the Food Security and \n     Rural Development Act of 2002 provide an economic safety net, \n     ensure the availability of Federal crop insurance, fund \n     conservation priorities, and enhance agriculture export \n     market opportunities for United States farmers and ranchers.\n       (2) The actual budget outlays for farm bill programs for \n     fiscal years 2002-2004 have been about $16,700,000,000 less \n     than projected by the Congressional Budget Office in August \n     2002, shortly after the farm bill was passed.\n       (3) Over 72 percent of farm program payments are currently \n     received by only 10 percent of our Nation's program crop \n     producers.\n       (4) Any agricultural policy modifications should address \n     the disproportionate share of farm program payments received \n     by the largest farming operations.\n       (5) If commodity prices decline, as projected by the \n     Congressional Budget Office over the next several years, \n     agricultural programs will be even more important to the \n     economic future of small- and medium-sized family farms.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that any reconciled mandatory agriculture savings required \n     under this resolution should be primarily achieved through \n     modifications to the payment limitation provisions of the \n     Food Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/11/senate-section/article/S2530-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2530-S2531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 19--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS \n    REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF LIFE INSURANCE AND RECOGNIZING AND \n           SUPPORTING NATIONAL LIFE INSURANCE AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS (for himself and Mr. Nelson of Nebraska) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary:\n\n                            S.

Res. 19\n\n       Whereas life insurance is an essential part of a sound \n     financial plan;\n       Whereas life insurance provides financial security for \n     families in the event of a premature death by helping \n     surviving family members to meet immediate and longer-term \n     financial obligations and objectives;\n       Whereas nearly 50,000,000 Americans say they lack the life \n     insurance coverage needed to ensure a secure financial future \n     for their loved ones;\n       Whereas recent studies have found that when a premature \n     death occurs, insufficient life insurance coverage on the \n     part of the insured results in three-fourths of surviving \n     family members having to take measures such as working \n     additional jobs or longer hours, borrowing money, withdrawing \n     money from savings and investment accounts, and, in too many \n     cases, moving to smaller, less expensive housing;\n\n[[Page S2531]]\n\n       Whereas individuals, families, and businesses can benefit \n     greatly from professional insurance and financial planning \n     advice, including the assessment of their life insurance \n     needs; and\n       Whereas the Life and Health Insurance Foundation for \n     Education (LIFE), the National Association of Insurance and \n     Financial Advisors (NAIFA), and a coalition representing \n     hundreds of leading life insurance companies and \n     organizations have designated September 2005 as ``Life \n     Insurance Awareness Month'', the goal of which is to make \n     consumers more aware of their life insurance needs, seek \n     professional advice, and take the actions necessary to \n     achieve the financial security of their loved ones: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) designates September 2005 as ``Life Insurance Awareness \n     Month'';\n       (2) recognizes and supports the goals and ideals of ``Life \n     Insurance Awareness Month''; and\n       (3) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the Federal Government, States, localities, \n     schools, nonprofit organizations, businesses, other entities, \n     and the people of the United States to observe ``Life \n     Insurance Awareness Month'' with appropriate programs and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/11/senate-section/article/S2531-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                     committee on foreign relations\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
