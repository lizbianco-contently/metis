Mr. President, I have a few remarks to make on the Iraq \nelections. I will proceed in sharing a few experiences that I had \nrecently, but really focus on what will occur on Sunday, January 30, \nand that is that millions of Iraqis will, for the first time in \ndecades, vote in free elections.\n  I truthfully believe we will see the power of elections speak loudly \nthis Sunday. It is going to be with a lot of courage and a lot of \ndetermination that those who vote will travel to over 5,000 polling \nstations across the country. They will be casting their ballot for 275 \nnational assembly positions that will, in turn, draft a new \nconstitution.\n  It is a historic event for the people of Iraq. It is, in the words of \nhistorian Fouad Ajami, ``a breakthrough in the terrible history of this \ntormented land.''\n  Doomsayers and pessimists point to the terrorist attacks on the Iraqi \ncitizenry as proof that Iraqis are not ready for self-governance. They \nsay: Postpone the elections. They say: Iraqis have no history of \nliberty. In other words, withhold freedom from the innocent and hand \nvictory to the guilty. Blame the victim, reward the criminal. It is a \ncruel logic and one that, thankfully, the Iraqis have flat out \nrejected.\n  Indeed, numerous candidates all over the country have entered the \nelections despite the insurgents' and the terrorists' threats and \nattempts at intimidation. Iraqi voter turnout on Sunday will be higher \nthan in many Western democracies.\n  Listen to the words of Iraqis themselves. Baghdad resident Ali Danif \ntells an American paper:\n\n       Going to the polling stations is a victory for the Iraqi \n     people.\n\n  Says his friend Kadhim Hassan:\n\n       Without elections, there will be tyranny. It's time for us \n     to come into the light.\n\n  On January 30, Iraqis will take those first momentous steps. No one \npresumes the elections will be perfect, including the Iraqi people \nthemselves. The terrorists will continue their attempts to derail the \nprocess between now and then. Unfortunately, the attacks, I believe, \nare likely to increase during this period and quite possibly for some \ntime afterward. But the American people will stand with the Iraqi \npeople for democracy and for freedom.\n  I was in Iraq 2 weeks ago with a Senate delegation, and based on our \nexperiences in talking with the Iraqi people, in talking with the \nleadership, and\n\n[[Page S510]]\n\nattending a town meeting, I can say with confidence that despite the \ninsurgents' bombs and threats, democracy is on the way.\n  During our time in Iraq, my Senate colleagues and I were in a meeting \nwith Prime Minister Allawi. In the middle of that meeting, he asked if \nwe would be willing to go around the block or a few hundred yards away \nat a townhall meeting that he was conducting. We said yes. It was \nspontaneous, and we did not know what to expect.\n  We went with him in the middle of our meeting, and it was a meeting \nhe had been holding over the course of the day. We walked into a room \nabout the size of this Chamber, and it was packed. It was packed with \nmore than 150 Sunni sheiks who were from the Sunni triangle area, the \narea where most of the terrorist activity has been occurring.\n  We walked into the room, and it was embroiled in activity. It was \nembroiled in debate. People were scrambling. Sheiks were scrambling for \nthe microphone so they could express themselves. There was controversy, \ndisagreement. It was orderly in the sense that one person talked at a \ntime. This was really democracy at its best. It was spontaneous, not \nplanned by us. The Prime Minister, in meeting with the sheiks, spent \nmost of the day listening very patiently.\n  The presentations were passionate, and for me it captured the real \ncontrast on that day when we saw free speech and full expression. Some \nwere saying postpone the elections; others we saying, no, don't \npostpone the elections. This is the first step toward democracy. Others \nsaid America has done things perfectly, knowing we were in the room, \nand others said we should have done this or done that.\n  The point is, everybody was expressing themselves, and the Prime \nMinister was sitting before them listening patiently, taking the \nopportunity to comment. It was a striking contrast to the decades under \nSaddam where disagreement could lead, and frequently did lead, to \ntorture and, in many cases, as we know, ultimately death.\n  So progress is being made. The will of the Iraqi people is, for the \nfirst time in decades, being heard. These elections will give an \nelement of legitimacy of expression of the Iraqi people that heretofore \nhas not been there to the degree that it should be and that it will be \nin the future. It is through the ballot box, the power of that ballot \nbox that the Iraqis will begin this journey.\n  I need to comment again very briefly on a Tennessee angle to these \nelections because the Tennessee population of Iraqis is quite high and, \ntherefore, Nashville, TN, has been chosen as one of the polling sites \nso that Iraqis, mainly a Kurdish community that has come to the United \nStates, can express themselves in this election.\n\n  It was in 1977 that a professor named Franklin Jones agreed to \nsponsor the first Kurdish family in Nashville, almost 30 years ago. Now \nNashville boasts the largest Kurdish community in the United States of \nAmerica. Referred to by some as ``Little Kurdistan,'' there are 5,000 \nto 8,000 Kurdish families living in Nashville, and on Sunday, 3,700 \nIraqi Americans living in the Nashville region will go out to our \nTennessee State fairgrounds where they will cast their vote. It is an \nout-of-country voting site that has been established. They will be \nparticipating in creating this new and free Iraqi government.\n  The story of Nashville's Kurdish community is a special one. After \nthat first Kurdish family arrived in 1977, more and more Kurds came to \nNashville. A number of our community and church organizations focused \non the Kurds' plight and helped refugees adjust, settle in, and be \nassimilated into our wonderful city, Nashville.\n  During the 1980s, a small Kurdish community began to develop. You ask \nwhy. A lot of it is serendipity, but one of the answers you get is the \nclimate in Nashville reminded them of the climate back home.\n  In 1991, during Desert Storm, a large contingent of Kurds fled to the \nUnited States, and many of them joined their brethren in Tennessee. Job \nopportunities were high, cost of living was low, and Nashville's \nunparalleled hospitality welcomed them and made them feel safe.\n  On Sunday, when millions of Iraqis go to the polls to vote for the \nfirst time in Iraq, they will be joined by their compatriots in \nNashville. And among them, as an aside, will be Samir, the Iraqi-\nAmerican translator who found Saddam Hussein down in his spider hole.\n  I am proud that early on the people of Tennessee welcomed Iraqis into \ntheir homes, into their communities, and gave them shelter and hope. I \nam honored the city of Nashville and the State of Tennessee will \nprovide Iraqis across the region with the opportunity to express \nthemselves on January 30.\n  It is a historic day for them and a historic day for the coalition \nthat has invested so much in the Iraqi people, and a historic day for \ndemocracy. We will see young men and women going to the polls \nexpressing themselves. People have been waiting a long time for this \nday.\n  In closing, we were all abuzz last week with the activities \nsurrounding the 55th inaugural. It was a wonderful event for those of \nus who participated here in the Capitol and for those who watched it \nacross America--the glowing lights, the banners. To have that peaceful \ntransfer of the election process be realized is clearly remarkable for \nus all. But at its core, the inauguration was not for a party and not \nfor a particular person. It was a celebration of the blessing of \ndemocracy and the freedoms we enjoy, freedoms I am confident one day \nwill be ever much as common in Iraq as it is in the United States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/26/senate-section/article/S510-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this morning I rise to speak about one of \nthe issues that is facing our country, an issue we need to understand \nand live up to, a promise that we made to the young men and women who \nserve us overseas. Since this election, we have heard a lot about the \ncrises that are facing our country and what our obligation is and the \ndiscussions that will occur in the Senate and around the country about \nthose as we move forward.\n  Next week, we will hear from the President on the State of the Union. \nI will be listening very carefully to hear if he addresses the issue \nthat I think is clearly one of the most important issues our country \nneeds to address, and that is how we treat the young men and women who \nare coming home, who have served us in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around \nthe globe, and that we have the services available for them to keep the \npromise we made to them when they went to serve all of us. I am talking \nabout the veterans who have come home to our country throughout our \ntime, who have served us well, who fought for our freedom, who have \nbeen there for every one of us, and who are now facing severe shortages \nof services. I am taking about the promises we made to them for their \nhealth care, to make sure they are reintegrated into society in the \nUnited States and given what we have promised them when they went to \nserve all of us.\n  This morning we woke up to the news of 30-some Marines who have been \ntragically lost in an accident. Our hearts go out to their families, to \ntheir loved ones, and to all who know them, and we owe them and their \nfamilies a sincere debt of gratitude. It is a reminder to all of us \ntoday of the service that these men and women give us, of the \nultimate sacrifice, so we can have the freedoms that are so important \nto us at home.\n\n  It is a reminder to all of us that we owe them more than rhetoric on \nthis floor or promises when they leave but fulfillment of those \npromises when they come home. We need to fullfil the promise of \nservices available so their health care needs are met and that they are \ngiven the full support of this country when they return.\n\n[[Page S511]]\n\n  I was involved in working with our veterans many years ago. My own \nfather was a veteran. He served us in World War II. He was one of the \nfirst soldiers into Okinawa. He was injured there when they went in. He \nwent to Hawaii for a time, was in a hospital, and then went back to \nOkinawa to continue his services. He was an injured and disabled \nveteran all of his life.\n  I never knew of the sacrifices he gave or what his life story was \nuntil he died. We found his journals and read the day-to-day \ntranscripts of what he as a young man, barely 20, did for our country \noverseas, the injuries he sustained, what he saw on the battlefield. He \nnever talked about that when he came home.\n  As I read through those diaries day by day, I realized what a \ntremendous service he and thousands of other men and women have given \nto all of us so that we have the freedoms we have today, so that my \ngrandson who is growing up in this country today has the freedoms his \ngrandfather fought for.\n  Today, as I go home and talk to our veterans in Tacoma, Vancouver, \nand Walla Walla, our veterans who are struggling to get health care in \nnorth central Washington, I hear them begging us to help them get the \nhealth care services they were promised. We need to step up to the \nplate.\n  As I talk to the Army and to our Guard and Reserve members at home, \nthey tell me about the thousands of soldiers who are now returning to \nWashington State and around the country who will face long lines, who \nwill not have the services they need, particularly mental health and \nposttraumatic stress syndrome. I am deeply concerned that we are not \nputting in place the resources these veterans need to be there for \nthem.\n  In 1972, I served my country in a unique way when I was in college. \nIt was a time of war for our country, the Vietnam War. I volunteered to \ndo my internship at WSU, Washington State University, at the veterans \nhospital in Seattle, WA. I served on the psychiatric ward. I worked day \nin and day out with our young men and women who were my age at the time \nreturning from Vietnam. I saw the mental health scars they had.\n  What I saw inside the VA system was people who understood what they \nhad gone through, who were willing to work with them day in and day \nout, but as I left that VA hospital every afternoon to go home, I was \nout on the street with people who did not understand and were not there \nto support these veterans.\n  I am committed at this time when our men and women come home from \nIraq and Afghanistan and the missions we have sent them to around the \nworld to make sure we are there for them and the support is there to \nreintegrate them into America.\n  I look at our budgets today and I see that is not the case. Later \nthis afternoon Ambassador Nicholson, a very fine man, will be \nconfirmed, most likely, on the Senate floor. I have met with him. I \nhave talked with him about the tremendous backlog of services, about my \nconcerns about the members of the services who are coming home today \nand the services that are not available. I know he is committed to \ndoing the right thing.\n\n  What I will be listening to is the State of the Union next week, and \nthe President's budget, more importantly, when it comes to Congress, to \nsee if indeed it has the support we need for our veterans, for the \nservices they so rightfully deserve and need to have in order to be \nable to reintegrate into this country and to be able to continue to \nhave full and promising lives at home once they return.\n  I fear we are not going to see a VA budget that has those services. \nToday in Washington State we are hearing the commitments that have \nalready been made in north central Washington for a clinic in \nBellingham may not be able to happen because the budget moneys have \nbeen so severely cut back. That is wrong. These are promises these \nveterans have been given and that they need.\n  Veterans who live in Wenatchee, WA, should not have to travel 8 hours \non icy mountain roads to be able to get the health care services they \nneed. When I go up there and I talk to a wife of a veteran who has \nhealth problems and she tells me her husband cannot get to the doctor, \nI think our country has not fulfilled a promise we made. We have to \nkeep those promises, and where those promises will be seen is in the \nbudget and in the appropriations process this year, whether we put our \nmoney behind the rhetoric we hear every day from people who thank the \npeople who serve us overseas.\n  The Democratic Senators have put forward an excellent bill that I \nwill be talking about in the days and months to come. S. 13 is a bill \nthat will keep our promise to American veterans. It is very important \nlegislation, and I hope we get bipartisan support for it--I hope we get \nsupport across the country--and Members sign on to be a sponsor of this \nlegislation to push this forward so we keep our promise to veterans.\n  S. 13, the bill that has been introduced, begins by expanding mental \nhealth care to all of our VA hospitals by 2006. This is extremely \nimportant. When I talk to our veterans organizations, they tell me as \nmany as 20 percent or more of our men and women who are serving will \ncome home with posttraumatic stress syndrome or mental health \nconditions, that we need to make sure they get the help and support \nthey need to deal with that. So the first part of the bill will expand \nmental health care to all of our VA hospitals by 2006.\n  Secondly, it will make prescription drugs readily available to \nveterans. Under current regulations, a veteran who receives a \nprescription from a private doctor has to complete a physical with a VA \nphysician before the VA will honor their prescription. That kind of \nredtape costs the VA an estimated billion dollars or more each year. So \nour bill will overturn that regulation and provide veterans with a \nquick and easy access to prescription drugs. This will save us money \nand it will help our veterans who so desperately need it.\n  This bill will also ensure that no veteran is forced to choose \nbetween their disability compensation and their retirement pay by 2006. \nThis is an issue I hear about in every corner of my State from all \nveterans. Those who served our country should not have to choose \nbetween their disability payments and their retirement pay. The Senate \nhas addressed this issue before. In conference, we were not able to \nmove it as far as we needed to. This bill fixes it so veterans no \nlonger face that difficult choice.\n\n  This bill also creates a seamless transition from the military to the \nVA. Many of our veterans who have returned home have encountered \nobstacles to getting the services they deserve when they leave their \nactive-duty status. While the Defense and Veterans Departments have \nbeen trying to iron out the kinks by preventing a seamless transition \nfrom military life to the VA system, the agencies have not completed \nany of the seven recommendations for this that have been offered by the \nPresident's task force.\n  S. 13 will enact each of these seven recommendations, including \nrequiring preseparation medical examinations and disability benefits \ncounseling, removing information-sharing barriers, and requiring \ngreater cooperation between the VA and the DOD in tracking disabilities \nresulting from occupational exposure to hazardous materials.\n  Finally, the S. 13 that has been introduced will enact a new GI bill \nfor the 21st century. I hope again all of our colleagues will sign on \nto this legislation so we can put our words and our reality behind a \npromise that has been made to the men and women who serve us in this \ncountry.\n  I think this is an extremely critical area and a crisis when we look \nout across the country at the thousands of men and women who are \nserving who are going to be facing already long lines at VA hospitals, \nalready decreased services, for whom we need to make sure of mental \nhealth services as quickly and efficiently as possible so we do not see \nlater complications in their families, in their communities, or in \ntheir own worklife.\n  Yesterday, the President put out his $80 billion supplemental for the \nIraq war. I will, of course, support that supplemental. It is \nabsolutely critical that we make sure those who are serving us have the \ntraining, the equipment, and the supplies they need to do what we have \nasked them to do abroad for all of us, but it is equally important that \nwe keep the promise to them when they\n\n[[Page S512]]\n\ncome home. So when that supplemental comes before the Senate I intend \nto offer an amendment, along with Senator Akaka, the ranking member on \nthe Veterans' Committee, to add $2 billion to the supplemental to make \nsure our veterans get the services they need.\n  We cannot rely on rhetoric. We cannot rely on empty promises. We need \nto make sure that the part of the commitment we have when we go to war \nincludes taking care of those men and women when they return home.\n  These proposals are not about growing the size of the Government. \nThey are not about expanding what we owe. It is about keeping a \npromise. It is about living up to the promises we have made to those \nwho have given so much to all of us. Our veterans deserve the best from \nus. S. 13, this legislation I just talked about, works to make sure \nthose goals become a reality. We have a tremendous responsibility and \nwe have a great opportunity in this Congress to keep the promise \nPresident Abraham Lincoln made 140 years ago, and that is to care for \nthe veteran who has borne the battle, his widow and his orphan. Those \nwords ring as true today as they did 140 years ago, and I intend in \nevery way I can, both in my work on the Veterans Committee, my work on \nthe Appropriations Committee, and my work on the floor, to keep the \npromise we gave to those who are serving us to make sure they are taken \ncare of when they return home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to support the nomination of \nCondoleezza Rice as Secretary of State. Dr. Rice has served the \nPresident with distinction over the past 4 years as National Security \nAdviser, and I have complete confidence she will bring the same \ntalents, energy, and vision we have witnessed thus far to her new job \nat the State Department's helm.\n  In many of her recent remarks and those of President Bush, Dr. Rice \nhas emphasized the promotion of freedom and democracy as a hallmark of \nAmerican foreign policy. Not only has Dr. Rice made democracy a \ncenterpiece of her time at the White House, but also her life itself \nillustrates the final triumph of true democracy at home.\n\n  Dr. Rice grew up in Birmingham, AL, in the heart of the segregated \nSouth. She has spoken movingly about her memory of the 1963 church \nbombing in her hometown. One of the innocent little girls who died \nthere was a friend of hers.\n  Dr. Rice grew up in a time and place where America's founding ideals \nhad not yet become reality for all of our citizens. The United States, \na country built on the idea of freedom, was not yet a full democracy.\n  Perhaps it was this experience that led Dr. Rice to make the study \nand practice of political systems her life's work. After receiving her \nPh.D. at the University of Denver, she joined Stanford University and \nquickly became identified as one of the world's leading scholars of the \nSoviet Union. We all know of her distinguished career since then.\n  Dr. Rice has the confidence of the President of the United States. \nDr. Rice has the confidence of the majority of this Senate. We know, as \nmany of her critics have admitted on this floor, she will be easily \nconfirmed.\n  So I wonder why we are starting this new Congress with a protracted \ndebate about a foregone conclusion. It cannot be for a lack of \npriorities because we surely have enough on our legislative plate this \nyear. It can't be because Dr. Rice has suggested she has some flaw so \nfundamental that the Senate must block the President's choice. I can \nonly conclude we are doing this for no other reason than because of \nlingering bitterness at the outcome of the elections.\n  We need to move on. The people of the United States made their choice \nlast November and they expect their elected officials to govern \naccordingly.\n  When President Clinton was reelected for his second term, I didn't \nshare the policy views of some of the officials he nominated, but I do \nnot recall going through protracted battles such as this. We all have \nvarying policy views, but the President, in my view, has a clear right \nto put into place the team he believes will serve him best.\n  I believe this Nation is honored by the presence of Dr. Rice, by what \nshe represents, by what she has achieved, and I believe she will be an \nenduring role model to all Americans, particularly Americans who are \nnot of the majority in race in our country.\n  I believe Dr. Rice is a living example of what can happen in America. \nFrom a beginning in a segregated South to the Secretary of State of the \nmost powerful nation in the world is a great American success story. I \nhope all my colleagues, at the completion of this overwhelming vote in \nfavor of her confirmation, will celebrate this great American success \nstory and all of us will look forward to her leadership of the \nDepartment of State, and working with her here in the Halls of \nCongress.\n  I yield the remainder of my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I understand we are in morning business \nand I have about 18 minutes; is that accurate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, these are difficult times but they are \nalso times of opportunity. We will face on Sunday, with the vote in \nIraq, difficulty, but also a time of opportunity for people to know \ndemocracy and freedom who have never known it before. Freedom, however, \nalways comes at a price. We are paying for this opportunity for freedom \nwith loss of life from our own country. Yet democracy and freedom is \nsomething for which we have fought for over 200 years.\n  I rise today to speak about something else we need to fight for. I \nspeak of one of the most difficult debates we have had to discuss in \nthis country: it is the debate on the issue of life and the moment that \nlife begins. I am introducing today, with over 30 cosponsors, a bill \nthat speaks to this critical issue. It is S. 51, the Unborn Child Pain \nAwareness Act. It has 31 cosponsors. This legislation, I believe, is \nstrongly pro-woman, pro-child and pro-life, and\n\n[[Page S513]]\n\nit will help in the creation of a culture of life in America.\n  The Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act is about empowering women with \ninformation. It is also about respecting and treating the unborn child \nmore humanely. This legislation is, at heart, an informed consent bill, \nwhich would do two simple things:\n  First, it would require abortion providers to present medical, \nscientific information to a woman, who is seeking a late-term abortion, \nabout what is known regarding the development of the unborn child \ninside of her womb.\n  Second, should the woman desire to continue with the abortion after \nbeing presented with this information, the legislation calls for her to \nbe given the opportunity to choose anesthesia for the unborn child in \norder to lessen its pain.\n  No abortion procedures would be prohibited by the Unborn Child Pain \nAwareness Act. It is an informed consent bill.\n  I do not believe that anyone in this esteemed chamber thinks that \nwomen should not be fully informed. I believe, along with a majority of \nAmericans, according to all the polls of which I am aware, that women \nhave the right to know what their unborn child experiences during an \nabortion. Most Americans believe that women are capable of processing \ninformation, even when faced with a crisis pregnancy.\n  In fact, according to a Wirthlin Worldwide poll conducted after the \nNovember election, 75 percent of respondents favored:\n\n     laws requiring that women who are 20 weeks or more along in \n     their pregnancies be given information about fetal pain \n     before having an abortion.\n\n  After being presented with the medical and scientific information on \nthe development of the unborn child 20 weeks after fertilization, the \nwoman is more aware of the pain experienced by the child during an \nabortion procedure, and more equipped--at the very least--to make an \ninformed decision. It is simply not fair for a pregnant mother to be \nuninformed.\n  In the proposed legislation, we have settled on a 20-week benchmark \nbecause there is a strong medical and scientific knowledge that unborn \nchildren feel and experience pain by 20 weeks after fertilization.\n  Looking over the data--and I am certainly not a doctor--but it seems \nreasonable to me that unborn children actually feel pain weeks earlier, \nbut we chose the 20-week benchmark as a point on which more scientists \nand doctors can agree. At some point, perhaps Dr. Coburn--a new member \nwho is a physician who has delivered thousands, of babies, one of this \nbill's cosponsors--might further enlighten us on this subject based on \nhis extensive experience.\n  How do we know that unborn children can feel pain? We know that \nunborn children can--and do--feel pain thanks to great advances in \nmedical technology. Unborn children, experience pain as evidenced by \nanatomical, functional, physiological and behavioral indicators that \nare correlated with pain in children and adults. We have Dr. Sonny \nAnand's Expert Report for the Partial-Birth Abortion trials, that were \nmade part of the Federal Court record.\n  Of course--though perhaps less scientific--any mother can tell you \nher unborn child can feel. The little unborn child most certainly feels \nand responds to stimuli from outside the womb. Sometimes a voice will \ncause the unborn child to stir. And usually, at some point in the late \nsecond trimester, even the father can feel and see the unborn child's \nmovements. And if you push the unborn child's limb, the limb may push \nback. I have happy memories of this with my wife and our children.\n  All along, women have been able to feel the child inside of them, but \nnow, science is telling us exactly what the child inside of his or her \nmother can feel. We now know that unborn children can not only feel, \nbut that their ability to experience pain is heightened. The highest \ndensity of pain receptors per square inch of skin in human development \noccurs in utero from 20 to 30 weeks gestation.\n\n  Think about the pain that unborn children can experience, and then \nthink about some commonly used abortion procedures. Of course, we have \nheard about Partial-Birth Abortion, but also consider the D abortion.\n  During this procedure, commonly performed after 20 weeks when there \nis medical evidence that the child can experience severe pain, and we \nhave a chart of this that I will show, the child is torn apart limb \nfrom limb. Think about how that must feel to a young human. We would \nnot allow an animal to be treated this way. Yet, the creature we are \ntalking about is a young, unborn child.\n  Women certainly have a right to be given the facts about the baby \ngrowing inside of them. Armed with these facts, women then have the \nopportunity to make a more informed decision.\n  Should the woman continue with the late-term abortion, she ought to \nhave the option of anesthetizing the unborn child before it undergoes a \npainful termination of its young life.\n  This should not be a Republican or a Democratic issue. This should be \na human issue.\n  The Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act offers us a rare chance to \ntranscend the traditional political boundaries. It is a matter of human \ndecency.\n  It is my hope that this bill will offer us a chance to work across \npolitical divides to forge new understandings in this Chamber.\n  I think that we can all support giving women more information when \nthey are making life-altering decisions.\n  A recent Los Angeles Times--December 23, 2004--article offers a \nglimmer of hope in this regard. The article notes that:\n\n       [Democrats] are looking at ways to soften the hard line \n     [support for abortion-rights], such as promoting adoption and \n     embracing parental notification requirements for minors and \n     bans on late-term abortions.\n\n  Adoption and parental notification for minors are issues, on which I \nhope we can work together. Perhaps we can begin with this measure: The \nUnborn Child Pain Awareness Act is not a ban on late-term abortions, \nbut it is a measure that would provide a wonderful opportunity for us \nto work together on an issue that is pro-woman, pro-child, and pro-\nlife. It is creating a culture of life.\n\n  I want to take a few of the minutes I have to describe a procedure \nthat takes place on a post-20-weeks-of-age gestation child, described \nhere on this chart. There may be people who may not want to look at \nthis. I would offer that they not, if they choose not to, but I think \nit is important they have this information.\n  We are talking about a D procedure at 23 weeks performed on an \nunborn child. It is important to note that the legislation that I have \nintroduced today does not ban this procedure or limit it in any way; \nthis legislation simply says that a woman needs to be informed about \nthe pain the child in her womb would experience if she undergoes that \nprocedure, and be given the option to offer the child in the womb \nanesthesia in the procedure of the child being pulled out of the womb, \nas you can see in this diagram.\n  I want to get some expert testimony that was provided at the partial-\nbirth abortion trials.\n  This was information submitted by Dr. Sonny Annand at the trial about \nthe nature of the pain the child experiences.\n  I held hearings in the Senate Commerce Committee about in utero \nsurgery. The surgeon talked about having to chase the child around in \nthe womb somewhat to give it its shot to anesthetize the child because \nthe child didn't want the needle to go into its buttock. He described \nhow the child was constantly moving around to avoid the needle. That \nmade perfect sense to me, having children who do not like to get shots. \nI don't like shots. And the child would move around.\n  But it also heightened my awareness--that if you go through this \nabortion procedure, what does the child feel at that point in time? It \ndoesn't want to get a shot in its rear end. What does it feel when it \ngoes through a procedure like this?\n  This was reported by the Associated Press at the trials last year, \nApril 4, 2004. Dr. Sonny Annand said:\n\n       Abortion would cause severe and excruciating pain to 20-\n     week-old fetuses.\n\n  There is now scientific information about the increase in the heart \nrate of the child when a procedure like this is taking place, the \nincrease in the physiological trauma that indicates somebody going \nthrough excruciating pain. And while you can't hear the child in\n\n[[Page S514]]\n\nthe womb--it can't scream--it has a silent scream, nonetheless it is \nshowing all the time the physiological nature of going through \nexcruciating pain.\n  I have another chart to put up here to illustrate this point as well. \nThis is from the same physician. Dr. Annand says:\n\n       The fetuses show increased heart rate, blood flow and \n     hormone level in response to pain.\n\n  This is how you and I, adults, respond to pain, although the \ndifference for us is we have less pain receptors per square inch, and \nwe also have developed a part of the brain that holds down or \nsuppresses pain. So actually we feel less pain because of the way our \nbrain is further developed. But the child feels more pain.\n  This issue is something I think most of us would probably choose to \nignore, if we could, and say ``let's just not talk about it.'' But when \nthis is going on and you know about it, how can you ignore it? It would \nbe like us saying, about some of the tragedies in our history, I just \ndo not want to know about it. Just do not tell me about it. I would \nrather be ignorant. Yet today we cannot deny the scientific \ninformation.\n  Here is a picture of a child in the womb. I do not know the age of \nthis child. But can you deny the humanity of this child?\n  I have a coin given to me yesterday from a Croatian, a gentleman from \nCroatia that I want to show you has the same picture of this unborn \nchild imprinted on this coin minted in Croatia. They just ask basically \non the coin, as you can in the picture, how can you deny the humanity \nof this child? If that is the case--and if you dismember this child in \na late-term abortion, how can you deny the humanity of this child and \nthe pain it experiences? We know physiologically because of the \nscientific advances taking place what this child experiences. How can \nyou ignore scientific evidence and say it is simply not taking place, \nor I just do not want to see it, which was unfortunately typically done \ntoo often in our past. But the facts seem too horrific for us to look \nat. We have seen recently in places around the world the horrific \nsuffering. Many times we just want to say: Don't show it to me. I don't \nreally want to see it. Yet it can't be denied. It must be confronted. \nThe sooner it is talked about, the sooner it will be addressed.\n  Let us have a lively debate. If people don't believe the child is \nexperiencing pain, come forward with the scientific information. It \nwould be counter to all common experience of women in pregnancy at that \n20-week stage or later. It would be counter to all the current \nscientific information. Bring it forward. Let us have a lively debate \nabout this. This bill does not ban any abortion procedure. It simply is \nan informed consent bill that women deserve to know about.\n  It is my hope that once a woman receives this information she would \ndecide to go ahead with the pregnancy and have the child. If she looks \nat her situation and believes it is just too difficult to continue to \ncare for the child, she could put the child up for adoption. There are \nmillions of families who would love to provide a loving home for a \nchild. No matter what the difficult circumstance, they would love to \nadopt; but perhaps she would choose to make her child go through this \nprocedure. What if she decided to go through the procedure, and then \nlater found out through scientific evidence that she put her child \nthrough this pain and had to live with that in her life. We have women \ncoming forward now in the Silent No More Campaign--women who have had \nabortions who have for years afterwards--decades afterwards--struggled \nwith the thought of having an abortion. They say: My goodness. How \ncould I do that to my own child in the womb? They are saying women \ndeserve better. They have struggled with this for years and are now \ncoming out with it; receiving the sympathy which they deserve for \nhaving gone through something at a very difficult time in their lives.\n  This bill will be introduced in both Chambers today. It is an \nimportant piece of legislation. It is one which I hope we can move \nforward with aggressively. If there is evidence on the other side, I \nwould welcome it coming forward. Let us have this debate, but let us \nnot ignore it any longer.\n  Thank you, very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand that the Democratic side has \nyielded their time.\n  Mr. President, we are going to be in the final debate on the \nnomination of Dr. Rice. Yesterday, I asked my colleagues to be careful \nin their criticism. The position of Secretary of State is the voice and \nthe advocacy of the policy of our country. We need to have a unity of \npurpose for the advancement of freedom. If people want to criticize \nsome things, they should come up with positive, constructive ideas so \nas not to diminish the credibility of our Secretary of State.\n  What I saw yesterday on the floor--and to some extent in the Foreign \nRelations Committee--that the confirmation proceeding of Dr. Rice is \nevolving into an overly partisan attack. I found out later yesterday \nevening that some of the attacks have really gone overboard. We heard \nabout accountability--accountability for the prosecution of the war on \nterrorism, whether in Afghanistan or in the Iraq theater. The \naccountability was really determined by the people of this country with \ntheir votes for President George W. Bush to be reelected as President.\n  However, we have heard from some on the other side of the aisle a \ncontinuation of their campaign arguments, whether here on the floor or \nin committee.\n  There has been for years a very logical approach that in times of \nwar, when we have our troops in harm's way overseas, in precarious and \ndangerous positions with their boots on the ground, that partisan \npolitics ends at our waters' edge. We have heard that. When troops are \nabroad, partisan politics ends at our waters' edge.\n  Unfortunately, that time-honored, respectful practice has been \nbreached. Even worse than the outrageous statements in these serious \ntimes is we find that statements are being used for political \nposturing--but even worse, political fundraising. We have heard the \narguments made in the sense that Oh well, this is advice and consent. \nThis is from a fundraising letter based upon the argument and \nopposition to Condoleezza Rice. The fundraising letter from the DSCC \nsent to DSCC friends, talks about how the Senate must take its advice \nand consent role during the confirmation process. Advice and consent is \nfine. That is to be allowed, but advice and consent doesn't mean \npoliticking and soliciting funds.\n  That is exactly what has happened, in a very, and in my view, harmful \nway in some of the debate. It harms and diminishes the ability of our \nSecretary of State, Dr. Rice. She has great credibility, and I think \nshe will still have great credibility. But there is going to be the \nquestion: Gosh, some in the United States don't think she is up to the \ntask.\n  There have been certain personal attacks.\n  But to try to solicit political contributions from such damaging \nrhetoric, in my view, is deplorable; it is dangerous; and, it is \ndisgusting.\n  Here is how they end the letter. This is signed by the junior Senator \nfrom\n\n[[Page S515]]\n\nCalifornia. It ends with this reference to the Rice nomination--\nassertions and allegations about Dr. Rice.\n\n       So while I raise my voice on the Senate floor, I hope you \n     will join us on the campaign trail and the loudest message of \n     all, one that all Republicans will not be able to ignore, \n     unseating them in the midterm elections and sending more \n     Democrats to the Senate.\n\n  Several times through this letter, it says contribute to the DSCC.\n  It is fine to have a debate. There should be the concept of advice \nand consent, but it ought not to be soliciting and politicking. Clearly \nto be using something as serious as the nomination and confirmation of \nour Secretary of State to solicit campaign fund is particularly \ndeplorable, especially during our global war on terror when we are \ntrying to get more allies and friends to join with us.\n  I hope as we get to this vote in about one hour that this sort of \npolitical chicanery, political maneuvering and solicitation of funds, \nand using something as important as this nomination will cease and \ndesist.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, and my colleagues for allowing me this \ntime to say this.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will rein in this \nsort of behavior. I don't want to say each and every one of them \ncondones it, but it is deplorable behavior that must cease.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/26/senate-section/article/S515-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have the pleasure and the honor to \ncommend the nomination of Dr. Condoleezza Rice. Soon, the Senate will \ncarry out its constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on \nPresident Bush's nominee for the office of Secretary of State. We will \nbe participants in an historic moment that will reaffirm the Senate's \nrole in foreign policy and underscore the brilliance of the \nconstitutional design.\n  Last week, the Committee on Foreign Relations held exhaustive \nhearings on this nomination. Dr. Rice fielded questions on dozens of \nsubjects for more than 10\\1/2\\ hours over 2 days. All 18 members of the \nCommittee took advantage of the opportunity to ask Dr. Rice questions. \nAt the hearings, she responded to 199 questions--129 from Democrats and \n70 from Republicans. In addition, in advance of the hearings, members \nof the Committee submitted 191 detailed questions for the record to Dr. \nRice. Members received answers to each of these questions. Thus, Dr. \nRice responded to a total of 390 questions from Senators. In American \nhistory, few cabinet nominees have provided as much information or \nanswered as many questions during the confirmation process. She \ndemonstrated that her understanding of U.S. foreign policy is \ncomprehensive and insightful.\n  Our hearings and yesterday's floor action served not only as an \nexamination of Dr. Rice's substantial qualifications, but also as a \nfundamental debate on the direction of U.S. foreign policy. This debate \nwas useful to the Senate and to the American people. Having the \nopportunity to question a Secretary of State nominee is a key aspect of \nCongressional oversight of any administration's foreign policy. Dr. \nRice enthusiastically embraced this function of the hearings.\n  In my judgment she is extraordinarily well-qualified to become \nSecretary of State. Even Dr. Rice's opponents have taken the time to \nadmire her accomplishments and her qualifications. She is a person of \nconviction, loyalty, integrity, and ability. As a result of her \ndistinguished service as National Security Advisor to President Bush \nand her earlier assignments on the NSC, she is well known to many \nMembers of the Senate. We have observed her energy, her expertise, and \nher devotion to this country. I appreciate the cooperation that she has \nprovided to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and to me \npersonally.\n  I had the good fortune to visit Dr. Rice before she assumed the post \nof National Security Adviser. Before President George W. Bush was \nelected, I participated with Dr. Rice at Stanford University meetings \non foreign policy hosted by former Secretary of State, George Shultz. \nSecretary Shultz, a close friend of many in the Senate, was an early \nsupporter of then Governor Bush. He recognized Dr. Rice's prodigious \ntalent and encouraged her leadership within the Bush foreign policy \nteam. At the Stanford University meetings, Dr. Rice demonstrated \nanalytical brilliance and broad knowledge of world affairs. During the \n2000 Presidential campaign, she established a trusted relationship with \nGovernor Bush that has carried through in her work as National Security \nAdviser.\n  The enormously complex job before Dr. Rice will require all of her \ntalents and experience. American credibility in the world, progress in \nthe war on terrorism, and our relationships with our allies will be \ngreatly affected by the Secretary of State's leadership and the \neffectiveness of the State Department in the coming years. We recognize \nthe deep personal commitment necessary to undertake this difficult \nassignment, and we are grateful that a leader of her stature is willing \nto step forward.\n  Opponents of the nomination have focused primarily on individual \nstatements made by the nominee during her tenure as National Security \nAdviser. I simply observe that Dr. Rice has spent 4 years in one of the \nmost intense crucibles of leadership imaginable. The scrutiny that \nNational Security Advisers must live under is unrelenting, and their \nresponsibility for foreign policy outcomes often is exceeded only by \nthe President, who makes the final decision. Dr. Rice has been in the \narena making tough decisions and answering tough questions on a daily \nbasis for 4 years. I do not remember any National Security Adviser who \ndid not have bruises to show for stepping into this arena. The \nattachment of controversies to a National Security Adviser is \ninevitable. Even as Senators scrutinize Dr. Rice's record, we must not \nfail to recognize the level of sacrifice, courage, and discipline that \nis required to be National Security Adviser. Her proven fortitude in \nmeeting these challenges and in sustaining herself physically and \nmentally through the pressures of responsibility is impressive.\n  Dr. Rice is not just a survivor. Even under intense pressure, she has \nperformed her duties successfully with thoughtfulness, fairness, and \nmagnanimity. These are exactly the qualities that we want in our top \ndiplomat. And these qualities already have produced results. Dr. Rice \nhas contributed to numerous policy successes in the Bush \nadministration. These successes have involved issues as diverse as our \nnon-proliferation policies, our campaign against global AIDS, and \nreform of our post-conflict stabilization and reconstruction \nmechanisms. Befitting the role of National Security Adviser, she has \nnot been in the limelight claiming credit for successes. Instead, she \nhas performed without ego, while preserving the trust of the President. \nThis close relationship will serve her well at the State Department.\n\n  The Secretary of State serves as the President's top foreign policy \nadvisor, as our Nation's most visible emissary to the rest of the \nworld, and as manager of one of the most important Departments in our \nGovernment. Any one of these jobs would be a challenge for even the \nmost talented public servant. The Secretary of State, at this critical \ntime in our history, must excel in all three roles.\n\n[[Page S516]]\n\n  From my own conversations with Dr. Rice, I am confident that she \nunderstands that the President's foreign policy can be enhanced in the \nsecond term by a closer working relationship with Congress. In moving \nto head the State Department, she understands that much of this \ncommunication will depend on her. Last week's hearings were an \nexcellent start. Her attitude throughout these arduous hearings was \nalways accommodating and always respectful of the Senate's \nConstitutional role in the nomination process. From the beginning she \nmade clear her desire to have a wide-ranging discussion of U.S. foreign \npolicy and to take all the questions that members wanted to ask.\n  If confirmed, it will be her duty to use the foundation of these \nhearings to build a consistent bridge of communication to the Congress. \nAs legislators, we have equal responsibility in this process. We have \nthe responsibility of educating ourselves about national security \nissues, even when they are not the top issues in headlines or polls. We \nhave the responsibility to maintain good foreign affairs law, even when \ntaking care of this duty yields little credit back home. We have the \nresponsibility to ensure that our first impulse in foreign affairs is \none of bipartisanship. And we have the responsibility to speak plainly \nwhen we disagree with the administration, but to avoid inflammatory \nrhetoric that is designed merely to create partisan advantage or settle \npartisan scores.\n  We have the opportunity with the beginning of a new presidential term \nto enhance the constructive role of Congress in foreign policy. We have \nmade an excellent start during the past week. I thank all 19 Senators \nwho participated in the Foreign Relations Committee hearings and all 22 \nSenators who have joined in the floor debate. I urge Members to vote in \nfavor of the nomination of Dr. Rice to be Secretary of State.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask that \nthe quorum count equally against both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time is \nallotted to the Senator from Delaware on the Rice nomination?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is allotted 20 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to support Dr. Rice's \nnomination to be Secretary of State. I don't do it as fulsomely as I \nrose to support the nomination of the previous Secretary of State. I \nwill explain why.\n  I believe the President of the United States is entitled to his \nCabinet unless the person he selects is so far out of the mainstream, \nincompetent, clearly of questionable character, or, as some in the past \nhave been, dedicated to the express purpose of dismantling the very \nagency to which they were being assigned, such as President Reagan--as \nmy mother would say, God love him--who wanted to do away with the \nDepartment of Education and assigned two people to be the head of the \nDepartment of Education for the express purpose of eliminating an \nagency that I thought needed to remain, or in the special case when the \noffice calls for an unusually different relation, as the Attorney \nGeneral does. The Attorney General does not work for the President. He \nis the people's lawyer. He is hired by the President, but he or she is \nthe people's lawyer and, in the worst of all cases, sometimes required \nto investigate the President himself and in the best of cases is \nrequired to interpret the constitutional laws of the land.\n  I very reluctantly voted against Attorney General Gonzales's \nnomination to be Attorney General because I believe he has so wrongly \ninterpreted law on torture and did such great damage as a consequence \nof that decision. There were significant consequences. There is a \nfundamentally different relationship and a fundamentally different \nconstitutional obligation. It is his judgment that I question, and I \ncurrently believe he should not be Attorney General.\n  Dr. Rice does not fit in any of those categories. I have known and \nworked with her for the past 4 years. She is knowledgeable, she is \nsmart, she is honorable, and her relationship with the President is \nessentially to be the public face of the President of the United States \nhere.\n  As the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I have a \nspecial responsibility to work with Dr. Rice, so I am going to vote for \nDr. Rice, but I am going to do so with some frustration and \nreservations. Let me explain why. I have said this to Dr. Rice, so she \nis not hearing this for the first time.\n  Last week, we gave Dr. Rice an opportunity to acknowledge the \nmistakes and misjudgments of the past 4 years. The point is not to play \nthe game ``gotcha.'' It is not about embarrassing the President. It is \nabout learning from our mistakes so we do not repeat them. A second \nterm is also a second chance.\n  Instead of seizing that opportunity, Dr. Rice stuck to the \nadministration's party line: Always right; never wrong. It is as if \nacknowledging mistakes or misjudgments is a sign of weakness. I do not \nthink it is. I think it is powerful evidence of strength and maturity.\n  But during the hearing, Dr. Rice claimed that my colleague, Barbara \nBoxer, was impugning her integrity when she asked about her changing \nrationale for the war in Iraq.\n  Now, I wish instead that Dr. Rice had acknowledged the facts. This \nadministration secured the support of the American people, and of \nCongress, for going to war based on what it insisted was an imminent \nthreat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.\n  Now, when it turns out there are no such weapons, Dr. Rice and the \nPresident claim the war was now about removing a dictator. I am glad \nSaddam is gone. He deserves his own special place in hell, but removing \nhim from power was not the justification initially offered by this \nadministration to go to war. Again, it is an example of what Barbara \nBoxer was talking about: a changing rationale for war. Why Dr. Rice \nwould not acknowledge that is beyond me.\n  Reading the resolution that Congress passed giving the President the \nauthority to use force if necessary, it was about ``disarming'' Saddam. \nAnd reread the words of the President and other senior officials. In \nspeech after speech, television appearance after television appearance, \nthey left the American people with the impression that Iraq was on the \nverge of reconstituting nuclear weapons. In fact, Vice President Cheney \nsaid they already had them.\n  The administration left the American people with the impression, even \ntoday, that Saddam had other weapons of mass destruction, and that he \nwas complicit in the events of 9/11 and that he collaborated with al-\nQaida--I assume collaborated with al-Qaida for purposes of the 9/11 \nattack. Back then the administration liked to claim that President Bush \nnever said Iraq was ``an imminent threat.'' Well, this is what he and \nother senior officials did say. They referred to it as an ``immediate \nthreat,'' a ``mortal threat,'' an ``urgent threat,'' a ``grave \nthreat,'' a ``serious and mounting threat,'' a ``unique threat.'' And \nit would be funny, the denial that they did not say ``imminent threat'' \nif it were not so deadly serious.\n  This is my point: Especially in matters of war and peace, we have to \nlevel with the American people if we want not only to secure their \nsupport but to sustain their support.\n  My poor colleagues are tired of hearing me say, for the last 2 years, \nthe following: No foreign policy can be sustained without the informed \nconsent of the American people. And this administration has been very \nreluctant to keep them informed. Informed means all the information and \na truthful rendition of the balance of the information they have.\n\n  During the time I was criticizing President Bush for his assertions \nabout aluminum tubes and his administration's assertions about other \nthings, the press kept saying to me: Why won't you say the President is \na liar? He was not lying. But what the President did--he got the \nintelligence, as we did on the committee. We can argue whether a \nminority or a majority, but a significant number of the intelligence \nassets in the U.S. Government said: We think those aluminum tubes are \nor could be used for gas centrifuges. A significant number said: No, \nthey are not used for that. They are for artillery.\n\n[[Page S517]]\n\n  Well, my criticism of the President was not that he, in fact, chose \nto believe that portion of the intelligence community which said they \nwere used for gas centrifuge systems, which is needed to build a \nnuclear capability and if you are going to use uranium; my problem with \nit was, both he and Dr. Rice implied there was no dissent, that this \nwas the view of the intelligence community, when it was not. There was, \nat a minimum, a significant dissent both in Energy and at the CIA, and \nother places. So they did not lie. They chose to pick the portion--I am \nnot saying they did it for any reason other than they believed it, but \nthey chose to pick the portion of the intelligence community's \nassessment which fit with their objectives, without ever mentioning, \nacknowledging, or suggesting there was any dissent within the \nintelligence community.\n  I love my colleagues now who keep saying: Don't blame it on Rice. \nDon't blame it on Gonzales. Blame it on the intelligence community. I \nthink our former Director of the CIA is getting a bad rap here.\n  The fact is, we have to be honest with ourselves and the world; \notherwise, we are going to do terrible damage to our most valuable \nasset, our credibility. After Iraq, it is going to be much harder to \nrally the world to our side if we have to face a truly imminent threat \nto our security from, say, Iran or North Korea.\n  The same goes for the way Dr. Rice answered my questions about \ntraining Iraqi security forces. Time and again, this administration has \ntried to leave the American people with the impression that Iraq has \nwell over 100,000--as high as 120,000; or I think there was even a \nhigher number offered--of fully competent police and military. They \ndon't say fully competent; they say trained.\n  Now again, it is like that story I have told. We Catholic kids go to \nCatholic school. We learn to go to one of the Sacraments in the \nCatholic Church, Penance. You go to confession. They explain to us that \nwhen we go to confession, we should confess all our sins. My nuns told \nme the story about Johnny, who said to the priest: Bless me father for \nI have sinned. I stole a gold chain. And he failed to tell the priest \nthat attached to that gold chain was an antique gold watch. He did not \nlie. He stole the chain. But when you say what you did, you should say \nall of what you did.\n  Failure to acknowledge, as my grandfather used to say, the ``hull'' \nof it, failure to do that is, at a minimum, misleading--at a minimum, \nmisleading. That is what has happened here.\n  So 120,000 troops trained. There may be 120,000 people who we put \nuniforms on--and I will not go through it in the limited time I have; I \nwill submit for the Record the facts as I believe them based on talking \nto our military and police trainers--but the real question is, How many \nAmerican forces doing the job of policing the streets, going after \ninsurgents, guarding the borders, whatever functions we are now \nproviding, how many of those could be replaced with an Iraqi now? I \nthink the number is closer to somewhere between 4,000 and 18,000.\n  Now, the good news--when I asked the question, I thought she would \nsay we have made mistakes. We went for quantity not quality. We realize \nwe had to fundamentally change our training programs. We brought in \nGeneral Patraeus, who is a first-rate guy. He is well underway of doing \nthat--which he is--and we are going to get it right. But, no, we have \n120,000 trained forces out there.\n  Well, the fact is, we are months, if not years, from reaching the \ntarget we need of putting uniformed soldiers, uniformed cops, and \nuniformed National Guard with Iraqi uniforms into Iraq.\n  The bottom line is, we should focus on real standards, not raw \nnumbers. To my mind, there is a real simple standard. An Iraqi soldier \nand policeman should be considered fully trained when he or she is \ncapable of doing the job we are now asking an American young man or \nwoman to do. How many meet that standard today? Nowhere near, as I \nsaid, 120,000. In my judgment, it is closer to 14,000 total. Army \ntrained is probably closer to 5,000.\n  So last week's hearing was a chance for Dr. Rice to wipe the slate \nclean with the American people and with our allies. I wish she had \nseized it.\n  This is not about revisiting the past. It is about how Dr. Rice and \nthe administration will meet the challenges of the future.\n  I notice, in the defense of Dr. Rice, I no longer hear on the floor \ndisagreements--I don't want to get him in trouble--disagreements with \nthe position taken by my friend, the chairman of our committee, or by \nmy friend, Mr. Hagel, or Mr. McCain, or myself, or others. I do not \nhear people saying we have conducted this postwar policy very well. I \ndo not hear anybody defending that. They are now saying, which is good: \nHey, wait a minute, I guess we have made mistakes.\n  Why the administration cannot do that is beyond me. They are not up \nfor reelection again. It would seem to me it would be a way to coalesce \nsupport.\n  In my judgment, America faces two overriding national security \nchallenges in this new century. First and foremost, we must win the \nstruggle between freedom and radical Islamic fundamentalism. Secondly, \nwe must keep the world's most dangerous weapons away from its most \ndangerous people.\n  On the latter point, the man we owe the greatest debt of gratitude to \non making progress on that score is my friend and colleague, Senator \nLugar, and former Senator Nunn. Senator Lugar is the guy who is \nfollowing up on this and the guy forcing us all to face the reality \nthat much more is needed to be done.\n  To prevail, we have to be strong. We also have to be smart, wielding \nthe force of our ideas and ideals together with the force of our arms.\n  Today, after a necessary war in Afghanistan and an optional war in \nIraq, we are rightly confident in the example of our power. But we have \nforgotten the power of our example.\n  Foreign policy is not a popularity contest. We must confront hard \nissues. Sometimes they require us to make hard choices that other \ncountries do not like. But above all, they require American leadership, \nthe kind of persuasion that brings along others to our side.\n  We have been having a tough time doing just that the past few years. \nSo despite our great military might, in my view, we are more alone in \nthe world than we have been in recent memory. As a result, we are much \nless secure than we could or should be.\n  That is because virtually all the threats we face--from terrorism, to \nthe spread of weapons of mass destruction, to rogue states that flout \nthe rules, to endemic and pandemic diseases--cannot be solely met by \nthe unilateral use of force.\n  I had hoped to hear from Dr. Rice how she planned to help rebuild \nAmerica's power to persuade, and to restore our Nation's respect that \nit once enjoyed. For she said, now is the time for diplomacy. \nParenthetically, I think diplomacy was needed 4 years ago. I am happy \nnow is the time for diplomacy.\n  I also had hoped to hear her ideas for contending with a series of \nproblems the administration has put on the back burner but whose pots \nare boiling over, such as the nuclear programs in North Korea and Iran, \nthe dangerous backsliding of democracy in Russia, and the genocide in \nSudan, to only name a few.\n  Over the past few years, North Korea has increased its nuclear \nweapons capacity by as much as 400 percent. It may now have as many as \neight nuclear weapons to test, hide, or sell to the highest bidder.\n  Dr. Rice told us it is ``unacceptable'' for North Korea to have these \nnuclear weapons, but she did not tell us what that meant or how the \nadministration proposed to stop this growing threat.\n  Over the past few years, the reform movement in Iran has been crushed \nand the regime has accelerated its own nuclear program. There may be \nnothing we can do to persuade Iran not to develop these weapons by \ndiplomacy, but our European allies are trying through a combination of \ncarrots and sticks. They believe they cannot succeed, though, unless \nthe United States engages directly in this effort.\n  I asked Dr. Rice whether we should be a party to a deal in which the \nIranians agreed--if there was a way to verify--that they would stop \ntheir attempts to build a nuclear weapon and end their missile program. \nShe said: Well, we have a lot of other problems with Iran.\n  Of course we do. But our No. 1 problem is the growing danger they \nwill develop nuclear weapons. Our best chance\n\n[[Page S518]]\n\nof stopping that is to work with the Europeans in showing Iran it can \nget more if it does the right thing, and what it risks if it does not. \nBut we are sitting on the sidelines, in my view. Nothing Dr. Rice said \ngave me confidence we are really going to get on the playing field.\n  Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Over the past few years, President Putin has reversed the \ncourse of democratic development and the rule of law in Russia. The \nadministration has been largely silent. How can we be so concerned \nabout the advancement of democracy in the Middle East and so \nunconcerned about the regression in Russia?\n  The President gave a powerful, eloquent inaugural address about \nexpanding freedom around the world. Every American shares that ideal--\nit goes to who we are as a people, to our experience, and to our \ninterests.\n  The question isn't the goal, it's how you achieve it. I wonder if the \nPresident plans on bringing a signed copy of his address to President \nPutin when he meets with him next month. I fear that in Russia and many \nother places, the gap between the administration's rhetoric and the \nreality of its policies is only going to get wider.\n  At the same time, we have gotten little in return for turning a blind \neye to Russia's regression. One of the most important programs to \nprotect America' security--the effort to help Russia account for, \nsecure and destroy weapons of mass destruction and related materials--\nhas become mired in redtape that the two Presidents need to cut \nthrough.\n  Finally, in Darfur, Sudan we have watched a terrible tragedy unfold. \nMilitia supported by the government have killed as many as 100,000 \ncivilians and chased as many as 2 million from their homes.\n  Four months ago, before the Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary \nPowell rightly called it genocide. Since then, the situation has gotten \neven worse. Yet we heard virtually nothing from Dr. Rice about what the \nadministration and Congress can do, now, to stop this slaughter and to \nhelp African allies develop their own peacekeeping capacity.\n  Let me end with something hopeful that Dr. Rice talked about: putting \ndiplomacy back at the center of America's foreign policy.\n  That effort is long overdue. Be that as it may, I strongly agree with \nDr. Rice that this is the time for a new diplomatic offensive with old \nallies, rising powers, and even hostile regimes.\n  But our diplomacy has to be sustained. It has to do as much listening \nas it does talking. And it has to use all the tools at our disposal.\n  Our military might is critical. It gives credibility to our \ndiplomacy. And it gives us the most powerful tool in the world to act, \nif necessary, against dictators who are systematically abusing the \nrights of their people, or against regimes with no democratic checks \nthat are harboring terrorists and amassing weapons of mass destruction.\n  But there are many other critical tools that have atrophied under \nthis administration--our intelligence, our public diplomacy, our \nalliances, international organizations, treaties and agreements, \ndevelopment assistance, trade and investment. We need to wield them \nwith the same determination with which we use force--even if it can be \nfrustrating and even if the payoff takes years, even a generation.\n  That is what we did after World War II. That is why we prevailed in \nthe Cold War.\n  Now, faced with a new but no less dangerous set of challenges, we \nmust recapture the totality of America's strength.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude by suggesting that we are now faced \nwith a new but no less dangerous set of challenges than we were in \nWorld War II, and we have to recapture the totality of America's \nstrength.\n  Above all, we have to understand that those who spread radical \nIslamic fundamentalism and weapons of mass destruction, although they \nmay be beyond our reach and there is no choice but to confront them and \nto defeat them, there are still hundreds of millions of hearts and \nminds around the world who practice Islam who are open to American \nideas and ideals, and we have to reach them.\n  Dr. Rice says she is going to make diplomacy her primary task. I will \nwork with her in that effort.\n  One of my colleagues said--by the way, I want to note parenthetically \nthat I think it is totally appropriate for Senator Dayton and Senator \nKennedy and my friend from California to say what they have said, to \ntake the positions they have taken. It is consistent with the facts as \nthey see them. They choose to view one side of the coin. I am viewing \nthe other side of the coin.\n  One of my colleagues said he is voting his notion that this is going \nto get worse. I forget the exact phrase my friend from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kerry, used. Well, it reminded me of a comment by Samuel \nJohnson who described second marriages as the triumph of hope over \nexperience. Well, I may be guilty in this second term of choosing hope \nover experience, because my experience thus far with this \nadministration on foreign policy has been very disquieting. My hope is \nthat the new--and I suspect she will be; I hope she will be confirmed--\nthe new Secretary of State will, in fact, play a role in trying to \nchange that policy, engage in diplomacy, and use the totality of our \nstrength, which includes our ideas and our ideals, as well as our \nmilitary power.\n  I reserve whatever time I may have and thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from California is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I want to begin today by again thanking Chairman Lugar \nand Senator Biden, our ranking member, for a very fair debate on the \nnomination of Dr. Condoleezza Rice as Secretary of State. I know these \nvotes usually go overwhelmingly for the nominee. The last time there \nwas any vote against a nominee, I think the most votes were Kissinger \nat 7 votes. So I know that what I am doing is not about winning a vote; \nit is simply about telling the truth as I see it and other Members \ntelling it as they see it.\n  At the end of the day, when Senators vote, some will be very \nenthusiastic about the nominee and feel very good about their vote. \nOthers will be a little anxious. I sense with Senator Biden, he \ncertainly has anxieties over it, but he is very hopeful. And knowing \nJoe Biden as I do, that definitely fits his character because I think \nhe gave Condoleezza Rice opportunity after opportunity after \nopportunity to set the record straight, to level with the committee. \nSenator Biden was not on the floor yesterday, but I kind of replayed \nhis give and take with future Secretary Rice on the issue of how many \ntroops were trained, and he was literally begging her to please be \ncandid. It is interesting because after that give and take, which was \npicked up by the news media, Ambassador Negroponte came into it and \nsaid: Clearly, there are not 120,000, but there are more than 4,000.\n  All this dancing around is not academic because, as Senator Biden \nclearly stated and as we all know, our exit strategy in Iraq is based \nupon the ability of the Iraqis to defend themselves certainly. We all \nare working toward that day, but we can't do it if we are not going to \nbe honest about how it is going, and we can't help the administration \nif they don't level with us as to how things are going.\n  I found it interesting--and this has nothing to do with this \nparticular nomination--that the White House Chief of Staff called those \nof us who wanted to debate this ``petty.'' I saw one clip of him saying \nthat the two Senators--he didn't mention the names--who were trying to \nget this nomination to the Senate floor and have some time to talk \nabout it were ``small.'' I don't think he was talking about my height. \nThat is showing such a disrespect to the American people, as we go \naround the world trying to bring democracy. It is something we all want \nto do. We may have different ways of going about it, but we want to do \nit. How do we stand tall if we don't uphold our Constitution? Our \nFounders believed it was crucial for the Senate to play a strong role \nin the selection of these very important and powerful positions.\n  Well, thanks to Senators Lugar and Biden, we have done that. I am \nglad.\n\n[[Page S519]]\n\n  The reason I am going to be voting no is clear to anyone who has \nfollowed this debate. I asked Condoleezza Rice a series of questions in \nfive different areas. I gave her every opportunity to correct the \nrecord. I asked her about her statements that the aluminum tubes Saddam \nwas buying could only be used for nuclear weapons, and she talked about \nthe mushroom cloud and frightened the American people at a time when we \nknow she had the information that there was a very strong dispute going \non in the intelligence community and that, in fact, she had known in \n2001 about this issue. She refused to budge.\n  I asked her about her continual statements that al-Qaida and Saddam \nwere close. It was not true. At the time she made those comments, the \nState Department itself put out a very important map--this was 1 month \nafter 9/11--saying that in fact there was no al-Qaida whatsoever in \nIraq. They were nowhere in Iraq. She refused to budge.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may have an additional 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  I asked Dr. Rice about my concerns in five areas. I don't fault the \nPresident for picking someone who believes in this war, who helped him \nin her position. That is not the issue. The issue has to do with the \nlack of candor that continues to come from Dr. Rice.\n  As recently as a few months ago she wrote a letter which resulted in \na very important amendment in the Intelligence bill being stripped from \nthat bill. This was a bill by Senators McCain and Lieberman, and this \nprovision was written in part by Senator Durbin. It was an antitorture \nprovision. She opposed it. She wrote that she opposed it. When I asked \nher about it, she denied that she opposed it, when she had opposed it \nin writing.\n  I know there are other Senators coming to the floor of the Senate and \nsaying this argument doesn't hold because she made statements that came \nfrom faulty intelligence. If that were the case, I would have no \nproblem with Dr. Rice. Everybody knows there was faulty intelligence. \nBut she continues to put out these misstatements. As a matter of fact, \nin front of the committee, if one listened closely, she muddied the \nwaters even more. So I gave her the chance to clear it up, and she \ndidn't. That is bad for the Senate. It is bad for the American people.\n  Dr. King said--and I often repeat it--our lives begin to end the day \nwe become silent about things that matter. This debate mattered. \nResponsibility matters. Accountability matters. It matters when you \ngive someone a chance to correct the record that is replete with half-\ntruths and misstatements, and they don't take that opportunity.\n  Dr. Rice is a role model. She is smart. She is intelligent. She is \nqualified. She is loyal to this President. I don't question any of \nthat. All of that makes everyone proud. The fact is, it would have been \nvery condescending and inappropriate to have someone as skilled as Dr. \nRice before a committee, someone as involved in setting the course of \nthis war as Dr. Rice before the Foreign Relations Committee, and not \nask her the kind of questions we all did.\n  I don't know whether we will have two votes against this nominee or \nfour or seven or eight. I really don't know because I haven't asked one \ncolleague how they are going to vote. This has not been the point of \nwhat I have done. I have simply tried to say that holding people \naccountable is important, that this war matters, that we need to look \nat the mistakes of the past so we don't repeat them, so we don't send \nour young people into another war based on hyped-up rhetoric and half-\ntruths.\n  I thank my colleagues all and again say to my chairman how much I \nappreciate him. I look forward to moving past this on to the other work \nof our committee and the other work of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, yesterday I came to the Senate floor to \nannounce my support for the nomination of Dr. Rice to be our Secretary \nof State and explained why I thought she was more than qualified to \ntake on this critical position at this critical stage in our Nation's \nhistory. In the time and the hours that followed, several of my \ncolleagues came to the floor and announced that they would not support \nthis nomination and explained why. I wanted to return very briefly this \nmorning to simply say that I considered the arguments made against her \nnomination and they do not alter my conclusion that Dr. Condoleezza \nRice is more than qualified to be Secretary of State at this time in \nour Nation's history.\n  Some of the criticisms of the administration's policy, particularly \npost-Saddam in Iraq, I agree with. Others about Dr. Rice personally, I \nvehemently disagree with. But as I see our role here in advising and \nconsenting, the question is not whether we agree with everything the \nnominee has ever done or said but whether the nominee is qualified to \nbe Secretary of State. This nominee is more than qualified.\n  Implicit in this, of course, is that the President has won the right, \nby virtue of his election, to have around him people who have his \nconfidence. This nominee certainly does.\n  Secondly, I want to make a statement about how I read the criticisms \nthat have been expressed. They are all about the past, either about \npast behavior of Dr. Rice or, more particularly, about past \nadministration judgments or actions with regard to foreign policy \ngenerally and particularly about the war in Iraq. I want to make clear \nthat I don't hear criticisms about where we are now or where we should \ngo in the future. It is important that the American people understand \nthat but more important that our friends and foes in Iraq, throughout \nthe Islamic world, and the world generally understand that. There is \nnot substantial dissent in the Senate of the United States about the \npolicy we are following in Iraq today. It is to train the Iraqis to \nbetter secure themselves. It is to give them the opportunity, which \nthey will exercise bravely and I believe successfully this Sunday, to \nelect their own leaders. It is to invest in their own economic well-\nbeing so they can create a model within the Arab world of not only a \nself-governing state but a modernizing state connected to the modern \nworld.\n\n  I have listened to my colleagues who oppose this nomination, and I \nhave spoken to them off the floor. I want to make clear to people \naround the world, there is not a single one of these colleagues who \nwants us to cut and run from Iraq. There is not a single one of these \ncolleagues who does not fully support our troops there. I want our \ntroops to understand that. There is not a single one of these \ncolleagues who is not supportive of the election this Sunday and \nhopeful that people will turn out in large numbers. There is no \nquestion about which side we are on. We are on the side of the people \nof Iraq, struggling bravely for a better future, and we are against \nthat minority there, composed largely of leftovers from Saddam Hussein \nand foreign terrorists associated with al-Qaida, who are killers, \nmurderers, fascists, who want to stop 25 million Iraqis from having a \nbetter life.\n  Finally, if my colleagues believe that Condoleezza Rice is not \nqualified to be Secretary of State of the United States, then, of \ncourse, they must vote against her. But if they are--I hate to use the \nword ``just''--just upset about some of the things this administration \nhas done in Iraq, but if they believe otherwise, that what we are doing \nnow is all we can do to make the situation better, then I appeal to \nthem to vote for Dr. Rice. Give her the benefit of the doubt. In some \nsense, give the President the benefit of the doubt that I believe the \nConstitution entitles him. Give America's national interests the \nbenefit of the doubt. Give our soldiers fighting in Iraq the benefit of \nthe doubt.\n  This nominee has the President's confidence. I want people around the \nworld to know--and I hope with a resounding vote--that though there are \ndisagreements about what the administration has done in regard to our \nIraq policy and other elements of foreign policy, that in the final \nanalysis we are together. We are together for what we are pursuing, \nwhich is the successful conclusion to our involvement in Iraq and to \nthe spread of freedom and democracy throughout the world.\n  I thank the Chair and urge a strong vote for Dr. Condoleezza Rice to \nbe our next Secretary of State.\n\n[[Page S520]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Will the Chair please recognize Senator Domenici.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Lugar for finding time \nfor me to express my views to the Senate and to those who might be \nlistening or viewing the Senate proceedings.\n  I say to Senator Lieberman, I appreciate very much the broad scope of \nhis statement with reference to America and the world, and I thank him \nfor stating his views, which are my views, and I think the views of an \noverwhelming number of Senators--77 of them who voted for us to proceed \nwith this approach to Iraq.\n  I think we all know our intentions, regardless of what some may say, \nare good and that the objective is that something good happen for the \npeople of Iraq and for America and the world.\n  Having said that, I have been dismayed to hear--not everyone on the \nother side--but some use words such as ``liar,'' to use words as to \nthis nominee--Condoleezza Rice--that called her a liar, implied she was \na liar, who implied the President intentionally misled. I would like to \nzero in on that for a minute and those who have been putting forth that \naccusation--I am not talking about those who oppose the war. I am \ntalking about those who say the policy was fraught with intentional \nmisleading information about weapons of mass destruction.\n  I want to step back and say to my fellow Senators and those \nlistening: What if today we were considering for Senate approval \nSecretary of State Colin Powell? Just think with me. He is the nominee. \nHe is being reconfirmed for Secretary of State. What would the Senators \nwho were here talking about Condoleezza Rice or our President \nintentionally misleading, being a liar, implying they had information \nthey withheld, what would they say about Colin Powell?\n  On a certain day, Colin Powell appeared before the United Nations. \nRemember that day? February 5, 2003. I remember it. I think millions \nand millions of people remember it: maps, overviews, a firm statement \nby him about weapons of mass destruction. Now I ask: Where did he get \nhis information? Was he lying? Did he mislead the American people? Was \nhe intentionally trying to force upon us a policy that was not based \nupon what he said but that those facts were dreamed up? I believe that \nneither Senators nor the people of America would believe he was not \ntelling the truth.\n  My point is, he got his information from exactly the same source that \nour President did, that the Prime Minister of Great Britain did, that \nall leaders at that point did, that we the Congress did. The President \ndid not get his information from someplace in the sky, nor did Colin \nPowell. There was only one source: the accumulation of intelligence by \nthe United States intelligence-gathering institutions. They told our \nPresident, Condoleezza Rice, and Colin Powell what was going on, and \nthey all said, what? That there were weapons of mass destruction in \nIraq, and that Saddam was a danger--an exceptional danger--because he \nhad weapons of mass destruction.\n  Frankly, I believe there are those who have become partisan on this \nissue, and I almost would say, and should say, extremely partisan, who \nhave become totally political on this issue and totally personal. There \nis no evidence whatsoever that Colin Powell lied, that he was \nmisleading us, that Condoleezza Rice was a part of a policy to mislead \nthe American people, nor that the President was. They all had the same \ninformation. One would not think that from what we have heard on the \nfloor. One would not think that as you hear those who want to deny her \nthis nomination.\n  Frankly, that argument does not wash. It is not consistent with \nreality. It is dreamed up. It is political. It is for no other reason \nthan to insert false and untrue information and facts into this \ndiscussion. She deserves the nomination.\n  The President did not intentionally mislead. Those who oppose the war \nought to say it and quit exaggerating and being political and personal \nabout their attacks.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Lugar, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I take very seriously the United States \nSenate's responsibility to provide advice and consent for the \nPresident's nominees. Generally, I believe that the President of the \nUnited States should be allowed to have the people he chooses in his \ncabinet to implement the policies he has been elected to put in place--\nproviding they are qualified to do the job. The vote should not be \nabout the ideology of the nominee--that decision is up to the \nPresident--but rather about the nominee's ability to perform the job.\n  Condoleezza Rice certainly has the academic training and the \nprofessional credentials to be Secretary of State. She is bright, \narticulate, and well versed in diplomatic procedures. She works \nextremely hard, is dedicated to her job, and is very close to the \nPresident. In many respects, she was the natural choice to succeed \nSecretary Colin Powell.\n  But, I am afraid there is a showstopper here. As National Security \nAdvisor, Ms. Rice has been one of the most public faces of this \nadministration's policy in Iraq. She has been the public face of this \nadministration's crusade to generate American support for an invasion. \nIn her effort to do this, Ms. Rice has made many of the most \ncategorical statements on Iraq, claiming that we had evidence that \nSaddam Hussein was pursuing weapons of mass destruction, that Saddam \nhad ties to the al Qaeda terrorists, that we were threatened by a \nmushroom cloud from Iraq, or a little vial that Saddam might give to \nterrorists to poison us. Over and over again, Ms. Rice has used every \nshred of evidence she could find, even evidence that the CIA urged her \nto retract, in order to make the case that Iraq was a direct and \nimmediate threat to the United States.\n  We now know that most of the intelligence information that led the \nPresident to conclude Iraq was an immediate threat to the United States \nwas wrong. Not only have no weapons of mass destruction been found in \nIraq, but no evidence has surfaced of any recent attempt by Saddam to \ndevelop these weapons. No ties with al Qaeda have come to light. \nIronically, it now appears that since the U.S. invasion, terrorists \ngroups are enjoying a surge in recruitment and have even set up \ntraining camps in Iraq. Hatred of America's actions in Iraq has surged \nthroughout the Muslim world and beyond. Condoleezza Rice is not solely \nresponsible for this dangerous turn of events, but she is inextricably \nlinked to this policy, and refuses to admit that any mistakes have been \nmade by this administration.\n  A hallmark of the administration's Iraq policy has been a refusal to \nwork with the international community. President Bush preferred to go \nit alone rather than be hampered by the constraints of the United \nNations or make the concessions necessary to form a broad coalition. \nMs. Rice was a prime spokesperson for this policy. She repeatedly \njustified the doctrine of preemption and defended the wisdom of going \nit alone, even if it meant losing the support of our closest allies. \nShe was the public face of this policy of contempt for the role of \ndiplomacy.\n  The Secretary of State is America's second most visible face to the \nworld. If he or she is to be effective, the Secretary must be seen as \ntruthful, forthright, and respectful of other nations. The hallmark of \nthis administration's foreign policy has been its willingness to \ndistort information in the service of its political objectives, and its \nfailure to tell the truth. It has viewed other nations as either naive \nor cowardly if they have disagreed with our policy. Ms. Rice has been \nthe public face of this policy and this ``modus operendi''. Nothing \ncould be more detrimental to her ability to be a successful Secretary \nof State.\n  I have said all along that this war is wrong, that the \nadministration's rationale for this war was faulty, and that the \nconsequences of this war may be very detrimental to our national \ninterest and our national security. Unfortunately, it looks like these \nobservations are proving correct.\n  More than 1,370 American soldiers have died in this war, and over \n10,000 have been wounded, many of them maimed for life. Countless \nthousands of Iraqis have died--we will probably never know how many. \nTheir country has been devastated, and as of now, it\n\n[[Page S521]]\n\nappears this Sunday's elections are unlikely to bring about any \nresolution of the internal strife. Civil war is a real possibility, and \ntoday it is hard to see how progress is going to be made toward the \nadministration's goal of stability in Iraq.\n  Condoleezza Rice has been a lead architect of our Nation's failed \nforeign policy and of the war in Iraq. Therefore I believe she is \nseverely handicapped in her ability to be America's chief diplomat and \nthe chief architect of America's effort to resolve these problems. This \nadministration has not hesitated to play loose with the truth and show \ncontempt for international opinion. These are not the tools of \nsuccessful diplomacy, the primary responsibility of the Secretary of \nState.\n  Therefore, sadly, for the first time in my Senate career, I must cast \nmy vote against a Cabinet-level nominee. I will vote no on the \nnomination of Condoleezza Rice to be Secretary of State.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I speak today in response to some things \nI have heard a few of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say \nabout Dr. Condoleezza Rice. I want to set the record straight and \nexpress my full support for her confirmation.\n  Dr. Rice is without question one of the most qualified people ever to \nbe chosen as Secretary of State. She is more qualified to be Secretary \nof State than all 100 Senators are for their jobs.\n  It is not surprising to me that I have not heard any of my colleagues \nquestion Dr. Rice's qualifications. She is one of the most well-rounded \nforeign policy experts in the nation, having spent some 25 years in \nGovernment, the private sector, and academics.\n  In Government, she has served three Presidents, including service at \nthe National Security Council and the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the \nPentagon. As National Security Advisor, one of the most important \nforeign policy positions in our Government, she has been a key \narchitect of our Nation's response to terrorism and threats abroad. \nSince she joined the Bush administration as National Security Advisor, \nthis administration has reached an agreement with Russia to reduce \nnuclear weapons, successfully achieved the return of our military \npersonnel from China when their plane was taken hostage, engaged North \nKorea in multilateral talks to end their nuclear weapons program, \nlaunched an effort to fight AIDS around the world, and freed millions \nof people living under the tyranny of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban.\n  In addition to her Government service, Dr. Rice has spent time in the \nbusiness world where she gained the management experience needed to run \nan organization as large and diverse as the State Department. She has \nserved on numerous corporate boards, and was the top budget official at \nStanford University when she served as Provost.\n  While I do not think that academic achievement alone qualifies \nsomeone for a job as important as Secretary of State, there is no \nquestion Dr. Rice has proven her intelligence, knowledge, and hard work \nthrough her academic career. She has three degrees, including a \ndoctorate, in Government and foreign policy. She has written numerous \nbooks and articles on national defense and foreign policy topics. And \nwhile serving as Provost at Stanford, she was also the top academic \nofficer of that prestigious university.\n  Rather than questioning Dr. Rice's qualifications, the few Senators \nwho have come to the floor to speak against her are simply playing \npolitics. I fear the Senators I listened to all day yesterday are \nacting out of bitterness from the rejection of their ideas and \ncandidates at the polls last fall. They are attacking Dr. Rice in a \ncontinuing effort to tear down our great President and to tear down his \npolicies that are bringing freedom and democracy to those who have \nnever experienced it. Worse yet, I fear some of my colleagues are \nattacking Dr. Rice to paint a false picture of her because they believe \nshe may one day seek elected office, or even be an opponent at the \nballot box.\n  Well, I have no such concerns about Dr. Rice, and I have no problems \nsupporting her. Late last year I had the pleasure to sit down with Dr. \nRice and discuss her vision for our foreign policy and the State \nDepartment. I was impressed by how clearly she discussed the war on \nterrorism and our involvement in the Middle East. We are involved in an \neffort to bring freedom, democracy, and individual rights to a region \nof the world that has never known any of those things. Dr. Rice \nunderstands that those changes will not happen in just a few months or \nyears. It will take decades, if not generations, to see the Middle East \ntransform into a peaceful and stable region. The next few years are \ncritical to that effort, and I believe Dr. Rice is the right person to \nlead our relations with Middle Eastern nations as well as all nations \naround the world.\n  Mr. President, I am confident the Senate will overwhelmingly confirm \nDr. Rice, and I wish her well. She has a huge task ahead of her, \nincluding bringing accountability to the United Nations and getting to \nthe bottom of the Oil-for-Food scandal, and I hope this body will be \nresponsive to her needs as she works to promote freedom and our \nnational security.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, the vote on whether to confirm \nCondoleezza Rice as Secretary of State is a difficult decision. The \nadministration and Defense Department's Iraq policy has been, by any \nreasonable measure, riddled with errors, misstatements, and \nmisjudgments. From the beginning of the Iraqi war, we were inadequately \nprepared for the aftermath of the invasion with too few troops and an \ninadequate plan to stabilize Iraq. Today, we are reaping the \nconsequences of those decisions with continuing tragic losses of \nAmerican and Iraqi lives, a full-fledged insurgency in Iraq and a lack \nof security and stability in many areas. In fact, the National \nIntelligence Council, the CIA's own think tank, recently stated that \nIraq has now replaced Afghanistan as the prime international terrorist \nhaven--a deeply disturbing result of our problematic policies.\n  In her role as National Security Advisor, Dr. Rice was a member of \nthe team responsible for our flawed Iraq policy. She made several \nmisleading statements about the presence of weapons of mass destruction \nin the lead up to the war. And in the almost 2 years since the Iraq \ninvasion, the flawed policies on Iraq have not been corrected. Indeed, \nDr. Rice has tremendous difficulty in even admitting error though \nobvious errors abound. In addition, $18 billion has been appropriated \nfor the reconstruction of Iraq, but only a tiny percentage of that \nmoney has actually been spent because of the violence in Iraq.\n  Although I profoundly disagree and deeply regret how this war has \nbeen conducted, my concern has less to do with Dr. Rice and more to do \nwith President Bush, Vice President Cheney, and Secretary Rumsfeld. The \nfact is that the President was reelected, and, though I was strongly \nopposed to his reelection, he was reelected nonetheless. I do not \nbelieve, however, that accountability ends with an election. We are all \npublic servants, including the President and his team, and we are all \ntherefore accountable to the public for our achievements and mistakes \non a continual basis. We are also accountable to the future and to \nhistory.\n  So while I, and many of my colleagues, have strong concerns about her \nrole in the development of a flawed Iraq policy, an overwhelming \nmajority on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, including a large \nmajority of committee Democrats, voted in favor of forwarding her \nnomination to the full Senate. While many of my Democratic colleagues \non the committee, including the ranking member, share my concern over \nher role in our Iraq policy, they think it worthwhile to give her a \nchance in this new role. That judgment, from Senators who had the \nopportunity to probe and question Dr. Rice on her qualifications, tips \nthe balance in favor of voting for Dr. Rice's nomination to be \nSecretary of State, in my mind.\n  I am hopeful that Dr. Rice's background and training will enable her \nto serve as Secretary of State with distinction and that she will carry \nthe lessons of our policy failures in Iraq with her as she leads the \nDepartment of State. She does have the President's ear and I hope she \nwill use her role to direct the President's attention to addressing our \nfrayed alliances in Europe, our relationships with Latin America, our \npolicy toward Russia, nuclear proliferation around the world, \nespecially in Iran and North Korea, personal sustained attention to new \nopportunities\n\n[[Page S522]]\n\nfor lasting security and peace in the Middle East, problems and \nopportunities posed by China, Afghanistan, India and Pakistan and to \nlead the world's efforts to address the global crises of AIDS and other \ndiseases, environmental degradation, poverty, education and health care \nin the developing world, and human rights.\n  As National Security Advisor, Dr. Rice's role was to advise the \nPresident. The Secretary of State has a different role as the Nation's \nchief diplomat. Dr. Rice's proposed appointments to senior positions \nwithin the State Department are well-qualified experienced personnel.\n  I am hopeful that Dr. Rice's statements during the recent hearings in \nsupport of reaching out to allies, public diplomacy and building \ncoalitions will be more than words, but instead describe a genuine \neffort to ensure that our country leads the world though its strong \nalliances, values and example.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad that we have had a few more days \nto consider and hours to discuss this nomination. Some have suggested \nthat we should have simply ``voice voted'' Dr. Rice's nomination so she \ncould be confirmed in time for the inauguration. Senators are here to \nadvise and consent, not rubber stamp for the White House's convenience.\n  We needed this extra time for debate. The Secretary of State is the \nchief foreign policy adviser to the President and fourth in the line of \nPresidential succession. And, like some other Senators, I was \ndisappointed by Dr. Rice's testimony before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee last week.\n  I had hoped that her testimony would demonstrate the kind of \nforthright, objective analysis that I believe we need in a Secretary of \nState. Unfortunately, it did not. I share the serious concerns \nexpressed by Senator Boxer and Senator Kerry, and I commend them and \nother Senators for voicing them.\n  I have not been impressed with Dr. Rice's performance as National \nSecurity Adviser. Strong leadership, openness, and sound judgment have \nbeen far less evident at the National Security Council during her \ntenure than I would have liked.\n  I also believe that she has not always been forthright with Congress \nor the American people. She contributed to the exaggerated public \nstatements, false information in the President's State of the Union \nspeech about Iraq's supposed attempts to acquire nuclear material, and \nthe selective declassification of intelligence, which helped to create \nan atmosphere of hysteria that led us into war in Iraq. She and others \ncreated the false--the false--impression that Iraq posed an imminent \nthreat to the United States.\n  These were serious failures, made worse by Dr. Rice's unwavering \nadvocacy and support for the administration's policies that have cost \nthe lives of over 1,300 American soldiers and an estimated 100,000 \nIraqis, many of them noncombatants.\n  It has alienated our friends and allies and convinced many of the \nworld's Muslims that we are at war with Islam itself. It led to the \natrocities at Abu Ghraib. It has added $200 billion to the Federal \ndeficit and at the rate we are going that is only a down payment.\n  There are now 150,000 American troops, many of them National Guard \nand Reserve, bogged down in an unwinnable war in Iraq that has become a \nhaven for terrorists.\n  Yet Dr. Rice refuses to own up to the Administration's failures. When \nconfronted with her own glaringly inconsistent statements regarding \nweapons of mass destruction which were the primary justification for \nthe war, she responded that the question unfairly impugned her \nintegrity.\n  She had an opportunity to reassure her detractors, and believe me \nthere are many in my State of Vermont, when she testified last week. \nShe declined to do so, and that was disappointing and frustrating to \nthose of us who want her to succeed in her new position.\n  My vote in favor of Dr. Rice is difficult to explain. It is more the \nproduct of a belief than a cold analysis of her record. I believe that \nDr. Rice is capable of learning from her mistakes and changing her \nways. That she will rise to this new challenge. That she can be a good \nSecretary of State.\n  The other major reason I am voting in favor of Dr. Rice's nomination \nis that I am the ranking member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee. \nIn this capacity, I have a responsibility to work with the Secretary of \nState, on a daily basis, to tackle a full range of international issues \ncritical to the United States and the rest of the world: AIDS and other \nglobal health issues, human rights, the United Nations, terrorism, the \nenvironment, women's rights, poverty, corruption, to name just a few.\n  By voting for Dr. Rice's nomination, I am sending a clear message: I \nwant to get this important working relationship started on the right \ntrack. I hope that my vote will be a step towards a more constructive \nU.S. foreign policy. After all, it is these policies that ultimately \nimpact the lives of billions of people around the world.\n  During the first term, the Bush administration dug a deep hole: \nrelationships with our oldest allies are badly strained, Iraq is a \nmess, and our own country is badly divided.\n  We need to come together as a Nation to deal with these and many \nother problems. But coming together does not mean ignoring valid \ncriticism, embarking on a policy that pleases only one side of the \naisle, and accusing those opposed of being un-American or unpatriotic. \nCriticism and dissent are the essence of democracy, the essence of \npatriotism.\n  Coming together means genuine consultations with members of both \npolitical parties, and policies which reflect a range of views even if \nthey do not fit into preconceived ideologies.\n  As I said, I hope that my vote here today will, in some small way, \nhelp begin this process. I hope it will allow us to get back to the \nreal practice of the Vandenberg rule--that politics end at the water's \nedge--and away from the slash and burn politics practiced during the \nfirst term of the Bush administration.\n  I hope that Dr. Rice will meet me half way. I want to work with her \non the many pressing issues that concern both Democrats and \nRepublicans, including the issues of freedom and human rights that the \nPresident spoke of in his inaugural address that are so important not \nonly to Americans, but to people everywhere.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Dr. Condoleezza \nRice to be our next Secretary of State. I am pleased to echo the \nsentiments of many of my colleagues--Dr. Rice's accomplishments are \ninspirational, and she sets an amazing role model for young people in \nour Nation today.\n  We are considering a person for Secretary of State with an impressive \neducational resume, a person who has lived through some of the most \ntrying eras of our history and who represents the best of America. Dr. \nCondoleezza Rice is more than well qualified to be Secretary of State. \nShe served 6 years as the Provost of Stanford University. Under \nPresident George H. W. Bush, she was Director and Senior Director of \nSoviet and East European Affairs in the National Security Council, and \na Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.\n  With her experience the last 4 years as National Security Adviser to \nPresident Bush, she comes prepared for this position like no other \nperson could. She knows our President and his foreign policy and \nnational security issues. She will arrive at a new job with a full \nunderstanding of the President's plan for our chief diplomat.\n  I have had the privilege of working with Dr. Rice during her tenure \nas National Security Adviser. In 2001, Dr. Rice played an instrumental \nrole in the Senate's passage of S. 149, the Export Administration Act \nof 2001, a bill I introduced in 2000. S. 149 was a strong bill that \nwould have modernized our national export control system for dual-use \nitems and technology. The bill, which required a risk-based analysis of \nproposed exports and emphasized transparency and accountability, \ngarnered vocal support from the President, the Secretaries of Defense \nand State, and our National Security Adviser, Dr. Condoleeza Rice. The \nsupport of Dr. Rice underscored the strength of the bill's national \nsecurity provisions. Unfortunately, Congress failed to pass S. 149 into \nlaw before adjourning the 106th Congress.\n  As such, I look forward to working again with Dr. Rice in her new \ncapacity as Secretary of State on issues related to export controls. In \nher new role, I believe she will be a leader within the interagency \nprocess on dual-use\n\n[[Page S523]]\n\nexports, as well as an effective leader for the Office of Defense Trade \nControls, ODTC, which administers the International Traffic in Arms \nRegulations, ITAR, and maintains the munitions list--a list of items \ncontrolled for defense purposes. Dr. Rice's experience on the National \nSecurity Council has well prepared her for a job that will require a \nfair and realistic approach to controlling both defense and dual-use \nexports.\n  We must ensure that our export control system keeps sensitive items \nand technology out of the hands of the terrorists and other bad actors. \nAt the same time, we must also make sure our troops and allies, who are \nfighting every day for freedom and democracy, have access to the best \nand most technologically advanced tools of our time. This will take \nforward thinking from all the Departments responsible for controlling \ndefense and dual-use items, including the Department of State. Our \nexport control policy must take into consideration the fact that the \nU.S. military and private high-tech companies are codependent Private \ncompanies are pushing the technological envelope for both militarily \ncritical and civilian products. And we must work toward a system that \nallows these companies to continue growing and developing so as not to \nstifle the military's rate of technological advancement. I believe Dr. \nRice will provide an intelligent and knowledgeable voice in this \nendeavor.\n  I have been disappointed with the comments made by some of my \ncolleagues. While we all certainly have the right and duty to disagree \non policy and procedures, the nature of some comments have gone beyond \nwhat is appropriate for this body. I strongly believe the character of \nDr. Rice and her integrity are above reproach. The criticism heard \nhere, unfortunately, reaches beyond the Senate and far beyond \nWashington.\n  I remind my colleagues that when we speak on the Senate floor, our \nwords are heard by brave men and women serving overseas. Our words are \nheard by their families and their friends who make it possible for them \nto serve our Nation so well. I hope we all remember that as we debate \nthe merits of our foreign policy and the nomination of Dr. Rice.\n  I am pleased to again state my support for the nomination of Dr. \nRice. Her experience, her dedication, her integrity, and her character \nwill make her a good representative of our Nation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have serious reservations about the \nnomination of Condoleezza Rice for Secretary of State.\n  While I believe that the President deserves the opportunity to select \nhis own team in the construction of his Cabinet, the confirmation \nprocess is one which gives the U.S. Senate the opportunity to reject a \nselection that it feels would not be in the best interest of our \ncountry.\n  The nomination of National Security Advisor Rice to become Secretary \nof State has been troubling to me because she was a part of the \ndispensing of intelligence information to justify the war in Iraq. That \nintelligence turned out to be fundamentally wrong.\n  There is no question that Ms. Rice has the intellect, the academic \nbackground, and the work history to justify this nomination. She is \nextraordinarily talented and skilled. But even so, I have significant \nreservations about her role in the use of intelligence leading up to \nthe Iraq war.\n  I recognize she was working for and representing the President, the \nVice President, and others in the administration, but nonetheless she \ntoo must bear responsibility for some very significant mistakes.\n  I sought out Condoleezza Rice yesterday for a personal conversation \nabout a number of the issues that concerned me. We had a full and \nlengthy discussion about those matters, especially the use of \nintelligence leading up to the war.\n  I've decided after much reflection that I will cast a vote for her \nconfirmation, but it is a close call for me. I fervently hope that this \nadministration, including the President and the new Secretary of State, \nwill rethink some of the foreign policy initiatives that I believe have \nmade our country less secure--not more secure.\n  So I will cast a yes vote with reservations and hope that this \nadministration has learned from the serious mistakes in foreign policy \nit has made in its first term.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today we are considering the nomination \nof Condoleezza Rice to be Secretary of State. Dr. Rice is \nprofessionally competent and accomplished. Her academic background is \nimpressive and she has the diplomatic skills necessary to serve as \nSecretary of State. I intend to vote in favor of her nomination, but \nnot without expressing serious reservations and concerns. This \nadministration's first term was marked by a series of failures and \nmiscalculations that have cost this country dearly. Dr. Rice, as \nNational Security Adviser, must bear some of the responsibility for \nthese mistakes. Now, however, she also has an opportunity to correct \nthem. I will therefore cast this vote with the hope and expectation \nthat she will work with the Congress to forge a new approach to our \nforeign policy.\n  Dr. Rice's tasks, if she is eventually confirmed, are numerous and \ndaunting.\n  The administration should be rapidly expanding efforts to stop the \nproliferation of nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union and \nthroughout the world. The prospect of these materials in the hands of \nterrorists is truly the greatest risk to our national security. \nMobilizing our allies in a concerted and coordinated effort to stop \nIran's nuclear program must also be at the top of the new Secretary's \nagenda.\n  Additionally, the administration must finally engage with the rest of \nthe world in addressing global climate change. Almost every day, new \nscientific evidence raises the world's concern and challenges our fate.\n  The administration should also expand efforts to combat HIV/AIDS to \ninclude India and other second-tier countries. Thus far, its words have \nbeen right, but the financial reality has fallen short.\n  We should fully fund our development and disaster assistance accounts \nand finally meet the promises of the Millennium Challenge Account.\n  The administration, working with our allies, needs to broaden nation-\nbuilding efforts in Afghanistan so that warlords and narcotics do not \ndestroy the hope of Afghan democracy.\n  And it must confront human rights abusers, not just in the ``outposts \nof tyranny'' mentioned by Dr. Rice in her testimony to the Foreign \nRelations Committee, but in Saudi Arabia, China, Central Asia and \nthroughout the world.\n  And, we must address these and many other challenges with a new \ncommitment to our alliances. For 50 years, American leadership helped \nbuild international institutions to fight common threats and promote \nthe common good. We drafted treaties to articulate universal values and \nentrench them in international law. And we constructed great military \nalliances to protect not just ourselves but our friends overseas. With \na renewed commitment to alliance building and real engagement around \nthe world, we can begin to end our own current isolation, rescue the \nreputation of U.S. policy overseas, and bring the resources of our \nfriends and allies to bear on the global challenges we all face.\n  While Dr. Rice will face many challenges ahead, I intend to speak in \ndetail today on two topics: Iraq and Darfur.\n  The administration's approach to Iraq has been disastrous from the \nstart. The intelligence used by the administration on weapons of mass \ndestruction and links to al Qaeda were flat wrong. We must begin to \nlearn the lesson of this colossal failure and ensure that we have \naccurate, objective intelligence. I have and will continue to call for \na full accounting of the development and use of the intelligence that \nled us into Iraq. But in the coming years, I also expect our Secretary \nof State to join in demanding real intelligence reform. Without it, we \nwill be unable to stabilize Iraq or confront other current and future \nthreats. Our foreign policy must be based on an understanding of our \nenemies. And our policies and the intelligence behind them must be \ncredible with our friends.\n  The Administration's approach to the war in Iraq was disastrously \nunilateral. It ignored the weapons inspectors, rejected our allies, and \nended up isolating America. The result of these policies is now borne \nby our troops, who are fighting nearly alone in Iraq, and by American \ntaxpayers, who are\n\n[[Page S524]]\n\npaying 90 percent of the costs of the war. We cannot afford to continue \nin this vein. I hope that, in this second term, the administration will \nrecognize the heavy costs of unilateralism and place a priority on \ndiplomacy and alliances. With Iraqi elections less than a week away, \nthe new Secretary of State can begin by acknowledging that ballots do \nnot equal democracy, and that the hard work of stabilizing Iraq will \nrequire a concerted global effort. Intellectual honesty is a must for \nthis administration and for our Secretary of State.\n  There have been a series of miscalculations with regard to almost \nevery aspect of the occupation. The administration failed to commit \nsufficient troops. It did not consider the political, military and \neconomic challenges inherent in occupying a foreign country. It \nanticipated neither an insurgency nor sectarian and ethnic conflict. It \npermitted looting and chaos, when order was so critical. It failed to \nraise an Iraqi security force before the insurgency was already raging. \nAnd its confused policies regarding detention and interrogation led to \nthe abuses at Abu Ghraib. On the international stage and in Iraq \nitself, the damage caused by these mistakes must be addressed head on. \nTrust must be rebuilt, through candor and through real changes in \npolicy.\n  Another great challenge facing the new Secretary of State is Darfur. \nSecretary of State Powell's declaration of September 9, 2004 that \ngenocide was occurring was appropriate, and I applauded the \nadministration at the time. But having made that declaration, we cannot \nallow genocide to continue. Nor is the reluctance of other nations to \ntake a tougher position an excuse for inaction. In her testimony to the \nForeign Relations Committee, Dr. Rice stated that the reason the U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions on Darfur have been so weak was because \nother members of the Council opposed sanctions against Khartoum. While \nthis is true, it is time to put real pressure on those countries. \nHundreds of thousands of lives are at stake in Darfur. We cannot accept \nbusiness as usual at the U.N. If our bilateral relations with countries \nthat oppose action to stop the genocide suffer, then that is how it \nshould be. Saving lives, stopping genocide is the high ground. It is a \nmoral imperative.\n\n  But through principled and sustained leadership, we have an \nopportunity to find common ground with our allies and partners. Next \nweek, a U.N. Commission is expected to identify those in Sudan \nresponsible for crimes against humanity. This is the time for \naccountability. All parties need to put aside their own agendas and do \nwhat is right for the sake of stopping this genocide, and deterring \nfuture crimes against humanity. Those countries who have opposed \nsanctions against Sudan need to accept the findings of the Commission \nand change course. And the administration should be open to all forms \nof justice and accountability, including the International Criminal \nCourt.\n  This week, the United Nations General Assembly is holding a special \nsession to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the \nNazi death camps. This session is convening in the spirit of ``never \nagain.'' Soon we have the names of those committing genocide, brought \nto us by a U.N. Commission established thanks to pressure from the \nUnited States. We must not allow ideology to stand in the way of \naccountability. Referring this case to the ICC will not threaten any \nAmericans. Rather, it will push the ICC toward the purpose for which it \nwas created and affirm America's leadership with regard to universal \nvalues of justice and accountability.\n  Finally, on Darfur, we must push harder for the full deployment of \nAfrican Union troops. Dr. Rice testified that only a third of a 3,300 \nperson AU force is currently in Darfur. It has been more than 4 months \nsince the U.N. Security Council called for the ``rapid expansion'' of \nthe AU force. Congress has appropriated $75 million specifically for \nthis expansion. Getting those troops in place immediately and providing \nthem with all the resources they need to succeed must be a top priority \nfor the new Secretary of State.\n  And if they succeed, this success will ripple outward across Africa. \nHaving stopped a genocide, visionary African leaders will be positioned \nto address future crises on the continent and the AU will have taken an \nimportant step forward as a credible and forceful institution.\n  Darfur represents an opportunity for this administration to live up \nto the words articulated by the President in his inaugural address.\n  The President said, ``All who live in tyranny and hopelessness can \nknow: the United States will not ignore your oppression, or excuse your \noppressors.'' How, then, can we stand by in the face of genocide?\n  The President, quoting Abraham Lincoln, said, ``Those who deny \nfreedom to others deserve it not for themselves; and, under the rule of \na just God, cannot long retain it.'' With the names of those \nresponsible for the killing in Darfur, are we not obligated to see \njustice served?\n  And the President, speaking to our allies, said, ``We honor your \nfriendship, we rely on your counsel, and we depend on your help.'' When \nthe African Union expresses a desire to deploy an effective force in \nDarfur, how can we not do everything in our power to make sure that \nthey succeed?\n  The challenges ahead our many. And this administration, in its first \nterm, has made many mistakes. But the collective wisdom of America is \ngreat. Our new Secretary of State and the rest of the Administration's \nnational security team can, if it chooses, work together with Congress \nand forge a new approach--one that will make us safer and create a \nbetter world.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the pending \nnomination of Condoleezza Rice to be Secretary of State. First, I start \noff by commending the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the \nForeign Relations Committee, Senators Lugar and Biden, for their \nefforts to ensure that all members had the time to engage Dr. Rice and \nto express their thoughts on this very important nomination. I would \nalso like to thank Dr. Rice for her willingness to devote as much time \nas necessary to answer our questions.\n  Unlike many other confirmation hearings for Secretary of State, the \nnominee before us is well known to Congress and to the American people. \nShe has a distinguished record as an academic and has served in many \nimportant positions as a public servant. Clearly, she has the requisite \nskills and experience for this post.\n  Rightly, the focus of last Tuesday's and Wednesday's committee \nhearings concerned in great part her role as the President's National \nSecurity Advisor in the first term and her vision of what our foreign \npolicy should be in the second term. It is no secret that many of us on \nthe committee have had our differences with the Bush administration's \nforeign policy agenda during these past 4 years. Nonetheless, I had \nhoped that the hearings with Dr. Rice would demonstrate that she had \ngrown somewhat intellectually and would be prepared be more analytical \nabout the strengthens and weaknesses of U.S. policy over the past, 4 \nyears. Sadly that has not been the case.\n  Instead, I have come away with the impression that when it comes to \nour foreign policy agenda, it is likely that we can expect more of the \nsame when it comes to policy priorities. As well, I have every reason \nto believe following these interactions that the lack of transparency \nand accountability which was the hallmark of this administration in the \nfirst term will continue into the foreseeable future. These flaws have \nled the United States to have a negative image both domestically and \nabroad.\n  It now appears that little will change in that regard.\n  For example, Dr. Rice's comments, or lack thereof, on the issue of \ntorture were startling to this Senator, as I presume they were to many \nof my colleagues. I asked her a simple question, whether or not she \nfelt that on the issue of certain interrogation techniques such as \nwater boarding, forced nudity, and the use of stress positions are \ntantamount to torture. I asked her to consider this not in the context \nof whether or not members of al-Qaida are covered by the Geneva \nConventions but as a human being reflecting on the actions of one \nperson against another. My question was straightforward; however, Dr. \nRice's answer was anything but. In fact, at no point did she provide\n\n[[Page S525]]\n\na clear answer to the question I posed. Disturbingly, her lack of a \nclear answer implies that she neither defines these methods as torture \nnor opposes their use in the war on terror.\n  International laws and treaties exist for the protection of all \nparties. They contribute to security and to a more humane world. \nAgreements such as the Geneva Convention project to the world the \nvalues we hold so dear in America, liberty, freedom, the rule of law. \nWe are better intrinsically for abiding by them, and we are better \noff--Americans are safer--when we successfully protect the values they \nenshrine.\n  After all, following World War II, our Nation insisted on trying Nazi \nwar criminals, people who were guilty of the most heinous crimes ever \ncommitted against humanity.\n  We insisted on this because we understood the importance of the rule \nof law, of being better than the enemy, and that this was the most \neffective way to spread our values, our common cause against tyranny. \nOf all the memories I hold dear, I am proud of none more than that of \nthe role my father played as a prosecutor at those trials in Nuremburg.\n  Dr. Rice chose not to answer my simple question. She had a chance to \nspeak to the whole world yesterday and today to convey the message as \nto how she will address this issue. I think she is off to a poor start. \nAnd I would recommend, for the sake of our national security and \nAmerican citizens globally that she should reflect upon this subject \nmatter when she assumes her duties as Secretary of State.\n  I am also troubled by her unwillingness to admit that there were any \nmistakes made by the Bush administration with respect to the \npreparation for the war and its aftermath. Even after all the deaths \nand instability that have plagued Iraq since the U.S. invasion of 2003, \nDr. Rice does not appear to have any second thoughts about decisions \ntaken with respect to Iraq. Surely, mistakes have been made. But Dr. \nRice appears inclined to follow in the President's footsteps of not \nbeing willing to admit mistakes. She was reluctant to admit even the \nmost glaring mistake, that Iraq did not possess WMD, even though that \nwas the fundamental rationale behind the Bush administration's original \ndrive to go to war.\n  In addition, it was painfully obvious that Dr. Rice does not \ncurrently have much of a feel for policy in the Western Hemisphere. \nWith respect to Venezuela, she seems determined to pursue the same path \nthat has done nothing to further democracy, and which has instead made \nit easy for President Hugo Chavez to vilify the United States. With \nrespect to Cuba, she seems stuck in a 40-year-old fixation on a 78-\nyear-old man, a mode of thought that is outdated, counterintuitive, and \nultimately has proven itself unsuccessful. Our inane policy toward that \nisland nation is exemplified by the fact that it is the only country in \nthe entire world to which the U.S. Government prevents its citizens \nfrom traveling. Americans can travel to Iran and North Korea, two \nnations that are unarguably more threatening, but not to Cuba. Yet, Dr. \nRice seems intent on retaining these failed policies.\n  I also took note of her refusal to provide a straight answer to \nquestions she was asked regarding a recent article about U.S. plans for \nmilitary action against Iran, which was written by the respected \njournalist Seymour Hersh and published in the most recent edition of \nthe New Yorker magazine. Dr. Rice contended that the article was full \nof inaccuracies. However, the question put to her by Senator Kerry was \nquite specific, is the article's contention about U.S. plans with \nrespect to Iran true or false. That is a simple question with a one \nword answer. If that particular part of the article is inaccurate, it \nwould have been easy and painless to say so. Her lack of candor did not \nappear to have anything to do with the information being classified. \nHad that been the case, Dr. Rice could simply have responded that any \ninformation regarding the matter would have to be discussed in a \nclassified briefing. But she did not.\n  All of these issues I have discussed are troubling to say the least. \nThey raise very serious concerns about the direction our foreign policy \nwill take over the next 4 years. Nonetheless, I believe that except in \nextraordinary circumstances, the President has the right to choose his \nor her Secretary of State. Therefore it is with serious reservations \nthat I voted to report this nomination favorably to the full Senate and \nwill support her confirmation when the full Senate votes on this \nmatter. However, I would offer some words of advice to Dr. Rice. First, \nthat she reflect upon some of the issues and concerns raised during her \nconfirmation hearings. And second, that she never forget as Secretary \nof State that she is not just the President's representative, she is \nthe representative of the American people. She should never forget \nthat.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, President Bush made an excellent choice \nin nominating Dr. Condoleezza Rice to be America's next Secretary of \nState. She has both the professional experience and the personal \nintegrity to make a great Secretary of State.\n  I cannot think of a candidate more qualified to be Secretary of State \nthan Condoleezza Rice. Dr. Rice's experience and expertise are truly \nmulti-facted. She is a distinguished public servant and has led one of \nour country's most distinguished universities. She has 25 years of \nexperience in foreign policy, having served three Presidents as a key \nadvisor.\n  She has led the President's national security team with strength and \nexpertise. A short list of her many accomplishments include developing \nsix-party talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear program, helping \nto design the President's landmark emergency AIDS relief package, and \nstrengthening relations with Russia and China. In her capacity as \nNational Security Advisor, Dr. Rice has developed personal working \nrelationships with international leaders and governments that will \nenable her to nurture alliances and conduct effective diplomacy around \nthe world. She was instrumental in developing the administration's \nresponse to 9/11 and a new framework for United States policy in the \nMiddle East.\n  Most important, Condoleezza Rice has the trust and confidence of the \nPresident. She has served the President as a loyal and trusted advisor. \nWhen she speaks to foreign leaders as Secretary of State, they will \nknow that Dr. Rice is speaking on behalf of the President.\n  I have had the honor of working closely with Dr. Rice on many \noccasions over the past 4 years. In particular, Dr. Rice's support was \nextremely helpful to me and to my colleague Senator Lieberman as we \nundertook the Herculean task of reforming our intelligence community in \nthe last Congress. Dr. Rice helped us overcome the obstacles we faced \nto ensure the bill became law, and for that, she has my gratitude.\n  Having a strong foreign policy vision is critical to success in the \nwar on terrorism. Condoleezza Rice is the right person for the job. Dr. \nRice will make an outstanding Secretary of State, and I look forward to \nworking with her in the coming years.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I will be casting my vote in support of the \nnomination of Dr. Condoleezza Rice as our next Secretary of State. Dr. \nRice currently serves as President Bush's National Security Advisor. In \nthat position, she has earned the trust and the confidence of the \nPresident. Her stellar credentials and her remarkable success story, \ndespite the barriers of segregation in Birmingham, AL, are an \ninspiration.\n  Dr. Rice will assume the job of our Nation's top diplomat not only \nduring a time of war but also during a time in which the United States \nfaces countless other challenges. In short, Dr. Rice will have her work \ncut out for her. As she noted in her opening statement to the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, ``We must use American diplomacy to help \ncreate a balance of power in the world that favors freedom. And the \ntime for diplomacy is now.'' Indeed. The extent to which we have \nalienated our allies and aroused suspicion about our policies is \nbreathtaking in contrast to the tremendous support and sympathy we \nexperienced in the aftermath of 9/11. Even as we pour hundreds of \nbillions of dollars into our efforts in the Middle East, there is much \nthat needs to be done to win the war of ideas in the Muslim world and \nbeyond.\n  There are many lofty ideals which the President extolled in his \ninaugural\n\n[[Page S526]]\n\naddress--democracy and freedom, liberty for all--these are ideals we \nall share. Our Secretary of State must recognize, however, that ideals \nare meaningless if they do not inform the specifics of our policies. \nWhere we must work to find common ground is in how to realize these \nideals. I look forward to working with the next Secretary of State as \nwe craft the State Department's budget and as we strive for a foreign \npolicy we can all embrace.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today on the nomination of Dr. \nCondoleezza Rice to serve as Secretary of State.\n  I have three criteria I use to evaluate all executive branch \nnominees: competence, integrity and commitment to the core mission of \nthe Department. On the basis of those criteria, I will vote to confirm \nDr. Rice.\n  Yet I do have concerns. This vote is not an endorsement of President \nBush's foreign and defense policy as we saw it during Dr. Rice's tenure \nas National Security Advisor.\n  I have serious concerns with the way we went to war with Iraq: With \nthe overblown assertions of the threat to the United States; with the \ndeeply flawed intelligence analysis from a few biased sources presented \nas facts; with the failure to build a strong international coalition; \nwith the failure to prepare and send sufficient forces to deal with the \naftermath of removing Saddam from power; and with the failure to \nprepare by providing our own troops the protective equipment they \nneeded to carry out their missions and come home safe.\n  I know a lot of the responsibility for those failures rests with the \nSecretary of Defense.\n  I hope that Dr. Rice's service as Secretary of State will be historic \nnot only because she will be the first African American woman to hold \nthat office. I hope that Dr. Rice will make history by exercising true \nleadership at the State Department: Rebuilding our tattered \ninternational relationships and alliances; seeking to achieve lasting \npeace in the Middle East and other conflicts; mobilizing the world to \nmeet humanitarian and development needs; and serving as an effective \nCEO of the State Department to ensure that our dedicated public \nservants have safe embassies and the resources they need to effectively \nformulate policy and represent the United States around the world.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today is a very sad day when we hear \nthat we lost somewhere around 37 or 38 of our finest in the Marine \nCorps with the crash of a helicopter and additional deaths from the \nground fight.\n  Like everyone here, this information is very painful to me. I have \nhad the experience, as most of my colleagues have, to visit with \nfamilies as their sons and daughters are buried as a result of their \nexposure in Afghanistan and Iraq in the military.\n  Most recently, about 2 weeks ago, I went to a funeral in New Jersey \nfor a 19-year-old marine corporal. I sat with the family who was very \nproud of their son's contribution to his country. Twin brothers, young \nmen were making comments at the funeral, participating in the eulogy, \nand the parents, grief stricken about the loss of this wonderful, \napparently, young man. I did not know him, but the history of his short \nyears was resplendent with good accomplishments in school.\n  I mention that because it sets the tone for my feelings about how we \nportray this war to the American public.\n  I am a veteran of a war a long time ago. As a matter of fact, I think \nI am one of three remaining here from World War II. The experiences \nare, though such a long time ago, still vivid in my mind. I remember \nthe enthusiasm of my friends in high school--I was 18 when I enlisted \nin the Army--and those in the community and how spirited the support \nwas for everything we did.\n  I do not see any failing of support for our troops in the theater. We \nare ready to do whatever we have to to make sure they have the materiel \nthey need. On a visit I made in March of this past year with four other \nSenators, it was distressful to learn, as we visited with the young \npeople who were doing the fighting there, that they did not have \neverything they needed. I talked with a small group from New Jersey--\neight enlisted personnel and one young captain. I asked if there was \nanything they needed to conduct their service that would help them.\n  They were reluctant to complain, but finally this young captain stood \nup and said: Senator, the flack vest you are wearing is the best that \nmoney can buy. I see these vests on some members of the coalition, but \nwe don't have them, Senator, and I would like to ask why.\n  He said further: When one of our humvees is hit with a rocket grenade \nor other weapon, very often they will go up in flames, like a \nfirecracker.\n  He talked about a rifle that was issued to some of the other troops \nand how much more reliable it was, how much lighter it was, how much \neasier it was to carry.\n  I was very upset at hearing that news because the last thing that any \nof our soldiers should have to do is worry about whether they have the \nbest equipment or whether their lives are going to be protected.\n  I went to visit at Walter Reed Hospital and saw a fellow who was \nbanged up a little bit. His companion friend with whom he had been \ninjured in Iraq said: You know, if we had not had the new vests, my \nfriend here would have been dead. But he had one of those new vests, \nand it really helped. He is alive and recovering.\n  When I saw that families, in many instances, sent gifts of an article \nor funds to buy a vest that would protect their loved ones, privately \nraised money to send a vest for a soldier that we sent over there to \nfight for our views, and we can't provide the equipment? That set a \ntone for me, and I must say that many questions arose in my mind as to \nwhether the information we were getting was credible information about \nall of these commitments that were being talked about from the \nadministration about how we were going to do everything we could to \nprotect our troops. It was not true. No, it was not true.\n  We did not have enough soldiers over there to do the job starting \nearly in this campaign. We have been reminded on this floor a dozen \ntimes that General Shinseki, Chief of the Army, said we needed 300,000 \ntroops to do this job. And, instead, we skinnied it on down and sent \n130,000. They could not protect themselves. The cost was a horrible \ncost. Lots of young ones died. And now over 1,400 have died as a result \nof the effort in Iraq and Afghanistan, over 40 people from the State of \nNew Jersey. I care about those. I am sure all of our colleagues care \nabout the casualties that we have suffered in this war. One cannot be \nindifferent to a reminder that we are deep in the mud and we do not \nknow when our troops are coming home and we do not know how many more \nwe are going to lose before this endeavor is over.\n\n  So for me, the question centers around the information supply that we \nhad: How did we make so many mistakes about weapons of mass \ndestruction? How did we make so many mistakes about how we were going \nto be treated when we got there? How did we make so many mistakes when \nit was said we would be there for a short stay, that we would turn this \njob over to the Iraqis and they would take care of it and we would get \nout of there in time?\n  It was not true. No, it was not true. Unfortunately, when Dr. \nCondoleezza Rice's credentials were presented it was quite a review, \nquite a hearing, in the committee of jurisdiction. When they tried to \nfind out more about how she would be acting as the Secretary of State, \nthe Foreign Relations Committee did their job very well.\n  I do not question her extensive and impressive experience in academia \nand foreign policy. What I question today is her judgment and her \nability to be candid with the American people and the Congress about \ncritical information. No, those are not the things we question. What we \nquestion is the attention being given to detail. What we question is \nthe attention being given to the commentary that arose in that \ncommittee.\n  During her confirmation, she had many opportunities to reflect on \nearly decisions that were made in statements on Iraq in her position as \nNational Security Adviser to the President, but when Dr. Rice was \nconfronted with her misstatements and inaccuracies she refused to \nacknowledge any errors or take responsibility. I found that very \ndisappointing.\n  During her hearing, Dr. Rice was given a chance to correct the record \nabout what she said about Iraq being a\n\n[[Page S527]]\n\nnuclear threat to the United States. Prior to the war, Dr. Rice stated \nthat the smoking gun in Iraq could come in the form of a mushroom \ncloud. What an assertion that is, a mushroom cloud. That means a \nnuclear bomb. It means perhaps millions being killed. There was this \nspecter of that kind of damage, that kind of catastrophe, because there \nwere weapons of mass destruction in play there that were available to \nSaddam Hussein, but we know the evidence to that effect was not there.\n  In January 2004, the U.S. chief weapons inspector David Kay announced \nhis group found no evidence that Iraq had stockpiled any weapons of \nmass destruction before our invasion. In October 2004, less than 6 \nmonths ago, the Duelfer report was released and contradicted the \nadministration's prewar contention that Iraq had a strong WMD, weapons \nof mass destruction, program. The Duelfer report's conclusions are so \ndefinitive they compelled the administration to announce earlier this \nmonth that the search for WMD had officially ended.\n  Despite all of that information, Dr. Rice refused to admit at her \nhearing that she made serious mistakes in continuously overstating \nIraq's nuclear capabilities. At her hearing, Dr. Rice was also given \nthe chance to speak honestly about the current size of Iraq's security \nforces. She said that 120,000 Iraqis have been trained so far, but a \nmuch more accurate on-the-ground assessment reveals that only 4,000 \nhave been trained. Imagine, on the one hand Dr. Rice said 120,000 \nIraqis have been trained and we are trying to get out of there and what \nwe need is a force that is able and large enough and trained well \nenough so we can bring our kids home, reunite our families.\n\n  Four thousand have been trained. We are so far away from having that \nforce ready to take over that no one can tell what the timeframe might \nbe.\n  When I was in Iraq, I went to a training facility for police \nofficers. About every 6 weeks they graduated 80 officers, and we needed \n53,000. So that meant, using the 6-week factor and calculating that by \n10, we might be training 800 of these police officers a year, and we \nneed 53,000. Yet we cannot now even find the truth out about what it is \nthat is required.\n  Dr. Rice also could not explain or at least she would not explain to \nthe committee what our exit strategy is or should be for Iraq. Here she \nsimply chose not to answer the question at all. With more than 1,400 of \nour brave young men and women in uniform killed, including 48 with ties \nto my home State of New Jersey, I believe we deserved an answer. \nInstead, Dr. Rice chose silence.\n  When it comes to Iraq, unfortunately this administration has lost its \ncredibility with the American people and with the global community, and \nit is the job of the Secretary of State to restore our credibility \nabroad, especially with our allies. In my view, promoting Dr. Rice to \nthe position of Secretary of State puts a stamp of approval on the \nadministration's policies and actions, and I cannot, in good faith, go \nalong with that. Despite ample opportunity, Dr. Rice has shown no \ninclination to be more forthright about any of the mistakes she and \nthis administration made and continue to make in Iraq or indicate that \nany change in course might be necessary. I find that very troubling.\n  Therefore, I feel compelled to vote against her confirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides at this \nstage?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has 14 minutes \nremaining, and the Senator from Delaware has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. LUGAR. There is 14 minutes and 1 minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, my understanding is the majority leader is \nen route to the floor. He had responsibilities in the House of \nRepresentatives for a period of time. The distinguished Democratic \nleader is on the floor. It is his desire to wait until the majority \nleader is present, and both, as I understand, will make final comments, \nif necessary using leader time. Therefore, Mr. President, I will speak \nat this point, utilizing the time allotted to our side with a final \nargument.\n  Mr. President, I appreciated, as did the Senator from New Mexico, the \ncomments of our distinguished colleague from Connecticut, Senator \nLieberman, when he discussed really the long debate we have had with \nregard to the conduct of the war in Iraq, of the conduct of the war \nagainst terrorism, which involves Iraq. Clearly, Senator Lieberman is \naccurate when he points out that essentially we have had many \ndisagreements about the prewar planning, the problems of the \ndislocation of all of the Iraqi security forces, the great dilemmas we \nhave had as we approach now the elections and the fledgling democracy \nwe hope Iraqis will be able to fashion as they formulate a constitution \nand elect the officials of their country.\n  The security situation remains extremely precarious for American \ntroops and those who are with us in Iraq attempting to help Iraqis \nprovide security for their villages and for their countryside. There \nare clearly differences of opinion as to how well all of these \nactivities have been conducted, but I think, in recognition of how very \ndifficult it has been for decisionmakers, a general consensus is that \nthe batting average has been good, even if not perfect. But Senator \nLieberman made the point that now, at this particular moment, as we \nvote today to confirm a Secretary of State, we are a united group in \nthis Senate on the need for success in Iraq.\n  There should be no doubt on the part of all who are about to cast \ntheir ballots in Iraq and take the chances that are posed when they are \nthreatened really with loss of life for their willingness to exercise a \nfranchise, it should be clear we are united back here.\n  This is not a fractious group, I hope, today that gives any \nsustenance of hope to the insurgents, to those who are attempting to \nformulate disaster in the Middle East that the face of America is not a \nunited face.\n  I make this point because the person we are about to confirm as \nSecretary of State will be, aside from the President of the United \nStates, the most prominent spokesperson, the most prominent diplomat \nmaking the case for the United States of America and for each of us on \nthis Senate floor as proud Americans. And it is very important, now \nthat we have had a full discussion of arguments on deficiencies, things \nwe must do better, institutions we must improve, simply to note how \nimportant it is to the world to have confidence we know what we are \ndoing and that we are prepared at least to continually discuss this in \nthe same candid way we have done, but then to come together and say \nthis is our President, this is our Secretary of State, this is our \npolicy.\n\n  I am very hopeful that the vote for Dr. Rice will be a very strong \nvote. I do not depreciate for a moment the right or desire of those who \nmay have a heartfelt need to say no. That is a great privilege we all \nexercise. But a lot is at stake today in saying yes, and saying yes \ntogether in as large a number as we can muster when the roll is called \nis important because this is a person who will be Secretary of State, \nand this is a vote that will be memorable. It is not in any way a \ntrivial pursuit or time of fractious odds or a time to be spoilers. \nThis is for our country at a time to be the very best we can be as \nSenators.\n  I have reiterated the record of our hearings and I have appreciated \nvery much the cooperation and, beyond that, the friendship of the \ndistinguished ranking member, Senator Biden, because the both of us \nhave shared from time to time with witnesses who have come before our \ncommittee considerable anxieties about the policies they were pursuing \nor some they were not pursuing, or questions we were raising we felt \nthey perhaps had not been raising and that they should. By my best \ncount, in the last 2 years, we have had 23 hearings on Iraq. That is a \nlot of quality time devoted by good administration witnesses and other \nexperts, as well as by Senators, as I mentioned, in the long hearings \nwe had with Dr. Rice, and in the almost 200 questions raised before the \nhearing and another 200 during the hearing. This is a lot of \nquestioning, a lot of information, a big record. So we took this \nseriously, all 18 of us, plus Senator Feinstein of California, who \nintroduced Dr. Rice to the committee\n\n[[Page S528]]\n\nto begin with. Senators have taken it very seriously on the floor.\n  In my opening comments, I mentioned that at least 22 Senators spoke \nyesterday and many spoke at length, with very sincere tributes to Dr. \nRice. Some of the Senators had very sincere questions about where we \nare going and what we ought to be doing. But those preliminaries are \nover. We come now to the moment of decision, and I hope and pray that \nthe vote will be a strong one for a candidate who in fact can be a \nchampion for us. Her entire life story, which has been touched upon, \nbut only barely--and perhaps this is a tribute to our next Secretary of \nState, that we did not dwell on biography, although it is a dramatic \none out of Birmingham, AL. We did not dwell on racial background or on \nthe fact that a lady is going to be Secretary of State. We did not get \ninto many of the divisive arguments we often have as to where somebody \ncomes from and what their background is.\n  Dr. Rice was taken seriously from the beginning of the hearings and \nthroughout this debate as a world statesperson who knows a great deal, \nwho is extraordinarily intelligent and dedicated to this country and \nextraordinarily courageous in speaking out as she has.\n  I add all this simply to say that I am hopeful Senators will vote for \nDr. Rice when we vote soon.\n\n  I will yield the floor in the hopes that our leader and the \ndistinguished minority leader will have an opportunity to make comments \nbefore the Chair calls for the roll.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute of leader time to the \nSenator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I don't speak for those who are going to \nvote no today. But I think the irony here is that their no vote is a \ndemonstration of how clearly we are united on one point: We want to win \nin Iraq.\n  The reason they are voting no is they believe Dr. Rice has misled, in \nmany ways, and as a consequence undermined our ability to succeed. I \nchoose to believe and take the opposite view. But I want to make it \nclear that those who say no today are actually doing a service to the \nSenate and possibly making it less likely that the Secretary of State \nwill be less candid with us, or not as candid as she has been in the \npast. I think the no votes are likely to encourage candor, because that \nis what it is about. They are voting no in large part because they \nthink she has not been candid and has undermined our ability to \nsucceed.\n  I look forward to working with Dr. Rice. I suspect there will be an \noverwhelming vote. Please don't read a no vote as not being united in \nthe effort to win in Iraq. That is why some of my colleagues are voting \nno; they think she has undermined our ability to win in Iraq. I choose \nto differ with them, but we do not differ on the point that we need to \nsucceed in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, is all time used or yielded back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has 5\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the Chair has noted we have 5 minutes. We \nare hopeful of seeing our leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, he is here. He is waiting for my remarks to \nconclude.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I will yield back our time and then the leaders may \nproceed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Lugar and Senator Biden set a great \nexample for the rest of the Senate in the way they handled this most \nimportant issue before this body and the way they handled that \ncommittee in general. I admire and respect both of them.\n  But I do say to the distinguished Senator from Indiana, I listened \nclosely yesterday to the remarks and I read some of them today. The \nremarks yesterday were troubling to me because most all of the remarks \nyesterday criticized us--that is, the minority--for having this debate, \nsaying why didn't we complete the debate last Thursday when the \nPresident was inaugurated.\n  The philosopher Voltaire once said, ``I may disagree with what you \nhave to say, but I shall defend, to the death, your right to say it.'' \nEvery American who goes to school has seen that quote because it \nreflects our most deeply cherished values and beliefs. Americans \nbelieve in freedom of expression. We believe in democracy. We believe \nin debate. That is why I have been disappointed that the administration \nand most of the Republicans in this body have attempted to stifle \ndebate on the nomination of Condoleezza Rice to be Secretary of State. \nThis job, this Cabinet office, is the most powerful and important \nposition in this or any administration. In my years in the Senate, I \nhave studied our rules and procedures, and I have studied them closely. \nI have come to know them pretty well.\n\n  In my years on this Earth, I have studied the qualities and values \nthat I believe will help us become better people. One of those is \nfairness--basic fairness. I have tried to uphold that value the best I \ncan. So between my knowledge of the Senate rules and my belief in the \nimportance of fairness, I know that we should be debating this \nnomination. It is our job in the Senate to debate matters of importance \nto the American people.\n  We are a deliberative body. We are the Senate of the United States. \nOur Founding Fathers meant for us to carefully consider the matters \nbrought before us and make sure that our Government does not act \nirrationally and without a plan and a vision for this country's future. \nIt is a matter of fairness that those who have concerns about Dr. Rice \nbe allowed to express them. Silence is not an important part of \nAmerican history, but debate is. ``Shut up and vote'' is not democracy. \nIt is especially important that we hold debate on Dr. Rice's nomination \nbecause of the importance of the job for which she is being considered.\n  Our Secretary of State will be handling our foreign policy at a time \nwhen we are at war and when our friendships and traditional allies have \nbeen strained. In Iraq and Afghanistan and around the world, Americans \nface enormous threats and challenges every day. About 1,400 Americans \nhave died so far in Iraq, and more than 10,000 have been wounded, many \ngrievously wounded. Today, 31 Marines died in 1 incident in Iraq. An \nestimated 40 troops have died in the last 2 days.\n  The American people have questions and should have questions, and \nhave concerns and should have concerns, about our plan in Iraq. Those \nquestions deserve answers and those concerns deserve to be addressed. \nThat is what the Senate should be doing. That is what we are all \nabout--asking questions on behalf of the American people. Instead, \npeople such as the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from \nCalifornia have been criticized for not rubberstamping this nomination. \nI don't think that is appropriate.\n  Nothing will matter more to the safety and security of our country \nthan our foreign policy decisions over the next few years. If any \nnominee deserves scrutiny and rigorous debate, it is the nominee for \nSecretary of State, Condoleezza Rice.\n  Democrats have had 4 hours of debate on Condoleezza Rice--4 hours of \ndebate on the most important Cabinet nomination the President, or any \nPresident, can have. Can anyone say that 4 hours of debate dealing with \nCondoleezza Rice for Secretary of State of the United States is too \nmuch? The American people all take longer to buy a car than what we \nhave debated on this nomination. If you want to buy a TV set, you look \naround Circuit City and other places, and it takes 4 hours. Shouldn't \nwe be able to spend 4 hours on a decision of this magnitude? I think \nso.\n  Republicans say a 4-hour debate has been a burden to the country and \nhas been unreasonable. On the contrary, it is exactly what the Founding \nFathers contemplated with the advise and consent clause of our \nConstitution. Debate--vigorous debate--is an American principle of \ndemocracy, a principle that is in our national interest, our national \nsecurity interest and, of course, our foreign policy interests.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in 2 or 3 minutes, we will have a historic \nvote in the Senate Chamber. We are about to confirm Dr. Condoleezza \nRice, the first African-American woman to become\n\n[[Page S529]]\n\nSecretary of State. It is a proud moment for this Senate and indeed for \nthe American people. Dr. Rice has served her country with distinction \nand she has served her country with honor. She has been a steady and a \ntrusted confidant to two Presidents, and as Secretary of State she will \napply her long experience and extraordinary skill to meet the greatest \nchallenges of our time--fighting the war on terror and advancing \ndemocracy around the globe.\n  Dr. Rice possesses this rare combination of management and \nadministrative experience, policy expertise, academic scholarship and, \nnot least important, personal integrity and character. Yes, I am \ndisappointed that Dr. Rice's nomination was caught up in partisan \npolitics. While I recognize my colleagues' right to debate the \nPresident's nominees, Dr. Rice's obvious qualifications have never, \never been in doubt. Nor was it ever in doubt that a large bipartisan \nmajority would vote to confirm her, which we will see in a few moments. \nPartisanship has its time and place, but we are at this point in time a \nnation at war. We need the strength of all of our resources to fight \nand win. I am disappointed that others on the other side of the aisle \nhave taken this moment to wage a partisan campaign. But it is time for \nall of us to move on, and we indeed will move forward with this vote.\n  I look forward to working with Dr. Rice to meet those challenges \nahead and I congratulate her on a historic achievement.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Condoleezza Rice, of California, to be \nSecretary of State?\n  On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered and the clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent. The \nSenator from Montana (Mr. Burns) and the Senator from New Hampshire \n(Mr. Gregg).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Montana (Mr. Burns) \nwould have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwishing to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas, 85, nays, 13, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 2 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--85\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--13\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Dayton\n     Durbin\n     Harkin\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Reed\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Burns\n     Gregg\n       \n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. FRIST.

It is a proud moment for the Senate \nand for the American people.\n  For the information of our colleagues, under our previous agreement \nwe will proceed with Secretary-designate Nicholson. We have a short \ntime agreement. Then we will have a voice vote, followed by Secretary-\ndesignate Leavitt. Then, shortly after that, I am hopeful we can \nproceed with Secretary-designate Bodman.\n  There have been no requests for rollcall votes on any of those three. \nIf that is the case, we would not expect to have rollcall votes later \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Under the previous order, the \nPresident will be notified that the nominee has been confirmed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/26/senate-section/article/S529-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S529-S532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      NOMINATION JIM NICHOLSON TO BE SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of Executive Calendar No. 5, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Jim Nicholson, of \nColorado, to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes equally divided between the Senator from Idaho and the Senator \nfrom Colorado.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I have been joined by my colleague, \nSenator Akaka, the ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, to comment briefly on the President's nomination of Ambassador \nJim Nicholson to serve as Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n  Mr. Nicholson is a man of considerable character and accomplishment. \nI am pleased to speak in support of his nomination to serve in this \ncritical post. I am pleased the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, \na committee of which I am the newly elected chairman, approved this \nnomination Monday at the committee's initial meeting of the 109th \nCongress.\n  The President has asked Jim Nicholson to accept one of the more \ndifficult jobs in Washington; that is, running the Department of \nVeterans Affairs. In the best of times this is a tough assignment. In \ntimes like the ones we are now entering, times within which the rate of \nthe growth of the VA's budget will likely slow, but also within which \nthe needs of the service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, \nmust and will be met, is a tougher assignment, still. I am highly \nconfident, however, that the President has found the right person for \nthis job.\n\n  Let me summarize Jim Nicholson's background. He was born in 1938 to \nmodest circumstances on a farm in Iowa. He left that farm in 1957 to \nattend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. After graduation in \n1961, he served for 8 years in active service in the Army. He was a \nranger and a paratrooper and served a tour in Vietnam from 1965 through \n1966 where he earned, among other declarations, the Bronze Star, the \nCombat Infantryman's badge, the Air Medal, and the Vietnamese Cross of \nGallantry.\n  After returning from Vietnam in 1966, then-Captain Nicholson \ncontinued to serve on Active Duty for more than 4 years, followed by an \nadditional 22 years as a Reserve officer. He retired from the Army \nReserve in 1991 at the rank of colonel.\n  While in Active and Reserve service, Mr. Nicholson obtained two \nadvanced degrees, a BA in public policy from Columbia University and a \nJD from the University of Denver. After practicing law for a relatively \nbrief period in Denver in the 1970s, he launched a very successful real \nestate development career. Among other positions, he served as chairman \nand president of Renaissance Homes of Colorado. His business career was \nalso marked with extensive community and charitable activity.\n  In 1986, Jim Nicholson became a committeeman for the Republican \nParty's national committee. In 1993, he was elected the Republican \nNational Committee's vice chairman, and then he was elected for a 4-\nyear term as chairman of the Republican National Committee. It was \nduring these years at the helm of the RNC, I grew to know and admire \nJim Nicholson. His accomplishments since that time have only increased \nmy respect for the man.\n  In August of 2001, President Bush appointed Mr. Nicholson U.S. \nAmbassador to the Holy See, the Vatican. From that post he has \nadvocated for religious reconciliation, for religious freedom in China \nand Russia, and against the international exploitation and enslavement \nof defenseless persons, commonly referred to as human trafficking.\n\n[[Page S530]]\n\n  He has, as well, ably represented the interests of this Nation to \nthis vital diplomatic post in a period of wartime. He has done so by \nall accounts with great diplomatic skill and steadfastness of the \npurpose that he was sent to serve.\n  Veterans are fortunate a man so well-known and respected by the \nPresident of the United States will serve as Secretary. I am pleased \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs, in its first official business \nmeeting of the 109th Congress on Monday, unanimously approved this \nnomination.\n  I ask my colleagues to ratify the judgment they were expressing. VA \nneeds a steadfast hand in Jim Nicholson. I hope all of my colleagues \nwill feel similar to those on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  This is not to suggest that VA has lacked a steady hand at the \ntiller. To the contrary. The stewardship as VA Secretary of former \nNaval Officer Anthony, or as we came to know him, Tony Principi, has \nbeen by any standard one of exceptional merit and distinction. It is a \nrare Secretary, indeed, who departs from this sensitive post with the \nwords, I believe, that can be expressed about his service as ``job well \ndone.'' Veteran service organizations, leaders from the hill, and other \nbodies all critically concerned about veterans affairs recognize that \nTony Principi managed his job extremely well, and he has managed it \nwhile leading VA with impeccable integrity, absolute fairness and \nobjectivity, and unflagging willingness to listen to all affected \nconstituents and an extraordinary sensitivity to the needs and concerns \nof ordinary rank-and-file veterans.\n  When the history of the VA is written, Tony Principi will be judged \nas one of the agencies titans. More importantly, he will also be judged \nby the ordinary former enlisted men and women whose needs he never lost \nsight of. On behalf of those persons, I salute the now retiring \nSecretary, Tony Principi.\n  I say to my colleagues, I believe Jim Nicholson to be a titan in the \nmaking. He has all of the qualities that our President recognized, that \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs recognized, as one who can \nadequately and most appropriately serve this very important agency of \nour Government and its millions of constituents. I ask the Senate to \nsupport the efforts of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs in bringing \nthis nomination to the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and recognize my colleague and ranking member of \nthe committee, Senator Dan Akaka.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I rise as a ranking member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs. I do it with great expectation and look \nforward to working with my friend, Chairman Craig from Idaho. I look \nforward to working with the committee. We held our first meeting \nyesterday, and I would say that it was a great meeting and a good \nbeginning for the committee.\n\n  I am also pleased to support the nomination of James Nicholson to be \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs. If confirmed, Ambassador Nicholson will \nhave the responsibility of steering the Department of Veterans Affairs \nthrough a period of great transformation.\n  I recently had a chance to meet with Ambassador Nicholson and to \ndiscuss the many challenges he will face in guiding VA through this \ncritical period. I have also had the opportunity to read his answers to \nprehearing questions that I submitted to him and also to hear his \ntestimony at the January 24, 2005, hearing of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs on his nomination. I believe Ambassador Nicholson has \nthe commitment and has the drive and fortitude to maintain America's \nspecial obligation to our veterans.\n  I know with his years of service to this Nation at West Point, in \nVietnam, and as Ambassador to the Holy See, Ambassador Nicholson is \nfamiliar with the importance of the leadership role he will soon assume \nat VA. We expect him to hit the ground running to tackle VA's many \nchallenges. And, of course, we will be there to work with him.\n  It is widely known that on the health care side, VA is facing a \ncrisis situation. In recent years, millions of veterans have come to VA \nfor the first time. As I said yesterday to my colleagues, I think it is \ngood news that millions have turned to VA for care. Some, however, \nbelieve we can deal with the burgeoning demand by reducing who is \neligible for care. For me, however, this is not the answer. I hope \nAmbassador Nicholson will see the merits of keeping a full and open \nsystem.\n  In addition to providing basic primary care, the VA system offers \nprograms of enormous value, especially for veterans who are blind or \nhave spinal cord injuries, who need prosthetic devices, or who require \ndependable mental health care. We must retain these specialized \nservices and, at the same time, ensure that all veterans can have \naccess to the care they have earned through their service.\n  The VA research program will need some attention as well, as many of \nour finest physicians chose to come to VA so they can conduct research. \nKeeping the research program viable is tremendously important. \nAmbassador Nicholson has his work cut out for him in this regard.\n  In the past, the Veterans Benefits Administration has come under fire \nfor the lack of timeliness of its claims processing. While VBA has made \nprogress in improving timeliness and accuracy of disability claims \nprocessing, further improvement is needed. Notably, VBA has turned its \nattention to decreasing the amount of time it takes to process a claim \nand taken its focus off appeals. A more balanced approach must be \nreached.\n  We will be looking to Ambassador Nicholson for innovative approaches \nso that VBA can absorb changes in law and new business processes \nwithout always going into a nose dive. Our veterans deserve no less \nthan quality workmanship done in a timely manner.\n  Ambassador Nicholson's nomination process has been fairly expedited \nbecause VA's pressing needs require a new Secretary immediately. \nHowever, my committee will continue its strong oversight of the \nDepartment, and I encourage other Members to work with us in this \nendeavor.\n  Madam President, in my view, Mr. Nicholson is ready for the \nchallenges of this important position. He will bring to it his many \nexperiences as someone who himself served as well as his sincere \ncommitment to the well-being of his fellow veterans. I ask my \ncolleagues to approve this nomination.\n\n  Madam President, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, let me say forthrightly that we have the \nAmbassador's nomination on the floor today because of the cooperation \nof the ranking member, and I greatly appreciate that. Both he and I \nhave reviewed what we believe is the mission of the committee. We are \nvery excited about the work we will do in the coming years to help our \nveterans and work on their behalf through this important committee. I \nthank him for his cooperation.\n  Madam President, I yield to our colleague from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, first of all, I thank the chairman and \nranking member for moving forward with the confirmation of Jim \nNicholson to be the new Secretary for the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. I congratulate them both on assuming their responsibilities as \nchairman and ranking member on the Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  Madam President, I rise today in strong support of President Bush's \nnominee for Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Mr. Jim Nicholson. I have \nknown and worked with Jim for years in the State of Colorado, and I am \nproud President Bush has nominated him for this post.\n  As a West Point graduate, Army ranger, highly decorated combat \nveteran, and almost 4 years of service as the Ambassador to the Holy \nSee, Mr. Nicholson is well prepared and highly qualified for the duties \nas the head of the VA. He brings a strong work ethic to his new \nresponsibilities.\n  Born during the Great Depression, as the third child of seven, Jim \nNicholson grew up on a tenant farm in rural Iowa. Both he and his older \nbrother Jack earned appointments to West Point while struggling as a \nfarming family in the Midwest.\n  Prior to Jim's appointment, his brother returned home from school for\n\n[[Page S531]]\n\nthe summer, and his family could not find enough money to send Jim back \nto New York for the start of his new term. In order to solve this \nproblem, a 15-year-old Jim Nicholson took it upon himself to find a job \nbuilding railroads through his home State of Iowa. By working as long \nas 19 hours some days, Jim was able to not only earn enough money to \nsend his brother back to West Point, but also was eventually able to \nbuy his father a used car so he could look for work.\n  These virtues that Jim displayed as a youth--work ethic, self-\nsacrifice, and determination--are the very qualities which will allow \nhim to excel in the President's Cabinet.\n  As a West Point graduate and decorated veteran, this former Army \nranger also has the personal experience in the Armed Forces that will \nserve his new constituency well. During his service in the Army, Mr. \nNicholson fought in the Vietnam war and was a highly decorated soldier. \nHe was awarded the Bronze Star, the Combat Infantry Badge, a \nMeritorious Service Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Vietnamese Cross \nfor Gallantry, and two Air Medals while spending 8 years on Active Duty \nand 22 years in the Army Reserve before retiring as a colonel.\n  Clearly, Senator Nicholson's qualifications after his Army career are \njust as impressive, including his advanced degrees, starting a \nsuccessful real estate business, numerous community volunteer efforts \nthroughout Colorado, and finally culminating in his service as an \nAmbassador to the Holy See. This is a man who has been asked to serve \nhis country in a new capacity and who will answer that call with his \nown sense of duty and honor.\n  I urge my colleagues to confirm Jim Nicholson as our next Secretary \nof Veterans Affairs.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today we consider President Bush's nominee \nto serve as Secretary of Veterans Affairs. At a time when America's men \nand women in uniform are not only serving but actively fighting in \ncombat, this is a particularly significant nomination for us to \nconsider. This nominee will be responsible for managing the benefits \nfor our longtime veterans as well as those who recently have served and \nsacrificed for us all.\n  Those who have served in uniform deserve our Nation's deepest \ngratitude. Beyond gratitude, we, as a nation, have committed to \nproviding our veterans with certain benefits and services which they \ndeeply deserve in honor of their sacrifice for our common good. These \nbenefits can never fully repay America's debt to her veterans but they \nare an important expression of our thanks and commitment to their well-\nbeing.\n  Sadly, the delivery of these benefits and services has been less than \noptimal. Every day, deserving veterans wait too long and wade through \nneedless redtape before receiving the help to which they are legally \nand morally entitled.\n  I am also particularly concerned about the vast disparities in the \nVA's compensation payments to disabled veterans and the way the current \nsystem shortchanges disabled veterans in my State of Illinois.\n  Illinois now ranks 50th in the Nation in average veteran's disability \ncompensation. While the veterans in some States receive a statewide \naverage disability payment of $10,000 to $11,000 per year, veterans in \nother States--including Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Virginia, New Jersey \nand others--receive statewide average disability payments of less than \n$7,000 a year. This wide inconsistency should not exist. America's \nveterans deserve better. The ability of veterans to receive fair and \njust compensation for service-related disabilities should not depend on \nwhere they happen to live.\n  Unfortunately, this disparity has been left uncorrected for several \nyears. In 2001, the Department of Veterans Affairs' Claims Processing \nTask Force questioned the consistency of decisions because of factors \nsuch as differing interpretations of VA guidance. Then, in 2002 the \nGovernment Accountability Office reported that the VA was not \nsystematically assessing decisionmaking consistency for any specific \nmedical impairments, despite concerns about possible inconsistencies in \ndisability claims decisions made by the VA's 57 regional offices. In \nthat same 2002 report, GAO expressly recommended that the VA assess \ndecisionmaking consistency for medical conditions requiring difficult \njudgment. The GAO even suggested a way to do this. The VA could develop \nhypothetical claims for a specific medical impairment, distribute these \nclaims to multiple adjudicators, and then analyze the variations in the \nresulting decisions on these claims. These findings and recommendations \nwent unheeded at the Department of Veterans Affairs. This past \nNovember, a new GAO report on the consistency of decisions at the VA \nfound that since the issuance of the 2002 report, the VA still had not \nsystematically assessed the consistency of regional office decisions.\n  Several Senators have joined me in raising this issue with the \ncurrent Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Secretary Principi. As a result \nof our expressions of concern, the Inspector General of the Department \nof Veterans Affairs is currently conducting a review of the Veterans \nBenefits Administration's system for rating disability claims to \ndetermine the reasons for these nationwide differences.\n  Because the national disparity in veterans disability compensation \nhits Illinois especially hard, Senator Obama and I met with Ambassador \nNicholson soon after his nomination to serve as the next Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs. In our meeting, he indicated to us that he was \nalready aware of the concerns raised about inconsistent decisions at \nthe VA and the ongoing Inspector General review into the matter.\n  America's veterans deserve our deepest gratitude. They also deserve a \nbenefits system that is managed in a competent manner so that it \nproduces fair, even and consistent decisions. I will continue to press \nfor action to address the flaws of the current system that leave \nIllinois veterans shortchanged. I look forward to working with Mr. \nNicholson to ensure that our veterans receive all the benefits to which \nthey are entitled.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise in strong support of the \nnomination of R. James Nicholson to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n  At the outset, I would like to thank Mr. Nicholson's predecessor, \nAnthony Principi, for his service to our Nation's veterans. John \nFurgess, the National Commander for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said \nit best when he described Mr. Principi's service to our country. He \nsaid that Secretary Principi:\n\n     is a true veterans' advocate . . . [who] constantly \n     challenged his staff to improve their services to America's \n     25 million veterans, and his work to address the needs and \n     concerns of today's newest generation of veterans who are \n     fighting the War on Terrorism typifies his vision and \n     leadership. Secretary Principi wore his compassion and \n     commitment to veterans on his sleeve . . . We applaud him for \n     his service to our country and wish him and his family the \n     best of futures. He will be missed but not forgotten.\n\n  Let me turn now to express my admiration and appreciation for the \nPresident's choice in nominating Ambassador Nicholson to lead our \nNation as it strives to support the veterans who have served so \ntirelessly on behalf of our country. I know Jim Nicholson to be an \nintelligent, articulate, and decent man. As a veteran of some \ndistinction himself, he has an excellent appreciation for the issues \nthe Department faces. And, as an accomplished executive, he is \nincredibly well-suited to lead this large and important agency. These \nare trying times for our Nation's veterans. As the Vietnam war era \nveterans begin to retire in greater numbers and our veterans from the \nwar on terrorism return, our Nation must reaffirm its commitment to \nthose who have placed everything on the line for the cause of freedom. \nI believe that Ambassador Nicholson is an excellent choice to lead our \nNation's effort to maintain the sacred covenants between the Nation and \nits veterans.\n  A man from humble beginnings, Ambassador Nicholson rose to graduate \nfrom West Point and become an Army Ranger who served his country during \nthe Vietnam war. During that conflict, he proved his courage in battle \nand earned the Bronze Star, the Meritorious Service Medal with Oak Leaf \nCluster, the Vietnamese Cross for Gallantry, two air medals, and, of \ncourse, the Combat Infantry Badge. His service to his country did not \nend there. He went on to serve for 22 years as an Army Reservist, \nretiring with the rank\n\n[[Page S532]]\n\nof colonel. Along the way he received a master's degree in public \npolicy from Columbia University and a law degree from the University of \nDenver. In Denver, he established a reputation as a highly qualified \nattorney specializing in real estate, municipal finance and zoning law \nbefore becoming a highly successful residential real estate developer.\n  However, his call to service did not end with his years of military \nservice, Ambassador Nicholson entered politics and was elected chairman \nof the Republican National Committee. His tenure secured him a \nreputation as a person of the highest ethics and his current position \nas Ambassador to the Holy See has been a success.\n  I feel quite confident that those same skills that made Ambassador \nNicholson a successful businessman and ambassador will ensure that our \nveterans receive the support and care they deserve while maximizing the \nefficiency of this Department.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I hope that I will be joined by my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle and quickly confirm Ambassador \nNicholson to this vital post.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nnomination of Jim Nicholson to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs. I \nbelieve Ambassador Nicholson's 30 years of military service make him an \nexcellent choice to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. Jim \nNicholson's leadership is particularly important as our brave men and \nwomen in uniform once again serve the cause of freedom in the fight \nagainst terrorism around the globe.\n  Jim Nicholson has served his Nation faithfully and ably for the \nmajority of his lifetime. I believe his great diversity of experience \nwill be of the utmost benefit to the Department of Veterans Affairs and \nour veterans. We as a nation have a commitment to our veterans. They \nand their families have made countless sacrifices to serve in our \ncountry's defense, and we have a duty to provide for their needs. Jim \nNicholson's leadership of the Department of Veterans Affairs will help \nus honor this obligation.\n  Jim Nicholson graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point \nin 1961, becoming an Army Ranger and a paratrooper. He went on to serve \nduring the Vietnam war. While in Vietnam, he earned the Bronze Star, \nthe Combat Infantry Badge, the Meritorious Service Medal, and the \nVietnamese Cross for Gallantry. After his 8 years of active service as \na Ranger, Jim served 22 years in the Army Reserve, retiring with the \nrank of full colonel.\n  Jim Nicholson has been an esteemed chairman of the Republican \nNational Committee and for the past 3 years he has served as the U.S. \nAmbassador to the Vatican. Jim holds a master's degree in public policy \nfrom Columbia University and a law degree from the University of \nDenver. On top of these vast achievements, he has been a successful \nbusinessman and community volunteer.\n  In conclusion, I believe the President has chosen the right person to \nlead the Department of Veterans Affairs in its very important work, and \nI strongly support the nomination of Jim Nicholson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, to my knowledge there is no one else who \nhas requested time to speak on behalf of this nominee. My colleague has \nyielded. I yield back the remainder of our time and ask for the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Jim Nicholson, of Colorado, to be \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/26/senate-section/article/S532-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S532-S533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF MICHAEL LEAVITT\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I understand we are going to soon be \nvoting on the nomination of Mike Leavitt to be the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services. I have the privilege of being one of Mike Leavitt's \nfriends, one of his political associates, and one of his strongest \nsupporters. I introduced him to the committee at the time of his \nconfirmation hearings. I don't want to add much to the comments I made \nthere, but I do want to take the occasion to note the Senate action \nwith respect to his confirmation and to assure my colleagues here in \nthe Senate, as well as any who might be listening, that the United \nStates is very fortunate to have a man of Mike Leavitt's stature \navailable to us to serve in this important Cabinet-level position.\n  He served as a Governor but as a Governor who was very innovative in \nmany of the areas where innovation will be called for in his new \nassignment. He served as a business executive, building a business, \ngrowing a business, helping a business to survive. He understands the \nimpact of extra taxes on small businesses, and he will be appropriately \nprudent, not only in the way he spends money but in the way he \npromulgates regulations that can impact small business.\n  He and his wife Jackie are beloved throughout Utah. He is one of only \ntwo men ever to be elected to three successive terms as Governor in the \nhistory of the State, and there are those who believe that if he had \ndecided to seek a fourth term, he would have received it without much \ndifficulty. He retired with a very high approval rating. He brings \nthat, plus the performance in his position as the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, to his new assignment.\n  On behalf of the people of Utah, I wish him well, and I urge my \nSenate colleagues to give him unanimous confirmation. He will be a \nsuperb Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I note that we are in a quorum call. As a \nmember of the Finance Committee, I am going to speak in favor of the \nLeavitt nomination to outline some of my concerns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in a quorum call.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I note that the chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee and the ranking minority member will be here shortly \nto speak on the Leavitt nomination. Until they get here, I thought I \nwould summarize my thoughts concerning this nomination.\n  I come to the Chamber to speak in favor of Mike Leavitt to head the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n  I want to begin my brief remarks by talking about the importance of \nbipartisanship in the health care field and to note that at the end of \nthe last session of the Congress, there was a bipartisan failure in the \nhealth care area, in my view, of enormous ramifications. At the end of \nthe last session of the Congress, the Congress failed to provide the \nfunding necessary for the office of Dr. David Brailer, who is, in \neffect, the national health care technology point man, to try to \nmodernize decision making, record keeping, telemedicine, and other \ncrucial matters in the health care field. His office, as a result of \nthis bipartisan failure by the Congress, was essentially defunded. So \nwhat you have is a situation where both political parties talk a big \ngame about health information technology, or IT. You hear senators of \nboth political parties saluting the promise of this exciting field and \ntalk about how committed they are, but the response of the Congress was \nto essentially defund it. So rhetoric has been in abundance; concrete \nsupport has been lacking.\n  I come to the Senate floor to say I very much hope--and Mike Leavitt \nhas a great interest in health information technology--that this \ndeficiency is corrected in this upcoming Congress because otherwise \nthere will be great consequences.\n\n[[Page S533]]\n\n  First, I am concerned that as we see the move towards electronic \nmedical records, these records and the placement of them is not being \ndone in a fashion that will promote interoperability so that they are \nbest in a position to be coordinated and maximize their value. They \nsimply are not interoperable. It is a very significant concern. If we \nare going to see this trend toward electronic medical records and not \ntake the steps to promote interoperability, that will be a very serious \ndeficiency as we set up the new system and will cause a great deal of \nconfusion.\n  Second, I am very concerned that in the information technology area, \nthe big and powerful figures, be they high-tech companies or medical \nclinics, will be able to do this work, but it is not going to be done \nby the small physician offices and clinics. Dr. Brailer's office was \nthe office that was in a position to give incentives to help those \nsmall offices go forward. That work is not being done.\n  Third, the very promising aspect of health technology has been in the \narea of regional offices, and now we are not seeing the funds that are \nnecessary for those regional offices as well.\n  The Congress essentially zeroed out the money that Dr. Brailer \nneeded. It was a modest amount, $50 million. My sense is to really \npromote health information technology, it is going to take much more \nsignificant sums, but to have this body on a bipartisan basis \nconstantly talking about the value of health information technology and \nthen taking the one program that would make a difference and zeroing it \nout is just unconscionable. Both political parties have let down what \nneeds to be done in this critical area.\n  I see the chairman of the committee. I know he is very interested in \nhealth information technology, as is Senator Baucus. I hope to lead a \nbipartisan effort in this session of the Congress to ensure that Dr. \nBrailer's office gets the funds that are necessary.\n  The last couple of points I would make in support of the Leavitt \nnomination: First, on the question of Medicaid, Mike Leavitt told me, \nin response to a question I asked, that there was no plan to send a \nblock grant proposal to the Congress. That was welcome news. But he \nleft an awful lot of wiggle room in terms of the details, and so \nbipartisan concerns remain, concerns by the governors as well, about \nwhat is to come.\n  As one Senator who specializes in this field, I send a message that I \nam very supportive of the concept of health care waivers. I think that \nkind of flexibility is certainly a plus. We in Oregon have used them in \na humanitarian way, to get better quality care to people for services \nthat are medically effective. But there is a big difference between \nwaivers that are borne out of a desire to use flexibility to serve \npeople and a block grant proposal which just sets an arbitrary cap and \ncuts people off.\n  Finally, I want to talk about the importance of working in a \nbipartisan way to contain costs for prescription drugs under the new \nMedicare law. As one who voted for that law, believing it was important \nto get started, I said then that the next step has to be to put in \nplace a real cost containment effort that looks particularly to the \nprivate sector. Senator Olympia Snowe, who serves with great \ndistinction on the Finance Committee, will be introducing legislation \nwith me next week that will say we are going to use private sector \nforces, marketplace forces, to hold down the costs of prescription \ndrugs in our country. For the life of me, I cannot figure out why \nWeyerhauser, a big timber company, or an auto company, or a steel \ncompany, or any other big concern, has marketplace power to hold down \nthe cost of medicine but the Medicare Program does not. In fact, I \ndon't know of a single buyer in the private sector who, after they \npurchased a certain volume of a particular commodity, looks to buying \nanother commodity and then doesn't ask for a discount, doesn't ask for \nsome kind of benefit as a result of using their marketplace power.\n  So I am very hopeful. Mike Leavitt indicated last week he was open to \ndiscussions in this area. Certainly, again, there were no details \ndiscussed, but he showed a flexibility that I found welcome.\n  I see the chair and the ranking minority member here. I don't want to \ndetain them. I urge the Senate to approve the nomination of Mike \nLeavitt when he comes up for a vote. I thank the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Grassley, and the ranking minority member for their \nindulgence so I could make these comments.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/26/senate-section/article/S533-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S533-S542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n NOMINATION OF MICHAEL O. LEAVITT TO BE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN \n                                SERVICES\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of the Executive Calendar, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Michael O. \nLeavitt, of Utah, to be Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nhours of debate on the nomination.\n  The Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, in the tradition of the work of the \nSenate Finance Committee--and that is basically described in one word, \nbipartisanship--we bring this nomination to the floor. We bring it with \nthe unanimous approval of everybody on the committee, saying that \nGovernor Leavitt should be the Secretary of Health and Human Services. \nHe is a person who is very well qualified for this position, and we \nlook forward to working with him on all of the quality-of-life issues \nthat come before Congress, whether they deal with Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid, welfare--issues that are under the jurisdiction of \nthis new Secretary to administer, and issues that are under the \njurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee for oversight.\n  During his tenure as Governor, he reduced the number of uninsured \nchildren through his work on the Children's Health Insurance Program, \nhe made significant improvements to the child welfare system, and he \nsignificantly increased the number of those with health insurance \ncoverage. So some of the things he has done as Governor are some of the \nthings that we are working on in this committee, and some laws are \nalready passed. He will have a chance to continue his good work on \nthese issues in conjunction with us as a committee and directly himself \nas Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  I am not alone in my high estimation of Governor Leavitt. The people \nof Utah recognize his strong leadership capabilities in reelecting him \nto three consecutive terms as Governor. Certainly big challenges lie \nahead for this Department, as it does for our committee, and strong \nleadership in that Department is needed. I am glad it comes with \nGovernor Leavitt.\n  First and foremost, there are an estimated 45 million Americans who \nlack basic health coverage, and those numbers seem to have been \nincreasing every year. As Secretary, his leadership will be called upon \nto propose innovative ways that we can help contain costs and increase \naccess to health insurance and the health care resulting from that \ninsurance.\n  The Medicaid Program will also be a key issue this year. Medicaid \nprovides health care coverage and benefits for low-income individuals \nand families. It is now the largest Federal care program in terms of \ntotal spending and served about 51,000 people in 2002.\n  It was originally enacted in 1965, and many have suggested it has not \nkept up with the times. Increasingly, States have been forced to rely \nupon what we call the 1115 waiver process to manage the program to fit \nthe needs of their State. These waivers are negotiated with little \ncongressional oversight. I look forward to working with Governor \nLeavitt to ensure that the Medicaid Program is functioning as \neffectively as it ought to function.\n  There is the issue of SCHIP, the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. Madam President, $1.1 billion in SCHIP allotments expired last \nyear and were returned to the Treasury. In addition, there are anywhere \nfrom 4 million to 6 million children currently uninsured who could \nqualify for this program.\n  Over the next 3 years, a growing number of States, including my own \nState of Iowa, are projected to consume their Federal SCHIP allotment.\n\n[[Page S534]]\n\nWhen this happens, they will lack the Federal funds necessary to \nprovide their current level of coverage and also the level of benefits \nfor low-income children.\n  We need to recapture the $1.1 billion in SCHIP funds, increase our \noutreach effort to enroll more children, and revitalize the SCHIP \nprogram so it is on firm financial footing.\n  Finally, we need to enact improvements to the 1996 welfare reform \nbill. We have debated this issue now for 3 years. It is time for \naction. The numerous short-term extensions are disruptive to the \nprogram. I look forward to working with Governor Leavitt to get a \nwelfare bill sent to the President this year. I think that process is \nstarting with the usual bipartisan cooperation between Senator Baucus's \nside of the aisle and his leadership and the Republicans who I lead.\n  The Department also has the important job of implementing the new \nMedicare prescription drug benefit. Under Dr. McClellan's leadership, \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has accomplished an \nimpressive workload over the last year.\n  Dr. McClellan and the staff at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices are to be commended for their long hours, hard work, and, most \nimportantly, a dedication to doing the best they can.\n  This is a crucial year for the drug benefit that was passed and \nsigned by the President in 2003. I look forward to working with the \nGovernor on this particular issue and continuing the close working \nrelationship with Dr. McClellan.\n  Medicare still faces significant challenges to be sure. Medicare \nspending grew by 5.7 percent in 2003, and as spending continues to \nincrease, there is a growing need to restrain its growth.\n  Many have said rising costs and health care can be contained and \nhealth care quality improved by paying providers based on their \nperformance and by utilizing health information technology.\n  The Department has taken significant steps to reduce health care \ncosts and provide better care through chronic care management \ninitiatives and additional preventive benefits that were in the 2003 \nlegislation.\n  The Department also called upon Dr. Brailer, as the National \nCoordinator for Health Information Technology, to develop, maintain, \nand oversee a plan focused on a nationwide adoption of health \ninformation technology in both the public and private sectors.\n  Bringing these initiatives together to reward quality and efficiency \nwhile reducing medical errors and duplication will be one of the major \nundertakings in health care over the next decade, and strong leadership \nat Health and Human Services is needed to make that happen.\n  Another issue on which the Governor's leadership is needed is the \nimportation of prescription drugs from Canada and other developed \nnations. That surely is a controversial issue that hopefully we can \ndebate in the Senate, because the law must be changed to make that \nhappen. American consumers are demanding lower prices for prescription \ndrugs, and I believe that legalizing importation under conditions that \nensure safety is the right thing to do.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to craft legislation that will pass Congress and be signed by the \nPresident.\n  I would also be remiss if I did not address an issue that continues \nto be of great concern. The frail and elderly residing in our Nation's \nnursing homes deserve high-quality care. I am confident that with \nGovernor Leavitt's help, we can ensure that they receive no less.\n  Besides these issues, the Department faces other significant \nchallenges. I have always taken responsibility of conducting oversight \nover the executive branch operations very seriously, and I will \ncontinue to do that as chairman again. Government truly is the people's \nbusiness, and Americans have the right to know what their Government is \ndoing and how it spends their money. Transparency in Government, \ncoupled with aggressive oversight by Congress, is critically important \nin helping to make Government transparent, more effective, more \nefficient, and more accountable to the taxpayers, program participants, \nand beneficiaries.\n  I am also a firm and ardent supporter of whistleblowers. \nHistorically, whistleblowers have been key to uncovering waste, fraud, \nand abuse. Unfortunately, whistleblowers are often as welcome in an \nagency as a skunk at a picnic.\n  I look forward to addressing these problems with Governor Leavitt. \nTaking a closer look at Medicaid, SCHIP improvement, implementation of \nthe new drug benefit, importation of prescription drugs, enactment of \nwelfare reform, and the advancement of information technology and \nquality in health care as a reimbursement tool are just some of the \npriorities I look forward to addressing with Governor Leavitt.\n  I close by urging my fellow colleagues to support Governor Leavitt in \nhis nomination as Secretary of Health and Human Services. It is a major \ncommitment that requires personal sacrifices on many levels, although I \nbelieve Governor Leavitt and his wife Jackie are the right team for \nthis job. I also thank President Bush for his choice of such a \nqualified and competent candidate.\n  I thank Senator Baucus not only for his cooperation on this effort, \nbut we have had 4 years now of cooperative effort, and we expect that \nto continue. I know he is committed to that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I appreciate those remarks and agree \nwith them.\n  I rise today to support also the nomination of former Utah Governor \nand current EPA Administrator Michael Leavitt to be the 20th Secretary \nof Health and Human Services.\n  As Utah's longest-serving Governor, Governor Leavitt earned the \nreputation as an innovator and consensus builder. He is best known for \nhis work in Utah to expand health care coverage. While he and I may \ndisagree on policy grounds about the Utah approach, Governor Leavitt \nhas spoken at length about the importance of transparency, the \nimportance of fairness and open debate, all of which are crucial to \ncreating sound public policy.\n  He is a consensus builder, something that is very much needed not \nonly in this town but in the new position he is about to have.\n  Governor Leavitt's leadership and social policies stretch beyond \nhealth care. He also has championed welfare reform. The Utah program \nfulfills many of the goals of the 1996 welfare bill, which I am proud \nto have helped write. It provides support for low-income families, \naddresses barriers faced by welfare recipients, provides education and \ntraining opportunities to support moving into sustainable employment, \nand ensures that struggling families receive child support.\n  As EPA Administrator, Governor Leavitt came out to visit my State. He \ncame out to visit the Superfund site at Libby, MT. We are having a very \ndifficult time in Libby. It is a huge Superfund site, one of the \nlargest in the country. I tell Governor Leavitt, as I have many times, \nhis visit meant a lot to me personally and to the people of Libby who \nhave suffered a great deal because of asbestos sickness.\n  In short, Mr. Leavitt is a very capable leader and excellent \ncandidate to lead this Department. We are fortunate to have his \nleadership, because the challenges he will face are tremendous.\n  This year, as Secretary, Mr. Leavitt will implement the new Medicare \ndrug benefit and managed care reforms--no small task but an extremely \nimportant one.\n  The final rule to implement major provisions of the new Medicare drug \nlaw were published last week, 2 days after the confirmation hearing, I \nmight add. I am still in the process of reviewing those regulations, \nbut at first read, I remain concerned about the transition rule for \ndual eligibles and for consumer protection standards. The final rule \nincluded much needed improvements in both areas. For example, \nbeneficiaries who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid will be \nautomatically enrolled into a drug plan. However, the timeframe for \ndoing so is short, and it may still cause problems for many low-income, \nvulnerable beneficiaries.\n\n[[Page S535]]\n\n  While the final rule includes expedited timeframes for coverage \ndecisions, it still appears drug plans will write their own appeals \nprocess.\n  In addition to Medicare, as HHS Secretary, Governor Leavitt will \ntackle Medicaid reform. Many of us in Congress anticipate an aggressive \nreform proposal will be included in the President's budget. It is true, \nas many claim, that Medicaid costs are growing, but the cost growth is \ndue to an increase in enrollment during our recent economic downturn \nand for the same health care cost of inflation that affects every \ninsurance plan. In fact, Medicaid growth is lower on a per capita basis \nthan is Medicare growth or private insurance growth. It is lower. We \nshould also bear in mind that Medicaid covers long-term care, something \nwhich is quite expensive.\n\n  Also, I disapprove of the administration's use of its 1115 waiver \nauthority. The 1115 waiver authority was not intended to achieve \nwholesale reform of Medicaid. We have a Medicaid law. The waiver \nauthority was not meant to undermine that law. It was meant to grant \nflexibility to the States but not to undermine the law. It was not \nintended to undermine the fundamental nature of the Medicaid Program.\n  I suspect the administration will want to consider Medicaid waivers, \nState flexibility, and Medicaid funding as part of any formal \ndiscussion.\n  Reauthorizing TANF is another task to add to Mr. Leavitt's growing \nlist. We cannot continue to extend the program on a 3-month or 6-month \nbasis, as these short month extensions have undermined the stability of \nthe program. We have to enact and reauthorize welfare reform. We must \nwork together on a longer term reauthorization, one that builds on the \n1996 reform law.\n  Finally, I hope we can work together to address rising health care \ncosts and the uninsured. The United States health system is the most \nexpensive in the world, by far. Spending on health care in 2003 reached \n$1.7 trillion, which calculates out to $5,670 per person. That is about \ntwice the next highest level in the world, which is Switzerland, and \nthey spend half per capita than what we spend. Yet 45 million \nAmericans, even though we spend so much more than any other country, \nlack health insurance. What can we do about lack of insurance and \nrising health care costs?\n  With respect to the uninsured, every major poll suggests covering the \nuninsured should be at the top of the congressional agenda. Yet this \nissue always seems to take a backseat. I think, however, that we can \nmake progress--maybe not sweeping reform but we can address the problem \nincrementally, starting with areas first of general agreement.\n  I believe there is a consensus, for example, that we ought to start \nby covering low-income children and the poorest adults below 100 \npercent of poverty.\n  I have every hope Governor Leavitt, as HHS Secretary, will keep \nworking on this, and I pledge to help him.\n  With respect to rising health care costs, I believe we can take \nimportant steps this year to improve health care quality and the way we \npay for health care in our country. I am counting on the \nadministration's support. I am counting on them to back up their \nstatements and goals with funding and actions.\n  I have no doubt Governor Leavitt is up to the task. He has an \nexcellent reputation, not just as Governor of Utah, not just as EPA \nAdministrator, not just as a political leader, but as someone who is \ncreative, who can think outside the box, and who can work with folks \nfrom all perspectives.\n  Governor Leavitt has my very strong support. He has my vote. I look \nforward to working with him as Secretary Leavitt and with the \nadministration to address the many challenges that lie ahead for our \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as everybody around here knows, I strongly \nsupport the nomination of Governor Mike Leavitt for Secretary of Health \nand Human Services. I urge my colleagues to confirm Governor Leavitt so \nthat he may start his work as quickly as possible.\n  I have known Governor Mike Leavitt for a long time, almost 30 years, \nand have worked very closely with him on many health issues, not just \nlocal and State health issues but national health issues as well. \nGovernor Leavitt has a distinguished record. He is highly qualified for \nthis job. He is bright, energetic, dedicated, and fair--all of the \nqualities necessary for this important position.\n  I say with all respect to those who have gone before him, I can think \nof no better candidate for Secretary of Health and Human Services or no \nbetter nominee than Mike Leavitt.\n  Having said that, I compliment his predecessor, Governor Tommy \nThompson. To have two great Governors in a row running HHS is a credit \nto this administration and to the country at large. Governor Thompson \nhas done a terrific job at HHS under very difficult circumstances. It \nis almost an unmanageable entity because it is so large and so \nimportant and covers so much of the wealth and costs of this Nation. \nGovernor Thompson deserves a great deal of credit. He was a great \nGovernor, but so was Mike Leavitt. Between the two of them, we will \nhave a continuity that will be very beneficial to all of us.\n  Governor Leavitt has devoted much of his life to public service, \nfirst in Utah and more recently in Washington. He is a smart \ndecisionmaker, a tireless worker, and a successful manager and \nexecutive. He is fair. He is knowledgeable about health care. He is a \ndecent family man. The bottom line: He will get the job done.\n  As Governor of Utah, Governor Leavitt was a strong leader on issues \nfamiliar to this body: welfare reform, health care delivery, and, of \ncourse, Medicaid. During a difficult financial time for our State of \nUtah, Governor Leavitt was able to create a fiscally responsible budget \nand at the same time provide important services to lower income Utah \ncitizens of all ages.\n  While Congress was working on the 1997 Child Health Insurance Program \nlegislation, a bill that I was the prime sponsor of, I talked to \nGovernor Leavitt frequently to get his perspective as a leader in the \nNational Governors Association. At first he was not very enamored with \nthe Hatch-Kennedy bill. On the other hand, I told him the final bill \nwas not going to be exactly that bill, which was written a little more \nmoderately than I thought it should be. I also wanted the States to \nhave more authority and power with the CHIP program, which was more in \nsync with Governor Leavitt's thinking. During that time he provided me \nwith valuable insight and has continued to do so as the program has \ngrown.\n  I would be remiss if I did not also cite Governor Leavitt's great \nwork in providing health care coverage to not only CHIP-eligible \nchildren but to lower income adults of our State as well through \ninnovative new State health care insurance programs like the Primary \nCare Network.\n  In addition, Governor Leavitt implemented several new and innovative \napproaches to serving the poor. Governor Leavitt's administration was \none of the first to implement a philosophy of universal engagement \nwherein every candidate to receive State assistance was assessed and a \nplan to help these individuals become self-sufficient was created. This \nproved to be an enormously valuable tool to helping the disadvantaged \nget the assistance they needed to return to the job market as soon as \npossible.\n  As in many aspects of his life as a public servant, Mike Leavitt is a \nvisionary who cares deeply about people, exactly the type of a person \nwe want in this position.\n\n  Finally, Governor Leavitt has been a strong supporter of the Utah \nHead Start Program. For many children, the Head Start Program is their \nfirst and only exposure to education and health services. There are \nmany examples of how the Utah Head Start Program has made a dramatic \ndifference. Let me cite a couple for my colleagues. One little girl \nfrom Utah was handed a book on her first day in the program and \nliterally did not know how to open the book. Another child was \ndiagnosed with a brain tumor through the Utah Head Start screening \nprocess. Surgery was successfully performed, and he returned to the \nprogram and did extremely well. Governor Leavitt has had firsthand \nexperience at overseeing this program and therefore brings an important \nperspective to HHS on why Head Start needs to be continued and even \nstrengthened.\n\n[[Page S536]]\n\n  On a personal note, I emphasize to my colleagues that Mike Leavitt is \na fair man. I know him very well. He will look at all sides of an issue \nbefore making a policy decision, and my colleagues can count on the \nresult to be the right decision. His record as both the Governor of \nUtah and as Administrator of EPA proves this, and he will continue to \nbe a great leader when he becomes Secretary of HHS. I can promise my \ncolleagues he will be an excellent leader for the programs we all \nsupport--Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, welfare and community health \ncenters, just to make a few.\n  Importantly, we can count on Mike Leavitt, along with the \nAdministrator for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Mark McClellan, to \nwork closely with our committee on the difficult task of fully \nimplementing the Medicare prescription drug program next January. I \nmight add that the jurisdiction of a Secretary of Health and Human \nServices is quite broad, it not only includes CMS, which handles \nMedicaid and Medicare among other programs, but it also includes the \nFood and Drug Administration and many other different programs within \nthat department.\n  In my opinion, the FDA is the single most important consumer agency \nin the world. The FDA handles upwards of 25 percent of all consumer \nproducts in America, and the agency does an extraordinary job. However, \nthere is more and more pressure on FDA every year to try to have a \nfail-safe system where no deleterious results can occur from \npharmaceutical innovations. There is no way that can ever be, but I \nbelieve that FDA does as good of a job as possible. In fact, my FDA \nRevitalization Act, authorized the creation of a central campus in the \nWashington, DC, area to house all FDA employees in this greater area \nwho are now scattered over more than 30 different facilities, which can \nbe very inconvenient and nonproductive. In December 2003, we dedicated \nthe first building on the White Oak campus, which is where the full FDA \ncampus will be built with state-of-the-art equipment and state-of-the-\nart facilities. Individuals who want to work in this area will be given \nan opportunity to work under the best of circumstances.\n  One of Governor Leavitt's responsibilities as Secretary will be to \ncontinue with this centralization, complete with a totally computerized \nand digital FDA campus, created so that we can be even more efficient \nat FDA. It is my hope that this centralized campus will shorten the \nlength of time it takes to ensure the safety and efficacy of \npharmaceutical drugs.\n  I will close with one anecdote related to me the other day. After \nattending several briefings with the Secretary designate, an FDA \nofficial stated: At our first briefing, Governor Leavitt was good. At \nthe second meeting, he was excellent. At the last briefing, he was \nteaching us.\n  Now, that is the kind of a man Mike Leavitt is. He will be a great \nSecretary. With pride and admiration, I strongly support my fellow \nUtahan Governor Mike Leavitt's nomination for Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services. Let us get him confirmed and on the job as soon as \npossible. I have no doubt that will occur. I am very grateful to those \nwho are willing to support Governor Leavitt, and I suspect that \neverybody in this body will do so.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TALENT. I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be \nrescinded, and I ask unanimous consent to proceed for only about 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hatch). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n\n                  The Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator for taking the \nchair for just a couple of minutes so I can speak about a bill I have \nintroduced along with Senator Brownback. He is the lead sponsor. There \nwill be others on the bill as well. We had sponsored the bill last \nyear. I want to make a brief statement about it.\n  It is a good bill in an area where we often do not see consensus, but \nI believe this bill will promote consensus. It is the Unborn Child Pain \nAwareness Act. It is based on the scientific evidence, which I think is \na matter of common sense as well, that children in gestation, unborn \nchildren in the womb, do at a certain point acquire the capability of \nfeeling pain. What the bill says is that before an abortion can be \nperformed on a child who has been in the womb for 20 weeks or longer, \nthe abortion doctor has to inform the mother that the child will feel \npain and will, in fact, feel intense pain if the procedure is \nperformed, and then inform her that if she wants to go ahead anyway, \nthe child can be given an anesthetic so that that pain is not felt.\n  Apart from the fact that the scientific evidence indicates children \nat this point can feel pain, I have a personal stake, if you will, in \nthis. Before we were blessed with the three children we have, my wife \nhad several miscarriages in a row. It was pretty obvious what was \ngrowing inside of her was a person. It makes sense to me to believe at \na certain point that a child can feel pain, and 20 weeks is actually a \npretty conservative estimate of when the child is able to feel that \nkind of pain.\n  I see no reason a doctor about to perform such a procedure would not \nwant to make it known, or a woman who is considering undergoing it \nwould not want to know that fact to make a decision.\n  Mr. President, you know me and my view on this issue overall. I \nbelieve unborn children are people. I look forward to and long for the \nday where we believe there is room in our hearts and our homes and our \nlaws for them and their moms. We are not there in that fundamental \nsense, but we are at a point where we can work on legislation like this \nwhich has support broader than either the pro-choice or pro-life side. \nThis is legislation which is really designed to perfect the current law \nthat says women should be able to make a choice. Then they should be \nable to make an informed choice.\n  I hope that is what we do. I hope we have an opportunity to bring it \nup on the floor of the Senate, and if we do have an opportunity to have \na reasonable debate, we will pass it with a large margin. I hope to \nhave that done in this Congress. I am proud to have cosponsored it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I plan to support Governor Michael O. \nLeavitt's nomination to be Secretary of Health and Human Services, HHS.\n  Governor Leavitt is taking on a difficult role. There are many \nhealthcare challenges facing our Nation. With over 300 separate \nprograms and a budget of more than $400 billion per year, the Secretary \nof HHS is responsible for setting the healthcare agenda for the \nadministration. It is my hope that implementing the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit will be at the top of Governor Leavitt's \nagenda. This large and complex law will have a tremendous impact on 40 \nmillion Medicare beneficiaries. As we get closer to January 1, 2006--\nopening day for the drug benefit--HHS will have many important \ndecisions to make. I look forward to working with Governor Leavitt to \nensure that North Dakota seniors get the options and information they \nneed to make the best choice about the right drug benefit for them.\n  Also, given his record, I hope Governor Leavitt will take an active \nrole in addressing funding shortfalls in the rural healthcare system. \nMany of the provisions in the Medicare Modernization Act that erased \nthe inequities that existed between rural and urban providers are due \nto expire in 2006 and 2007. I am committed to reauthorizing these \nimportant provisions and trust that Governor Leavitt will work with me \ntowards this end.\n  More generally, it is important that HHS and Congress look at other \nareas where healthcare needs are being unmet and take the appropriate \nsteps to improve access to healthcare in rural America. For example, \nCongress should improve the financing of our rural emergency medical \nservices. Our rural EMS squads are a vital component of the healthcare \nsystem, and current Medicare regulations do not adequately reimburse \nthese squads for their services. This Congress, I intend to introduce \nlegislation to improve the rural EMS system and hope that Governor \nLeavitt will support these efforts.\n\n[[Page S537]]\n\n  As Governor of Utah during the 2002 Winter Olympics, Mr. Leavitt had \nextraordinary experiences with preparing for a possible bioterrorism \nattack that will aid him in his position as Secretary of HHS. Over the \npast years, I have pushed for the enactment of a national emergency \ntelemedical communications system that could be used to more \neffectively respond to a bioterrorist attack on a regional level by \nusing telehealth technologies. I look forward to working closely with \nGovernor Leavitt to move this legislation forward.\n  Finally, in his new role as Secretary, Governor Leavitt will be \ncharged with preserving and protecting two of our Nation's most \nimportant health insurance programs--Medicaid and the State Children's \nHeal Insurance Program. It is important that Governor Leavitt be a \nstrong advocate for these vital social programs.\n  I look forward to working with Governor Leavitt in the coming years \nto improve healthcare for all Americans.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Michael \nLeavitt to be the next Secretary of Health and Human Services. Our \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions has unanimously \nrecommended his confirmation, and I urge the Senate to do so as well.\n  At the committee hearing on his nomination, Governor Leavitt showed \nthe intelligence, honesty and commitment to public service that have \nbeen the hallmark of his career. While we differ on some issues raised \nat the hearing, there are many issues where we agree and can work \ntogether to create a bipartisan consensus. I believe that he will lead \nthe Department with integrity, skill and vision.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services has a broad and deep \nimpact on the lives of the American people. Its programs reflect the \nideals of our nation and our commitment to provide help to all those \nwho need our help the most.\n  HHS cares for the elderly through Medicare and the Older Americans \nAct. It nurtures the young through Head Start, CHIP, and maternal and \nchild health programs. It sustains poor families through the Temporary \nAssistance to Needy Families Act. It brings health care to all in \npoverty through Medicaid. It offers help and hope to patients suffering \nfrom disease through the National Institutes of Health. It guarantees \nevery American that the medicines they take are safe and effective and \nthe foods they eat are healthful through the Food and Drug \nAdministration. It protects the health of every American against \nepidemics of disease through the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention.\n  Mr. Leavitt brings impressive skills to this critical post. As a \nformer governor he knows how HHS works, and where it needs improvement. \nAt EPA, he confronted health issues similar to many of those dealt with \nby HHS. Everyone who knows him respects his intelligence, his high \nenergy, and his experience as a manager and problem-solver.\n  His new position will test all those skills, and he'll face an \nespecially heavy challenge this year. Many of the most important \nprograms he oversees get lavish praise but little real support. Last \nyear, the administration was able to push through the Congress a flawed \nMedicare drug bill that benefited drug companies and insurance \ncompanies at the expense of patients. Governor Leavitt will now have to \nimplement that flawed bill.\n  Press reports indicate that the administration intends to block grant \nMedicaid and cut it deeply, and to cut Medicare deeply as well. More \nthan 50 million of the Nation's poor depend on Medicaid for health \ncare. Forty-two million senior citizens and disabled Americans depend \non Medicare. The administration's tax cuts for the wealthy and its \nmisguided war in Iraq have created a catastrophic deficit, but it would \nbe unconscionable to solve the budget crisis by penalizing the poor and \nthe elderly who did nothing to create it, and to ask the wealthy and \npowerful to make no contribution at all.\n  We will continue our bipartisan work this year on Head Start--the \nfoundation of federal support for the nation's most vulnerable \nchildren. Head Start has a 40-year track record of success. The \nreauthorization this year is an opportunity to build on that success, \nand do more to open the American dream to many more children who \ndeserve our help. A block grant for Head Start would be a giant step \nbackwards--we can't turn Head Start into Slow Start or No Start.\n  The current extension of welfare reform expires at the end of March, \nand our ability to move the welfare debate forward will require more \nflexibility from an administration willing to work in good faith with \nCongress on this basic issue of what kind of country we are. Governor \nLeavitt led Utah's innovative welfare program, which guarantees \nprovides support and services tailored to the individual needs of each \nrecipient, including education and training, substance abuse treatment, \nchild care and other key assistance.\n  Other priorities facing the Department include the need to move our \nhealth care system into the modern age using information technology, \nand improve FDA's ability to detect and respond promptly to warning \nsignals on the effects of new drugs. We must also continue the fine \nwork of Secretary Thompson in putting disease prevention and health \npromotion higher on the national agenda. And I hope that Governor \nLeavitt will support the bipartisan efforts led by Senator Dorgan and \nSenator Snowe to import safe FDA-approved drugs at the low prices that \nCanadians and Europeans are charged.\n  I welcome Governor Leavitt's strong commitment to using information \ntechnology to improve the quality of care for America's patients and to \nreducing the costs of health care. I look forward to working with him \nclosely to see that we take the actions needed to turn our bipartisan \nvision of an improved health care system into a reality.\n  Michael Leavitt is a distinguished and talented public servant, and \nan impressive choice for this important responsibility, and I urge the \nSenate to confirm him as Secretary of HHS.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nnomination of Michael Leavitt to be the Secretary of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. Michael is an overwhelmingly qualified \ncandidate and the kind of leader the Agency needs. I am confident he \nwill work hard to serve the public health needs of our Nation.\n  Michael Leavitt will bring considerable executive experience to this \npost. As the former Governor of Utah, he improved access to health care \nfor thousands of children and adults, while keeping rising health care \ncosts in check. To date, Utah's uninsured rate remains below the \nNation's average. Michael has also proven himself a capable leader in \nhis former positions as chairman of the National Governor's \nAssociation, and most recently, administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, helps to protect \nthe health, safety, and well-being of the American people. HHS is among \nour Nation's largest and most important Federal departments, overseeing \nmore than 300 programs with a budget in excess of $580 billion. HHS is \nresponsible for the management of such vital programs as the Food and \nDrug Administration, Indian Health Services, the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \nServices. The Medicaid and Medicare programs alone help provide needed \nhealth care to nearly 80 million Americans.\n  I applaud President Bush for his choice of an accomplished leader to \nhead this vital department. I look forward to working with Secretary \nLeavitt on critical issues such as implementation of the Medicare \nprescription drug program, medical liability reform and finding ways to \nreduce the cost of health care.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as you know, I am passionate about health \ncare issues, and I want to talk today about two issues of particular \ninterest to me, which Health and Human Services Secretary Nominee \nMichael Leavitt has promised to review when he takes the helm at that \ndepartment.\n  Leavitt promised to look at the legislation which Senate Judiciary \nChairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and I are developing to require dietary \nsupplement manufacturers to submit reports to the Food and Drug \nAdministration when they cause serious injury or death to consumers. \nUnder current law,\n\n[[Page S538]]\n\nthese manufacturers of these products, which are widely sold, do not \nhave to report to the government if their products are suspected of \ncausing someone taking them to become ill or even die. This happens \neven to people who are seemingly healthy, such as 17-year-old Sean \nRiggins from Lincoln, IL. Sean was a rising star on his high school \nfootball team in 1992 and wanted to enhance his performance in the big \ngame. Sean took ``Yellow Jackets,'' a supplement promising increased \nenergy, which contained ephedra. Sean was killed by those pills.\n  While dietary supplements are safely consumed by millions of \nAmericans every day, unfortunately, this is not always the case. \nEphedra is perhaps the best-known dangerous supplement ingredient; it \nhas caused at least 150 deaths, forcing HHS to pull it off the market. \nThere are other supplements that have raised questions, such as \naristolochic acid, usnic acid, kava kava and yohimbine, and the problem \nis, we just don't have the data centrally located to help the agency \ndetermine the products' safety. The law assumes products containing \nthese substances are safe until proven unsafe.\n  Senator Hatch and I do not always agree, but on this issue, we do. \nThere should be a clearinghouse at the Food and Drug Administration for \nthese manufacturers to provide data about the safety of their products. \nAnd most of the industry and consumer groups are on our side, so as we \ndevelop legislation this year, Administrator Leavitt has agreed to \nreview it. I look forward to working with him.\n  Administrator Leavitt also promised to remain active on the issue of \ntobacco control. Mr. Leavitt is a former charter member of the American \nLegacy Foundation board, the foundation established by the Master \nSettlement Agreement to educate youth and the public about the \naddictiveness and health effects of smoking.\n  More than 90 percent of adult smokers began smoking as teenagers. The \nAmerican Legacy Foundation's public education campaign is helping to \nproduce dramatic decreases in youth smoking rates. The work of the \nAmerican Legacy Foundation is more important than ever to this \ncountry's health.\n  I support Administrator Leavitt's nomination to serve as Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services and welcome the opportunity to work with him \nto reduce smoking among young people, acquire quality safety data on \ndietary supplements, and address other critical health concerns.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today as the nomination of current \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, Administrator and former Utah \nGovernor Michael Leavitt for the position of Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services comes before the Senate. I plan to support this nominee \nas I did a little more than one year ago when Governor Leavitt's \nnomination to lead the EPA came before this body. I do so with the \nintention of working with him once he is confirmed as the \nadministration's leading health care advocate to protect our Nation's \nvital health care infrastructure.\n  Once confirmed as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Governor \nLeavitt will oversee the administration of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, HHS, the vast federal agency overseeing the Medicare \nand Medicaid programs, the National Institutes of Health, NIH, the Food \nand Drug Administration, FDA, the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, CDC, the Health Resources and Services Administration, \nHRSA, and the Administration for Children and Families, which oversees \nchild care, welfare and Head Start. HHS operates more than 300 \ncritically important programs that represent almost a quarter of all \nfederal outlays. In fact, the Medicare and Medicaid programs alone \nprovide health insurance for one in four Americans.\n  Current research tells us that well crafted, well researched, and \ncomprehensive public health initiatives spearheaded by the office of \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services could lead millions of \nAmericans to efficiently and successfully address health concerns \nbefore they become critical. However, just as important as the \ndevelopment of lifesaving preventive services is support for those \nprograms already providing services to those already struggling with \ndisease or impairment. In order to be successful in his new role as \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, Governor Leavitt will need to \nbalance these sometimes competing needs so as to effectively lead our \nnation's federal health care systems into the 21st Century.\n  Let me just take a moment to lay out several areas that I hope \nGovernor Leavitt will make a priority as secretary. First, I think it \nis imperative that we take steps to ensure that the prescription drugs \nthat are already on the market will not harm the millions of Americans \nthat rely on them for their health and well-being. Serious questions \nhave been raised about the ability of the Food and Drug Administration \nto ensure the safety of medicines. In the coming days, I will be \nintroducing a bill to reform the FDA and give it the authority and \nresources to effectively monitor prescription drugs that are on the \nmarket, and take action if a safety issue is identified. I look forward \nto working with Governor Leavitt on this issue, and I hope that he will \nmake it one of his top priorities.\n  Of additional concern are possible efforts to modify our nation's \nMedicaid program, the federal and state health insurance program for \nthose with low incomes. Currently this valuable program serves more \nthan 50 million low-income children, pregnant women, elderly and \ndisabled Americans, providing a vital safety net of health care \nservices to these often vulnerable populations. I plan to work with the \nnew Secretary to ensure that any modifications to this important \nprogram do not endanger its continued ability to provide for the health \nof its needy beneficiaries.\n  I am also hopeful that Governor Leavitt will expand the work done by \nhis predecessor to bring the health care system into the information \nage. Expanding the use of information technology, IT, in health care \nsettings will save patients' lives and improve the quality of care. In \naddition, estimates suggest that investment in health IT is one of the \nmost effective tools we have to control skyrocketing health care costs, \nmaking health care more affordable for all Americans.\n  I urge Governor Leavitt to take a close look at an issue affecting \nthe health of infants in this country. The Advisory Committee on \nHeritable Disorders and Genetic Diseases in Newborns and Children is \nclose to issuing a report recommending a standard set of genetic \ndisorders that all states should test for at birth. Newborn screening \nsaves thousands of lives every year, but the current inconsistency in \nstate testing policies means that too many children still suffer from \ndisorders that are not detected until it's too late. I hope that \nGovernor Leavitt will work with me to ensure that states can adopt the \nrecommendations of the advisory committee, so no more infants fall \nthrough the gaps in newborn screening.\n  Tragically, we know that each and every day in America 7,000 children \nunder the age of sixteen have their first alcoholic drink. We also know \nthat 4,500 children under the age of 21 will lose their lives due to \nthe abuse of alcohol each year. At the same time, the social costs \nassociated with underage drinking total close to $53 billion annually \nincluding $19 billion from automobile accidents and $29 billion from \nassociated violent crime. In 2003, the Institute of Medicine released a \nstudy, ``Reducing Underage Drinking--A Collective Responsibility,'' \nthat laid out the national problems presented by consumption of alcohol \nby youth and established a multi-tiered national strategy to reduce \nunderage drinking's toll. Sadly, however, there has yet been little \nprogress made in instituting this strategy. It is my desire to work \nwith the new Secretary toward implementation of this important report's \nrecommendations.\n  I also look forward to working with Governor Leavitt to increase the \navailability of medical devices for children. Many essential medical \ndevices used extensively by pediatricians are not designed and sized \nfor children's special needs. Because the number of children needing a \nparticular device is often quite small, there's simply little financial \nincentive for manufacturers to make pediatric appropriate devices. As a \nresult, health care providers are forced to use adult devices ``off-\nlabel''\n\n[[Page S539]]\n\nwithout a clear understanding of the risks involved or to use older, \nless optimal, or more invasive interventions. Pediatricians tell us \nthat the development of cutting-edge medical devices suitable for \nchildren's smaller and growing bodies can lag 5 or 10 years behind \nthose for adults. In my view, this is an issue that demands our \nattention.\n  Lastly, if I could take a moment to talk about some of the issues \nrelated to poverty that this Congress will face and how important it \nwill be that we are able to work with a Secretary of Health and Human \nServices who will be prepared to listen and to objectively assess \noptions and, when appropriate, to help bring compromise toward a \nbipartisan solution. In the coming months, we will be working on \nlegislation to further strengthen Head Start, to improve the quality of \nchild care and to provide additional funding for child care in order to \nensure that we do not pit the working poor against the welfare poor, \nlegislation to reauthorize the Community Services Block Grant, CSBG, as \nwell as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP. I am \ninterested in working with Mr. Leavitt to reach bipartisan support for \nthese measures, which frankly should have bipartisan support. We should \nnot be politicizing poverty.\n  I am very concerned about the direction that the administration wants \nto take with regard to Head Start. I, too, believe there are further \nactions we can take to strengthen the literacy and cognitive \ndevelopment of Head Start children. But, Head Start is not just about \nliteracy. It is about overall school readiness which includes the \nsocial, emotional, physical, and cognitive development of children, \ndevelopment of the ``whole'' child. The Head Start bill approved by the \nHouse last year and supported by the administration would repeal the \nHead Start performance standards--standards which help ensure the \ncomprehensive quality of the program. I think that is a mistake. We can \nand should further strengthen the Head Start program and I look forward \nto working with Governor Leavitt to do so. But, if we are serious about \nstrengthening Head Start, then we cannot repeal the performance \nstandards which are the foundation for quality accountability.\n  As I mentioned earlier, another issue I hope to work with Governor \nLeavitt on is child care. When Governor Leavitt appeared before the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, we talked about the \nneed to expand access to the children of working poor families, not \njust the welfare poor, and to improve the quality of care. Again, if we \nare serious about improving the school readiness of our Nation's \nyoungest, then we need to ensure that the child care they receive is \nrelated to child development. Some 700,000 children are in state pre-\nkindergarten programs. Another 900,000 children are in Head Start \nprograms. But, some 14 million children younger than six are in child \ncare arrangements for many hours every day, every week. If we ignore \nthe quality of care that these children receive, we are missing an \nopportunity to ensure that these children enter school ready to learn. \nIt is these children, largely from working poor families, who aren't in \nHead Start, who aren't in a 2-3 hour day pre-kindergarten program \nbecause their parents work, who are most at-risk of being left behind. \nI am hopeful that we can work to achieve a bipartisan increase in child \ncare funding to better address the needs of the working poor while \nimproving the quality of care the children in these families receive.\n  These issues of concern offer only a handful of the multitude of \nitems facing the office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. \nIn his new role as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Governor \nLeavitt will have the opportunity to touch the lives of millions of \nAmericans who often struggle to adequately address their health care \nneeds.\n  However, as we all know, with great opportunity also comes great \nresponsibility. As we learned painfully with the bioterrorist attacks \nof 2001, we now face as a nation threats to our public health that we \ncould never have imagined only a few short years ago. In this new era, \nit is critical that we are prepared to meet these new challenges head \non. I look forward to working with Governor Leavitt in his new role and \nin the future to ensure that the public health infrastructure of the \nUnites States is prepared to adequately address these new threats.\n  So it is with great optimism that I support this nomination. I can \nthink of few more influential positions within federal service than the \nposition of Secretary of Health and Human Services. This position \nbrings with it a great opportunity to not only shape the way we as \nAmericans learn about the importance of health but literally has the \nability to save lives. I hope to be able to have the opportunity to \nwork with Governor Leavitt in his new role as Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to enhance the health and well-being of all Americans.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the nomination \nof former EPA Administrator and Utah Governor Michael Leavitt to be the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services.\n  I respect Governor Leavitt. He and I have enjoyed a good working \nrelationship when he was the EPA administrator. Governor Leavitt always \nkept an open door, and he worked closely with me on important Michigan \nissues such as Canadian trash and air quality standards.\n  But today, he stands ready to take a new role. This is an immense \nhonor and carries even greater responsibility. HHS oversees many of the \nagencies that affect Americans' lives the most. For example, the \nSecretary oversees Medicare and Medicaid, which covers over 70 million \npeople, from children and mothers to seniors and the disabled. The \nNational Institutes of Health drives our Nation's biomedical research, \nand the Food and Drug Administration works to make sure what we eat is \nsafe.\n  Unfortunately, HHS also has a series of missteps. In today's \nWashington Post, we learned that HHS, like the Department of Education, \npaid a journalist to write supportive statements about administration \npolicy in her column. This is on top of findings that HHS improperly \nused federal money for political purposes. HHS officials also stopped \nthe CMS actuary from giving important information to Congress about the \ntrue cost of the Medicare drug bill. I urge Governor Leavitt to work to \ncorrect these abuses.\n  I intend to vote to confirm Governor Leavitt, but I do want to use \nthis opportunity to raise some major concerns about health care. First, \nI am concerned about Governor Leavitt's position on Medicaid. My State \nhas made great strides in stretching each Medicaid dollar, including an \ninnovative drug purchasing plan with other States.\n  We should encourage States to find innovative ways to save money, but \nhaving flexibility and innovation does not mean cutting people's \nbenefits. I am concerned about rumors about ``block granting'' \nMedicaid. That would be a dangerous proposition to our most vulnerable \npopulations that rely on this important State-Federal partnership.\n  Second, we need to have a full and open debate about reimportation. \nLast Congress, I was deeply disappointed that after numerous bipartisan \nattempts to bring the issue of drug reimportation to the Senate floor, \nthe leadership blocked a fair discussion on a sensible way to bring \ndown drug prices. I am glad that my friend and colleague Senator Dorgan \nsecured an agreement with Senators Frist and Enzi on having a HELP \ncommittee hearing on reimportation by April 25.\n  We urgently need to have a reimportation bill brought to the floor. I \nam very troubled by allegations of delays while our seniors and \nbusinesses pay the price. For example, there are allegations that the \nadministration is putting strong pressure on our neighbors to the north \nto block reimportation. In fact, we have heard complaints that almost \nimmediately after U.S. trade officials visited Canada in December, the \nCanadian health minister began looking into ways to block \nreimportation.\n  I have heard too many stories from my constituents that without lower \npriced, FDA-approved drugs from Canada, they would not be able to \nafford their rent or buy their groceries. In the America that we want \nfor ourselves and our children, no one should ever have to choose \nbetween paying their rent or their medicine.\n  It is unacceptable that they cannot purchase their medicine here in \nthe\n\n[[Page S540]]\n\nUnited States. In this great Nation, a pharmacist in Detroit should be \nable to do business safely and securely with a pharmacist in Windsor.\n  I am glad that Governor Leavitt is keeping a more open mind about \nreimportation than others in the administration . . . so far! In fact, \nduring his nomination hearing in the Finance Committee, he stated: ``If \nit can be shown that it can be done safely, then it's a discussion we \nshould have.''\n  I hope Governor Leavitt will continue to keep an open mind as we \ndebate reimportation under the agreement with leadership. Again, we \nneed to have an open debate here in Congress about reimportation.\n  Finally, I hope that Governor Leavitt would keep an open mind about \nallowing the Federal Government to negotiate drug purchases on behalf \nof Medicare.\n  Even outgoing HHS Secretary Thompson said at his December 3 \nresignation press conference that he would have liked to have had the \nopportunity to negotiate lower drug prices.\n  I know that Secretary-designate Leavitt has said he does not believe \nthat the Secretary should have the power to negotiate with drug \nmanufacturers to secure lower prices for Medicare beneficiaries. \nRather, he believes that the Medicare law provides enough safeguards to \nkeep drug prices in check.\n  How is that possible when researchers at Boston University have found \nthat the pharmaceutical industry will actually make $139 billion more \nunder this plan?\n  In fact, a recent study published in the prestigious Health Affairs \njournal found that if Medicare could negotiate and bring drug prices \nmore in line with other nations' costs, we could close the doughnut \nhole.\n  I am disappointed that Governor Leavitt does not believe in using the \nmarket power of over 40 million people to get the best prices for \nseniors, the disabled, and the American taxpayer. It is a good market-\nbased solution.\n  More than ever, we need to work to keep down the costs of drugs. It \nis hurting our businesses, it is hurting our families, and it is going \nto hurt every American taxpayer when the new Medicare drug program \nbegins in 2006.\n  Yesterday the Wall Street Journal published a sampling of this \nmonth's prescription drug price increases, finding that the prices of \n31 of the 50 biggest selling medications have increased dramatically \nsince our November elections. These drugs included popular drugs such \nas the cholesterol-lowering drugs Lipitor and Pravachol; the pain-\nkiller Celebrex; the antidepressant Zoloft; and the blood-thinner \nPlavix.\n  One health research group stated that pharmaceutical companies are \nmarking up their prices now in anticipation of the Medicare drug \nprogram coming out in 2006.\n  It is outrageous that Medicare can't negotiate prices just like \nbusinesses, states, and even other Federal agencies can.\n  This is a great nation, and in the past month, we have seen how \nstrong our democracy is. But we also have room for debate and \ndiscussion. I urge Governor Leavitt to keep an open mind and to work \nwith all Members of Congress to bring down the cost of prescription \ndrugs for all Americans.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr Talent). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the business before the Senate is the \nnomination of Governor Leavitt to be the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. I come to the floor to express my support for Governor \nLeavitt. He has come to Washington in recent years to be the head of \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. He is someone of considerable \ntalent, and he is someone with whom I have worked when he was Governor \nof the State of Utah.\n  I have great respect for him, and I am very pleased that someone of \nhis capability and talent would offer himself again for this Cabinet \npost. I am very pleased to support his nomination.\n  I do want to say that one of the issues that he will confront as the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services is the issue of the \nreimportation of prescription drugs. It has been a hotly debated issue \nin the U.S. Congress. Sufficient votes exist in both the House and the \nSenate to pass legislation allowing for the reimportation of \nprescription drugs. The only reason that legislation has not been \npassed and gone to the President is it has been blocked by a minority, \nand blocked by those who want, apparently, to protect the President \nfrom having to veto legislation that includes reimportation.\n  The President has indicated opposition to the reimportation of \nprescription drugs.\n  Let me describe why the reimportation issue is important. The fact \nis, American people pay the highest prices in the world for \nprescription drugs. That occurs because the pharmaceutical industry can \ncharge those prices. Unlike most other industrialized countries, we \nhave no price controls. There, in fact, are some price controls, but \nthe controls are in the hands of the pharmaceutical industry. They \nactually control prices in this country, and they control prices \nbecause of a piece of legislation that was passed a couple of decades \nago that prohibits the reimportation of prescription drugs, except by \nthe drug manufacturer itself. For that reason, unlike other countries, \ncitizens in our country are not able to routinely purchase an FDA-\napproved drug which is sold for a much less expensive price in other \ncountries.\n  There is an exception to that, which is the allowance for \nprescription drug reimportation for personal use by someone who \nactually travels personally across the border to Canada or Mexico and \npurchases the FDA-approved prescription drug. They are allowed to bring \na 90-day supply for personal use into our country. With the exception \nof that, a pharmacist from this country is not able to purchase from a \npharmacist in Canada, and a licensed distributor in this country is not \nable to purchase from a licensed distributor in Canada.\n  The fact is, that is an exception to what is happening in other parts \nof the world--Europe for over 20 years. If you are living in Germany \nand want to buy a prescription drug from Italy, no problem. You can do \nthat. If you are in Spain and want to buy a prescription drug from \nFrance, that is not a problem, either. It is called parallel trading. \nThose engaged in it in Europe have testified before Congress and \nindicated it has been going on for decades with no safety issues at \nall. Yet in this country, we have this artificial barrier that prevents \na pharmacist from Grand Forks, ND, from buying an FDA-approved drug \nsold by a pharmacist in Winnipeg, Canada. It makes no sense at all.\n  We were not able to pass this legislation because the pharmaceutical \nindustry has great influence here and with the Administration. As a \nresult, the legislation has been blocked.\n  Yesterday, Senator Olympia Snowe from Maine and I met with Majority \nLeader Frist and Senator Enzi. We indicated that we would be \nreintroducing our bipartisan legislation. Senator Snowe and myself, \nSenator McCain, Senator Kennedy, Senator Stabenow, and many other of \nour colleagues, will cosponsor the major bipartisan piece of \nlegislation dealing with the reimportation of prescription drugs.\n  We had a commitment yesterday that was expressed publicly last \nevening; that the bipartisan piece of legislation dealing with the \nreimportation of prescription drugs will have a hearing on its own \nmerit exclusively directed at that bill before the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee. I appreciate that very much. That is the \nfirst step in getting this kind of legislation passed through the \nCongress.\n  Our approach is to try to put downward pressure on prescription drug \nprices because we think it is unfair that the consumers in this country \npay the highest prices in the world.\n  With your consent, Mr. President, I will show two pill bottles--two, \nof a dozen, I could show. The bottles that I hold up today are bottles \nof Lipitor. As one can see, they are identical in color, identical in \nshape and size, and they contain an identical tablet. It is something \ncalled Lipitor for the reducing\n\n[[Page S541]]\n\ncholesterol. The medicine taken is one of the most popular medicines \nsold in this country taken to lower cholesterol levels in patients. It \nis sold in Canada and in the United States.\n  As you can see, the same pill is put in the same bottle, is made by \nthe same company, and is FDA-approved in both cases. The difference? \nPrice. The American consumer is charged $1.86 per tablet and the \nCanadian consumer, $1.10 per tablet. Why would one justify charging \nnearly double the price to the American consumer? What justifies that? \nThese pills are, in most cases, made in the same plants, put in the \nsame bottle, but shipped to two different places with two different \npricing schemes. In almost every case, the pricing scheme with medicine \nof this type is to price the brand-name prescription drug at a higher \nprice in the United States than exists in other countries. We think \nthat is unfair to the American consumer. We don't propose price \ncontrols. Rather, we suggest the American consumer have the same access \nto be able to purchase the FDA-approved medicine from other major, \nindustrialized nations with drug safety systems comparable to our own.\n  We recently had some testimony at a gathering here in the Congress \nthat I want to review for a moment. Dr. Peter Rost, who is a drug \nindustry executive, says:\n\n  The biggest argument against reimportation is safety. What everyone \nhas conveniently forgotten to tell you is that in Europe reimportation \nof drugs has been in place for 20 years--\n  And done safely.\n  Then he continues by saying the following:\n\n       During my time response for a region in northern Europe, I \n     never once--not once--heard the drug industry, regulatory \n     agencies, the government, or anyone else saying that this \n     practice is unsafe. And personally, I think it is outright \n     derogatory to claim that Americans would not be able to \n     handle reimportation of drugs, when the rest of the educated \n     world can do this.\n\n  This, from a drug industry executive. He obviously wasn't treated \nwell by the industry when he said this. But it took great courage for \nhim to say what is obvious to everyone. There is no safety issue. That \nis a specious argument by the pharmaceutical industry and those who \nsupport it to try to head off the Congress passing legislation that \nwould allow for the reimportation of prescription drugs.\n  The bipartisan group of legislators, Republicans and Democrats, who I \nand others have worked with, will introduce our legislation in the \ncoming days. We now have a commitment for a formal hearing on that \nlegislation. We will push for a vote on the floor of the Senate. I am \nconfident there are sufficient votes in the Senate to pass this \nlegislation. I do not think this legislation can continue to be blocked \nas it was in the last Congress.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to make this point during the discussion \nabout the nomination of Mr. Leavitt.\n  Mr. Leavitt is a person, as I said, of considerable talent. I am \nenormously pleased that he is assuming this role. He will understand, \nas I understand, that he is duty bound in his new role as Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to follow what the White House dictates on \nthis issue. The White House, at least at this point, is continuing to \noppose reimportation legislation. In fact, when Tommy Thompson and I \nput together a task force to study this issue, they issued a report at \nthe end of last year which could have been classified as ``recently \nincompetent humor''--this commission conceived in this report that \nthere was a safety issue. To show you how irresponsible it was to put \nthe task force together to reach a foregone conclusion that the \nAdministration previously held, they proposed that Dr. McClellan head \nthe group. He was the point person, who was the head of the FDA at the \ntime, who raised all the issues and was vigorously opposed to \nreimportation and raised those issues in a manner that would befit \nsomeone working for the pharmaceutical industry.\n  There was such a stink raised by Dr. McClellan to be selected to run \nthe task force that the Administration finally backed away and had \nsomeone else run the task force. But the task force did not take a \n``level look'' at what this was about. They came up and conducted the \nsafety issue.\n  There is no safety issue. Dr. Rost tells you; and I encourage any of \nmy colleagues who wish to know; go to Europe, or ask the Europeans to \ncome over here and testify. They will tell you they have been doing \nthis for years. The reimportation of drugs between countries has been \ndone routinely year after year without any safety issues at all. That \nis just a specious issue raised by those who want to support the \npharmaceutical industry and who don't want to support the interests of \nthe American consumers who should not be charged the highest prices in \nthe world for prescription drugs.\n  Let me conclude as I started. Mr. Leavitt will assume the job of \nSecretary of Health and Human Services. I am anxious to work with him. \nI look forward to working with him. I have great respect for him. My \nhope is that he can convince this Administration to change its policy \non reimportation.\n  This should not continue: The same pill put in the same bottle, made \nin the same plant, both approved by the FDA, should not be shipped to \ntwo places, one of which will impose upon the U.S. consumer the highest \nprices in the world. That is not fair to Americans, and this Congress \nought to have the courage and the backbone to stand up for the \ninterests of the American people on this important issue.\n  Within a matter of days, we will reintroduce our bipartisan piece of \nlegislation. Within 90 days, we will have a hearing and we intend in \nevery way possible to press this case on the floor of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor, and I yield the remainder of the time on this \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota yields the floor \nand yields back the remainder of the time on the Democratic side.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nnomination of Governor Mike Leavitt, who has been the Administrator of \nthe Environmental Protection Agency, to serve as our next Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services.\n  President Bush chose wisely when he nominated Governor Leavitt for \nthis important post. He is a strong leader and an able administrator \nand his record provides the proof for his ability to get results.\n  I have known Governor Leavitt for some time. We worked together far \nback in my public service career when he helped found the Western \nGovernors University. His service as Utah's Governor gives him a wealth \nof experience in the challenges of providing access to affordable \nhealth care. As a Governor of Utah, his state had a diverse mix of both \na very rural and a very urban population. Accordingly, he brings \ndiverse views on how to handle a wide variety of issues. As a \nwesterner, he also understands the particular health care problems that \naffect folks who live in those rural areas as well as the more rural \nfrontier areas.\n  His perspective will serve him well as Secretary. We have much work \nto do together with Governor Leavitt. We need to improve our health \ncare system and increase patient safety through better and more \nwidespread use of information technology. We need to ensure that the \nmedications we take are safe and effective. We need to redouble our \nefforts to protect our Nation from the present danger of bioterrorism. \nWe need to strengthen our health care safety net to protect the most \nvulnerable among us, and perhaps most importantly we need to do \neverything we can so that more affordable health insurance options are \navailable to working families and small businesses. That important task \nwill include making our medical liability system work better for \npatients and providers.\n  I am pleased that I will have the opportunity to work with Secretary \nLeavitt in my new capacity as chairman of the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions. My committee is looking forward to \nworking with Governor Leavitt to craft solutions to the health care \nchallenges we face as a nation. During his confirmation hearing, he \nagreed to informally sit down with Senator Kennedy and I and others who \nare interested to informally discuss some of these solutions.\n  I believe we will succeed in meeting the shared challenges because \nSecretary Leavitt has succeeded in every step he has taken in his \ncareer. More importantly, Secretary Leavitt has great appreciation of \nthe importance of the family, which is the cornerstone of\n\n[[Page S542]]\n\nour society and the basic building block of our communities. Governor \nLeavitt is both a good man and a strong leader. I look forward to \nworking with him on the health care issues that affect our families so \ndirectly.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to confirm Governor Leavitt as the next \nSecretary of Health and Human Services.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding the other side has yielded back \ntheir remaining time. Knowing no other Republican wishes to speak, I \nyield back the remainder of our time, as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming yields back the \nremainder of the time on the Republican side. All time having expired, \nunder the previous order, the Senate will proceed to a vote on the \nconfirmation of the nomination.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Michael O. Leavitt, of Utah, to be Secretary of Health and Human \nServices.\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President will be notified of the Senate's \naction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/26/senate-section/article/S542-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions is actively working in all four of those areas as \nspecified in the title of our committee as there are major initiatives \nthat need to be accomplished in each of those areas.\n  I have found that each Member who is working on an issue in any of \nthose four areas--and I am not just talking about members of the \ncommittee, I am talking Senators as a whole--believe their issue should \nbe the first issue to come up in the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions. As Chairman, I believe that we should work like \nthe National Institutes of Health; that is, those issues that stand the \nbest chance of making progress will get a higher priority. We will be \nworking in all of these four issue areas because they are immensely \ncritical to the people of the United States.\n  As a brand new Committee Chairman, I am asking all of my colleagues \nthat when a Member has an idea in the areas of health, education, \nlabor, or pensions, that you share it with me. I can bring the Member \nup to date on all of the people who need to work on that issue so I can \nget them involved. It would be most appreciated. In addition, it would \nallow us to work prime pieces of your bill into any committee bill that \ncomes out.\n  On a number of issues out there, there are multiple groups, and in \nmany cases, bipartisan groups, working on their own bill. The way we \nwill have to address those, of course, is to have the committee be the \nreferee on which sections of which bills get into the final bill. I can \nassure Members we will look most favorably on Members who have shared \nwith us in advance. If it is a matter of who is going to get the \ncredit, I don't care on that. I will help preserve credit for your \nidea.\n  It would be helpful for me as the new chairman to have some kind of \nan idea of what Members are working on and what the timeframe is. We \nwill let Members know how we are working on the same issue and our \ntimeframe for the issue.\n  I have four outstanding subcommittee chairmen, and they have already \nsat down, looked at a list of things they need to accomplish, and \ntogether we have set some priorities and have begun to put together \naction plans on each of those bills. I have met with Senator Kennedy to \ntake a look at the 20-plus bills that need to be reauthorized before \nSeptember 5. We are trying to organize those so that we can get as many \nof those completed as possible and to see where there is agreement; and \nwhere there is agreement, perhaps we can move them along faster \nallowing us the opportunity to concentrate on the other bills that need \nmore work.\n  I didn't say the ones which we are in opposition to--because I know \non most issues around here, if there is not agreement on the two \nconflicting ways to move a bill forward, there is often a third way \nthat can be derived. A lot of the time the way committees work, as we \nget involved in an issue, is if there is a section that people do not \nagree on, quite often we can have those Members interested in that \nsection go off for a little bit and hammer it out. Typically, they come \nback with the third way that they can agree upon. Quite often the \ncommittee agrees on it as well.\n  In committee, usually, we can get agreement on 80 percent of an \nissue. Generally, the 80 percent is what is passed through the \ncommittee if there is bipartisan support, if it appears to have \nbipartisan support. Unfortunately for the American public and \ntelevision, when people see us debate in the Senate it is on that other \n20 percent, the 20 percent we did not agree on in committee, and for \npolitical reasons may not agree on no matter how long the debate \ncontinues. When we vote, after all the amendments are tallied, quite \noften we go back to the 80 percent that came out of committee with \nbipartisan support.\n  I am suggesting to my colleagues that if we can go by an 80-percent \nrule, do the 80 percent we agree upon in committee, bring it to the \nSenate floor, and wrap it pretty quickly, then we can skip that other \n20 percent. Overall, we could get a lot more done around here. In \naddition, it would be more collegial and it would lead us to being able \nto get more things done on a bipartisan basis.\n  So we are going to be trying that in this committee and seeing how it \nworks. I hope it does not turn out to be the grand experiment that \nfailed. I hope it turns out to be a model for a way we can have a \nSenate that is more agreeable and working towards solutions for the \nAmerican people.\n  That is the approach we have taken on every issue that has been \nmentioned here today. We have already been working on action plans for \nthose things to see if there is a way we can come up with an 80-percent \npackage. If we can, we will move them along much faster than what \npeople expect. But it will take a lot of work and a lot of \nconcentration and, incidentally, quite a few hearings, too.\n  I have learned under Senator Graham and Senator Sarbanes and Senator \nShelby--those are all Banking Committee chairmen--that one of the ways \nto handle an issue is to try to get together everybody you can who is \nan expert on the particular area you are doing and draw on their \nknowledge--these are practitioners who have actually worked in the \ntrenches on the idea--and gather the information from them and see if \nthere is not, again, an 80-percent agreement.\n  There should not be a shortage of ideas in the United States. We are \nthe idea country. If we can find some way to simmer those down and put \nthem out as legislation, that helps people. That is what the HELP \nCommittee is all about.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and seeing what sorts of \nthings we can do to help health care in the United States so we can \nhave more accessible, lower cost, higher quality health care. As you \ncan tell from previous discussion, that covers a whole range of issues. \nThe Presiding Officer at the moment, of course, is interested in the \nassociated health plans, and so are a whole lot of other people in the \nChamber.\n  We have talked about drug reimportation. We have a bill in that comes \nout of a task force, Senate file 4. It comes out of a task force last \nyear that was led by Senator Gregg, who is my predecessor as chairman \nof this committee, a diligent, hard-working, knowledgeable task force \nleader who helped us put together about 15 bills that would do exactly \nwhat I talked about: increase access, reduce costs, help the quality. \nThose are included in a bill. It is not definitive, it is not the final \nanswer, but it is a starting point for us to go on this great debate.\n  In education, we are going to do an education piece that makes sure \npeople understand there are lifelong education\n\n[[Page S543]]\n\nopportunities, that school is never out, that learning never ends. We \nhave Head Start, which is preschool education. Of course, we have No \nChild Left Behind in our jurisdiction.\n  We are concerned about the number of high school dropouts there are \ntoday. We are also concerned about the Higher Education Act, which \nneeds to be reauthorized, and the Perkins Act, which provides funding. \nAll of those are things that need to be done. We have combined them in \nSenate file 9, with the Workforce Investment Act, which you will recall \ncame through this body 2 years ago. Two years ago, it came through. The \ncommittee passed it out by unanimous consent, and it passed this body \nunanimously. But I think partly because of the Presidential election \nyears, we were not allowed to have a conference committee. We were \nblocked from having a conference committee. That is an essential piece \nin making sure people have jobs.\n  I am fascinated that this generation that is in school now probably \nwill not have the kinds of jobs our parents had where they went to work \nat one place, they worked there their entire life, and they retired \nfrom there. The generation in school now is going to probably have 14 \ndifferent careers, and 10 of them have not even been invented yet. So \nthere is a tremendous challenge to having learning capability and \ncapacity and flexibility so this generation, this generation that is in \nschool right now, will be able to get the best jobs in the world, not \nthe best jobs in the United States, the best ones in the whole world so \nthat any job that happens to be outsourced is one of the low-skilled \njobs, one of the low-paying jobs, not the best of jobs. But that is a \nhuge challenge for us, and it is one we will be working on with a \nprimary objective to solve in the education portion of the committee.\n\n  In the labor portion of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, we want to make this a safer country for the workers. I put \nforward several recommendations for ways that can happen, ways we can \nprovide more help to small businesses so they can know the best way to \nkeep their employees safe rather than beaten over the head and fining \nthem after the fact. We need to have them do the prevention, not the \npenalties. There is some common ground there that we can work on.\n  Of course, in the area of pensions, this is a very interesting year \nbecause a lot of pensions need a lot of help. The Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation, which I have already met with, has a huge \nchallenge ahead of it to make sure people who have been putting into \npension plans wind up with a pension. We do not want to have a large \nGovernment bailout. We want to have the pensions operate the way they \nwere designed but with a backup so the worker does not get left behind. \nIt is a huge work area. I am looking forward to the task.\n  With cooperation from everybody in this body, we can have some great \nbipartisan efforts that will make a difference to every single person \nin this country.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming yields the floor.\n  We are in morning business.\n  Mr. ENZI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Further, I ask unanimous consent that I may be able to \nspeak in morning business for as such time as I may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today it is a real privilege for me to be \nable to report to my colleagues and the people of America on a \nmagnificent relief effort underway in Indonesia, where the December 26, \n2004, tsunami left over 115,000 confirmed deaths, with potentially tens \nof thousands more swept out to certain death in the sea, leaving no \nrecord of their disappearance, and hundreds of thousands of surviving \nvictims left in precarious positions, with inadequate water and food, \nfacing potentially life-threatening diseases.\n  On Saturday, January 15, a week ago this past Saturday, I walked \nthrough the primitive conditions in the mud, in the heat and humidity \nof Banda Aceh Airport to talk to the relief teams and the military \npersonnel, Asian and American, gathered in a common cause. Some of \nthese American troops are shown here in this picture. It was an \nextremely diverse group of individuals. They shared in the common beads \nof sweat dripping off the end of the nose from the oppressive climate. \nThey had a compelling commitment to relieve the tremendous suffering of \nthe people of Aceh and Northern Sumatra and a cooperative spirit that \nresolved questions and differences of opinion with speed and good \nhumor.\n  The U.S. Navy and Marine helicopter crews, which had flown 600 \nmissions delivering 2.3 million pounds of supplies to isolated \nlocations cut off by the tsunami-destroyed roads and bridges, mingled \nwith international relief agency personnel, personnel from other \ncountries, Navy volunteers from the USS Abraham Lincoln who joined with \nmarines from the Bonhomme Richard, loaded U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment rice and purified water from the carrier Lincoln onto the \nhelicopters.\n  The Indonesian military, through their Army, the TNI, provided \nsecurity for relief forces against potential kidnapping and harassment \nby the free-Aceh movement, known as GAM, which apparently and \nfortunately was more interested in ensuring that people did not forget \nabout them than in inflicting more casualties on the volunteers.\n  Navy fixed-wing pilots from the Lincoln, who were not that day flying \noff the carrier, came to work in oppressively hot tents to provide \nlogistics control and support. USAID workers, who were among the true \nheroes of the effort, organized food, water, and medical supplies as \ndirected by Indonesian government officials, to be put on helicopters \nor sometimes Marine hovercraft, VCACs, which could gain access to \nisolated regions along the shores, once the debris and human remains \nhad been removed from the shorelines.\n  Even though the main work of removing bodies of victims in Banda Aceh \nhad concluded days before, the State Department security official noted \nto me that each day debris from collapsed buildings was removed, a \ndozen or so body bags carried additional victims from beneath the \nrubble.\n  One of the first people who met me was Pierre King, the French leader \nof a unit from the International Organization of Migration, IOM, a \ncritically important group of workers who had been on the scene from \nthe beginning. He asked me to tell the American people that American \ntroop efforts and that of volunteers had been outstanding. This was the \ntheme heard time and time again from many different sources.\n  When I arrived at a concrete structure serving as the command center, \nIndonesia's coordinating minister in charge of relief efforts, Alwi \nShihab, an old friend who had visited me in Washington, DC a week \nbefore the tsunami, expressed the profound gratitude of the people of \nIndonesia for the great work the Americans had done. He expressed his \nhope that the U.S. troops would stay in the country until Indonesian \nresources could take over the immediate relief effort.\n  Later, the Indonesian Defense Minister, Juwono Sudarsono, told Deputy \nSecretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz that the United States had been the \nbackbone of the relief effort. Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and I later met \nwith Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, often referred to, \nfor obvious reasons, by his initials SBY. The President expressed his \ngratitude for the relief work of the United States military, and he \nsaid he hoped that Indonesia would be able to take over any further \nneeded relief work within 3 months and probably sooner.\n  This entire effort and the saving of untold lives was made possible \nby the outpouring of voluntary assistance as well as the work of troops \nassigned to the region.\n  In Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, later I learned that when the \nUnited\n\n[[Page S544]]\n\nStates began loading our C-130s with vital relief needs, our embassy \npersonnel, led by USAID workers, were joined by volunteers from the \nAmerican Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia, spouses of American \ndiplomats, and other American and international civilians living in the \narea who loaded the 20,000-pound pallets to be carried to Banda Aceh in \nthe C-130s. It is clear that without their efforts the scope of the \ntragedy of the tsunami itself could have been magnified many times by \nstarvation and disease, killing Indonesians in the impacted areas who \nhad survived the disastrous wall of water brought in by the tsunami.\n\n  Aid for severely injured victims in Indonesia was provided initially \nby United States naval doctors and corpsmen, and the most seriously \ninjured were transferred to high-level care facilities on shipboard. \nLater field hospitals were provided by other countries, including \nJordan, Spain, and France. The latter provided a 74-ton field hospital, \nwhich our heavy-lift Marine helicopters were able to transport to the \ndisaster scene. Most of the severe injuries had been cared for by the \ntime we arrived, and several of the field hospitals were preparing to \nreturn to their home countries because their mission had been \nfulfilled.\n  I was told that one Marine hovercraft had blown a portion of a pallet \ninto a resident, injuring him. He was treated by a Navy corpsman, taken \nhome by the Marines who were there unloading the hovercraft.\n  But the real challenge is to health, the lack of healthy water supply \nand sanitation, creating the danger of tetanus, typhoid, and other \ndisease. One of the Philippine nurses in the IOM tent proudly showed me \nthe tetanus, typhoid vaccines, and other medicines they were \nadministering to protect survivors from disease.\n  The need for clean water was addressed initially by U.S. Admiral Doug \nCrowder, commander of the Abraham Lincoln Strike Force deployed to the \nregion on an emergency basis. The carrier was able to generate 90,000 \ngallons of purified water, in addition to its needs each day, to be \ndelivered to the residents of the stricken region.\n  Also we saw in Jakarta USAID personnel prepared large water jugs with \nwater purification chemicals attached to them to enable purification of \nwater on the ground for residents whose water supply had been severely \ncompromised.\n  In addition to the volunteer efforts I described, great work was done \nby our allies in the region. We need to make special reference to them. \nSingapore supplied helicopters for relief efforts. Australia brought in \nC-130s for heavy lift, as did New Zealand. Other countries in the \nregion played valuable roles as well. Japan contributed. Thailand, \nwhich had over 5,000 deaths in its hotel and resort area of Phuket, was \nable to handle the disaster relief with its own forces and volunteers, \nnot calling on other countries for assistance.\n  In addition to dealing with the problem in his own country, Prime \nMinister Thaksin Shinawatra promptly offered the use of its airfield at \nUtapoah as a central U.S. staging point for airlift relief supplies \ngoing into northern Indonesia.\n  The Government of Malaysia, led by its newly elected Prime Minister \nAbdullah Badawi, acted quickly to clear all necessary flight access for \nrelief efforts and to permit our military aircraft to utilize vitally \nneeded airports for operations into Indonesia. After meeting with \ngovernment officials and volunteers on the ground on January 15, I \njoined our United States ambassador in Indonesia, R. Lynn Pascoe, and \nDeputy Secretary Wolfowitz on a helicopter tour of the devastated areas \nof northern Aceh.\n  During my time as Governor, I saw devastation of areas hit by floods \nand tornadoes. I thought I had seen the worst. In addition, all of us \nin America who watched television saw stark pictures of the floods, the \ndestruction, what was left after the tsunami struck. But what I saw \nfrom the helicopter was beyond anything I had ever seen before in both \nits extent and magnitude. The extent and magnitude were nothing short \nof cataclysmic. We saw from the air broad reaches of low-lying portions \nof what had obviously been a reasonably prosperous Asian community \nturned into piles of large matchsticks with buildings torn completely \noff their foundations. Remnants of fishing vessels perched hazardously \nagainst remnants of structures hundreds and hundreds of yards from \nshore. Small fires were burning where surviving residents were cleaning \nup debris and burning the trash.\n  As we flew down the shoreline for a short way, we saw the sides of \ncliffs carved out where the tsunami wave had bulldozed huge sections of \nthe cliffs. This slide from a helicopter window shows the new cliffs \nwhich have been carved out by the floodwaters as they hit in those \nareas. The only trees left standing were very young pine trees which \napparently were slender and supple enough to avoid being broken off by \nthe tsunami. Small towns along the way were identifiable only by \nfoundations of buildings which may have been businesses, farms, or \nhomes, but otherwise totally unrecognizable. In some areas, bridges \nwere wiped out and in other areas the highways near the shore were \ncovered in large expanses of sand. It was obvious that fields which had \nbeen cultivated were likely turned into barren salt and sand \nwastelands.\n  In addition to the large swath of devastation cut across Banda Atjeh, \nthe devastation continued on to the horizon along the shore where the \ntsunami had wiped out manmade and even natural structures.\n  Later, I learned that the Navy operations to bring in relief had to \nawait remapping of the shoreline because even the underwater structures \nhad been so changed by the tsunami that the navigation charts were \nunreliable. From the helicopter, we obviously just had this bird's-eye \nview. But from the relief workers and news reports in the area, we \ngained a much more detailed understanding of what had transpired.\n  In the January 15 edition of the International Herald Tribune, it was \nreported that the seashore town of Calang, with 7,300 people, had been \nleft after the tsunami with nothing other than the skeleton of one \nhouse of a wealthy resident. There were no signs of shops, houses, \nrestaurants, or a mosque which had been there. Of the 7,300 people \nthought to live in the town, 323 bodies were found, and 5,627 residents \nwere listed as missing--more than 80 percent of the community. We could \nonly assume that they and thousands of others in isolated regions were \nswept out to sea. The total loss of life may never be known.\n  The IHT reported news of similar devastation along a coastal region \nwhere villages were flattened, leaving no roads, bridges, ports, or \nairstrips. It was reported that one swampy area had approximately 100 \nfloating bodies, and nobody had been able to gain access to remove and \nbury the dead.\n  In a subsequent report on January 18, IHT noted that the Red Cross \nhad given up attempting to compile a list of those missing, and decided \nto pursue what tragically was a much smaller listing of those who \nsurvived. It was a publication called simply ``I Am Alive.'' The news \nstory recorded a heartwarming and touching account of an 18-year-old \nboy who was able to find his 8-year-old brother who had been torn out \nof his arms in the waves. But the number of reunions had been \ntragically small, with only one or two other reunions recorded.\n  Before I visited Banda Aceh, I had read and was concerned about \nreports indicating that the response to the tsunami had been slow. But \nas I learned more about the nature of the devastation, I gained a \nbetter understanding of why it was slow. Apparently, there had been a \nmajor sports celebration in Banda Aceh when the tsunami struck, and \nmost of the town's leaders were in the low-lying areas as were a large \nnumber of the TNI military and its leaders, and most of the \ncommunication facilities in Banda Aceh. These were all washed away--the \ncitizens, the leaders, the local officials, and the communications \nfacilities. It was many hours before aircraft flights over the area \ncould discover the extent of the destruction.\n  Despite the uncertainty and despite a lack of knowledge of the exact \nnature of the destruction, initial reports of the tsunami brought \nimmediate proactive reactions from a lot of U.S. leadership--ADM Thomas \nFargo, our Pacific military commander, and our Ambassador to Indonesia, \nR. Lynn Pascoe, as well as organizations like the American Red Cross, \nthe International Organization for Migration, and the Governments of \nSingapore, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\n[[Page S545]]\n\n  Ambassador Pascoe immediately made available $100,000 to the \nInternational Red Cross to purchase badly needed supplies and \nmedication. He also tasked the IOM to mobilize truck convoys which \nenabled land relief with 80 trucks to reach Banda Aceh within some 5 \ndays after the tsunami. Admiral Fargo's proactive order to turn the USS \nAbraham Lincoln around to the straits of Aceh, cancel shore leave and \nmove it from Hong Kong to the straits of Aceh, brought in helicopter \nrelief to isolated areas 6 days after the tragedy.\n\n  It is obvious that this is a natural tragedy of historic proportions. \nThe loss of life has truly been staggering, but the displaced and \nendangered people in the region are even a far larger number. Our \nrelief efforts for the immediate needs have been generous and prompt, \nbut there will be much more work to be done.\n  Now, several misinterpretations of our efforts in Indonesia have \nappeared in the press and I need to address that. Many people \ninterpreted the remarks of the Indonesian Vice President as ordering \nAmerican forces out of Indonesia by March 26. In fact, our Ambassador \nand military officials agreed with the Indonesian Government that our \ntroops--diverted to the country from scheduled and needed rest and \nrelaxation--would stay only as long as absolutely needed and wanted by \nthe country's government. All parties knew that the time of our troops' \ncommitment would be, at the most, no more than 3 months. I believe the \nVice President's announcement of departure by March 26 was a prediction \nof the schedule, not an ultimatum.\n  Our mission in Indonesia was well described by Marine GEN Christian \nCowdrey who, as commander of the Combined Support Group, told the \nIndonesians, ``We are here to support your efforts, at your direction, \nwhere you need it.'' He made it clear that we intended to stay as long \nas the Government of Indonesia requested our assistance, and as soon as \nour assistance was no longer required, he would return to the home base \nand station. There were 8,000 marines and sailors assisting in the \nrelief effort, and the majority of them were based on ships to limit \nthe number of people on shore who needed to be supplied.\n  The short-term nature of our commitment was reinforced by an \nannouncement by Admiral Fargo this past Friday that withdrawal of the \ntroops would begin immediately, transferring relief operations to host \nnations and international organizations. He predicted that all 15,000 \nU.S. troops would be withdrawn within 60 days--well short of the \npredicted maximum of March 26--as the mission in Indonesia moved from \nthe immediate relief phase to rehabilitation and reconstruction.\n  Another press report suggested Indonesia had demanded that our \naircraft carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln, leave its waters. This \nreport seemingly was based on sightings of the Lincoln heading to open \nwaters.\n  Well, I had the opportunity to ask ADM Doug Crowder, commander of the \nLincoln Strike Force, about this report. He shook his head and smiled \nin dismay. He told me that he routinely had to conduct flight \noperations to keep his fixed-wing pilots current. He does not conduct \nthese operations near shore and routinely goes out to blue water, 50 to \n60 miles offshore. Even if he is in San Diego, he doesn't fly fixed \nwing off of his carrier on shore; he goes out to sea by that distance \nto blue water.\n  In Indonesia, his practice had been to send off his helicopters with \nsupplies and shore volunteers in the morning, located near shore. He \nthen would move the carrier to blue water for fixed-wing flights and \nreturn in the evening to retrieve his choppers and personnel for \novernight.\n  Another story indicated that the U.S. Marines were prohibited from \ncarrying any weapons while they were on Indonesian soil. As a father of \na marine, this troubled me. I thought, are we sending marines in \nwithout protection? I inquired of Marine General Cowdrey if his troops \nwere unprotected. He assured me that while marines engaged in \nhumanitarian operations normally did not carry M-16 rifles, he never \ndeployed his marines without adequate force and personal protection.\n  Another thing the relief operations did was to bring into stark \nreality the unintended consequences of congressional restrictions \nplaced on our assistance to Indonesia. This was done supposedly to deal \nwith human rights abuses by the TNI--the Indonesian military--during \nthe times of authoritarian rule in that country through the aftermath \nof the East Timor referendum. Those restrictions were first imposed in \n1991 and have been tightened since.\n  I have opposed continuation of these sanctions since Indonesia has \nchosen new leaders democratically, most recently this fall's 2004 \nelection of President Yudhoyono; and the new leadership made a strong \ncommitment to reform, to a recognition of human rights, and to fighting \ncorruption. President Yudhoyono has shown he is a reformer; his \npermitting U.S. soldiers in Indonesia was opposed by hardliners in his \nParliament. I believe we need to support him and his reform efforts, \nrather than strengthen the hand of anti-U.S. forces in his country. The \nmain focus of the sanctions was to prohibit Indonesian participation in \nthe International Military Education and Training Program, or the IMET \nProgram, run by our military for our own officers and forces from \nfriendly nations.\n  IMET provides training in modern military operations, including \nadherence to the Code of Military Justice, civilian control of the \nmilitary, respect for human rights, and proper treatment of civilian \npopulations--precisely by the principles that should be instilled in \nmilitary forces thought to have been involved in human rights abuses in \nthe past.\n  The major benefits of the program, however, are establishing \nrelationships among our military leaders and commanders of friendly \nforeign forces to assure they understand how to conduct military or \nrelief operations together.\n  This principle is known as interoperability. The foreign officers \nlearn English language skills so our allied officers can communicate. \nThe failure to have such training in Indonesia almost resulted in a \ntragic midair collision of U.S. aircraft with a TNI helicopter \noperation.\n  Our military leaders, Secretary Don Rumsfeld, Deputy Secretary Paul \nWolfowitz, and our Secretary of State, Colin Powell, have told me \npersonally how important these IMET programs are and how important it \nis not to deny them to Indonesia. If our forces are to participate in \nmilitary or relief operations with those of friendly nations, we must \ntrain together.\n  Also, as a result of U.S. policy, Indonesia was denied the ability to \npurchase necessary spare parts for its C-130 fleet, rendering its fleet \nof 24 planes largely inoperable. Had the Indonesian C-130s been \navailable, relief and aid would have flowed much sooner and in greater \nquantity to Aceh. When Secretary of State Colin Powell learned about \nthe limitation, he immediately responded by issuing a waiver to bring \nfunding for spare parts and the parts themselves to Indonesia.\n  Beginning this past week, American and Indonesian mechanics began the \ninstallation of the spare parts, and soon more of the fleet should be \nready for flight operations.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and the administration \nto reverse these unnecessarily restrictive policies at the earliest \nopportunity.\n  I might also say it has been disheartening to read some press \naccounts that have attributed the U.S. response as a shallow move to \nwin better public relations in Islamic countries. Some of this \nnonsense, regrettably, appeared in American publications.\n  America is and always has been and always will be a force for social \njustice and humanitarian relief. It is notable that we are not \nchallenged when we provide assistance for AIDS victims in Africa or \nelsewhere around the world, and I hope people will understand the \ngenuine outpouring of American concern in this instance.\n  At churches in Washington, DC, and in my hometown of Mexico, MO, as \nwell as in comments and discussions with many Americans here and at \nhome, I have heard nothing but genuine expressions of great concern, \nsympathy, and willingness to assist. Voluntary charitable contributions \nof individuals, corporations, and other organizations have been to date \noverwhelming.\n  When I was in Kansas City and St. Louis on Monday of this week, I \nheard that the American Red Cross is seeking to raise $400 million, \nwhich is greater than the $350 million pledged by the\n\n[[Page S546]]\n\nU.S. Government for assistance. I believe the figures, when you take in \nthe amount provided by many different avenues through matching grant \nprograms from employers, corporations, to their employees, the number \nof dollars going voluntarily will significantly exceed the initial \ncommitment of the U.S. Government aid.\n  I might also add that the U.S. Government spends $5 million to $6 \nmillion a day in addition to that just operating its carriers in \nIndonesia.\n  As far as expressions of aid and commitment and compassion, I can \ntell you the marines and soldiers laboring in the oppressive heat of \nAceh to put rice and clean water on helicopters to deliver to suffering \npeople were not doing it to gain better public relations for the United \nStates. Neither were the USAID or the charitable organization workers \nwho had to overcome tremendous obstacles to bring relief to people in \nisolated areas of Aceh and northern Sumatra. They were not worrying \nabout anything more than coming to the aid of suffering human beings.\n\n  With respect to the grievances of the Free Aceh Movement, President \nYudhoyono, in his previous position in the Megawati administration, had \nbegun negotiations with leaders in the region, but these negotiations \nwere called off by then-President Megawati.\n  Prior to the disaster, negotiations had been started by the Yudhoyono \nadministration, and it is my understanding these negotiations are \ncontinuing in Sweden currently. President Yudhoyono appealed to the \nfree Aceh rebels to respect the humanitarian weapons and disavow use of \narms.\n  Minister Shihab told me they had gone further and sent the message \nthat his government wanted not just a cease-fire but a reconciliation. \nPresident Yudhoyono even met with Western diplomats to discuss ideas \nfor finding a solution. Aceh is a rich region that has many resources, \nas well as a long tradition of antipathy toward Jakarta. But with the \nproper spirit on both sides, I have hopes that coming out of this \ntragedy in Aceh can arise a negotiated settlement that will recognize \nand respect the culture, views, and wishes of the Acehanese and keep \nthem in the country of Indonesia.\n  It is also my hope that the immediate emergency relief effort that \nwill come to a close soon will not signal the end of American interest \nand commitment to the region. Truly, I hope that the attention that has \nbeen brought by the very extensive media coverage of the tsunami will \nkeep more attention in this body and the American public at large on \nthe importance of good relations with the people in Southeast Asia.\n  There is much more that needs to be done over the long term to meet \nwhat I view as an exciting but challenging relationship in Southeast \nAsia. I will be addressing in the future the extent and the importance \nof this challenge in Southeast Asia, how it has importance--not just \nfor the humanitarian interests which I described today but for \npolitical, economic, strategic, and national security concerns.\n  The tragedy of the tsunami has brought an unparalleled opportunity to \ninvite more Americans to pay attention to an area of the world where we \nhave vital interests. I hope when the tsunami relief efforts have \npassed, our friends and neighbors will keep in mind the need to \nstrengthen our relationships in a very critical area of the world.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are in the very early days of this \n109th Congress, and one of the items we are all working at is \nidentifying what the agenda should be for this Congress, for this \ncountry, and what issues should be given priority and attention, and \nwhat issues should be given priority in our funding.\n  Along those lines, we have tried to introduce some bills early in the \nCongress to highlight priority concerns and priority issues for \nconsideration by our colleagues, by the country as a whole, and by the \nadministration. One of those bills is S. 15. This is a bill that I \nintroduced along with Senator Reid and many other cosponsors on the \nDemocratic side. It is called the Quality Education For All Act of \n2005. This legislation represents a major step forward in advancing \neducational opportunities for millions of students around the country.\n  There is no question that we have made progress in recent years in \nadvancing educational opportunity, but we still have very far to go. We \nneed to look at ways to increase that opportunity and also to improve \nthe quality of education in a meaningful and comprehensive manner.\n  This bill is about making sure that we are doing all we can in the \n109th Congress to increase and improve educational opportunities for \nthree different parts of our educational system. The obvious three are: \nEarly childhood education; second, the education of people from \nkindergarten through the 12th grade; and third, higher education. Those \nare the three areas I want to briefly discuss today.\n  Beginning with early education, the foundation for learning begins \nvery early in life. Early education provides critical opportunities to \npromote children's physical, cognitive, social, and emotional \ndevelopment.\n  We know that quality early education improves school readiness and \nfosters greater academic achievement and motivation in later years. \nParticularly this is true for children from low-income families.\n  Early education also provides a great return on our investment. The \nbenefits include lower rates of grade retention, placement in special \neducation, and juvenile delinquency, and higher rates of educational \nattainment and skilled employment.\n  These positive outcomes for children are not a guarantee when access \nto quality education is limited, and unfortunately lack of funding has \nlimited access to quality early childhood education in our country.\n  To illustrate what I am talking about, I will refer to New Mexico, my \nhome State. There are approximately 28,000 children under age 5 in New \nMexico living in poverty who are eligible, by virtue of the income \nlevel of their families, for Head Start services, but due to inadequate \nfunding of Head Start, New Mexico can only provide services for around \n7,600 of those 28,000 children. An additional $186 million is required \njust to serve the other 20,000 or so eligible New Mexico children. This \nis without making any quality improvements, just expanding the services \nwe are currently providing to the 7,600 to another 20,000.\n  My colleagues and I believe we need to increase access to early \neducation. We need to strengthen the quality of those programs as well. \nThe first thing this bill does is expand access to early Head Start for \nour youngest children. It also increases access to Head Start for \nchildren and families living at 130 percent of the poverty line. The \ncurrent law says if a person's family income exceeds 100 percent of the \npoverty line, they are not eligible to have their children participate. \nWe would like to see that increased to 130 percent. Too frequently the \nworking poor are left out of these types of programs in that they are \nnot poor enough, but clearly these same families do not have the \nresources to provide quality early education to their children.\n  The bill also seeks to strengthen the quality of these early \neducation programs by making significant improvements to the quality of \nthe teaching workforce. We provide grants to States to attract and \nretain highly qualified teachers, including grants to tribal colleges \nand universities to increase the number of postsecondary degrees earned \nby Indian Head Start staff. Plus, the quality set-aside in childcare \nwill be increased from 4 percent up to 6 percent. With access to \nquality early education, children can enter school ready to learn, and \nthat is in everyone's interest.\n  I will move on to the issue of educating our children from \nkindergarten through grade 12. The main legislation that we have passed \nat the Federal level related to this, of course, is the No Child Left \nBehind bill. It is intended to deal with this problem. Unfortunately, \nwe cannot expect States\n\n[[Page S547]]\n\nto meet the challenges of the No Child Left Behind Act without \nproviding sufficient resources and guidance to them in how to do that.\n  The administration assured us that we would be able to fully fund the \nNo Child Left Behind bill when it was enacted. The program in the \ncurrent fiscal year is underfunded by about $7 billion. There are more \nthan 2.5 million fewer children who are being served through that law \nthan the law promised to serve. In this legislation I have introduced, \nwe provide that the No Child Left Behind bill should be fully funded.\n\n  This issue is becoming critical for our schools for the simple reason \nthat we are now in our third year after the enactment of No Child Left \nBehind, and there are a number of schools that are failing to meet the \ncriteria set out in that law that has to be met, the adequate yearly \nprogress number. They have failed to meet that AYP, adequate yearly \nprogress number, for 2 years in a row. They are in a position now that \nsanctions will be applied to them for failing to do so.\n  At this point, Federal resources to help them avoid those sanctions \nare absolutely critical, and we give this a very high priority in our \nlegislation.\n  The bill makes a number of changes to the law to ensure that the No \nChild Left Behind bill is implemented in the manner that Congress \nintended. It would give schools the option of recalculating their AYP \nscores from last year and do so by applying the administration's newly \nissued rules. This would save thousands of schools from inappropriate \nsanctions that were caused by the delay in publishing the rules that \nare called for in that act.\n  There is a particular provision in our legislation that I know \nSenator Reid from Nevada feels very strongly about, as do many of us, \nand that is a provision to assist rural school districts with the \nresources they need to have good schoolbus transportation for all their \nstudents. There are many school districts in this country where the \nschoolbuses are antiquated, where they need to be replaced and \nmodernized, and we provide some assistance to those school districts \nunder this legislation to do that very thing. We call for full funding \nof the No Child Left Behind bill. We call for full funding of IDEA.\n  In the final area I wanted to talk about we call for greater access \nto higher education for all of our students. It is clear that we have \nmany people who would like to be in college, many students who would \nlike to continue with their college education but because of the \ninability to pay, they are not proceeding with that education. The \nestimate we have is that there are 180,000 of our young people in this \ncountry who are not going to college, to a university, because of their \ninability to pay.\n  This is a time when we are worried about too much of the work being \ndone overseas that needs to be done to support our economy. We are \nworried about outsourcing. We are worried about the immigration of \npeople into this country to take good-paying jobs. The reality is, if \nwe do not educate and train our own young people to take these jobs \nthat outsourcing will continue and will grow over time. So it is very \nimportant that we increase resources for higher education.\n  We are requesting additional Pell grant funds so more students can \nreceive Pell grants. We also need to ensure that students who graduate \nfrom high school are ready to go to college, and we have funds for the \nTRIO Program and the GEAR UP program as well.\n  There are various provisions in this legislation, some of which were \nincluded in legislation introduced in the previous Congress. The truth \nis, we are trying as a Congress in these early weeks to determine what \nis going to be given priority, what will we, in fact, decide to fund, \nand what will we decide to neglect.\n  A week from this coming Monday the President will present to the \nCongress his recommended budget for the year. I hope very much that the \ncommitment we are advocating in this legislation for educational \nfunding, for increased access to education, and for improved quality of \neducation, that that same priority will be reflected in the \nadministration's budget we receive on February 7.\n  I do believe this is an important issue. It is one that has not been \ntalked about a great deal in the last weeks and months. We hear the \nadministration's agenda of what they want to get done in this \nCongress--with regard to privatizing Social Security, with regard to \nreforming the Tax Code, with regard to prosecuting the war in Iraq. \nThere is not always much mention of education as a continuing priority. \nOur legislation tries to correct that. Our legislation tries to ensure \nthat education is a continuing priority.\n  I commend it to the consideration of all of our colleagues, and I \nhope very much we will have a chance to enact many of the parts of this \nlegislation as we proceed through the 109th Congress.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this morning's Washington Post contains a \nstory about yet another case of the Bush administration apparently \nusing taxpayer dollars to try to buy favorable news coverage of their \nmost controversial proposals.\n  In a column she wrote for the National Review Online, the \nconservative columnist Maggie Gallagher wrote that the administration's \nmarriage initiative could ``carry big payoffs down the road for \ntaxpayers and children.'' In fact, the big payoff so far appears to be \nto Ms. Gallagher herself.\n  According to the Washington Post, Miss Gallagher received $21,500 \nfrom the Federal Department of Health and Human Services in the year \n2002 to promote the Bush administration's marriage initiative. She \nreceived an additional $20,000 from the administration for writing a \nreport entitled ``Can Government Strengthen Marriage?''\n  Last year, Miss Gallagher defended the administration's proposal for \na Federal constitutional amendment banning gay marriage in her columns, \ninterviews, and television appearances. She also testified in favor of \nsuch an amendment before the Senate Judiciary Committee. I have her \ntestimony.\n  I have attended many meetings of the Senate Judiciary Committee. It \nappears we will now need to ask each witness who apparently comes from \nthe outside whether they are on the inside. Miss Gallagher was on the \ninside. She was such an insider that she was paid handsomely by some in \nthe administration for her ``objective'' views on administration \npolicies.\n  This is the third time in less than a month we have heard allegations \nof political payola by the Bush administration. It troubles me. I can \nrecall recently being on FOX--I know you are surprised if you follow \nthe newscast to know that I would go on FOX, but occasionally I think \nit is good for them to meet a Democrat--I went on Chris Wallace's \nSunday show. We were joking ahead of time about Armstrong Williams. I \nsaid: Chris, before you ask me any questions on FOX, I have to ask you, \nAre you being paid by the administration to ask these questions? We \nlaughed about it. But there is nothing funny when we hear about Miss \nGallagher and Armstrong Williams. We learned the Federal Department of \nEducation paid well-known conservative commentator Armstrong Williams--\nget this--$240,000 to promote the administration's No Child Left Behind \nAct in television and radio appearances. Picture this. We come to the \nSenate lamenting the fact the administration does not have enough money \nto send to our schools to help failing children do better on tests and \nimprove their education.\n  The administration says: We can't afford this; we do not have the \nmoney to help children in school. But they found almost a quarter of a \nmillion dollars\n\n[[Page S548]]\n\nfor Mr. Armstrong Williams to tout their program and do so in a way \nthat was deceiving.\n  Mr. Williams, an African American, was hired by the Education \nDepartment to promote the law on his nationally syndicated television \nshow to urge other Black journalists to do the same. As part of the \nagreement, Williams was required to regularly comment on No Child Left \nBehind during the course of his broadcast, and to interview with \nSecretary Rod Paige from the Department of Education for TV and radio \nreports that aired on the show during 2004.\n  We learned earlier this month from the New York Times that the Bush \nadministration is planning a new propaganda campaign. According to the \nNew York Times, the Social Security Administration is gearing up for a \nmarketing campaign to sell the false claim that Social Security faces \ndire financial problems requiring immediate action. The new campaign \nwould support the administration's highly controversial desire to \npartially privatize Social Security.\n  There used to be a time when our Government would let the facts speak \nfor themselves. It apparently is the position of the Bush \nadministration that the facts in and of themselves are not articulate; \nyou need to have people to articulate the point of view to put the \nappropriate political spin on that point of view so the public can \nunderstand the gravity of the issue.\n\n  The American people get this and they understand it. They know the \nsky is not falling when it comes to Social Security. They know, as we \nhave proven time and time again, left untouched, without a single \nchange, no revision in the law, Social Security as a program will make \nevery payment it has promised to make, with a cost-of-living adjustment \nevery single year to every Social Security recipient, and it will do so \nuntil 2042, by one estimate, or 2052 by another, 37 years of solvency \nin the Social Security system.\n  The President today said we want permanent solvency in the Social \nSecurity system. Wouldn't it be great if we could say that? The \nPresident cannot even promise that next year his budget deficit \nprojection is going to be accurate. He wants us to say 47, 57, 87 years \nfrom now Social Security will never have a problem. We cannot do that. \nWe do not know what is going to befall this Nation.\n  Who would have known in the early 1950s about a birth control pill? \nWho would have known about the advances in medicine in the 1960s? Who \nwould have known that we were going to enact Medicare so seniors would \nlive longer? Who would have known that we were going to have \ndemographic changes in America reflecting immigration to this country?\n  We do not know those answers. We speculate and try to make our best \nguess as to where Social Security will be. If the President wants us to \nstand here and say with a straight face that we have guaranteed \npermanent solvency for the Social Security system, it can never be \ndone. Neither can he predict with any certainty, as he has proven, what \nhis own budget deficit will be a year or 2 years from now.\n  Now they start the propaganda campaign through the Social Security \nAdministration which is supposed to line up the ad agencies to convince \nthe American people the sky is falling on Social Security and the only \ncure is to take money out of the Social Security system, cut Social \nSecurity benefits, and increase the deficit in America by $2 trillion \nin the first 10 years. This retirement roulette which this \nadministration is pushing says to retirees that they should take money \nout of Social Security and play the stock market.\n  Make no mistake, many Americans, including my family, invest in \nmutual funds and in the stock market. We are doing OK. We have good \nyears and bad years. There is no guarantee. As they say over and over \non their ads, last year's performance is not a predictor of what next \nyear's performance will be. There is uncertainty and risk.\n  If we take money out of Social Security to play retirement roulette \nin the stock market, we leave retirees vulnerable. Assume for a second \nwe figure out how to pay for it, which the President has not, but if \nthe retirees guess wrong, what will happen? What if today's retiree \nreceiving $1,200 a month from Social Security receives only $600 a \nmonth? How do they survive? If they are lucky they have savings and \nmaybe a family to support them. But if they are not, where do they \nturn? They turn back to the government. They say to the government: We \nguessed wrong. We invested wrong.\n  That is what the President thinks is the way to assure the American \npeople of the solvency and reliability of Social Security.\n\n  It appears he is not doing very well convincing Members of Congress \nof either political party. So they have decided they need the Social \nSecurity Administration to come up with a technical plan. This chart, \nwhich will be difficult if not impossible to read by those following \nthis on television, lays out the objectives of the Bush \nadministration's marketing tactical plan in the Kansas City region when \nit comes to the current Social Security system. The American people are \nnot buying the President's message. He hires an advertising firm, a \nmarketing firm, to try to convince them that what he says is true. The \nfacts, obviously, cannot speak for themselves. This marketing firm has \nto convince the American people of the ability of the Social Security \nProgram to pay promised benefits to current and future beneficiaries. \nThe message is, necessary reforms must take place. We must address \nlong-term solvency now. The sooner the changes are made, the more time \npeople will have to adjust.\n  On and on. Staff meetings. Tactics. How to measure their success. And \nbudget.\n  The Social Security Administration is no longer in the business of \njust telling the facts. The Social Security Administration is now in \nthe spin business. It is supposed to color the facts, to change the \nstory, convince the American people of something they are not \nbelieving.\n  My office, having obtained that, understands this is not accurate. \nWhat I have described is simply propaganda.\n  According to the Social Security Administration's own official \nnumbers, the trust fund is not only solvent but running a surplus. I \nknow that to be a fact because I happened to have served in Congress \nwhen we made a conscious bipartisan decision in the middle 1980s. \nPresident Ronald Reagan--no question about his Republican credentials--\nwent to Tip O'Neill, the leading Democrat in Congress, and said: Mr. \nSpeaker, we need to get together. Baby boomers are coming and we need \nto be prepared. And changes were made, bipartisan changes were \nmade. And we bought solvency and longevity for Social Security.\n\n  We did this in the mid-1980s, and our work then guaranteed that \nSocial Security could make its payments for 57 years. That was a heavy \nlift, but we did it, and we did it in a responsible, bipartisan \nfashion. We understand that.\n  There is enough money in the Social Security trust fund to pay every \npenny until 2042, and even after that, if we did nothing, to make 73 \npercent of the projected payments if we make no change in Social \nSecurity.\n  Now, I personally believe we should make some changes, but \nresponsible, bipartisan changes. We can make commonsense changes in \nSocial Security that can give it an even longer life.\n  When I have asked the people in Illinois, what do you think we ought \nto do about Social Security, do you know what they say overwhelmingly? \nWhy doesn't the Federal Government pay back into the Social Security \ntrust fund all the money it took out? Good question. Frankly, we were \non a course to do that. When President Clinton left office 5 years ago, \nwe were running a surplus, and with that surplus we were retiring the \ndebt of the Social Security trust fund, paying back what the Government \nhad borrowed from it and giving even longer life to Social Security.\n  Well, in came the brave, new world of the Bush administration with a \nnew economic policy. They said: If we have a surplus, then clearly that \nmeans we need a tax cut. The Government ought to give back the money it \nhas in surplus in Washington, ignoring the obvious, that we still had \nthe deficits in the Social Security trust fund that needed to be \naddressed.\n  So President Bush successfully pushed through a tax cut, primarily \nfor the wealthiest people in America, and we stopped retiring the debt \nof the Social Security trust fund. We not only\n\n[[Page S549]]\n\nturned that corner from surplus, we went into deficit, facing the \ndeepest deficits in the history of the United States under the Bush \nPresidency. We never had larger deficits. And how do you finance a \ndeficit? You borrow the money from the Social Security trust fund, \nmaking it even more precarious, more uncertain.\n  We had a plan for making Social Security strong. It was called a \nsurplus, buying down the debt of the Social Security trust fund. The \nBush administration destroyed that plan with tax cuts, with a weak \neconomy, and with the war which is very costly not just in human terms \nbut in terms of tax dollars.\n  So how do we keep Social Security solvent now facing the reality of \nBush economics? Well, I think, first, we look at the obvious and we \nspeak truth to the American people. Social Security is not in crisis. \nIt is challenged beyond the year 2042. We need to do the right thing to \nmake certain we meet those challenges. We do not want to misuse the \nresources of this program or its employees in the Social Security \nAdministration to try to manufacture a crisis. That would be wrong, \nwrong to the American people.\n  If we cannot start the discussion on Social Security with an \nagreement on facts, if we cannot start with a bipartisan approach that \ntries to find solutions, as President Reagan and Speaker Tip O'Neill \ndid, we are not likely to have success.\n  The Social Security Administration's ``tactical plan'' states that \nthe agency will ``insert solvency messages in all Social Security \npublications; place articles on solvency in external publications''--\nthe list goes on and on. This is going to be a press release mill to \ntry to gin up a crisis. Instead of objective information, we are to \nreceive from the Social Security Administration the political spin, the \nbest possible spin on the President's Social Security proposal.\n\n  There are several propaganda tactics, all of which are evident in \nthis Social Security Administration plan.\n  Appeal to fear--``In 2042,'' they say, ``the Trust Funds will be \nexhausted.'' That is not true. The trust funds will be able to make 73 \npercent of all payments after 2042 if we do nothing. And I have not met \nanybody who says we should do nothing.\n  Appeal to authority--``The President has said that reform is easier \nto implement if done far in advance.'' You cannot quarrel with that \npremise. What we did in the mid-1980s bought us over 50 years of \nsolvency. What we do in 2005 can buy us even further longevity and \npermanency in Social Security.\n  Then: Glittering generalities. Here is one that is used in the Social \nSecurity Administration propaganda plan: ``Longer, healthier lives mean \nchange is needed in long-term Social Security financing.'' Well, you \ncannot argue with that. If people are going to live longer, people are \ngoing to have to pay out more. But let's be honest about how much we \nare going to pay out.\n  Then: The bandwagon effect they are trying to create: ``On December \n21, 2001, the President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security \nissued its report [according to this tactical plan], which outlined \nthree alternative models for Social Security reform.''\n  What the talking points the Social Security Administration wants to \nshare with the American people fail to mention is that President Bush \ncharged the Commission with finding a way to make privatizing Social \nSecurity work. This Commission was not given a blank slate. They were \ntold what their goal was: Get in that room and don't come out until you \nhave justified privatizing Social Security.\n  Also missing from the plan is any mention of a crucial fact: By \ndiverting $1 or $2 trillion--with a ``T,'' trillion--away from Social \nSecurity and into private investment accounts, risky investment \naccounts, just in the first decade, the administration's privatization \nplan would actually make Social Security weaker. It would change what \nwe have as today's challenge into a real crisis.\n  At the time the Armstrong Williams payoff story broke, Mr. Williams \nreportedly told a journalist for another publication: ``There are \nothers.''\n  Well, how many columnists are on the administration's payroll? How \nmany people will you watch on the nightly news tonight who are \nreceiving some sort of a payola check from the administration to give \nyou the facts ``straight,'' to be ``fair and balanced''? The honest \nanswer is, we do not know. More are coming to light every day.\n  There are indications we have serious problems. In the past year, the \nnonpartisan Government Accountability Office, Congress's watchdog \nagency, has released two legal analyses finding that two Government \nagencies violated the Government's prohibition on publicity and \npropaganda.\n  The prohibition against using taxpayer dollars and Government \nagencies to produce propaganda was put in place in 1951, during the \nMcCarthy era. The prohibition was intended to balance the duty of \nFederal agencies to provide information with the not uncommon urge to \ntry to manipulate public opinion. We said, 50 years ago, it was wrong. \nIt is still wrong today.\n\n  According to the GAO, the Office of National Drug Control Policy \nviolated the publicity and propaganda prohibition when it produced and \ndistributed fake news stories called ``video news releases'' as part of \nits National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. The GAO concluded that the \nagency's fabricated news stories were nothing less than ``covert \npropaganda.''\n  In a separate report, the GAO found that the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services violated the publicity and propaganda prohibition by \ndisseminating fake news stories touting the supposed benefits of the \nnew prescription drug law.\n  The stories featured phony reporters telling viewers that ``all \npeople with Medicare will be able to get coverage that will lower their \nprescription drug spending.'' That is simply not true.\n  The bill that is going to be introduced next week by Senators \nLautenberg and Kennedy will clarify congressional intent in the 1951 \nlaw. I am happy to cosponsor this legislation.\n  Among other things, our bill will make it clear that any news \nreleases that do not clearly identify the Government as their source \nare prohibited. No more Government propaganda masquerading as \nindependent news.\n  Our bill will prohibit using taxpayers' dollars to try to buy \nfavorable news coverage and manipulate public opinion.\n  Our bill will contain teeth. The agencies that violate the \nprohibitions will get more than a slap on the wrist. The Federal \nGovernment has a responsibility to be honest with the American people, \nto give them truthful information.\n  In the 3 years since we passed No Child Left Behind, the \nadministration has refused consistently to fund the law. In all, the \nPresident's proposed budgets have shortchanged No Child Left Behind by \na total of $26 billion.\n  Ask someone from Colorado, or from Florida, or from any State in the \nUnion; the same thing is being said by school boards and school \ndistricts: Thank you for the Federal mandate of No Child Left Behind. \nWhere are the resources to help the kids, who have fallen $26 billion \nshort of what we planned on funding for this program?\n  Americans, when given the facts, understand the realities and make \nsensible choices.\n  Thomas Jefferson famously said that if he had to choose between a \ngovernment without newspapers or newspapers without a government, he \nwould go with the newspapers. Jefferson understood that access to \nreliable, accurate information is essential to democracy. So did \nanother one of my heroes, a former newspaperman with whom many of us \nhad the good fortune to work.\n  The late Senator Paul Simon of Illinois was a great journalist and a \ngreat public servant, my closest friend in politics, my predecessor in \nthe Senate. When he was 19 years old, he dropped out of college and \nbought a weekly newspaper in Troy, IL. He used his paper to tackle \ncrime and corruption. He understood that good government and good \njournalism are not mutually exclusive; they are inseparable.\n  Americans today are faced with many serious questions, concerning the \neducation of our children, the cost and quality of health care, whether \nour sons and daughters will be sent to war, and how secure our \nretirement will be. Government propaganda denies people the information \nthey need to make wise choices and erodes our faith in Government.\n  What we need is not propaganda but a commitment to truth and faith in \nthe\n\n[[Page S550]]\n\nability of the American people to make the right decisions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to be standing here \ntoday with my colleague and friend, Senator Joe Lieberman. We serve on \nthe Armed Services Committee together. Much has been said in recent \nyears about a lack of bipartisanship in the Senate, but there is an \nissue before us today that I believe all Members agree on, and \ncertainly Senator Lieberman and I do. We need to be sure that we care \nadequately and generously for the brave men and women who have lost a \nloved one who served this country in combat. We have offered together \nthe HEROES Act. We introduced it Monday as S. 77, along with 20 other \ncosponsors. This is an overdue and critical piece of legislation that \ncontemplates the moral obligation we in the Senate owe to our Armed \nForces.\n  I am pleased Majority Leader Bill Frist has made this legislation a \npart of his package of priorities for the year and that Senator John \nWarner, who chairs the Armed Services Committee, said he will give us a \nprompt hearing on the issue. I also note that Senator DeWine and \nSenator George Allen of Virginia have also offered legislation relative \nto this issue.\n  No amount of money, of course, can ever replace the loss a family \nfeels when their husband, wife, son, or daughter dies defending our \ncountry, carrying out the policies of this Government as they are \ndirected by the Congress and the President of the United States. But \nthis is a wealthy Nation, and we can and must do more to ensure that \nall those who fall in defense of the United States know without a doubt \nthat their loved ones will be well taken care of--generously taken care \nof.\n  Earlier this month, on a trip to Iraq, I flew from Baghdad to Kuwait \naboard a C-130 about 9:30 at night. It was a very somber trip because \ntraveling with us were two flag-draped coffins, the remains of soldiers \nwho had given their lives for their country. They are doing this too \noften. They are doing this true to the mission we ask of them and to \nthe fellowship and the spirit and the courage of the units with which \nthey serve. As those coffins were removed from the aircraft--and I saw \nall the service people who were at the airport that night spontaneously \ncome out to be there to show their respect--it reminded me, once again, \nthat this legislation is important. This grateful Nation needs to be \ngenerous to those who have served.\n  The families are not coming to us. They are not asking and demanding \nmore money and more benefits. They have always borne the cost and \nhardship of military service silently, proudly, and steadfastly. \nHowever, those of us with the power to enact change must ensure that we \nare adequately meeting our responsibilities as a people to those \nfamilies who serve us. The HEROES Act will do that, and it should move \nthrough this Congress as expeditiously as possible to final passage.\n  I am also pleased to announce this legislation has resonated with \nvarious organizations that work to ensure the best services and \nbenefits for our veterans. They have read the HEROES Act and decided \nthat this is the right thing to do for our Armed Forces. As of this \nafternoon, the 380,000 members of the Military Officers Association of \nAmerica, the 2.4 million members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and \nthe 2.8 million members strong of the American Legion and the National \nMilitary Families Association have all voiced their unqualified support \nfor this legislation. I am proud to have their backing, and I ask \nunanimous consent that their letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                          Veterans of Foreign Wars\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2005.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sessions: On behalf of the 2.4 million members \n     of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States and our \n     Ladies Auxiliary, I would like to offer our support for ``The \n     HEROES Act of 2005,'' legislation that would amend Title 10 \n     and Title 38, United States Code, to improve benefits for the \n     families of deceased members of the Armed Forces.\n       As the number of servicemen and women killed in the war on \n     terror continues, it is imperative that we recognize the need \n     to provide not only emotional support to their families, but \n     much-needed financial assistance during this troubling time.\n       By increasing the current $12,000 military death gratuity \n     payment to $100,000, your legislation will stand by the \n     Federal government's promise to take care of those left \n     behind when a servicemember dies in the line of duty. We also \n     applaud the bill's proposal that would increase the \n     Servicemembers Group Life Insurance (SGLI) maximum benefit \n     from $250,000 to $400,000. VFW resolution 642, passed at our \n     National Convention in August, calls for legislation to \n     improve the SGLI benefit; an increase we believe is long \n     overdue.\n       Once again, thank you for introducing legislation that will \n     help ensure that those families that have lost a loved one in \n     the name of freedom receive the support and financial \n     assistance that truly demonstrates our appreciation for those \n     who sacrificed all.\n       We look forward to working with you and your staff on this \n     legislation. As always, thank you for your continued support \n     of America's veterans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Dennis Cullinan,\n     National Legislative Service.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 25, 2005.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sessions: On behalf of the 2.8 million members \n     of The American Legion, I would like to express our full \n     support for the Honoring Every Requirement of Exemplary Act \n     of 2005/HEROES Act of 2005. The initiatives outlined in this \n     bill will greatly assist the families and loved ones of \n     servicemen and women who died in combat.\n       The American Legion supports the augmentation of the lump-\n     sum death benefit and the maximum payout from life insurance \n     to families of soldiers killed in combat. For those who have \n     made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our freedoms, this \n     act goes far to ease the hardships incurred by those \n     families. However, The American Legion believes the benefits \n     of this act should be extended to the families of all our \n     servicemen and women killed in the service of the nation.\n       Once again, The American Legion fully supports Honoring \n     Every Requirement of Exemplary Act of 2005/HEROES Act of \n     2005. The American Legion appreciates your continued \n     leadership in addressing the issues that are important to \n     veterans, members of the Armed Forces and their families.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Steve A. Robertson,\n\n                                                         Director,\n     National Legislative Commission.\n                                  ____\n\n                             National Military Family Association.\n       The National Military Family Association thanks Senator \n     Jeff Sessions and Senator Joe Lieberman for their active \n     interest in the well being of our military families should \n     the unthinkable happen. NMFA is grateful for the recognition \n     in The HEROES Act of 2005 that the election of insurance is a \n     family decision and for including a provision to ensure that \n     spouses are included in that important decision.\n       For the family members of a fallen servicemember, NMFA \n     knows that there is no way to compensate them for their loss, \n     only to help them prepare for their future. We strongly \n     believe that all servicemember's deaths should be treated \n     equally. Servicemembers are on duty 24 hours a day, 7 days a \n     week, 365 days a year. Through their oath, each \n     servicemember's commitment is the same. The survivor benefit \n     package should not create inequities by awarding different \n     benefits to families who lose a servicemember in a hostile \n     zone versus those who lose their loved one in a training \n     mission preparing for service in a hostile zone. To the \n     family, there is no difference. NMFA therefore supports \n     proposals for improvements to the survivor benefit package \n     that are consistent with our philosophy that all active duty \n     deaths be treated equally. We encourage Members of Congress \n     to examine the total package with the goal of recognizing the \n     service and sacrifice of the servicemember and family and \n     providing compensation that promotes the financial stability \n     of the family.\n                                              Kathleen B. Moakler,\n                            Deputy Director, Government Relations.\n\n\n[[Page S551]]\n\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank them for their service to the \nNation over the years, for their concern for our men and women in \nuniform, and for their support of this legislation. The loss of a \nfamily member in combat is, indeed, a terrible tragedy for the \nsurvivors. I have had the responsibility to call numerous families in \nAlabama since the war on terrorism began and talk to family members and \nattend funerals and wakes for those who have been lost. So many things \noccur to these families all at once. In the midst of their grieving, \nplans must be made for funerals, transportation of loved ones, and \nfamilies must bear all the expenses and arrangements. To the survivors, \nit will feel like everything in the world has come to a shattering \nstandstill. Indeed, there may be requirements that a family move, \nrelocate, or either sell or purchase a house. There are great numbers \nof expenses that can occur for them at that time. The enhanced benefit \npackage we have offered will ensure that our military families do not \nhave to worry about these day-to-day realities as they are having to go \nthrough the painful exercise of burying a loved one.\n  Senator Lieberman is here. He has cosponsored and worked with us on \nthis legislation. I note that it raises the $12,000 death benefit to \n$100,000. It raises the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance from $250,000 \nto $400,000. Those increases will keep these payments up to date with \ncurrent reality and be an expression of national support for those \nfamilies.\n  It is an honor to work with Senator Lieberman on the committee on a \nlot of different issues. We thank him for his leadership in the Senate \nand for his support of our men and women in uniform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nAlabama for his kind words. I thank him for his leadership on this \nissue and so many other matters to our Nation's security and for those \nwho fight and serve in uniform to protect us.\n  Senator Sessions and I have worked together as members of the Armed \nServices Committee. He was chair, and I was ranking Democrat on the \nAirland Subcommittee. In some ways, the public, after listening to the \nchatter and the noise, would be surprised to hear we work so often in \nthese committees with total nonpartisanship in the national interest, \nwhich is the way it ought to be.\n  I forgot the moment, but we were considering the question of what \nkinds of benefits there are for our men and women in uniform, and we \ncame to death benefits. We were both, frankly, shocked and embarrassed \nand ultimately outraged that it had been $6,000, just raised to \n$12,000. When you think of death benefits generally and the impact on a \nfamily, the loss of a loved one, it just cried out for some kind of \nchange. That is what this proposal, the HEROES Act, is all about and \nwhy I am so proud to join with Senator Sessions and the other \ncosponsors in introducing it and why I am grateful Senator Frist \nincluded this as one of his priority items on his leadership list of \nmeasures introduced.\n  I had one of those moments we all have--I guess all Members of the \nSenate do this--where I got word today of a loss of another Connecticut \nsoldier, SGT Thomas Vitagliano. If I am not in the State because we are \nin session, I always reach out to call the family.\n  I spoke with his mother earlier today. These are extraordinary \npeople. She spoke with a strength that I must say was inspiring. I \nsaid: There is nothing I can say to fill the gap that is there because \nof the loss of a loved one in service of country. All I can say to you \nis, thank you on behalf of myself and a grateful nation and please know \nthat your son is a hero.\n  She said to me: He loved his service in the military. He was a big \nguy and he had a great sense of humor, but he was really serious about \nhis service in the military.\n  I know that he was killed by an improvised explosive device, IED, \nbasically a bomb. She said to me: I know that he died in service of his \ncountry, he died doing what gave his life meaning.\n  She also said to me: Senator, I am really thinking now in just the \nwords you said, as the mother of a hero. There will be a time after his \nburial when I will think as a mother, and it will be a very hard time. \nBut today I am thinking as the mother of a hero.\n  That is what this HEROES Act is all about, Honoring Every Requirement \nof Exemplary Service Act, the HEROES Act of 2005. We could not come up \nwith any sum of money to reimburse a family for the loss of a loved \none, but the fact is that these folks put their lives on the line for \nus. They are there, more specifically, as a result of our decision and \nthe President's as Commander in Chief. The least we can do for them is \n$100,000 in a death benefit.\n  I am very pleased, also, as I believe Senator Sessions said, that \nunder this HEROES Act we are going to increase the Servicemen's Group \nLife Insurance, or SGLI as it is called. That is a benefit that is now \nat $250,000. It is basically term insurance. It is a pretty good plan. \nIt is not a typical death benefit that we are offering for those who \nare killed in action, but it certainly, obviously, goes to the \nsurvivors of those killed in action. By the HEROES Act, we are adding \n$150,000 of life insurance for troops serving in a combat zone, and the \npremium for that $150,000 will be paid by the U.S. Government.\n  So we have a circumstance where if a soldier has bought the SGLI, the \nServicemen's Group Life Insurance, their family will receive the \n$250,000, for which the soldier pays, $150,000 which we pay, and \n$100,000 that will now be the death benefit, and that will be a half \nmillion dollars, which in these days is not a lot of money for families \nleft without a parent, a spouse, children who are going to have to be \nsent through college and all the expenses related thereto.\n  The $12,000 that is the existing death benefit is so shockingly \npaltry, but all the more so when you focus on the fact--and this \nearlier $6,000 goes way back when it was first set--that the military \nhas changed. Our military, as all of us know who serve on the service \ncommittees or visit our military or just see our Guard and Reserve at \nhome, is no longer primarily a group of 18-, 19-, and 20-year-old \nsingle men. More than 60 percent of our service men and women on Active \nDuty have a family.\n  If my colleagues have visited, they know in Iraq about 40 percent of \nthe Americans there in uniform are Guard and Reserve. Those folks are \nin their thirties, forties, and during my visit at the end of December \nI saw a few who were in pretty good shape but looked as though they \nwere in their fifties.\n  So these are people who have families, and if killed, it will leave a \nterrible void in the life of those families. And in some small way we \nhope to fill that void monetarily by providing this increase in \nsupport.\n  Incidentally, the HEROES Act will also direct the military to discuss \nthe level of insurance selected with a spouse or other beneficiary to \nensure that family members are informed and fully participating in \nthese important decisions.\n  The great President Theodore Roosevelt once said: A man who is good \nenough to shed blood for his country is good enough to be given a \nsquare deal afterward. I would attempt to update the great TR's wisdom \nand words by saying that a man or a woman who is good enough to shed \nblood and risk life for our country should know when doing so that \ntheir families will be taken care of no matter what happens. That is \nthe purpose of the HEROES Act.\n  I do not think I have ever introduced legislation that I have felt \nbetter about or, frankly, felt more optimistic about. I cannot believe \nthis is not going to pass overwhelmingly and be supported \noverwhelmingly. When we think of all we are spending--incidentally, it \nis retroactive so anyone who has been killed in Iraq or Afghanistan \nwill receive these full death benefits. What it will amount to in total \nis a fraction of one percentage point of what we are spending every \nmonth, probably every day, in Iraq. It is the least we can do.\n  I am proud to be part of it with Senator Sessions. I thank him again \nfor his leadership. He and I and all the others are going to stick with \nit until we get this done and the checks start to go out to those who \nhave given their all to protect our security and advance the cause of \nfreedom.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S552]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, has the Senator from Alabama finished?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like a few minutes to finish up if the Senator \nwill yield.\n  Mr. TALENT. I will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Talent for his courtesy which is well-\nknown in this body.\n  Mr. President, Senator Lieberman is correct. The families I talk to \nso often say to me about their son or daughter or spouse who lost their \nlife that they loved their work, they were doing what they wanted to \ndo, they believed in what they were doing, and that gives them comfort. \nI have heard that over and over again. It is very similar to what the \nSenator heard today.\n  I know the Senator's call was very comforting to the family because I \nknow the Senator has the sensitivity and judgment to reach out to them \nin the proper way. It is not an easy thing to do, for sure.\n  I have, indeed, valued the Senator's partnership on the Airland \nSubcommittee. We have never had a harsh word nor even a serious \ndisagreement. It does show that those of us who are from different \nparties love America, we want to see our military using the money \nwisely and doing the right things with it.\n  It has been a pleasure for me to work with the Senator from \nConnecticut. I have learned so much from him.\n  I will not go over the benefits of the program, which Senator \nLieberman has already mentioned. I think that this legislation is a \nstep in the right direction. I would note that it is retroactive to the \nbeginning of the war in Afghanistan. I would also note that the Defense \nDepartment has studied this legislation. I asked them to do that last \nyear as part of our Defense bill. They support it. It will have an \ninitial cost estimated at $459 million, and it should drop to half of \nthat in the future and hopefully much less than that. I think these \ncosts are clearly justified.\n  Our service members are assigned all over the globe in dangerous \nparts of the world. As an editorial in the San Diego Union Tribune \nsaid:\n\n       The costs are beside the point. This is a case in which \n     lawmakers have a moral obligation to do the right thing, \n     regardless of cost.\n\n  I think this legislation is the right thing. I do believe we have \ngreat support so far and I look forward to seeing it become law. I also \nthank the Chair for his cosponsorship of this legislation.\n  I thank Senator Talent for his courtesy, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I was happy to yield to my friend.

Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of Mr. Wyden and \nmyself to speak about a resolution we are submitting to commemorate the \nliberation of Auschwitz, where more than 1 million people were murdered \nat the hands of the Nazis. Sixty years ago tomorrow, allied forces \nsuccessfully liberated the most notorious of Nazi death camps, freeing \nthose who managed to live in the most deplorable of conditions and yet \nsomehow survive the greatest evil the world has ever witnessed.\n  For 5 long years at Auschwitz, men, women, and children arrived in \ncattle cars from all parts of Europe. Whether young or old, rich or \npoor, they were systematically stripped of their dignity before being \nmurdered because of their religion and their deeply held faith in God. \nBut 60 years ago tomorrow the genocide ended and the gates to freedom \nwere opened.\n  With the passage of time, people tend to forget the events of the \npast, particularly if those events occurred well before their birth. \nThe survivors of Auschwitz are elderly and they are dwindling in \nnumber, but their stories of how good successfully triumphed over evil \nwill live on in our history and our hearts.\n  The resolution Senator Wyden and I introduce today commemorates \nAuschwitz and urges all Americans to remember those who were murdered \nthere, murdered for nothing more than practicing their religion. We owe \nit to ourselves and to future generations never to forget that horror.\n  I am pleased to say leaders from around the world, including Vice \nPresident and Mrs. Cheney, are traveling to Poland for tomorrow's \ncommemoration ceremony. They will be joined by survivors who are still \nable to make the trip out into the Polish countryside.\n  I hope this resolution will serve as a reminder that the Senate, \nindeed all Americans, remembers the events of 60 years ago tomorrow. It \nis also my hope that when anti-Semitism rears its ugly head, the world \nwill feel a collective responsibility to stand up and speak out against \nreligious hatred. That at least will give meaning to the sacrifice of \nthose who were murdered and incinerated in the ovens of Auschwitz.\n  Mr. President, I am informed that the resolution has been cleared on \nboth sides. I am very pleased to hear that. On behalf of the leader, I \nask unanimous consent the Senate now proceed to the consideration of S. \nRes. 18, which was submitted earlier today, the resolution about which \nI have been speaking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 18) commemorating the 60th \n     anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz extermination \n     camp in Poland.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/26/senate-section/article/S552-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S552-S553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        LIBERATION OF AUSCHWITZ\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, perhaps more than any other word, \nAuschwitz is synonymous with evil.\n  Sixty years ago today, Russian soldiers liberated Auschwitz.\n  The horrors of Auschwitz are incomprehensible and undescribable.\n  Over 1 million people lost their lives at Auschwitz--the largest of \nthe Nazi death camps. Ninety percent were Jews. Hundreds of thousands \nwere children.\n  Auschwitz represented the Germans' campaign to exterminate a people--\nthe Jews. They almost succeeded--killing 2 out of 3 Jews in Europe.\n  As a Polish American, I carry the images of Auschwitz in my heart.\n  The Nazis considered all Poles to be an inferior race. After Poland \nwas conquered, German authorities expelled much of the native Polish \npopulation from regions of the newly annexed territories. Polish cities \nwere given German names and German settlers were colonized on Polish \nland. In occupied Poland, the Nazi Governor, Hans Frank, proclaimed: \n``Poles will become slaves in the Third Reich.''\n  The Nazis set out to destroy Polish culture. Thousands of Polish \nteachers, politicians, university professors and artists were executed \nor sent to Nazi concentration camps. Catholic priests were among the \nmain targets of Nazi mass murder in Poland.\n  In fact, Auschwitz was created as an internment camp for Polish \ndissidents. And thousands of Poles were murdered alongside the Jews in \nAuschwitz.\n  Many Poles risked their lives to save Jews:\n  Irena Sendler was a young social worker in Warsaw. She used her \nposition to smuggle 200 Jewish children out of the ghetto to safe \nhouses. In 1943, Sendler was arrested by the Gestapo, brutally tortured \nand condemned to death. On the day of her execution, she was freed with \nthe help of the Jewish underground.\n  Irena Adamowicz, a Polish Catholic, aided in establishing contacts \nbetween the Jewish Underground and the main Polish resistance \norganization.\n  Jan Karski, who, while working for the Polish Government in exile, \nwas one of the few outsiders to visit the Warsaw Ghetto. He appealed to \nthe Allies to do something.\n  As a Polish American, I traveled to Poland in the late 1970s. I was a \nCongresswoman. And I wanted to see my heritage. I went to the small \nvillage where my family came from. It was a very moving and historic \nexperience.\n  But I also wanted to see the dark side of my history, and I went to \nAuschwitz.\n  In touring Auschwitz, it was an incredibly moving experience to go \nthrough the gate, to see the sign, to go to see the chambers. I went to \na cell that had been occupied by Father\n\n[[Page S553]]\n\nKolbe, a Catholic priest who gave his life for a Jewish man there.\n  And then, for those of you who don't know, I am a social worker, I \nhave been a child abuse worker and I don't flinch.\n  But then I got half way through that tour and I came to a point in \nthat tour where I saw the bins with glasses and the children's shoes, \nand this 40-something-year-old Congresswoman could not go on.\n  I became unglued. I had to remove myself from the small tour, go off \ninto a private place in Auschwitz, cry in a way that shook my very \nsoul. And when I left there, I thought, now I really know why we need \nan Israel.\n  And that is why I will fight so hard to ensure the survival of \nIsrael. I know its importance. I know why it exists. I will always \nfight for the survival and the viability of the State of Israel. My \nsupport is unabashed and unwavering.\n  I also know why it is so important for us educate our young people--\nabout the effects of hatred, about the importance of history.\n  That is why I have worked with the Polish and Jewish communities in \nBaltimore to develop a U.S.-Poland-Israel Exchange program. Young \npeople from America, Poland and Israel will join together to learn \nabout each other's history and culture. They will visit Poland and \nIsrael, to visit historical and religious sites, to learn together \nabout history and to work together to build a brighter future.\n  In closing, I would like to read the words of Eli Weisel:\n\n       Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, \n     which has turned my life into one long night, seven times \n     cursed and seven times sealed. Never shall I forget that \n     smoke. Never shall I forget the faces of the children, whose \n     bodies I saw turned into wreathes of smoke beneath a silent \n     blue sky. Never shall I forget those flames which consumed my \n     faith forever.\n       Never shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived \n     me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I \n     forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and \n     turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, \n     even if I am condemned to live as long as God himself.\n\n  Mr. President, 60 years after the liberation of Auschwitz, let us \npledge never to forget. And let us honor those who died in the \nholocaust by fighting against bigotry, hate crimes, and intolerance.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, since I am going to ask on behalf of the \nleader the resolution be agreed to, I want to express my gratitude to \nhis office and the Democratic leader's office for their expeditious \nhandling of this resolution, and also Senator Wyden and all those who \nhave cosponsored it.\n  On their behalf, I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the \nable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 18) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 18\n\n       Whereas on January 27, 1945, the Auschwitz extermination \n     camp in Poland was liberated by Allied Forces during World \n     War II after almost 5 years of murder, rape, and torture;\n       Whereas more than 1,000,000 innocent civilians were \n     murdered at the Auschwitz extermination camp;\n       Whereas the Auschwitz extermination camp symbolizes the \n     brutality of the Holocaust;\n       Whereas Americans must never forget the terrible crimes \n     against humanity committed at the Auschwitz extermination \n     camp and must educate future generations to promote \n     understanding of the dangers of intolerance in order to \n     prevent similar injustices from happening again; and\n       Whereas commemoration of the liberation of the Auschwitz \n     extermination camp will instill in all Americans a greater \n     awareness of the Holocaust: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates January 27, 2005, as the 60th anniversary \n     of the liberation of the Auschwitz extermination camp by \n     Allied Forces during World War II; and\n       (2) calls on all Americans to remember the more than \n     1,000,000 innocent victims murdered at the Auschwitz \n     extermination camp as part of the Holocaust.\n\n  Mr. TALENT.

This Friday's hearing will be on the subject of Social \nSecurity. Among the witnesses at this hearing will be Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt's grandson, the AARP, and we will have a couple of employees \nof the Social Security Administration who will testify about efforts \ninside the Social Security Administration to get some of the career \nemployees to push the issue of privatization and the issue that there \nis, in fact, a crisis in Social Security. We are going to have a \nhearing on these issues.\n  Incidentally, we have invited witnesses who will provide a full range \nof opinions.

Mr. President, I wish to make a couple of comments about \nthe future of Social Security because the President talked about this \nissue again this morning. This is a big issue. I noticed in a recent \nnewspaper article that someone, who philosophically doesn't appear to \nbelieve in Social Security, said: ``Social Security is the soft \nunderbelly of the welfare state.''\n  Social Security is a program that was signed into law by Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt in 1930's. It is an insurance program. Money is taken \nfrom workers' paychecks in the form of something called FICA taxes. The \n``I'' in FICA is insurance, not investment. Social Security is an \ninsurance program. It has lifted tens of millions of elderly people out \nof poverty in this country. It has been amazingly successful. It is not \nin crisis. The President did not use that word--``crisis''--today, but \nhe has used it the past, and others also have. It is not in crisis.\n  We have a responsibility with respect to the Social Security system \nto make some adjustments as we go along. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, the Social Security system will be fully solvent until \nthe year 2052. In the period beyond 2052, if no changes are made, \nSocial Security would be able to pay about 80 percent of what we now \npay in benefits. In fact, people are living longer, healthier, better \nlives as a result of Social Security. Yes, it is successful. People are \nliving longer and healthier lives. We can and will and should make some \nadjustments in Social Security, but major surgery is not needed. I do \nnot support privatized accounts in the Social Security system.\n  With respect to retirement security, we have two things. Social \nSecurity is the foundation. That is the basic retirement insurance. It \nis the one without risk and that will be there no matter what. Above \nthat, we have retirement investments, 401(k)s, IRAs, and other private \npension programs. I support those as well. I have supported aggressive \nincentives for the American people to invest in the stock market, in \n401(k)s and IRAs and other retirement accounts. That is different than \nSocial Security, the basic foundation of retirement security. The \nPresident suggests we should begin taking apart\n\n[[Page S554]]\n\nthe foundation. I do not support that. I do not agree with it. I say \nlet us build on the first, second, and third floor of this structure, \nbut let us keep the foundation intact.\n  Social Security, the social insurance program you pay into during \nyour working life and you can expect to get when you retire, has made \nlife better for tens of millions of retired elderly Americans. We ought \nnot take it apart.\n  The President proposes this: He says let us borrow $1 trillion to $3 \ntrillion and invest that borrowing in the stock market and then have \nfaith that somehow that will produce substantial returns and at the \nsame time reduce benefits in the Social Security program. He suggests \nthat it will all come out just fine. Well, it will not come out just \nfine.\n  I point out that the President also told us 4 years ago that we were \ngoing to have budget surpluses as far as the eye. It didn't turn out \nthat way. We went from the largest budget surpluses to the largest \nbudget deficits in history. There is not exactly a substantial amount \nof evidence that the economic estimates in the future from this \nadministration will be on the mark. In fact, just the opposite is true.\n  Our obligation is to understand the basics of retirement security. My \ngrandmother, as I have told you before, said you don't borrow for \nretirement, you save for retirement. That is why this notion of \nborrowing $1 trillion to $3 trillion to stick in the stock market \nbegins with a premise that doesn't make any sense.\n  Incidentally, one other thing: Third-grade math will tell you there \nis no connection here. If, in fact, those who want to privatize a \nportion of Social Security allege that Social Security is in trouble \nbecause the actuaries estimate average economic growth at only 1.8 \npercent per year, then they cannot on the other hand allege that if \nthere are private accounts you are going to get a 7-percent return. An \neconomy growing at 1.8 percent a year on average cannot produce the \ncorporate profits that will rise and increase the stock market to \nproduce 7-percent returns on investment over the long term. It doesn't \nwork. You have inconsistent arguments for a policy that, in my \njudgment, is not the right policy for our country.\n\n  I welcome the debate. I don't begrudge anyone for taking a position \nthat is dramatically different from mine. I just believe that those who \nbelieve we should privatize a portion of Social Security system are \njust plain wrong.\n  I grew up in a town of 300 people. Everybody knew everybody. I knew \neveryone who lived in that town. I knew the people who retired in that \ntown and had nothing but their Social Security checks. I wasn't alive \nat a time when those who retired and had nothing didn't have a Social \nSecurity check, but I know that at that point in time half of those who \nbecame elderly in this country lived in poverty. Some 50 percent of the \nAmerican elderly lived in poverty. Growing up in my small hometown, I \nknew everybody. I understood who benefitted so substantially from that \nmonthly Social Security check and who would have lived in poverty \nwithout it. This is not about statistics; it is about real people. \nThose are the people who built this country and created this wonderful \nlife which we inherited. People say we inherited this wonderful life \nfrom those who went before us and we owe it to our children. The \nquestion is, How will we deal with it? How will we treat it? Will we be \nresponsible and make the right choices?\n  Those who came before us built something that is unique on this \nglobe. We share this Earth that circles the Sun with 6 billion \nneighbors. Through the blessings of God, we happened to be born right \nhere and are living right now. A lot of people on this Earth can say \nthat. There is no place else like this. There is no one on this Earth \nwho has what we have. It has been given to us by people who worked hard \nand who understood that part of what we have created in this country is \nto help lift tens of millions of elderly people out of poverty through \nsomething called Social Security. We ought to be here to expand it, to \nprotect it, to nurture it, and to make sure it is available for 100 \nyears--not take it apart. We are going to have a real debate about \nthat.\n  Once again, I am not going to be engaged in name calling or be \npejorative about those who have different opinions. There is room for a \nlot of different opinions. I feel strongly about this, and I welcome \nthis debate. This is about values and what our country values. We will \nhave a hearing on this subject on Friday. I invite everyone here who \nmight wish to attend to be part of it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/26/senate-section/article/S554-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S554-S555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF SAMUEL BODMAN\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to make a brief statement about the \nperson who is destined to become the new Secretary of Energy, someone \nfor whom I voted in the Energy Committee this morning and someone I am \nvery pleased to support and think brings considerable skill to the \nposition of Secretary of Energy. He has not yet been confirmed by the \nfull Senate, but he was approved unanimously by the Energy Committee \nthis morning.\n  I commend President Bush for his selection. We have had some \ncontroversial nominees, but the selection of Dr. Bodman is the \nselection of someone whose capabilities, skills, and experience I \nbelieve lend themselves very well to the demand and the duties of \nSecretary of Energy. At this time, when we have these compelling energy \nissues, the President has made a good choice.\n  Mr. Bodman is a person of considerable skill and talent who I am \ngoing to be proud to support, and who I voted for in the Energy \nCommittee this morning.\n  When I talk about trade, as I did yesterday, one of the significant \nissues of trade and economic opportunity in the future for this country \nis the issue of oil and energy. We are now importing nearly 60 percent \nof our oil. Everyone talks about independence and trying to be free \nfrom the grip of those who live in troubled parts of the world. Yet we \nallow these countries to hold us hostage to the supply that comes from \ntheir oil pipeline.\n  Every 25 years we grow concerned and start worrying about energy. We \nall put on our suit and start debating energy. In the end it is a bunch \nof people in dark suits that huff and puff and do nothing. And every 25 \nyears we develop a ``new'' strategy that is exactly the same, dig and \ndrill.\n  This strategy is what I like to call a yesterday forever policy. Yes, \nwe should dig. And yes, we should drill. But if this is all we have for \nan energy policy, it is yesterday forever, and 25 years from now we \nwill be back here talking about it again--perhaps a different bunch of \nSenators--but we will talk about the same thing.\n  The question is, Can we do something different? I have often told my \ncolleagues that my first automobile when I was in school was a 1924 \nModel T Ford that I restored. I bought it for $25. I lovingly restored \nit over 2 years. It was not much of a car. You could not date in it and \nit was not much of a car for someone in high school. The thing about it \nis that you put gasoline in a 1924 Ford exactly the same way you put \ngasoline in a 2005 Ford. You drive up to a pump and stick a hose in the \ntank and start pumping. Nothing has changed. Everything in our lives \nhas changed, but nothing has changed with respect to the way we put \ngasoline through a carburetor. This country is so overwhelmingly \ndependent on oil from troubled parts of the world that if we do not get \nvocal and do something significant, shame on us.\n  In 2003, the President called for developing hydrogen fuel cells. I \nsaid at the time, I welcomed that and thought it was a terrific idea, \nalthough it was more timid than what I proposed. I proposed a $6.5 \nbillion, 10-year Apollo-type program that would move us to a position \nwhere we are no longer putting gasoline through carburetors and \ndepending on foreign oil. And I still believe we should move to a \nhydrogen fuel cell future.\n  The fact is, there are enormous benefits if we create a hydrogen fuel \ncell program. First, hydrogen is ubiquitous. It is everywhere. I \nunderstand there are concerns regarding production, storage, \ndistribution, and infrastructure. I understand that, but these concerns \nare not insurmountable and hydrogen is everywhere.\n  When you drive a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, what comes out of the \ntailpipe? Water vapor. It is a wonderful thing for the environment to \ndrive a\n\n[[Page S555]]\n\nvehicle that puts water vapor out the tailpipe.\n  If we can decide as a country that our policy should be that our \nchildren or their children no longer drive vehicles with an internal \ncombustion engine that requires us to get oil from Saudi Arabia, \nKuwait, Iraq, or Venezuela, we will have done something very \nsignificant for the defense of this country.\n  This is about national security. We cannot be timid. And we cannot \ntake baby steps towards an energy policy.\n  When we develop an energy bill--and I am on the Senate Energy \nCommittee and I want to be part of developing that bill; I voted for \nthe last one in the Senate; it was very controversial but I voted for \nit--it needs to be a bill that includes four pieces.\n  First, we have to incentivize additional production. Yes, it is \ndigging and drilling, but if that is the only title, it is over. We do \nnot accomplish much at all. Second, we need much more conservation. We \nwaste so much more energy than we should. It is incredible how much \nenergy we waste. We need conservation. Production, conservation. Third, \nwe need efficiency. Everything we do, from turning on the bathroom \nlight in the morning to using the electric shaver we plug in, can be so \nmuch more efficient and could save a substantial amount of energy. \nFourth, we need renewable forms of energy. Yes, that is wind energy, \nsolar, biodiesel, and ethanol.\n\n  Collectively, we need to create a significant national program, an \nApollo-like program, where our Nation exerts its will and says: Here is \nwhere we are headed and here is how we will get there. It has to be a \ncollective national will for us to decide we will escape the excessive \ndependence we have on Middle East oil. That is the only way we will \nachieve this goal.\n  I know it is longer term. But, if we do not take the first step, we \ncan never get there. When we write a new energy proposal, I will \nagain--and I have visited with Dr. Bodman about this--I will work with \nmy colleagues and propose a very aggressive Apollo-type or Manhattan-\ntype program that says, let's head this country in a new direction with \na fresh choice, a different choice that makes us less dependent on the \noil that comes from the ground in the Middle East.\n  We have no choice but to consider an energy bill a priority, a new \nenergy policy a priority. We need to get it right. There are enough \nideas to go around. I don't think any one party or any one philosophy \nhas a lock on good suggestions or ideas with respect to a new energy \nbill. I do believe this, those who cling to the past and those who \nbelieve digging and drilling represents America's energy future do no \nservice to our kids and grandkids.\n  As we grapple with this issue, and with the help and leadership of \nDr. Bodman at the Department of Energy when he is confirmed next week, \nmy hope is we can do something significant and at the end of our \ncareers we can say we produced a significant new and interesting energy \npolicy that takes this country well beyond the dependence that now \nholds us hostage.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/26/senate-section/article/S555-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S555-S557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ATTORNEY GENERAL JOHN ASHCROFT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this morning, on a party-line vote, the \nJudiciary Committee agreed to send the nomination for the U.S. Attorney \nGeneral of Judge Alberto Gonzales to the Senate floor. It is the \nleader's intention, as I understand it, to bring that nomination to the \nfloor next week. So it appears to me relatively obvious that the United \nStates of America will have a new Attorney General within the next \ncouple of weeks.\n  I did not want the opportunity to pass to talk a little bit about the \ncurrent Attorney General, a person for whom I have absolute respect and \nexpress appreciation for his service, not only for the State of \nMissouri when he represented that State as Governor and later as a \nSenator but for all of America during his service in the last 4 years \nas Attorney General of the United States.\n  I think sometimes people have overlooked the record of this Attorney \nGeneral. I wanted to take a moment this evening to talk about some of \nthe accomplishments of the Bush administration, and specifically the \nJustice Department under the leadership of Attorney General John \nAshcroft. But first I want to say a couple of personal words about John \nAshcroft.\n  When his confirmation hearing was held 4 years ago, there was \nopposition to him because he was deemed to be a conservative. His views \nwere deemed to be too firmly held. Some people called him rigid in his \nideology. Some people thought he was too faithful to his religion. No \none questioned his intelligence or his integrity or his experience.\n  He is a graduate of one of the finest law schools in the country, the \nUniversity of Chicago. He clearly had the public service, as a Governor \nof the State and as a U.S. Senator. Very few attorneys general had the \nsame kind of experience he had.\n  But throughout his tenure, I think he has been criticized less for \nwhat he has accomplished than for the kind of person he is. It ought to \nbe the other way around. People should look at the kind of leadership \nJohn Ashcroft has provided the Justice Department and be thankful that \nwe had such a firm, intelligent, upright, faithful, and strong Attorney \nGeneral. These years have called for strength which we could not have \nanticipated when John Ashcroft was confirmed just 4 years ago. But \nbecause just a few months later this country was brutally attacked in \nSeptember of 2001, all of our public servants had to begin to operate \ntheir departments in a way they had never operated them before.\n  The Justice Department was no different. In fact, the Justice \nDepartment was on the front line of our defense of the homeland. There \nwas no Homeland Security Department at that time. Immediately, the \nJustice Department had to begin changing the way it did business. The \nFBI, under the jurisdiction of the Justice Department, had major \nchanges. Thankfully, under the leadership of John Ashcroft and now Bob \nMueller, the Director of the FBI, things have begun to change, but it \nhas not been easy. Without the strong and firm and steady leadership of \nJohn Ashcroft, it would likely not have happened.\n  The first obligation, therefore, of the Attorney General was and is \nthe protection of Americans, preventing another terrorist attack, and \nensuring that we maintain the proper balance between the protection of \nour own civil rights and our security from terrorist attack. During the \nperiod of time John Ashcroft has served, we have shut down numerous \nterrorist operations and cells across America. In fact, I am informed \nthe Justice Department has brought criminal charges against 364 \nindividuals and obtained convictions against 193 of them. Over $2 \nmillion in funds has been frozen.\n  I know, because I have talked to Attorney General Ashcroft and \nforeign leaders, he has been able to forge a relationship with his \ncounterparts in other countries. For example, not to be exclusive, but \nour European allies helped us go after terrorist cells in countries \naround the world. Largely because of his success in that, we have been \nable to integrate our law enforcement activities with other countries. \nEven though people may be concerned about the support that some of our \nallies have failed to give us in operations such as those in Iraq, I \ncan tell you the cooperation in law enforcement and going after \nterrorists and terrorist cells has been very good. That is one of the \ngood news stories in the war on terror, and John Ashcroft had a lot to \ndo with that.\n\n  With regard to the first obligation that the Attorney General has to \nthe American people, I can't think of a better person to have in place \nafter 9/11 than John Ashcroft. His Department has done a terrific job.\n  One of the areas that is of most concern to me is violent crime. For \nyears, Senator Feinstein and I labored to secure passage of a \nconstitutional amendment to protect the victims of\n\n[[Page S556]]\n\nviolent crime. No one was more supportive of that effort than Attorney \nGeneral John Ashcroft. In fact, President Bush came to the Justice \nDepartment and, with Attorney General Ashcroft and John Gillis, who \nheads the Department of Justice office in charge of supporting victims \nof crime, they made very strong and passionate statements in support of \nour amendment to protect crime victims.\n  Eventually we were able, this year, to get passed not a \nconstitutional amendment but a Federal law that has been signed into \nlaw to protect the rights of people in the Federal court system who \nwere victims of crime, with significant incentives for the same \nprotections to exist in the State courts. John Ashcroft was very \nsupportive of those efforts. I express my great appreciation to him for \nthat.\n  But he has not only worked to help the victims of crime, he has \nhelped to reduce crime itself. There are some interesting statistics \nhere from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The rate of violent crime \nis at a historic 30-year low. In the past 3 years, the overall rate of \nviolent crime has declined 27 percent from the previous 3-year period. \nOver the past 3 years, there has been a double-digit reduction in the \nrate of rape and sexual assault, a 31-percent reduction; robbery, 31 \npercent; assault, 26-percent reduction. Obviously, these are not just \nstatistics, these are real people whom we have ensured are not \nvictimized who otherwise might have been victimized.\n  Mr. President, 1.7 million fewer citizens in America have experienced \nthe pain of violent crime in this period between 2001 and 2003. That is \nnot all attributable to the work of the Department of Justice or \nAttorney General Ashcroft, but a lot of it is. It has been overlooked, \nand I think he deserves credit for that.\n  Gun crime is something else he pledged to work on as Attorney \nGeneral, and he kept his pledge. The Justice Department has increased \nFederal gun crime prosecutions by 68 percent over the past 3 years. In \nthe fiscal year 2003, more than 13,000 offenders were charged, which is \nthe highest figure for any single year. More than 9,500 individuals \nwere convicted, which is the largest number ever convicted in the \nFederal system in a single year. This has been a priority. As a result, \nthere have been fewer gun crimes committed.\n  On illegal drugs, something we all are concerned about, working with \nJohn Walters, the so-called drug czar, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the \nDepartment of Justice, and Attorney General Ashcroft have been very \ncommitted to going after all of the various aspects of the illegal use \nof drugs in the United States as well as their importation into the \ncountry. There have been a variety of operations, but just to cite an \noverall statistic, in the past 2 years, 15 major drug-trafficking \norganizations have been dismantled or disrupted. The statistics on all \nof the major drugs, from marijuana to the hallucinogens to Ecstasy, \nLSD, show the use of drugs is falling. Part of that will be the result \nof the significant efforts of the Department of Justice.\n\n  We were shocked to see corporate fraud raise its ugly head in this \ncountry a couple of years ago, and the Department of Justice went after \nthat with a vengeance. The corporate scandals that had festered for \nsome time were finally brought to light after 2001. As a result of the \nwork of the Corporate Fraud Task Force that the President created, with \ntough investigation by our prosecutors, the Department of Justice \nbrought more than 900 violators being charged in more than 400 cases. \nOver 500 individuals have been convicted or pled guilty since that \ntime, including top executives at companies like WorldCom, Enron, \nMclone, and others.\n  Why is this important? America has to lead the world in terms of \nrespect for the rule of law and transparency and integrity. This is \npart of what we believe to be the fundamentals of free government. It \nis important for the administration and especially the Department of \nJustice to show that it is committed to ensure that this transparency \nand integrity remains as a hallmark of our economic system. Therefore, \nthe Corporate Fraud Task Force in its work was critical to achieving \nthat goal.\n  In the other areas for which the Department of Justice has \nresponsibility, from civil rights to civil fraud to environmental \nenforcement, in each of these areas there have been significant \nachievements. One statistic: In the area of civil rights, in the past 3 \nyears, 439 people have been charged with criminal civil rights \nviolations, which is more than during the preceding 3 years. Civil \nfraud recoveries doubled for the past 3 years.\n  By the way, the number is pretty astonishing--$5 billion.\n  In environmental enforcement, there have been a variety of actions. \nThe Department of Justice obtained the largest civil penalty in history \nagainst a single company for violation of an environmental statute.\n  There is so much more one could say about the Department of Justice \nunder John Ashcroft's leadership. The point I want to simply make this \nevening as we are preparing to begin a new administration--a second \nBush administration with new leadership in the Department of Justice--\nis I think we should reflect a little bit on the achievements of this \npast 4 years and on the individual who helped to achieve these results.\n  As a former colleague of all of us in the Senate, I know we wished \nJohn Ashcroft well when he took his oath of office. Although not all of \nus have agreed with every action of the Department of Justice since \nthen, I think we have to agree that John Ashcroft's integrity and \ncommitment were hallmarks of his leadership of the Department of \nJustice. I for one appreciate the personal commitment that he made. \nThroughout his term, I spent time with John and his family. I know how \nhard he worked in his job. America has had no more faithful servant. \nThe President has had no more faithful servant in the execution of the \npolicies of the administration than Attorney General John Ashcroft. He \nput his heart and soul into the job. He committed 4 years of his life \nto continuing to serve the people of this country.\n  I think for that, and for the great success that his Department \nachieved, we owe him a debt of gratitude. As we begin this next \nadministration, as we confirm people to serve in the next \nadministration, I hope we will also pause to thank those who have \nserved in the first Bush administration--all of the American people--\nand say our hat is off to them, and to say Godspeed, we wish you the \nvery best in the future. Take a little time off so you can reflect a \nlittle bit not only on what you did but on what you will need to do now \nto spend time with family and friends and enjoy the thanks that we are \nnow sharing.\n  I know my colleagues join me in wishing Attorney General Ashcroft \nwell. And perhaps some will have more to say about his service in the \npast, but I didn't want this opportunity to pass, because he has been \ntruly one of the great public servants to serve this country. I will \npersonally miss him in that position, and I personally wish him well.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, as I did in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, I cast my vote in favor of the confirmation of Dr. Rice to \nbe Secretary of State. I did so not because I endorse Dr. Rice's views \nbut because, barring serious concerns about a nominee's qualifications \nor serious ethical lapses, the President has the right to appoint \nCabinet officers who share his ideology and his perspective. In keeping \nwith Senate practices and precedents, my inclination is to give the \nPresident--any President--substantial deference in his Cabinet choices. \nI do not agree with many of the President's foreign policy choices. But \nas President, he generally has a right to a Cabinet that shares his \nperspective and agenda.\n  However, I want to be clear that I was troubled by some of Dr. Rice's \nstatements in the hearing. Our most senior diplomat, our emissary to \nthe entire world, should be able to represent our core values. Dr. \nRice's failure, and the failure of the administration, to categorically \nreject tactics\n\n[[Page S557]]\n\nthat the average American would acknowledge to be torture is more than \ndisappointing. It is dangerous, and it is shameful.\n  I also want to restate my view that the President's foreign policy \nover the last 4 years has been, on many fronts, misguided and self-\ndefeating. I have discussed these issues in much greater detail on the \nSenate floor and in the Foreign Relations Committee. I am troubled by \nthe damage done to our image around the world, I am concerned by our \nloss of focus in fighting terrorism, I am angry about the use of \nshifting justifications and faulty information to sell the war in Iraq, \nI am angry about the failure to plan for the fact that overthrowing a \nregime leads to disorder and disorder leads to looting, I am angry \nabout the official insistence on grossly underestimating the bill that \nwould be handed to the American taxpayer and then declining to budget \nfor this massive expense once its parameters became more clear, I am \nangry about the mismanagement of efforts to put a competent Iraqi \nsecurity force in place, I am angry about the woefully slow pace of \nreconstruction, and I am angry about this administration's failure to \nensure that our troops were adequately equipped for the circumstances \nin which they found themselves. Many people in this country and in this \nCongress are troubled not only by the mistakes, but by the fact that \nthere appears to be no real accountability for these failures.\n  At one point in the course of the hearing, Dr. Rice expressed some \nindignation regarding questions or remarks that she felt impugned her \ncredibility. Her credibility is a legitimate question. Dr. Rice made \nsweeping, public characterizations about aluminum tubes sought by Iraq \nbefore the war began that were, quite plainly, misleading. She \npermitted a reference to Iraq seeking uranium from Africa, a reference \nthat she knew the intelligence did not support, to be included in a \nmajor presidential address. She has a credibility problem, not just \namong skeptics in this country, but around the world. Once confirmed, \nDr. Rice will be accountable to Congress in a way that she was not as \nthe President's National Security Advisor. I hope that Dr. Rice fully \nunderstands her obligations to tell the duly elected representatives of \nthe American people the whole truth.\n  President Bush, like any President, is entitled to a Cabinet that \nreflects his views. But I will continue to oppose every bad policy, to \nquestion every baseless assertion, and to advocate for a wiser course \nthat will make our country more secure. The stakes for the current and \nfuture generations of Americans are far too high to do anything else.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I want to detail for the Senate the \nreasons why I voted to support the nomination of Condoleeza Rice to be \nour Nation's next Secretary of State. Her diverse professional \nbackground as a Professor at Stanford University specializing in \nRussian affairs, her time as President Bush's National Security \nAdvisor, and her demonstrated understanding of world affairs and \ndiplomacy qualify her to run the Department of State.\n  My support for Dr. Rice does not come without reservations about the \ndirection this administration has taken with regard to foreign policy. \nWe confront an enormous responsibility with respect to world affairs. \nThe individual charged with the running of the State Department will \nset the direction for our country's policies around the world. This \nperson will have the power to decide whether to nurture and develop, or \nhalt our Nation's great diplomatic efforts.\n  I hope Dr. Rice works to promote democracy throughout the world, not \njust by employing our ample military force, but that we seek to develop \ndemocracy organically, where it has not taken hold. Democracies will be \nmore receptive to our products, ideas and people, and our Nation should \napproach its foreign policy decisions with these long-term goals in \nmind. My State of Washington is heavily reliant on international trade, \nand we also create and circulate information in this age of high \ntechnology, which should be a principal part of our foreign policy \nstrategy.\n  The Senate does not, by confirming Dr. Rice, place the responsibility \nfor this country's diplomacy in the hands of a single individual. I do \nnot believe that the American people are ready to ignore the voices of \nour humanitarian community who remind us how fragile and vulnerable our \ninternational relationship can be. I am hopeful that these voices will \nbe heard by Dr. Rice. I am placing my trust in her that she will \nembrace her duty to take into account the future and foreseeable \nconsequences of her actions, and that she will be guided by the \nknowledge that this Senator will raise those consequences at all \nappropriate occasions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/26/senate-section/article/S557-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S557-S561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     RULES OF PROCEDURE--COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Except as provided in paragraph 3, in any case in which \n     a controversy arises as to the jurisdiction of any committee \n     with respect to any proposed legislation, the question of \n     jurisdiction shall be decided by the presiding officer, \n     without debate, in favor of the committee which has \n     jurisdiction over the subject matter which predominates in \n     such proposed legislation; but such decision shall be subject \n     to an appeal.\n       2. A motion simply to refer shall not be open to amendment, \n     except to add instructions.\n       3.

The motion shall be privileged, but it \n     shall not be in order until the Congressional Record in which \n     the notice is printed has been available to Senators for at \n     least twenty-four hours. No amendment to any such\n\n[[Page S559]]\n\n     motion shall be in order except amendments to any \n     instructions contained therein. Debate on any such motion, \n     and all amendments thereto and debatable motions and appeals \n     in connection therewith, shall be limited to not more than \n     two hours, the time to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the majority leader and the minority leader or \n     their designees.\n       (b) Proposed legislation which is referred to two or more \n     committees jointly may be reported only by such committees \n     jointly and only one report may accompany any proposed \n     legislation so jointly reported.\n       (c) A motion to refer any proposed legislation to two or \n     more committees sequentially shall specify the order of \n     referral.\n       (d) Any motion under this paragraph may specify the portion \n     or portions of proposed legislation to be considered by the \n     committees, or any of them, to which such proposed \n     legislation is referred, and such committees or committee \n     shall be limited, in the consideration of such proposed \n     legislation, to the portion or portions so specified.\n       (e) Any motion under this subparagraph may contain \n     instructions with respect to the time allowed for \n     consideration by the committees, or any of them, to which \n     proposed legislation is referred and the discharge of such \n     committees, or any of them, from further consideration of \n     such proposed legislation.\n       4. (a) All reports of committees and motions to discharge a \n     committee from the consideration of a subject, and all \n     subjects from which a committee shall be discharged, shall \n     lie over one day for consideration, unless by unanimous \n     consent the Senate shall otherwise direct.\n       (b) Whenever any committee (except the Committee on \n     Appropriations) has reported any measure, by action taken in \n     conformity with the requirements of paragraph 7 of rule XXVI, \n     no point of order shall lie with respect to that measure on \n     the ground that hearings upon that measure by the committee \n     were not conducted in accordance with the provisions of \n     paragraph 4 of rule XXVI.\n       5. Any measure or matter reported by any standing committee \n     shall not be considered in the Senate unless the report of \n     that committee upon that measure or matter has been available \n     to Members for at least two calendar days (excluding Sundays \n     and legal holidays) prior to the consideration of that \n     measure or matter. If hearings have been held on any such \n     measure or matter so reported, the committee reporting the \n     measure or matter shall make every reasonable effort to have \n     such hearings printed and available for distribution to the \n     Members of the Senate prior to the consideration of such \n     measure or matter in the Senate. This paragraph\n       (1) may be waived by joint agreement of the Majority Leader \n     and the Minority Leader of the Senate; and (2) shall not \n     apply to\n       (A) any measure for the declaration of war, or the \n     declaration of a national emergency, by the Congress, and\n       (B) any executive decision, determination, or action which \n     would become, or continue to be, effective unless disapproved \n     or otherwise invalidated by one or both Houses of Congress.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n                               Rule XXVI\n\n\n                          COMMITTEE PROCEDURE\n\n       1. Each standing committee, including any subcommittee of \n     any such committee, is authorized to hold such hearings, to \n     sit and act at such times and places during the sessions, \n     recesses, and adjourned periods of the Senate, to require by \n     subpoena or otherwise the attendance of such witnesses and \n     the production of such correspondence, books, papers, and \n     documents, to take such testimony and to make such \n     expenditures out of the contingent fund of the Senate as may \n     be authorized by resolutions of the Senate. Each such \n     committee may make investigations into any matter within its \n     jurisdiction, may report such hearings as may be had by it, \n     and may employ stenographic assistance at a cost not \n     exceeding the amount prescribed by the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration. The expenses of the committee shall be paid \n     from the contingent fund of the Senate upon vouchers approved \n     by the chairman.\n       2. Each committee shall adopt rules (not inconsistent with \n     the Rules of the Senate) governing the procedure of such \n     committee. The rules of each committee shall be published in \n     the Congressional Record not later than March 1 of the first \n     year of each Congress, except that if any such committee is \n     established on or after February 1 of a year, the rules of \n     that committee during the year of establishment shall be \n     published in the Congressional Record not later than sixty \n     days after such establishment. Any amendment to the rules of \n     a committee shall not take effect until the amendment is \n     published in the Congressional Record.\n       3. Each standing committee (except the Committee on \n     Appropriations) shall fix regular weekly, biweekly, or \n     monthly meeting days for the transaction of business before \n     the committee and additional meetings may be called by the \n     chairman as he may deem necessary. If at least three \n     members of any such committee desire that a special \n     meeting of the committee be called by the chairman, those \n     members may file in the offices of the committee their \n     written request to the chairman for that special meeting. \n     Immediately upon the filing of the request, the clerk of \n     the committee shall notify the chairman of the filing of \n     the request. If, within three calendar days after the \n     filing of the request, the chairman does not call the \n     requested special meeting, to be held within seven \n     calendar days after the filing of the request, a majority \n     of the members of the committee may file in the offices of \n     the committee their written notice that a special meeting \n     of the committee will be held, specifying the date and \n     hour of that special meeting. The committee shall meet on \n     that date and hour. Immediately upon the filing of the \n     notice, the clerk of the committee shall notify all \n     members of the committee that such special meeting will be \n     held and inform them of its date and hour. If the chairman \n     of any such committee is not present at any regular, \n     additional, or special meeting of the committee, the \n     ranking member of the majority party on the committee who \n     is present shall preside at that meeting.\n       4. (a) Each committee (except the Committee on \n     Appropriations and the Committee on the Budget) shall make \n     public announcement of the date, place, and subject matter of \n     any hearing to be conducted by the committee on any measure \n     or matter at least one week before the commencement of that \n     hearing unless the committee determines that there is good \n     cause to begin such hearing at an earlier date.\n       (b) Each committee (except the Committee on Appropriations) \n     shall require each witness who is to appear before the \n     committee in any hearing to file with the clerk of the \n     committee, at least one day before the date of the appearance \n     of that witness, a written statement of his proposed \n     testimony unless the committee chairman and the ranking \n     minority member determine that there is good cause for \n     noncompliance. If so requested by any committee, the staff of \n     the committee shall prepare for the use of the members of the \n     committee before each day of hearing before the committee a \n     digest of the statements which have been so filed by \n     witnesses who are to appear before the committee on that day.\n       (c) After the conclusion of each day of hearing, if so \n     requested by any committee, the staff shall prepare for the \n     use of the members of the committee a summary of the \n     testimony given before the committee on that day. After \n     approval by the chairman and the ranking minority member of \n     the committee, each such summary may be printed as a part of \n     the committee hearings if such hearings are ordered by the \n     committee to be printed.\n       (d) Whenever any hearing is conducted by a committee \n     (except the Committee on Appropriations) upon any measure or \n     matter, the minority on the committee shall be entitled, upon \n     request made by a majority of the minority members to the \n     chairman before the completion of such hearing, to call \n     witnesses selected by the minority to testify with respect to \n     the measure or matter during at least one day of hearing \n     thereon.\n       5. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of the rules, \n     when the Senate is in session, no committee of the Senate or \n     any subcommittee thereof may meet, without special leave, \n     after the conclusion of the first two hours after the meeting \n     of the Senate commenced and in no case after two o'clock \n     postmeridian unless consent therefor has been obtained from \n     the majority leader and the minority leader (or in the event \n     of the absence of either of such leaders, from his designee). \n     The prohibition contained in the preceding sentence shall not \n     apply to the Committee on Appropriations or the Committee on \n     the Budget. The majority leader or his designee shall \n     announce to the Senate whenever consent has been given under \n     this subparagraph and shall state the time and place of such \n     meeting. The right to make such announcement of consent shall \n     have the same priority as the filing of a cloture motion.\n       (b) Each meeting of a committee, or any subcommittee \n     thereof, including meetings to conduct hearings, shall be \n     open to the public, except that a meeting or series of \n     meetings by a committee or a subcommittee thereof on the same \n     subject for a period of no more than fourteen calendar days \n     may be closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to \n     go into closed session to discuss only whether the matters \n     enumerated in clauses (1) through (6) would require the \n     meeting to be closed, followed immediately by a record vote \n     in open session by a majority of the members of the committee \n     or subcommittee when it is determined that the matters to be \n     discussed or the testimony to be taken at such meeting or \n     meetings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of the foreign relations of the United States;\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of committee staff \n     personnel or internal staff management or procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise to expose an individual to \n     public contempt or obloquy, or will represent a clearly \n     unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of any informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     of financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n\n[[Page S560]]\n\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person; or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations.\n       (c) Whenever any hearing conducted by any such committee or \n     subcommittee is open to the public, that hearing may be \n     broadcast by radio or television, or both, under such rules \n     as the committee or subcommittee may adopt.\n       (d) Whenever disorder arises during a committee meeting \n     that is open to the public, or any demonstration of approval \n     or disapproval is indulged in by any person in attendance at \n     any such meeting, it shall be the duty of the Chair to \n     enforce order on his own initiative and without any point of \n     order being made by a Senator. When the Chair finds it \n     necessary to maintain order, he shall have the power to clear \n     the room, and the committee may act in closed session for so \n     long as there is doubt of the assurance of order.\n       (e) Each committee shall prepare and keep a complete \n     transcript or electronic recording adequate to fully record \n     the proceeding of each meeting or conference whether or not \n     such meeting or any part thereof is closed under this \n     paragraph, unless a majority of its members vote to forgo \n     such a record.\n       6. Morning meetings of committees and subcommittees thereof \n     shall be scheduled for one or both of the periods prescribed \n     in this paragraph. The first period shall end at eleven \n     o'clock antemeridian. The second period shall begin at eleven \n     o'clock antemeridian and end at two o'clock postmeridian.\n       7. (a)(1) Except as provided in this paragraph, each \n     committee, and each subcommittee thereof is authorized to fix \n     the number of its members (but not less than one-third of its \n     entire membership) who shall constitute a quorum thereof for \n     the transaction of such business as may be considered by said \n     committee, except that no measure or matter or recommendation \n     shall be reported from any committee unless a majority of the \n     committee were physically present.\n       (2) Each such committee, or subcommittee, is authorized to \n     fix a lesser number than one-third of its entire membership \n     who shall constitute a quorum thereof for the purpose of \n     taking sworn testimony.\n       (3) The vote of any committee to report a measure or matter \n     shall require the concurrence of a majority of the members of \n     the committee who are present. No vote of any member of any \n     committee to report a measure or matter may be cast by proxy \n     if rules adopted by such committee forbid the casting of \n     votes for that purpose by proxy; however, proxies may not be \n     voted when the absent committee member has not been informed \n     of the matter on which he is being recorded and has not \n     affirmatively requested that he be so recorded. Action by any \n     committee in reporting any measure or matter in accordance \n     with the requirements of this subparagraph shall constitute \n     the ratification by the committee of all action theretofore \n     taken by the committee with respect to that measure or \n     matter, including votes taken upon the measure or matter or \n     any amendment thereto, and no point of order shall lie with \n     respect to that measure or matter on the ground that such \n     previous action with respect thereto by such committee was \n     not taken in compliance with such requirements.\n       (b) Each committee (except the Committee on Appropriations) \n     shall keep a complete record of all committee action. Such \n     record shall include a record of the votes on any question on \n     which a record vote is demanded. The results of rollcall \n     votes taken in any meeting of any committee upon any measure, \n     or any amendment thereto, shall be announced in the committee \n     report on that measure unless previously announced by the \n     committee, and such announcement shall include a tabulation \n     of the votes cast in favor of and the votes cast in \n     opposition to each such measure and amendment by each member \n     of the committee who was present at that meeting.\n       (c) Whenever any committee by rollcall vote reports any \n     measure or matter, the report of the committee upon such \n     measure or matter shall include a tabulation of the votes \n     cast by each member of the committee in favor of and in \n     opposition to such measure or matter. Nothing contained in \n     this subparagraph shall abrogate the power of any committee \n     to adopt rules--\n       (1) providing for proxy voting on all matters other than \n     the reporting of a measure or matter, or\n       (2) providing in accordance with subparagraph (a) for a \n     lesser number as a quorum for any action other than the \n     reporting of a measure or matter.\n       8. (a) In order to assist the Senate in--\n       (1) its analysis, appraisal, and evaluation of the \n     application, administration, and execution of the laws \n     enacted by the Congress, and\n       (2) its formulation, consideration, and enactment of such \n     modifications of or changes in those laws, and of such \n     additional legislation, as may be necessary or appropriate,\n\n     each standing committee (except the Committees on \n     Appropriations and the Budget), shall review and study, on a \n     continuing basis the application, administration, and \n     execution of those laws, or parts of laws, the subject matter \n     of which is within the legislative jurisdiction of that \n     committee. Such committees may carry out the required \n     analysis, appraisal, and evaluation themselves, or by \n     contract, or may require a Government agency to do so and \n     furnish a report thereon to the Senate. Such committees may \n     rely on such techniques as pilot testing, analysis of costs \n     in comparison with benefits, or provision for evaluation \n     after a defined period of time.\n       (b) In each odd-numbered year, each such committee shall \n     submit, not later than March 31, to the Senate, a report on \n     the activities of that committee under this paragraph during \n     the Congress ending at noon on January 3 of such year.\n       9. (a) Except as provided in subparagraph (b), each \n     committee shall report one authorization resolution each year \n     authorizing the committee to make expenditures out of the \n     contingent fund of the Senate to defray its expenses, \n     including the compensation of members of its staff and agency \n     contributions related to such compensation, during the period \n     beginning on March 1 of such year and ending on the last day \n     of February of the following year. Such annual authorization \n     resolution shall be reported not later than January 31 of \n     each year, except that, whenever the designation of members \n     of standing committees of the Senate occurs during the first \n     session of a Congress at a date later than January 20, such \n     resolution may be reported at any time within thirty days \n     after the date on which the designation of such members is \n     completed. After the annual authorization resolution of a \n     committee for a year has been agreed to, such committee may \n     procure authorization to make additional expenditures out of \n     the contingent fund of the Senate during that year only by \n     reporting a supplemental authorization resolution. Each \n     supplemental authorization resolution reported by a \n     committee shall amend the annual authorization resolution \n     of such committee for that year and shall be accompanied \n     by a report specifying with particularity the purpose for \n     which such authorization is sought and the reason why such \n     authorization could not have been sought at the time of \n     the submission by such committee of its annual \n     authorization resolution for that year.\n       (b) In lieu of the procedure provided in subparagraph (a), \n     the Committee on Rules and Administration may--\n       (1) direct each committee to report an authorization \n     resolution for a two-year budget period beginning on March 1 \n     of the first session of a Congress; and\n       (2) report one authorization resolution containing more \n     than one committee authorization resolution for a one-year or \n     two-year budget period.\n       10. (a) All committee hearings, records, data, charts, and \n     files shall be kept separate and distinct from the \n     congressional office records of the Member serving as \n     chairman of the committee; and such records shall be the \n     property of the Senate and all members of the committee and \n     the Senate shall have access to such records. Each committee \n     is authorized to have printed and bound such testimony and \n     other data presented at hearings held by the committee.\n       (b) It shall be the duty of the chairman of each committee \n     to report or cause to be reported promptly to the Senate any \n     measure approved by his committee and to take or cause to be \n     taken necessary steps to bring the matter to a vote. In any \n     event, the report of any committee upon a measure which has \n     been approved by the committee shall be filed within seven \n     calendar days (exclusive of days on which the Senate is not \n     in session) after the day on which there has been filed with \n     the clerk of the committee a written and signed request of a \n     majority of the committee for the reporting of that measure. \n     Upon the filing of any such request, the clerk of the \n     committee shall transmit immediately to the chairman of the \n     committee notice of the filing of that request. This \n     subparagraph does not apply to the Committee on \n     Appropriations.\n       (c) If at the time of approval of a measure or matter by \n     any committee (except for the Committee on Appropriations), \n     any member of the committee gives notice of intention to file \n     supplemental, minority, or additional views, that member \n     shall be entitled to not less than three calendar days in \n     which to file such views, in writing, with the clerk of the \n     committee. All such views so filed by one or more members of \n     the committee shall be included within, and shall be a part \n     of, the report filed by the committee with respect to that \n     measure or matter. The report of the committee upon that \n     measure or matter shall be printed in a single volume which--\n       (1) shall include all supplemental, minority, or additional \n     views which have been submitted by the time of the filing of \n     the report, and\n       (2) shall bear upon its cover a recital that supplemental, \n     minority, or additional views are included as part of the \n     report.\n       This subparagraph does not preclude--\n       (A) the immediate filing and printing of a committee report \n     unless timely request for the opportunity to file \n     supplemental, minority, or additional views has been made as \n     provided by this subparagraph; or\n       (B) the filing by any such committee of any supplemental \n     report upon any measure or matter which may be required for \n     the correction of any technical error in a previous report \n     made by that committee upon that measure or matter.\n\n[[Page S561]]\n\n       11. (a) The report accompanying each bill or joint \n     resolution of a public character reported by any committee \n     (except the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on \n     the Budget) shall contain--\n       (1) an estimate, made by such committee, of the costs which \n     would be incurred in carrying out such bill or joint \n     resolution in the fiscal year in which it is reported and in \n     each of the five fiscal years following such fiscal year (or \n     for the authorized duration of any program authorized by such \n     bill or joint resolution, if less than five years), except \n     that, in the case of measures affecting the revenues, such \n     reports shall require only an estimate of the gain or loss in \n     revenues for a one year period; and\n       (2) a comparison of the estimate of costs described in \n     subparagraph (1) made by such committee with any estimate of \n     costs made by any Federal agency; or\n       (3) in lieu of such estimate or comparison, or both, a \n     statement of the reasons why compliance by the committee with \n     the requirements of subparagraph (1) or (2), or both, is \n     impracticable.\n       (b) Each such report (except those by the Committee on \n     Appropriations) shall also contain--\n       (1) an evaluation, made by such committee, of the \n     regulatory impact which would be incurred in carrying out the \n     bill or joint resolution. The evaluation shall include (A) an \n     estimate of the numbers of individuals and businesses who \n     would be regulated and a determination of the groups and \n     classes of such individuals and businesses, (B) a \n     determination of the economic impact of such regulation on \n     the individuals, consumers, and businesses affected, (C) a \n     determination of the impact on the personal privacy of the \n     individuals affected, and (D) a determination of the amount \n     of additional paperwork that will result from the regulations \n     to be promulgated pursuant to the bill or joint resolution, \n     which determination may include, but need not be limited to, \n     estimates of the amount of time and financial costs required \n     of affected parties, showing whether the effects of the bill \n     or joint resolution could be substantial, as well as \n     reasonable estimates of the recordkeeping requirements that \n     may be associated with the bill or joint resolution; or\n       (2) in lieu of such evaluation, a statement of the reasons \n     why compliance by the committee with the requirements of \n     clause (1) is impracticable.\n       (c) It shall not be in order for the Senate to consider any \n     such bill or joint resolution if the report of the committee \n     on such bill or joint resolution does not comply with the \n     provisions of subparagraphs (a) and (b) on the objection of \n     any Senator.\n       12. Whenever a committee reports a bill or a joint \n     resolution repealing or amending any statute or part thereof \n     it shall make a report thereon and shall include in such \n     report or in an accompanying document (to be prepared by the \n     staff of such committee) (a) the text of the statute or part \n     thereof which is proposed to be repealed; and (b) a \n     comparative print of that part of the bill or joint \n     resolution making the amendment and of the statute or part \n     thereof proposed to be amended, showing by stricken through \n     type and italics, parallel columns, or other appropriate \n     typographical devices the omissions and insertions which \n     would be made by the bill or joint resolution if enacted in \n     the form recommended by the committee.

Childress\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Terre \nHaute. SGT Kyle W. Childress, 29 years old, died on January 21 when he \nwas attacked by enemy forces using small arms fire in Ad Duluiyah. With \nhis entire life before him, Kyle risked everything to fight for the \nvalues Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the \nworld.\n  After graduating from Terre Haute South Vigo High School in 1994, \nKyle followed in his father's footsteps by joining the Army. According \nto family and friends, Kyle was a calm and easygoing young man whose \ndecision to join one of the most challenging divisions of the Armed \nForces was a surprise. Nevertheless, his mother told the Terre Haute \nTribune Star that her son ``was proud'' of what he signed up to do.\n  Kyle was the 44th Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving his \ncountry in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was assigned to A Troop, 1st \nSquadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, Schweinfurt, \nGermany. This brave young soldier leaves behind his mother, Nancy \nKnight; his father, Keith Childress; his sister, Gretta; and his \nbrother, Jason.\n  Today, I join Kyle's family, his friends and the entire Terre Haute \ncommunity in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow \nover this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely \nfighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and \nstrength of character that people will remember when they think of \nKyle, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days of \nconflict and grief.\n  Kyle was known for his dedication to family and his love of country. \nHis brother Jason told the Terre Haute Tribune Star that Kyle had been \nmore than a brother to him, that he was his best friend. Jason recalled \nthat Kyle had been his role model, ``He's the one who pretty much made \nme the person I am today.'' Today and always, Kyle\n\n[[Page S563]]\n\nwill be remembered by family members, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a \ntrue American hero, and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully \nserving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Kyle's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Kyle's actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Kyle Childress in the official \nrecord of the Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think \nabout this just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain \nthat comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like \nKyle's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, \n``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away \ntears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Kyle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/26/senate-section/article/S563-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             JOHNNY CARSON\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity \nto speak today about a fellow Nebraskan who not only gave back to his \nState, but gave much more in ways of laughter to all of America. I am \nspeaking of Johnny Carson, beloved by his family and friends, cherished \nby fans, and respected by his fellow comedians. Johnny Carson was a man \nwhose comedic talent always looked effortless, yet set the highest of \nstandards for his performances. Mr. Carson passed away at the age of \n79.\n  Mr. Carson took over the ``Tonight Show'' in 1962, and preferring to \nretire at the top of his game, voluntarily stepped down in 1992. For 30 \nyears, Johnny Carson tucked Americans into their beds all the while \nmaking them laugh before they shut their eyes to sleep. Between 10 to \n15 million people watched Johnny deliver his hilarious monologue each \nnight.\n  Mr. Carson should be honored not only for all the laughter he brought \nto so many American homes, but also all that he brought to his \nhometown, Norfolk, NE. Johnny Carson was and will remain Nebraska's \nfavorite native son. He always remembered his roots, and often made \nvisits home to ``give back'' to his humble, rural community which he \nloved. There is no question that all of Norfolk loved him back. He was \na philanthropist, a father, a son and to most, a cherished nightly \nfriend.\n  Mr. Carson shielded his political views as carefully as he did his \nprivate life, insisting that the only message of his show was \nentertainment. Johnny Carson is a man that could bring people together, \nregardless of political or religious affiliation, regardless of race or \ngender; he was a man of character. He will be remembered and recognized \ntoday and always as a man who gave his all and never forgot the few.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/26/senate-section/article/S563-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE EXONERATED\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I normally do not do movie reviews, but for \nthis Thursday's premiere of ``The Exonerated'' on CourtTV, I feel \ncompelled to make an exception. ``The Exonerated'' tells the harrowing \ntrue stories of six innocent people who were convicted and sentenced to \ndeath.\n  Since February 2000, I have worked to prevent more innocents from \nmeeting the same fate, and last year the Innocence Protection Act was \nfinally passed and signed into law. The reforms it enacts will create a \nfairer system of justice, where the problems that have sent innocent \npeople to death row are less likely to occur, where the American people \ncan be more certain that violent criminals are caught and convicted \ninstead of the innocent people who have been wrongly put behind bars \nfor their crimes, and where victims and their families can be more \ncertain of the accuracy, and finality, of the results.\n  The film of ``The Exonerated'' was adapted from a play of the same \ntitle by Jessica Blank and Erik Jensen, which was performed last year \nat the Kennedy Center. Those who were unable to see the play will have \nthe chance to watch the movie on CourtTV this Thursday, January 27, at \n9 p.m.\n  Since 1973, some 117 innocent people have been released from death \nrow with evidence of their innocence. Six of these stories are told in \n``The Exonerated.'' While the Innocence Protection Act passed with \noverwhelming bipartisan support in both the House and Senate, the task \nbefore us remains getting the new law funded. Watching these true-life \naccounts will help explain why funding the Innocence Protection Act \nshould be a high priority that Congress and the administration must not \nignore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/26/senate-section/article/S563-3", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S563-S565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nVOTING OPPORTUNITY AND TECHNOLOGY ENHANCEMENT RIGHTS ACT OF 2005 (VOTER \n                                  ACT)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as we approach the historic elections in \nIraq this week, it is important that we pause and take stock of our own \nelections process here in the United States. There is already much we \ncan learn from the Iraqi experiment in democracy that can broaden and \nstrengthen the participation of our own citizens in their democracy \nhere in America. And in light of the continuing barriers that American \ncitizens found at polling places across this Nation last November, we \ncannot rest on the laurels of past legislation. We must continue to \nstrive to provide an equal opportunity for all citizens to participate \nin their democracy by voting and having their vote counted.\n  For that reason, on Monday, I was pleased to introduce S. 17, the \nVoting Opportunity and Technology Enhancement Rights Act of 2005--the \nVOTER Act. I am grateful to the Democratic Leader, Harry Reid, for \nincluding this comprehensive initiative in his leadership package of \nDemocratic legislative priorities for the 109th Congress. There is \nnothing more fundamental to the vitality and endurance of a democracy \nof the people, by people, and for the people, than the people's right \nto vote. In the words of Thomas Paine:\n\n       The right of voting for representatives is the primary \n     right by which other rights are protected.\n\n  With regard to the Iraqi elections, President Bush has made his goal \nfor this initial act of democracy clear: he wants as full participation \nin the vote as possible. In his words, he wants ``everybody to vote.'' \nWhile that is a laudable goal for a fledgling democracy, it should be \nthe standard for a democracy that has existed for nearly two and one-\nquarter centuries. Regrettably, we have not yet reached that standard. \nIn the 2000 presidential election, 51.2 percent of the eligible \nAmerican electorate voted. And although in the 2004 presidential \nelection voting participation reached its highest level since 1968, \nstill, only 60.7 percent of the eligible Americans voted.\n  While there are many reasons why ``everybody'' does not vote in \nAmerica, we learned from the 2000 presidential elections that many \ncitizens cannot vote and have their vote counted because they are \nimproperly removed from registration rolls, do not have access to \naccessible voting systems and ballots, and lack confidence in \nantiquated and error-prone machines and State administrative \nprocedures. In response to those concerns, Congress enacted \noverwhelmingly bipartisan legislation--the Help America Vote Act of \n2002, or HAVA. For the first time in our history, that landmark \nlegislation established the role of the Federal Government in \nadministering and funding Federal elections. The twin goals of this act \nare to make it easier to vote and harder to defraud the system.\n  On the day that the Senate adopted its version of HAVA, I noted that \nthe Senate bill was a bipartisan compromise and the culmination of the \nhard work of a dedicated group of Senators, including my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senator McConnell and Senator Bond, and others. But I also \nnoted that the compromise was just that--it was not everything that all \nof us wanted, but it was something that everyone wanted. That was \nequally true of the final HAVA compromise on election reform.\n\n[[Page S564]]\n\n  While many of the most important reforms in HAVA do not have to be \nimplemented by the States until the 2006 Federal elections, the 2004 \npresidential election raised both continuing and new concerns. And the \nmost important of these concerns are either not addressed by HAVA at \nall, or in some few instances, may actually be the result of HAVA. The \nfact that barely over one-half of the eligible voting age population \nvoted in 2004 underscores the reality that not everybody votes in \nAmerica. We must do better, and we can.\n  At a time when our Nation and its leaders are building a new \ndemocracy in Iraq, we must not forget that building democracy begins at \nhome. Just as eligible Iraqis, in this first post-Saddam election, are \nable to fully participate in democracy by voting from across the globe, \nso should eligible American voters be able to fully participate in \ndemocracy by voting from across the globe. Just as Iraqi voters will be \nable to vote prior to election day at early voting sites, so should \nAmerican voters be able to participate in early voting. If Iraqis can \nregister to vote on election day, then American voters should be able \nto register to vote on election day.\n  Building democracy must begin at home. The legislation I introduced \nthis week will provide American voters with many of the same rights and \nopportunities to participate in democracy that Iraqi voters have been \ngiven with the support of the blood, sweat and tears of American \nsoldiers--and the resources of American taxpayers.\n  The Voting Opportunity and Technology Enhancement Rights Act of 2005, \nor the VOTER Act, provides every eligible American, regardless of where \nthey live in the world or where they find themselves on election day, \nthe right to cast a National Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot in \nFederal elections. This new national absentee ballot extends to all \ncitizens the same right to a Federal absentee ballot that overseas and \nactive military voters currently have. Beginning with Federal elections \nin 2007, every State shall provide early voting opportunities for a \nminimum of 15 days prior to election day, including Saturdays. \nBeginning in 2007, any otherwise eligible voter must be allowed to \nregister to vote on election day and have that vote counted in Federal \nelections.\n  Additionally, the VOTER Act addresses many of the recurring, and new, \nbarriers to voting that voters faced at the polls last November. It \nrequires that a State count a provisional ballot for Federal office \ncast within the State by an otherwise eligible voter, notwithstanding \nthe polling place in which the ballot is cast.\n  HAVA established a uniform national right for every voter in a \nFederal election to receive and cast a provisional ballot. This new \nright was intended to ensure that no otherwise eligible voter could be \nturned away from the polls because of an administrative error, or other \nchallenge. But in 2004, we saw this right eroded by States and applied \nin non-uniform ways. Some States, such as Ohio, initially interpreted \nHAVA to require that a voter be in their correct precinct in order to \ncast a Federal provisional ballot. Other States, such as Iowa, \ninterpreted the same HAVA language to allow challenged voters to cast a \nprovisional ballot in their county of residence. Whether or not the \nprovisional ballot was ultimately counted turned solely on State law. \nThe VOTER Act ensures that eligible voters who cast a provisional \nballot for Federal office will have that ballot counted in a uniform \nmanner.\n  The VOTER Act requires that each State provide a minimum required \nnumber of voting systems and poll workers for each polling place on \nelection day and during early voting, consistent with mandatory \nstandards established by the Election Assistance Commission--EAC.\n  On election day there was a recurring problem across the country of \nlong lines and disenfranchised voters because of too few voting systems \nor ballots at polling places and too few poll workers to assist voters. \nThis requirement becomes effective for Federal elections on or after \nJanuary 1, 2007.\n  To ensure that all voters have an equal opportunity to independently \nverify their ballot before it is cast and counted, the VOTER Act \nrequires that by 2009, all States provide voters a voter-verified \nballot with a choice of at least four formats for recording their \nverification: a paper record; an audio record; a pictorial record; and \nan electronic record or other means which is fully accessible to the \ndisabled, including the blind and visually impaired.\n  HAVA already requires that all voting systems provide the voter an \nopportunity to verify their ballot before it is cast and counted. HAVA \nalso requires that all voting systems produce a permanent paper record \nfor audit purposes. However, HAVA does not spell out how that \nverification is to be achieved to ensure security and independence of \nthe voter's choice.\n  Some have called on Congress to require a voter-verified paper \nballot. Such is inherently discriminatory against the disabled, \nparticularly the blind and visually-impaired. HAVA already requires \nthat all voters, regardless of disability, be able to verify their \nballots. With current and developing technology, it is simply \nunacceptable, and unnecessary, to discriminate against any voter by \nrequiring that such verification be in paper form.\n  For good reason, many in the disabled community believe that \nadditional election reform legislation will deter State and local \nadministrators from complying with the existing deadlines under HAVA. \nWhile they oppose any such efforts, to the extent that legislation is \nproposed regarding the voter verified ballot, they support this \napproach which assures full accessibility for all voters.\n  While I had hoped that the EAC would have addressed this issue in the \nvoluntary voting system standards required under HAVA to be issued last \nyear, those standards have yet to be issued. I encourage the EAC to \nincorporate guidance for fully accessible voter verified ballots in the \nsection 301 Voting System Standards to be issued this year.\n  The VOTER Act also addresses the continuing problem of minority \ndisenfranchisement through last-minute purges of voter registration \nlists by requiring States to provide public notice of any such purges \nnot later than 45 days before a Federal election.\n  To expedite the studies called for under HAVA for establishing \nelection day as a Federal holiday, the VOTER Act requires the EAC to \ncomplete its study and issue recommendations within 6 months of \nenactment and earmarks funds within the EAC budget solely for this \npurpose.\n  The VOTER Act includes amendments to HAVA that build on the existing \nvoting system requirements to ensure that all voting systems, including \npunch cards and central count optical scan machines, provide voters \nwith actual notice of over-votes. Also, beginning in 2009, States must \nallow for voter registration through the Internet.\n  The VOTER Act also includes provisions to ensure both the security \nand uniform treatment of voter registration applications by requiring \nthat all voters sign an affidavit attesting to both their citizenship \nand age, in lieu of the HAVA requirements for a check-off box alone, \neffective in 2007.\n  HAVA requires that voter registration forms include questions \nregarding citizenship and age with check-off boxes that applicants use \nto indicate whether or not they meet eligibility requirements. States \nare further required to contact any applicant who does not fill in the \nboxes in order to complete the form. However, in the 2004 elections, \nStates implemented this requirement in widely varying ways, resulting \nin non-uniform treatment of voters in Federal elections.\n  In some cases, States refused to process the form and failed to \ncontact the voter. In other States, voters who had submitted incomplete \nforms were asked to complete those forms at the polling place. While \nthe twin purposes of HAVA were to make it easier to vote and harder to \ndefraud the system, as implemented this requirement achieves neither \npurpose.\n  This requirement further resulted in disenfranchising voters who \nfailed to check a box but nonetheless signed an affidavit, under \npenalty of perjury, attesting to both their citizenship and age. With \nthe implementation of statewide voter registration lists, the check-off \nbox requirement is unnecessary and burdensome to both voters and \nelection administrators.\n\n[[Page S565]]\n\n  To ensure that the implementation of the voter identification \nrequirements in HAVA do not make it harder to vote, the VOTER Act \nexpands the forms of identification that can be used to establish \nidentity for first-time voters who submit their voter registration by \nmail to include an affidavit executed by the voter attesting to his or \nher identity, generally subject to penalties for perjury under State \nlaw.\n  The VOTER Act also responds to concerns first raised in the 2000 \nPresidential election in Florida, and echoed again in the 2004 \nelection, regarding the appearance of impartiality by State election \nofficials who were otherwise active in Federal campaigns. The bill \nimposes new accountability and transparency requirements on States, \nbeginning in 2007, including a public notice requirement of any changes \nin State law affecting the administration of elections, such as changes \nin polling places and actions denying access to polling place \nobservers.\n  To ensure the independence of the Election Assistance Commission, and \nthe timely issuance of guidance and standards, the bill provides the \nagency with independent budget authority and the authority to issue \nmandatory standards to implement the new requirements.\n  Finally, in recognition of the inherent role of the States in the \nadministration of Federal elections, the VOTER Act provides additional \nFederal funds for the State requirement grants under HAVA to implement \nthe new requirements.\n  While Congress accomplished much with the passage of the Help America \nVote Act following the debacle of the 2000 Presidential election, 4 \nyears later in the 2004 election, voters faced many of the same \nbarriers to voting that HAVA promised to remove. As Iraqis go to the \npolls this week, let us assure our own citizens that we have done all \nwe can to ensure that every eligible American voter has an equal \nopportunity to cast a vote and have that vote counted in Federal \nelections.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a brief section-by-section analysis be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    S. 17, Voting Opportunity and Technology Enhancement Act of 2005\n\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Sec. 1.--Title;

PRINCIPI\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to honor Secretary \nPrincipi for his diligent and effective tenure as the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Veterans' Affairs. Secretary Principi has served our \nNation during a historic time, and has done an impressive job with one \nof the most challenging positions in the government. I am proud to have \nworked with him.\n  When I travel around the State of Texas, I am reminded of the work \nSecretary Principi has done on behalf of veterans. He was always \navailable to discuss the needs of Texas veterans and provided an open \ndialogue to our communities. I am particularly grateful for the time he \nspent with me touring VA facilities in Texas to learn what was \nimportant to our veterans. Over the years, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs and the veterans it serves have been severely challenged by the \nskyrocketing costs of healthcare and the surging demand for services \nfrom an aging veteran population. Throughout his time at the \nDepartment, Secretary Principi worked to ensure healthcare \naccessibility was a priority. Across the country, the VA has opened 194 \ncommunity clinics and 87 percent of the veteran population now lives \nwithin 30 minutes of a VA medical facility. Additionally, under \nSecretary Principi's leadership, the Department reduced the number of \nveterans waiting more than 6 months for primary care and cut in\n\n[[Page S566]]\n\nhalf the wait time for an appointment. These important accomplishments \nhave improved the healthcare for our service men and women.\n  Secretary Principi also understood the importance of further \ninvestigating the causes of Gulf War Illness. He kept his promise to \nattend a meeting in Texas with Dr. Robert Haley, a world renowned \nresearcher on the issue of Gulf War Illness. After meeting with Dr. \nHaley, Secretary Principi recognized the need for a study on this \nillness, which ultimately led to the dedication of $60 million over the \nnext 4 years for research. We cannot thank him enough for his \nleadership and attention to this important issue.\n  I thank Secretary Principi for his tireless service to the veterans \nof Texas and throughout the United States. He and his work will not be \nforgotten by a grateful Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/26/senate-section/article/S566-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         COMMON SENSE REGULATION OF FIFTY CALIBER SNIPER RIFLES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the CBS news program ``60 Minutes'' \nrecently aired a segment regarding the dangers that .50 caliber sniper \nrifles pose to the security of our Nation. In previous Congresses, I \nhave cosponsored legislation to enact common sense regulation of these \ndangerous weapons. Unfortunately, the Congress has thus far failed to \nact. I am hopeful that the 109th Congress will address this issue for \nthe safety of all Americans.\n  The .50 caliber sniper rifle is a favorite weapon of militaries \naround the world and is also among the most powerful weapons legally \navailable to private individuals in the United States. According to a \nreport released by the Violence Policy Center last year, a .50 caliber \nsniper rifle is capable of accurately hitting a target over 1,500 yards \naway, and the ammunition available for the rifle includes armor-\npiercing, incendiary, and explosive bullets. The report also cites the \nU.S. Army's manual on urban combat, which states that .50 caliber \nsniper rifles are designed to attack bulk fuel tanks and other high-\nvalue targets from a distance using ``their ability to break through \nall but the thickest shielding material.''\n  The previously mentioned ``60 Minutes'' program highlighted various \nthreats that military style .50 caliber sniper rifles pose to \ncivilians. One serious threat reported on the program is the \nvulnerability of commercial aircraft to terrorists with .50 caliber \nsniper rifles. This threat was previously addressed in a 1999 report by \nthe minority staff of the House Government Reform Committee, which \nnoted that the thumb-sized bullets fired by .50 caliber rifles can \neasily punch through aircraft fuselages, fuel tanks, and engines. \nPolice Commissioner Ray Kelly of New York City referred to these \npotential threats by saying, ``Clearly, with the range that it has, and \nthe impact capability that it has, it would put an airliner or an \nairplane at risk if it hit that plane.''\n  So the easy availability of the .50 caliber sniper rifle poses a \ndanger to airline safety, as well as our overall security. Last \nSeptember, California became the first and so far only State in the \ncountry to ban the manufacture, sale, distribution, or importation of \n.50 caliber sniper rifles. Unfortunately, there are few Federal \nregulations to protect the rest of the Nation from these dangerous \nweapons. Buyers need only be 18 years old, rather than the 21 years of \nage required for handgun purchases. And there is no minimum age \nrequirement for possession of a .50 caliber weapon and no regulation on \nsecond hand sales.\n  In an interview which became part of the ``60 minutes'' report, the \ninventor and current manufacturer of the .50 caliber sniper rifle, \nRonnie Barrett, described his product as ``a high-end adult \nrecreational toy.'' When asked how he came up with the idea for the \nrifle, Mr. Barrett replied, ``I was just a 26 year-old kid, and didn't \nknow any better.''\n  Mr. President, we should know better. The time has come to classify \nthese weapons in the same common sense manner that we classify other \nweapons of war, including machine guns. The 109th Congress should \nfollow California's good example and pass reasonable legislation that \nchanges the way .50 caliber guns are regulated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/26/senate-section/article/S566-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S566-S567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    GLOBAL TSUNAMI DETECTION SYSTEM.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I would like to comment today on S. 50, the \nTsunami Preparedness Act of 2005, a timely and much-needed bill in the \naftermath of the devastating tsunami in the Indian Ocean. The world has \nlearned valuable lessons in the past month about human suffering and \nloss, as well as generosity and good fortune in the face of impossible \nodds. We have also learned a great deal about the generation of \ntsunamis, the need to instrument the ocean, and the need to assist in \nthe development of a warning and civil defense system for vulnerable \nnations around the world.\n  I joined my colleagues Senators Dan Inouye and Ted Sevens, the \nranking member and chair, respectively, of the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation, as an original cosponsor of S. 50, the \nTsunami Preparedness Act of 2005, which was introduced on Monday, \nJanuary 24, 2005. The bill would authorize, expand, and improve our \ndomestic tsunami warning system. Equally importantly, it would \nauthorize the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, NOAA, to provide technical assistance and advice to \nappropriate international entities in developing a global tsunami \nwarning system comprised of regional warning networks, modeled on the \nTsunami Warning System of the Pacific. We must share our expertise and \nexperience with other tsunami-prone nations around the world.\n  My conviction is based on personal experience. In Hawaii, tsunamis \nhave accounted for more lost lives than all other natural disasters. In \nthe 20th century, an estimated 221 people were killed by tsunamis. Most \nof these deaths occurred on the island of Hawaii during the tsunamis of \n1946 and 1960, two of the largest tsunamis to strike in the Pacific. I \nam hopeful that our experiences in Hawaii and the expertise of NOAA's \ntwo National Weather Service Tsunami Warning Centers located in Palmer, \nAK, and the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Ewa Beach, HA, can help \nother nations around the world prepare for potential undersea \nearthquakes that result in these tragic disasters.\n  One of the worst natural disasters in Hawaii's history took place \nApril 1, 1946 when a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in the Aleutian Islands \ntriggered a destructive, Pacific-wide tsunami that killed 159 people: \n96 in Hilo, 15 on Kauai, 14 on Maui and nine on Oahu. There was no \nwarning in Hawaii, as the Tsunami Warning System had not been \nestablished at that time. The town of Hilo was ``pounded'' by a series \nof 6 to 7 waves, one after the other. The waterfront and all the \nbuildings facing Hilo Bay were completely destroyed. The tsunami \nflooded the downtown area of Hilo causing more than $26 million in \ndamages. The photos that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers took \nafterwards showed scenes similar to the ones we've seen in the past \nmonth in Thailand and Indonesia--everything was leveled and destroyed. \nThe character of downtown Hilo was changed forever. Tragically, we lost \na number of young children, students, killed by the tsunami in \nLaupahoehoe, a small community north and west of Hilo where the waves \nstruck the school and destroyed a hospital. As a result, in 1949 the \nPacific Tsunami Warning Center was established, which later became the \nheadquarters of the International Pacific Warning System.\n  This bill would authorize several programs in NOAA that we have \ndepended on since 1949. It would deploy a greater number of buoys \nthroughout the Pacific and it would expand the research on tsunamis and \ntheir detection to ensure a more reliable and better instrumented \nsystem for the Pacific, including Alaska, the West Coast of the U.S. \nand Pacific islands nations who are members of the group. It would \nexpand the domestic system to the Atlantic and Caribbean where tsunamis \nare infrequent but not impossible.\n  I would like to close with an appeal to my colleagues to consider the \ntypes of aid that the U.S. can provide to Sri Lanka, India, Indonesia, \nand Thailand. We must not overlook the science and technology of \ntsunamis and tsunami detection. The detection, warnings, planning, and \npublic education are perhaps the most important types of assistance we \ncan provide, because they are preventive and represent the little that \nwe can do to save lives in dealing\n\n[[Page S567]]\n\nwith the forces of nature in the future. They are an investment in the \nfuture safety and security of humankind.\n  This bill, most importantly, would mandate the U.S. to share its \nexpertise and experience in the Pacific with those nations that have \nsuffered such devastating losses from the Indian Ocean tsunami. With \nthe technology we have, no family of nations need suffer in the future \nfrom such widespread devastation without warning and public awareness \nof what tsunamis are, what they can do, and how to react and plan for \nthem. Hawaii and the Pacific has been well-prepared for tsunamis \nthrough 20 years of State and federal efforts through the National \nTsunami Hazard Mitigation Program, which is a NOAA Federal-State \npartnership with or Hawaii Civil Defense program. This program has \nenhanced Hawaii's tsunami mitigation and preparedness programs.

Mr. President, it is with the greatest pleasure \nthat I rise today to honor William Randle and Connie Marie Hudgens on \nthe occasion of their 70th wedding anniversary. The Hudgens were \nmarried on November 10, 1934, in England, AR, and celebrated their \nPlatinum Anniversary on November 10, 2004.\n  Mr. Hudgens was born in Cornersville, AR, on January 16, 1915. His \nfamily moved to England, Arkansas, in 1922 where he met and later \nmarried his wife, Connie Marie Saulter.\n  Mr. Hudgens is a retired farmer and heavy equipment operator. He \ncontributed greatly to Arkansas' highway system with his work on the \nconstruction of Interstates 30 and 40.\n  Mrs. Hudgens retired from a position with Wal-Mart and worked with \nseveral other companies in central Arkansas. Her most important and \nrewarding role, however, was as a wife and mother.\n  The Hudgens raised two beautiful daughters, Joyce Cates of North \nLittle Rock, AR, and Sandra Evans of Lonoke, AR. Their lives have also \nbeen blessed with six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Hudgens now reside in Lonoke, AR. They are devoted \nmembers of the Lonoke Baptist Church, where Mr. Hudgens serves as a \nDeacon Emeritus.\n  It is my honor and privilege to join the Hudgens' family and friends \nin recognizing the very special and momentous occasion of their 70th \nwedding anniversary. I ask my colleagues to join me in offering Mr. and \nMrs. Hudgens best wishes for continued happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/26/senate-section/article/S567-3", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     JUDGE WILLIAM AUGUSTUS BOOTLE\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe life and legacy of U.S. District Judge William Augustus Bootle. \nJudge Bootle passed away yesterday at his home in Macon at the age of \n102.\n  Judge Bootle and I became friends as I began my law practice 36 years \nago. His leadership and integrity have had a great impact on my role as \na public servant. From our first meeting until now, Judge Bootle and I \nhave maintained a close working relationship and have had many \nopportunities to interact over the years.\n  A stalwart of our country's judicial system, Judge Bootle will be \nremember for his unwavering commitment to doing what's right on behalf \nof all Americans, having led our country though some of the most \ndifficult decisions in our Nation's history. Georgians will remember \nhim for being fair and judicious in his verdicts and for being the type \nof judge before which all lawyers like to practice.\n  He showed an exemplary sort of courage in the fight to desegregate \nthe South and helped resolve many hard fought battles respective to the \nintegration of Georgia's education systems. To this end, Judge Bootle \nwas responsible for the admittance of the first black students in the \nUniversity of Georgia.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to quote from a book written by \nFrederick Allen which is entitled ``Atlanta Rising.'' This book deals \nwith a lot of history which took place in the Atlanta area during the \nyears of the civil rights movement. Two black applicants who were \ndenied admittance to the University of Georgia filed suit in the middle \ndistrict of Georgia, and quoting from this book, I read as follows:\n\n       Two black applicants, Charlayne Hunter and Hamilton Holmes, \n     went to the court attacking the welter of excuses University \n     of Georgia officials had concocted to keep them out. The two \n     made a convincing case that the only reason they had been \n     denied admission was segregation, pure and simple. In a \n     ruling issued late on the afternoon of Friday, January 6, \n     1961, Judge William A. Bootle ordered Hunter and Holmes \n     admitted to the school, not in six months or a year, but \n     bright and early the next Monday morning.\n\n  In the 1960s in Georgia, that took great judicial integrity.\n  In the 105th Congress, my good friend Senator Paul Coverdell and I \nsuccessfully led the charge to designate the Federal building and U.S. \ncourthouse in Macon, GA, as the ``William Augustus Bootle Federal \nBuilding and United States Courthouse'' in the honor of his steadfast \nservice to the people of Georgia.\n  The legacy of Judge Bootle will continue to impact countless \nindividuals across our great Nation and I know he will be sorely \nmissed--but honored in high regard by future generations. My wife \nJulianne and I are proud to have counted Judge Bootle a close friend, \nand extend our deepest condolences and prayers to his family and loved \nones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/26/senate-section/article/S567-4", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S567-S568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:48 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolutions, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to reauthorize additional contract authority for \nStates with Indian reservations; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my distinguished \ncolleague Senator Bennett to introduce the Indian School Bus Route \nSafety Reauthorization Act of 2005. This bill continues an important \nFederal program begun in 1998 that addresses a unique problem with the \nroads in and around the Nation's single largest Indian reservation and \nthe neighboring counties. Through this program, Navajo children who had \nbeen prevented from getting to school by roads that were often \nimpassable are now traveling safely to and from their schools. Because \nof the unusual nature of this situation, I believe it must continue to \nbe addressed at the Federal level.\n  I'd like to begin with some statistics on this unique problem and why \nI believe a Federal solution continues to be necessary. The Navajo \nNation is by far the nation's largest Indian Reservation, covering \n25,000 square miles. Portions of the Navajo Nation are in three States: \nArizona, New Mexico, and Utah. No other reservation comes anywhere \nclose to the size of Navajo. To give you an idea of its size, the State \nof West Virginia is about 24,000 square miles. In fact, 10 States are \nsmaller in size than the Navajo reservation.\n  According to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, about 9,800 miles of \npublic roads serve the Navajo nation. Only about one-fifth of these \nroads are paved. The remaining 7,600 miles, seventy-eight percent, are \ndirt roads. Every day school buses use nearly all of these roads to \ntransport Navajo children to and from school.\n  About 6,400 miles of the roads on the Navajo reservation are BIA \nroads, and about 2,500 miles are State and county roads. All public \nroads within, adjacent to, or leading to the reservation, including \nBIA, State, and county roads are considered part of the Federal Indian \nReservation Road System. However, only BIA roads are eligible for \nFederal maintenance funding from BIA. Moreover, construction funding \nand improvement funding from the Federal Lands Highways Program in TEA-\n21 is generally applied only to BIA or tribal roads. Thus, the States \nand counties are responsible for maintenance and improvement of their \n2,500 miles of roads that serve the reservation.\n  The counties in the three States that include the Navajo reservation \nare simply not in a position to maintain all of the roads on the \nreservation that carry children to and from school. Nearly all of the \nland area in these counties is under Federal or tribal jurisdiction.\n  For example, in my State of New Mexico, three-quarters of McKinley \nCounty is either tribal or federal land, including BLM, Forest Service, \nand military land. The Indian land area alone comprises 61 percent of \nMcKinley County. Consequently, the county can draw upon only a very \nlimited tax base as a source of revenue for maintenance purposes. Of \nthe nearly 600 miles of county-maintained roads in McKinley County, 512 \nmiles serve Indian land.\n  In San Juan County, UT, the Navajo Nation comprises 40 percent of the \nland area. The county maintains 611 miles of roads on the Navajo \nNation. Of these, 357 miles are dirt, 164 miles are gravel and only 90 \nmiles are paved. On the reservation, the county has three high schools, \ntwo elementary schools, two BIA boarding schools and four pre-schools.\n  The situation is similar in neighboring San Juan County, NM, and \nApache, Navajo, and Coconino Counties, AZ. In light of the counties' \nlimited resources, I do believe the Federal Government is asking the \nStates and counties to bear too large a burden for road maintenance in \nthis unique situation.\n\n  Families living in and around the reservation are no different from \nfamilies anywhere else; their children are entitled to the same \nopportunity to get to school safely and to get a good education. \nHowever, the many miles of unpaved and deficient roads on the \nreservation are frequently impassable, especially when they are wet, \nmuddy or snowy. If the school buses don't get through, the kids simply \ncannot get to school.\n  These children are literally being left behind.\n  Because of the vast size of the Navajo reservation, the cost of \nmaintaining the county roads used by the school buses is more than the \ncounties can bear without federal assistance. I believe it is essential \nthat the Federal Government help these counties deal with this one-of-\na-kind situation.\n  In response to this unique situation, in 1998 Congress began \nproviding direct annual funding to the counties that contain the Navajo \nreservation to help ensure that children on the reservation can get to \nand from their public schools. The funding was included at my request \nin section 1214(d) of TEA-21. Under this provision, $1.5 million was \nmade available each year to be shared equally among the three States. \nThe funding is provided directly to the counties in Arizona, New \nMexico, and Utah that contain the Navajo reservation. I want to be very \nclear: these Federal funds can be used only on roads that are located \nwithin or that lead to the reservation, that are on the State or county \nmaintenance system, and that are used by school buses.\n  This program has been very successful. For the last six years, the \ncounties have used the annual funding to help maintain the routes used \nby school buses to carry children to school and to Headstart programs. \nI had an opportunity in 1998 to see first hand the importance of this \nfunding when I rode in a school bus over some of the roads that are \nmaintained using funds from this program.\n  The bill I am introducing today provides a simple 6-year \nreauthorization of that program, for fiscal years 2005 through 2010, \nwith a modest increase in the annual funding to allow for inflation and \nfor additional roads to be maintained in each of the three States. The \ntext of the bill is identical to that passed last year by the full \nSenate in H.R. 3550, the SAFETEA bill.\n  I believe that continuing this program for six more years is fully \njustified because of the vast area of the Navajo reservation--by far \nthe Nation's largest--and the unique nature of this need that only the \nFederal Government can deal with effectively.\n  I don't believe any child wanting to get to and from school should \nhave to risk or tolerate unsafe roads. Kids today, particularly in \nrural and remote areas, face enough barriers to getting a good \neducation. The Senate already passed this legislation last year. I ask \nall Senators to join me again this year in assuring that Navajo \nschoolchildren at least have a chance to get to school safely and get \nan education.\n  I am pleased that Congressmen Tom Udall of New Mexcio, Rick Renzi of \nArizona, and James David Matheson of Utah are introducing a companion \nbill today in the House. I look forward to working with them this year \nand with the Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nSenator Inhofe, and Senator Jeffords, the ranking member, to \nincorporate this legislation once again into the comprehensive 6-year \nreauthorization of the surface transportation bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 168\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Indian School Bus Route \n     Safety Reauthorization Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CONTRACT AUTHORITY FOR \n                   STATES WITH INDIAN RESERVATIONS.\n\n       Section 1214(d)(5)(A) of the Transportation Equity Act for \n     the 21st Century (23 U.S.C. 202 note; 112 Stat. 206) is \n     amended by striking ``$1,500,000 for each of fiscal years \n     1998 through 2003'' and inserting ``$1,800,000 for each of \n     fiscal years 2005 through 2010''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Inhofe):\n  S. 169. A bill to amend the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act of 1991 to identify a route that passes through the \nStates of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Kansas as a high priority \ncorridor on the National Highway System; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will enhance the future economic vitality of communities in Otero, \nLincoln, Torrance, Guadalupe, and Quay Counties.\n\n[[Page S579]]\n\nThe purpose of this legislation is to focus attention on the need to \nupgrade U.S. Highway 54 to four lanes. I believe improving the \ntransportation infrastructure will help attract good jobs to South, \nCentral, and Eastern New Mexico.\n  I am honored to have my good friend and colleague, Senator Roberts, \nas the lead cosponsor of the bill. I am also pleased to have Senators \nInhofe as an original cosponsor. In addition, Representatives Udall \n(NM), Lucas, and Pearce are introducing this bill today on the House \nside.\n  Our bill designates U.S. Highway 54 from the border with Mexico at \nthe Bridge of the Americas in El Paso, TX, through New Mexico, and \nOklahoma to Wichita, KS, as the Southwest Passage Initiative for \nRegional and Interstate Transportation, or SPIRIT, corridor. Congress \nhas already included Highway 54 as part of the National Highway System. \nThis bill adds the SPIRIT Corridor to Congress's list of High Priority \nCorridors on the National Highway System.\n  About half of the 700-mile-long SPIRIT corridor is in New Mexico and \nanother 200 miles of it are in Kansas. Our goal in asking Congress to \ndesignate SPIRIT as a High Priority Corridor on the National Highway \nSystem is to help focus attention on the need for a complete four-lane \nupgrade of the route from El Paso to Wichita. When completed, the route \nwill link rural areas in the four States to major market centers.\n  I continue to believe strongly in the importance of highway \ninfrastructure for economic development in my state. Even in this age \nof the new economy and high-speed digital communications, roads \ncontinue to link our communities together and to carry the commercial \ngoods and products our citizens need. Safe and efficient highways are \nespecially important to citizens in the rural parts of New Mexico.\n  It is well known that regions with four-lane highways more readily \nattract out-of-state visitors and new jobs. Truck drivers and the \ntraveling public prefer the safety of a four-lane divided highway.\n  In New Mexico, U.S. 54 is a fairly level route, bypassing New \nMexico's major mountain ranges. The route also traverses some of New \nMexico's most dramatic scenery, including three of the state's popular \nScenic Byways. One is the Mesalands Scenic Byway in Guadalupe, San \nMiguel and Quay Counties, incorporating the beautiful tablelands known \nas El Llano Estacado. Another is the State's newest byway, La Frontera \nde Llano, which follows highway 39 from Logan to Abbott in Harding \nCounty, including the spectacular Canadian River Canyon and the Kiowa \nNational Grasslands. The third byway is the historic Route 66, which \ncrosses Highway 54 from Santa Rosa to Tucumcari.\n  The SPIRIT corridor passes through Alamogordo, home of the New Mexico \nMuseum of Space History and gateway to the stunning White Sands \nNational Monument.\n  Highway 54 is also important to our Nation from the perspective of \nnational security. The route directly serves Fort Bliss, the White \nSands Missile Range, and Holloman Air Force Base. It also passes \nthrough the Nation's breadbasket as well as some of the Nation's most \nimportant oil and gas fields.\n  The route of the SPIRIT corridor starts at Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico, \nhome of one the largest concentrations of manufacturing in the border \nregion. As a result of increased trade under NAFTA, commercial border \ntraffic is now much higher at the border crossings in El Paso, Texas, \nand Santa Teresa, New Mexico. In New Mexico, truck traffic from the \nborder has risen to over 1000 per day and is expected to triple in the \nnext twenty years.\n  The SPIRIT corridor is perfectly situated to serve international \ntrade and promote economic development along its entire route. The \nroute provides direct connections to four major Interstate Highways: I-\n10, 1-35, I-40, and 1-70. SPIRIT is also the shortest route between \nChicago and El Paso shaving 137 miles off the major alternative.\n  Though much of U.S. 54 is currently only two lanes, traffic has been \nrising dramatically along the entire route since NAFTA was implemented. \nIn New Mexico, total daily traffic levels are nearing 10,000 and are \nprojected to rise to 30,000, with trucks making up 35 percent of the \ntotal. In Oklahoma, traffic levels are up to 6,500 per day--40 percent \nof which are commercial trucks. These traffic statistics clearly \nreflect the SPIRIT corridor's attraction to commercial and passenger \ndrivers.\n  New Mexicans recognize the importance of efficient roads to economic \ndevelopment and safety. I have long supported my State's efforts to \ncomplete the four-lane upgrade of U.S. 54. The State Department of \nTransportation rates the project a high priority for New Mexico. The \nfour-lane upgrade of the first 56-mile segment from the Texas border to \nAlamogordo was completed in 2002. Two more sections in New Mexico \nremain to be upgraded: 163 miles from Tularosa, north through \nCarrizozo, Corona, and Vaughn, to Santa Rosa and 50 miles from \nTucumcari to the Texas border near Nara Visa in Quay County. This \ncorridor is currently a two-lane facility with no shoulders, no passing \nzones and various deficient areas. The cost to four-lane these two \nsegments is estimated at $420 million.\n  I am pleased Governor Richardson has set aside over $130 million as \npart of the New Mexico's GRIP initiative to upgrade key portions of the \nroute between Tularosa and Santa Rosa. I am committed to working with \nState to secure the funding required to complete New Mexico's four-lane \nupgrade as soon as possible. I am pleased the other states are also \nmoving quickly to four-lane their portion of the route.\n  Once the SPIRIT corridor is designated, New Mexico will have four \nhigh-priority corridors on the National Highway System. The other three \nare the Ports-to-Plains corridor, the Camino Real Corridor, and the \nEast West Transamerica Corridor. These four trade corridors, as well as \nour close proximity to the border, strongly underscore the vital role \nNew Mexico plays in our Nation's interstate and international \ntransportation network.\n  The SPIRIT project has broad grassroots support. Most of the cities, \ncounties, and chambers of commerce all the way from Wichita to El Paso \nhave passed resolutions of support for the four-lane upgrade of U.S. 54 \nalong the entire corridor.\n  I do believe the four-lane upgrade of Highway 54 is vital to the \ncontinued economic development for all of the communities along the \nSPIRIT corridor in New Mexico. I again thank Senators Roberts and \nInhofe for cosponsoring the bill, and I hope all senators will join us \nin support of this important legislation. It is my hope that our bill \ncan pass quickly this year or be included when the Senate again \nconsiders the reauthorization of a six-year surface transportation \nbill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 169\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to clarify the definition of rural airports; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mr. Stevens, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 171. A bill to exempt seaplanes from certain transportation taxes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two related \npieces of legislation addressing inequities that affect seaplane \noperators and passengers in rural areas. Both of these were included in \nS. 1072 when it passed the Senate last year, but because that business \nremains unfinished, it is necessary to reintroduce them.\n\n[[Page S580]]\n\n  The first of these--on which Senator Stevens is joining me as a \ncosponsor, is a modification to the definition of a ``rural airport.'' \nThe law adopted in 1997 provides for a per-passenger fee--now $3.20--on \neach domestic flight segment. Rural airports were exempted from the tax \non the grounds it was intended to cover increased security costs for \nairports handling large aircraft and international flights. The law \ndefines a rural airport as one which--for a given calendar year--has \nfewer than 100,000 departures in the second preceding calendar year, \nand which either received essential air service subsidies as of August \n5, 1997, or is more than 75 miles from a larger airport.\n  The latter provision is a significant problem in my State. It was \nintended to reflect the fact that 75 miles is not really a long way to \ndrive to and from an airport. Unfortunately, that assumes there is a \nroad to drive on. That's not always the case. My State has a number of \nsmall community airports that are within 75 miles of a larger airport, \nbut where there are no roads connecting the two. Thus, passengers \ncannot choose to drive to the larger airport. In order to fly to their \nultimate destination, they are forced to fly from their village to the \nlarger airport, where the passenger tax is legitimately collected. The \nbottom line is that these rural residents are unfairly taxed at least \ntwice as much as all the other passengers leaving from the larger \nairport.\n  My bill simply adds this one additional unique criterion to the \ndefinition of a rural airport--that it may include a small airport that \nis within 75 miles from a larger one, but where there is no road \nconnection between the two.\n  The second bill I am introducing today--along with Senator Stevens \nand Senator Murray--is also intended to correct an inequity. Air \npassenger transportation is subject to a 7.5 percent excise tax in \naddition to the $3.20 per-segment fee. This generates revenue that goes \ntoward the maintenance and improvements of airports receiving Airport \nImprovement Program (AIP) funding. However, in several cases in Alaska, \nand in at least one case in the State of Washington, the taxes are \nimposed on seaplane operators who land on and take off from open \nwaters, not from facilities using AIP funds, and which rarely if ever \nmake use of FAA communication and navigation systems. It should be a \nfundamental tenet that those who do not receive a service should not be \nrequired to pay for it. That is exactly the basis for my second bill.\n  Both these proposals have been in circulation for several years. Each \nof them has been estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation to have \nnegligible impacts on revenue--less than $2 million per year for the \nrural airport definition and less than $1 million for the excise tax. \nIn that connection, it should also be noted that even if the excise tax \nfor seaplane operators is eliminated, they will still be paying their \nfair share because they will automatically begin paying higher fuel \ntaxes. The latter will go up from 4.4 cents per gallon to 19.4 cents \nper gallon for aviation gasoline and to 21.9 cents per gallon for jet \nfuel.\n  I encourage my colleagues' support of these two important measures.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of both measures be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 170\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve the palliative and end-of-life care \nprovided to children with life-threatening conditions, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to discuss a bill Senator \nDodd and I are introducing today. This is a bill about children, and it \ncovers an issue that is difficult to think about or talk about, but one \nthat is critical to many children and their families in our Nation.\n  What I am talking about is what we can do when a child develops a \nlife-threatening or terminal illness. How do we make sure we do \neverything in our power to make a sick child as comfortable as possible \nand as happy as possible--everything in our power to ease their \nsuffering--when that child is terminally ill. We have a pressing need \nfor comprehensive, compassionate, continuous care for children who are \nfacing death as a result of serious illness.\n  No parent or family member ever expects a child to die. With today's \nmodern medicine and research advances, it is easy to think that only \nolder people die, but, tragically, we all know that is not the case. \nThat is why today we are introducing the Compassionate Care for \nChildren Act, a bill we introduced previously in the 108th Congress \nalong with Representative Deborah Pryce in the House. This legislation \nis an effort to help ensure that very sick children receive a continuum \nof care and that young lives do not end in preventable pain or fear or \nsadness.\n  Every year, over 55,000 children die in the United States. Some \nchildren will die suddenly and unexpectedly--in a car accident, by \ndrowning, or fire, or by choking. Some may even be murdered. Others, \nthough--thousands of children, actually--will be diagnosed with life-\nthreatening illnesses or diseases that might eventually, over a period \nof time, take away these children's lives. Children with such illnesses \nare in and out of hospitals and clinics. They receive chemotherapy and \nradiation treatments. They might undergo multiple surgeries. They might \nhave nurses and doctors poking and prodding at them nearly all the \ntime. Some of these children are old enough to realize that they might \ndie if the treatments for their diseases don't work. Others are too \nyoung to understand that reality.\n  One little girl--Liza--knew she was going to die. Shortly after her \nfourth birthday, she was diagnosed with a form of leukemia. For the \nnext year, Liza's parents explored every possible medical option for \nher and every possible treatment. They took her to doctor after doctor \nafter doctor, and they had access to the most cutting-edge therapies \navailable to treat Liza's disease. Nothing seemed to work. At the age \nof five, Liza began to ask her mother what would come next, and whether \nshe would soon die after her bone marrow transplant--her last chance \nfor a cure--had failed.\n  Once the medical treatments had failed, doctors had little else to \noffer Liza. There was no discussion, tragically, about end-of-life care \nat the hospital for this little child. No one wanted to admit that they \nwere out of\n\n[[Page S582]]\n\ntreatment options--that there was no cure--that she wasn't going to get \nbetter, have her life restored and her health restored--that she wasn't \ngoing to grow up and become an adult and have her own children someday. \nThere was no discussion of that. No one in that hospital wanted to talk \nwith Liza about death, even though this little girl pleaded with them \nto do so.\n  Liza's mother told the Washington Post that Liza asked her oncologist \nto tell her when death was near. This little five-year-old girl asked \nher doctor to tell her when she was going to die. Yet, on the final \nnight of her life, as this little child lay dying in her mother's arms, \nnear her father and her older sister, Liza asked, ``Why didn't the \ndoctor call to tell me?''\n  Liza's parents were able to get some hospice care for their daughter \nduring the last three months of her life. Tragically, fewer than 10 \npercent of children who die in the United States ever receive any sort \nof hospice care. When children like Liza are terminally ill, parents \nare forced to make decisions for their children under extremely \nemotional and stressful conditions. The decisions that confront these \nparents are ones that they never, of course, expected to have to make. \nParents want what is best for their children. They want their children \nto get better and be healthy. They want their children to be pain free. \nThey want their children to receive comfort and care when they are \nsick.\n  God forbid that parents find out their children are very sick--so \nsick they are never going to get better--so sick there are no more \ntreatments and no more cures--and so sick they know their children are \ngoing to die. Those parents will try to do everything imaginable and \neverything possible in their power to help their children and make them \ncomfortable--pain-free and happy in their remaining days.\n  Mr. President, we have an obligation to help those parents. Children \nwith life-threatening diseases and illnesses require special medical \nattention to make their shortened lives more comfortable. We know that. \nYet, despite that knowledge, the fact is, current federal law and \nregulations do not take into consideration the special care needs of a \ngravely ill or dying child. In fact, these federal laws and regulations \nget in the way of taking care of these children.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would help correct the \ndeficiencies in current law and help sick children facing possible \ndeath live more comfortably and live with dignity. It would help them \nreceive the comprehensive care they deserve and the comprehensive care \nwe would expect for our own children.\n  Let me take a few moments to explain what our bill actually does. \nFirst, it offers grants so doctors and nurses can receive training and \neducation to enable them to better understand these issues and to help \nthem provide end-of-life care for these kids. The goal of these grants \nis to improve the quality of care terminally ill children receive. One \nof the ways we do this is to make sure doctors and nurses truly \nunderstand these issues so they can provide the care and be better \ninformed. Our bill also provides money for the National Institutes of \nHealth to conduct research in pain and symptom management in children. \nThis research is critically important to improving the type of care \nthat dying children receive.\n  An article in the New England Journal of Medicine stated that 89 \npercent of children dying of cancer die experiencing ``a lot or a great \ndeal'' of pain and suffering. This does not have to happen. We can \nchange that, and we must. This is simply not acceptable. Research has \nto be done so that children will not suffer needlessly.\n\n  In addition to grants, the second piece of our bill changes the way \ncare is delivered to children with life-threatening illnesses. Right \nnow, doctors, hospitals, and parents have to overcome significant \ninsurance and eligibility barriers to enroll a dying child in hospice. \nFirst, to qualify for hospice, a doctor must certify that a child has \nsix months or less to live. The problem with this ``six-month rule'' is \nthat it is harder for a doctor to determine the life expectancy of a \nsick child than it is to determine the life expectancy of a sick adult \nor elderly person. A child dying of cancer, for example, may die in six \nmonths or six years, making that child ineligible for hospice care that \nwould ensure a comfortable life while that child is alive. It is very \ndifficult many times to estimate how long that child is going to live. \nThis very rigid six-month predictability rule, which denies care, is \nvery inhumane for these kids. It is wrong, and we have to change that \nrule.\n  According to Dr. Joanne Hilden and Dr. Dan Tobin, ``Sick children are \nstill growing, which is a biological process very much like healing. \nSo, when a child is diagnosed with illness, such as cancer or heart \ndisease, he or she is much more likely to be cured than an adult.'' \nSimply put, diseases progress differently in children than adults, and \nchildren with terminal diseases get lost in the health care system \ndesigned for adults--a health care system that does not take into \nconsideration the special needs of children.\n  Furthermore, the current system does not allow a patient to receive \ncurative and palliative care simultaneously. In other words, current \nlaw does not allow doctors to continue trying life-prolonging \ntreatments--treatments that could cure an illness or extend a life--and \nalso at the same time provide palliative care to that patient. That \nmeans that current law does not allow the doctors to go in to provide \ntypical hospice care where you make that child comfortable and do all \nthe things to alleviate the pain and at the same time try to save the \nchild's life.\n  That is wrong. That is simply wrong. That presents a parent with a \nhorrible choice--a choice that no parent should ever have to make. That \nis tragic. Palliative care offers a continuum of care--care that \ninvolves counseling to families and patients about how to confront \ndeath--care that involves making the patient comfortable in his or her \nsickest hours--care that acknowledges that death is a real possibility.\n  Federal law requires a person who wishes to receive end-of-life care \nto discontinue receiving curative or life-prolonging treatment. This \nshould not be an either/or decision for parents. I don't know of any \nparent who would give up trying to cure a sick child when there was any \nchance that child might be saved. They should not be put in this \nposition.\n  Current law places parents in impossible positions. We simply must \nfix this. End-of-life care should be integrated with curative care so \nthat parents, children, and doctors have access to a range of benefits \nand services. As I said earlier, palliative care should not be confined \nto the dying. It should be available to any child who is seriously ill.\n  That is why our bill creates Medicare and private market \ndemonstration programs to remove these barriers, making it simpler and \neasier for doctors and parents to make end-of-life decisions for \nchildren. The demonstration program would allow children to receive \ncurative and palliative care concurrently. This means children can \ncontinue to receive treatment and life-prolonging care while receiving \npalliative care at the same time. The demonstration program also \nremoves the six-month rule so children can receive palliative care \nbenefits at the time of diagnosis.\n  I would like to take a moment to tell my colleagues about another \ngirl--Rachel Ann. Rachel Ann was a little girl who did receive \npalliative care from the time she was diagnosed with a grave heart \nproblem. Rachel Ann had a heart that doctors describe as ``incompatible \nwith life.'' Most babies with heart malformations like Rachel Ann die \nwithin a matter of days after birth. Rachel Ann's parents were \ndevastated and distraught to see their tiny baby connected to a sea of \nwire and tubes, clinging to life.\n  Rachel Ann's parents were referred to a pediatric hospice and decided \nto bring their daughter home from the hospital so she could experience \nlife with her family, surrounded by parents, brothers, relatives, and \nfriends at home. Rachel Ann's parents say she seemed truly happy at \nhome. She smiled and wiggled in response to voices and being held. Her \nbrothers doted on their baby sister.\n  Rachel Ann was able to spend her life at home in comfort with her \nfamily. She lived for 42 days and her family was able to make every \nsingle moment count. On Christmas day, after spending the morning with \nher family, Rachel Ann passed away.\n  Fortunately, Rachel Ann and her family were able to spend as much \ntime\n\n[[Page S583]]\n\ntogether as possible with Rachel Ann as comfortable as possible. Her \nbrothers were able to know their sister and to talk with hospice \nprofessionals about what was happening to her. Rachel Ann's parents and \ngrandparents also were able to talk about her condition with hospice \nprofessionals and maintained an active role in her care. There was a \nsupport system in place for this family.\n  The terminal illness of a child is an incredibly difficult thing to \nconfront for a parent and family. No one wants to think about children \ndying. No one wants to believe that children suffer, especially in this \nage of great medical advances. It is a horrible situation. But, it is \none that we must face. We can always do more to improve the care that \nour children receive. We should continue to support research and \nfinding cures for the diseases and illnesses from which children \nsuffer. But, until those cures are found, and as long as children die \nfrom these diseases, we must provide care and support for a dying \nchild. We have an obligation to provide that care and that support.\n  The bill we are introducing today will be an important step in this \ndirection. It will provide tools and support networks to help grieving \nfamilies in their time of need. It is the right thing to do, and I \nencourage my colleagues to join us in co-sponsoring this important \npiece of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 174\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today, along with my \ngood friend Senator Mike DeWine, to introduce the Compassionate Care \nfor Children Act of 2005. This important legislation is designed to \ngreatly improve the quality of care provided to terminally ill children \nand their loved ones, as well as the training of those that provide for \ntheir medical care.\n  The subject of childhood illness is a difficult one. However, for \nchildren facing a serious illness and their families, it is a subject \nthat must be examined. Tragically, we know that close to 55,000 \nchildren under the age of 19 die each year. Some are lost to accidents. \nMany are lost suddenly to complications related to prematurity. \nHowever, many other children are diagnosed with life-threatening \nconditions and begin a battle that, tragically, many will eventually \nlose.\n  For these children and their families, palliative care is often the \nonly way to ease their great burden. Very broadly, palliative care \nseeks to prevent or relieve the physical and emotional distress \nproduced by a life-threatening condition or its treatment, to help \ndiagnosed children and their families live as normal a life as \npossible, and to provide accurate and timely information to ease \ndecisionmaking. And while many view palliative care as necessary for \nonly the terminally ill, any child with a serious illness and their \nfamily would benefit greatly from its broad scope of services.\n  Sadly, determining how best to care for a child facing a life-\nthreatening or terminal illness requires an expertise that too few \nhealthcare professionals possess. Too often, healthcare professionals \nserving a child with a life-threatening condition are at a loss as to \nhow best ease the child's pain, comfort the child's family and loved \nones, and coordinate the range of services required.\n  The legislation we introduce today would seek to close this knowledge \ngap by authorizing $35 million annually to provide for research and \ntraining related to childhood palliative care. Specifically, the \nlegislation will authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto award grants to health care providers and health care institutions \nto expand pediatric palliative care programs, to research new \ninitiatives in pediatric palliative care--such as issues related \nspecifically to pain management for children--and to provide training \nto healthcare providers serving children requiring pediatric palliative \ncare services.\n  According to Children's Hospice International, close to one million \nchildren are seriously ill with a variety of progressive afflictions at \nany one time. Parents of these children face a multitude of heart-\nwrenching decisions related to the appropriate course of treatment for \ntheir children. Among the choices available to some parents is one that \nI believe no parent should ever be forced to make. Under current law, \nseriously ill children are not eligible to receive simultaneous \ncurative and palliative care.\n  Imagine forcing a parent to choose between seeking a cure for their \nseriously ill child or services designed to ease their child's burden. \nAgain, no parent should ever be required to make\n\n[[Page S587]]\n\nthis choice and under the legislation we introduce today, parents will \nno longer be forced to decide whether to forgo curative treatment \noptions for their children in order to receive palliative care. In \neliminating this unnecessary and cruel requirement, the Compassionate \nCare for Children Act establishes a demonstration program under \nMedicare that will encourage the development of more coordinated model \nsystems of curative and palliative care.\n  This legislation would also ensure that seriously ill children \ntreated under the demonstration program would not be subject to the so-\ncalled 6-month rule, a regulation currently in place that requires a \nphysician's determination that an ill child has a life expectancy of 6 \nmonths or less in order to receive hospice services. As we all know, \nchildren are not simply little adults. Children's bodies react \ndifferently than adults to the onset of disease and various treatment \noptions, making this determination possibly dangerously inaccurate.\n  Lastly, I thank the legislation's chief sponsors in the House of \nRepresentatives, Deborah Pryce and John Murtha. Representatives Pryce \nand Murtha have been tireless advocates on behalf of seriously ill \nchildren and their devotion to easing the struggle of these children \nand their families is truly admirable. I look forward to continuing \nworking with my colleagues from the House to advance the Compassionate \nCare for Children Act in the 109th Congress.\n  Mr. President, when Senator DeWine and I first introduced this \nlegislation in the last Congress, we were joined by members of the \nNational Childhood Cancer Foundation. Each year this valuable \norganization sponsors ``Conquer Kids Cancer Gold Ribbon Days,'' an \nevent that brings cancer patients, families, care givers and \nresearchers from across the Nation to the District to lobby the \nCongress for increased resources to battle childhood cancers. At this \nevent we heard from dozens of children and families from across this \nNation that have battled serious illness. It is because of struggles \nlike theirs that we are here today at the outset of an effort to better \nserve seriously ill children and those who love and care for them.\n  I know that I can say with confidence that we all wish for the day \nwhen no child fell ill to serious disease. Until that day comes, the \nCompassionate Care for Children Act offers children battling illness \nand their families the hope of eased pain, expertise in treatment, and \ninformed decisions. They deserve no less. I urge all of my colleagues \nto support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. Roberts):\n  S. 175. A bill to establish the Bleeding Kansas and Enduring Struggle \nfor Freedom National Heritage Area, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am proud to join with my colleague \nfrom the great State of Kansas, Senator Pat Roberts, and introduce the \nBleeding Kansas National Heritage Area Act. I appreciate the Senator's \nhard work and passion on this bill. Likewise, I commend Representative \nJim Ryan who authored this bill in the House of Representatives who, \nlike Senator Roberts and I, worked tirelessly to pass this bill last \nCongress. And finally, I would like to thank Senator Domenici, Chairman \nof the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and Senator Thomas, \nSubcommittee Chair, National Parks, for working with me in the 108th \nCongress. Through their hard work and the work of their staff, the \nBleeding Kansas National Heritage Area Act passed the Senate. It is my \nhope that we will once again be able to see this bill pass the Senate \nbut also pass the House of Representatives in the 109th Session.\n  The great story of Kansas can be summed up in the, State motto, ``Ad \nAstra per Aspera,'' to the stars through difficulties. Though only a \nshort phrase comprised of four words, the meaning and passion behind \nthe Kansas State motto are as profound as they are descriptive of a \nState that though smaller than some, was a catalyst for racial equality \nin this Nation.\n  From inception, Kansas was born in controversy--a controversy that \nhelped to shape a nation and end the egregious practice of chattel \nslavery that brutalized an entire race of individuals in this country. \nI cannot think of a more noble or more important contribution provided \nto our Nation--though arguably it was one of the most turbulent and \ndarkest hours of our history. Without this struggle however, the battle \nto end persecution and transform our country into a symbol of freedom \nand democracy throughout the world would not have been realized.\n  Last year, 2004, marked the sesquicentennial of the signing of the \nKansas-Nebraska bill which repealed the Missouri compromise, allowed \nStates to enter into the Union with or without slavery. This piece of \nlegislation, which was passed in May 1854, set the stage for what is \nnow referred to as, ``Bleeding Kansas.'' During this time, our State, \nthen a territory, was thrown into chaos with Kansans fighting \npassionately to ensure that the territory would inter the Union as a \nfree State and not condone or legalize slavery in any capacity. At the \nend of a very difficult and bloody struggle, Kansas entered the Union \nas a free State and helped to spark the issue of slavery on a national \nlevel. However, Kansas' contributions to the realization of freedom in \nthis Nation did not stop with the Kansas-Nebraska Act.\n  Keeping true to our motto, to the stars through difficulties, Kansas \nopened up her arms to a newly freed people after the Civil War ended. \nMany African Americans looked to Kansas for solace and prosperity when \nthe South was still an uncertain place. Perhaps one of the best \nexamples of Ad Astra per Aspera was the founding of a town in Kansas by \nAfrican Americans coming to our State to begin their life of freedom \nand prosperity.\n  Founded in 1877, Nicodemus, which was named after a legendary slave \nwho purchased his freedom, is the most recognized historically black \ntown in Kansas. Nicodemus was established by a group of colonists from \nLexington, KY, and grew to a population of 600 by 1879. However, \nNicodemus is not the only Kansas contribution that shaped a more \ntolerant Nation. Kansas was also one of the first States to house an \nAfrican American military regiment in the 1800s, the Buffalo Soldiers.\n  The Buffalo Soldiers were, and still are, considered one of the most \ndistinguished and revered African American military regiments in our \nNation's history. One of those regiments, the 10th Cavalry, was \nstationed at Fort Leavenworth, KS. In July 1866, Congress passed \nlegislation establishing two cavalry and four infantry regiments that \nwere to be solely comprised of African Americans. The mounted regiments \nwere the 9th and 10th Cavalries, soon nicknamed ``Buffalo Soldiers'' by \nthe Cheyenne and Comanche tribes. Lt. Henry O. Flipper, the first \nAfrican American to graduate from the United States Military Academy in \n1877 and commanded the 10th Cavalry unit where he proved that African \nAmericans possessed the quality of military leadership. Until the early \n1890s, the Buffalo Soldiers constituted 20 percent of all cavalry \nforces on the American frontier. Their invaluable service on the \nwestern frontier still remains one of the most exemplary services \nperformed by a regiment in the U.S. Army.\n  These are just a few examples of why I am pleased to join with my \ncolleague from Kansas, Senator Pat Roberts, today and introduce the \nBleeding Kansas National Heritage Area Act, which will not only serve \nto educate Kansans but the Nation on the important contributions--and \nin many cases the sacrifices--made in order to establish this proud \nstate. The creation of this heritage area will ensure that this legacy \nis not only commemorated but celebrated on a national level.\n  Specifically, the Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area Act will \ndesignate 24 counties in Kansas as the ``Bleeding Kansas and the \nEnduring Struggle for Freedom National Heritage Area.'' Each of these \ncounties will be eligible to apply for the heritage area grants \nadministered by the National Park Service.\n  The heritage area will add to local economies within the State by \nincreasing tourism and will encourage collaboration between interests \nof diverse units of government, businesses, tourism officials, private \nproperty owners, and nonprofit groups within the heritage area. \nFinally, the bill protects private property owners by requiring that\n\n[[Page S588]]\n\nthey provide in writing consent to be included in any request before \nthey are eligible to receive, Federal funds from the heritage area. The \nbill also authorizes $10,000,000 over a 10-year period to carry out \nthis act and states that not more than $1,000,000 may be appropriated \nto the heritage area for any fiscal year.\n  Kansas has much to be proud of in their history and it is vital that \nthis history be shared on a national level. By establishing the \nBleeding Kansas and the Enduring Struggle for Freedom National Heritage \nArea, we will ensure that this magnificent legacy lives on and serves \nas a stirring reminder of the sacrifices and triumphs that created this \nNation--a Nation united in freedom for all people.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am pleased to once again introduce, \nalong with my distinguished colleague Senator Brownback, a bill \ndesignating the Bleeding Kansas and the Enduring Struggle for Freedom \nNational Heritage Area. This project, which we hope will receive the \ncongressional recognition it deserves, has joined communities \nthroughout eastern Kansas in an effort to document, preserve, and \ncelebrate Kansas' significant role in the political struggle that led \nto the Civil War and in other historic struggles for equality that took \nplace in our State.\n  National Heritage Areas are places where natural, cultural, historic, \nand recreational resources combine to form complete and distinct \nlandscape. The State of Kansas, which has a proud heritage and \ncompelling story, will benefit from this national designation that \nhelps preserve and celebrate America's defining landscapes. By \nenhancing and developing historic sites throughout eastern Kansas, we \nwill ensure that the traditions that evolved there are preserved.\n  During the Civil War, William Quantrill, the head of an infamous gang \nof Confederate sympathizers, led a raid on Lawrence, KS. Though far \nfrom the main campaigns, this massacre caused Bleeding Kansas to become \na prominent symbol in the fight for the freedom of all people, and the \nterritory would become a battleground over the question of slavery. \nAfter these attacks, the abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner delivered \nhis famous speech called ``The Crime Against Kansas,'' in which he \nbrought the escalating situation into sharper focus for the nation.\n  Almost 100 years later, Kansas became the battleground once again, as \nOliver L. Brown fought to prove that separate among the people of this \ngreat Nation is not equal. In fact, we will soon celebrate the 50th \nanniversary of the Brown v. Topeka Board of Education Supreme Court \ndecision, which was a landmark victory in the civil rights movement. \nThese are only two of the historic chapters that will make up this \nheritage area, marking an important era in our Nation.\n  I commend the Lawrence City Commission, the Douglas County \nCommission, and the Lawrence Chamber of Commerce, who have worked \ndiligently on this project for over 2 years. We have a great \nopportunity to pass this important piece of legislation during the \n109th Congress, and I encourage the Senate's swift consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Allard, Mr. \n        Baucus, and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 177. A bill to further the purposes of the Reclamation Projects \nAuthorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 by directing the Secretary of \nthe Interior, acting through the Commissioner of Reclamation, to carry \nout an assessment and demonstration program to control salt cedar and \nRussian olive, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce a piece of \nlegislation that is of paramount importance to the State of New Mexico \nand many other western States. This bill will address the mounting \npressures brought on by the growing demands of a diminishing water \nsupply throughout the west.\n  The bill that I am introducing today authorizes the Department of the \nInterior acting through the Bureau of Reclamation to establish a series \nof research and demonstration programs to help eradicate non-native \nspecies on rivers in the Western United States. This bill will help \ndevelop the scientific knowledge and experience base needed to build a \nstrategy to control these invasive thieves. In addition to projects \nthat could benefit the Pecos and the Rio Grande, the bill allows other \nStates in the west such as Texas, Colorado, Utah, California and \nArizona to develop and participate in projects as well.\n  Allow me to explain the importance of this bill. A water crisis has \nravaged the west for more than five years. Drought conditions have \nexpanded throughout the Western United States. Snow packs have been \ncontinuously low, causing severe drought conditions.\n  The presence of invasive species compounds the drought situation in \nmany states. For instance, New Mexico is home to a vast amount of salt \ncedar. Salt cedar is a water-thirsty non-native tree that continually \nstrips massive amounts of water out of New Mexico's two predominant \nwater supplies--the Pecos and the Rio Grande rivers.\n  We have already had numerous catastrophic fires in our Nation's \nforests including the riparian woodland--the Bosque--that runs through \nthe heart of New Mexico's most populous city. One of the reasons this \nfire ran its course through Albuquerque was the presence of large \namounts of Salt cedar, a plant that burns as easily as it consumes \nwater.\n  Estimates show that one mature Salt cedar tree can consume as much as \n200 gallons of water per day; over the growing season that's 7 acre \nfeet of water for each acre of Salt cedar. In addition to the excessive \nwater consumption, Salt cedars increase fire, increase river \nchannelization and flood frequency, decrease water flow, and increase \nwater and soil salinity along the river. Every problem that drought \ncauses is exacerbated by the presence of Salt cedar.\n\n  I know that the seriousness of the water situation in New Mexico \nbecomes more acute every single day. This drought has affected every \nNew Mexican and nearly everyone in the west in some way. Wells are \nrunning dry, farmers are being forced to sell livestock, many of our \ncities are in various stages of conservation and many, many acres have \nbeen charred by fire.\n  The drought and the mounting legal requirements on both the Pecos and \nRio Grande rivers are forcing us toward a severe water crisis in New \nMexico. Indeed, every river in the inter-mountain west seems to be \nfacing similar problems. Therefore, we must bring to bear every tool at \nour disposal for dealing with the water shortages in the west.\n  Solving such water problems is one of my top priorities and I assure \nthis Congress that this bill will receive prompt attention by the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee. Controlling water thirsty \ninvasive species is one significant and substantial step in the right \ndirection for the dry lands of the west.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 177\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide assistance to the State of New Mexico for \nthe development of comprehensive State water plans, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, water is the life's blood for New \nMexico. When the water dries up in New Mexico, so will many of its \ncommunities. As such, the scarcity of water in New Mexico is a dire \nsituation. Unfortunately, the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer, \nNM OSE, lacks the tools necessary to undertake the Herculean task of \neffectively managing New Mexico's water resources.\n  Today, I introduce legislation that would allow New Mexico to make \ninformed decisions about its limited water resources.\n  In order to effectively perform water rights administration, as well \nas comply with New Mexico's compact deliveries, the State Engineer is \nstatutorily required to perform assessments and investigations of the \nnumerous stream systems and ground water basins located within New \nMexico. However, the NM OSE is ill equipped to vigorously and \ncomprehensively undertake the daunting but critically important task of \nwater resource planning. At present, the NM OSE lacks adequate \nresources to perform necessary hydrographic surveys and data \ncollection. As such, ensuring a future water supply for my home State \nrequires that Congress provide the NM OSE with the resources necessary \nto fulfill its statutory mandate.\n  The bill I introduce today would create a standing authority for the \nState of New Mexico to seek and receive technical assistance from the \nBureau of Reclamation and the United States Geological Survey. It would \nalso provide the NM OSE the sum of $12.5 million in Federal assistance \nto perform hydrologic models of New Mexico's most important water \nsystems. This bill would provide the NM OSE with the best resources \navailable when making crucial decisions about how best to preserve our \nlimited water stores.\n\n[[Page S590]]\n\n  Ever decreasing water supplies in New Mexico have reached critical \nlevels and require immediate action. The Congress cannot sit idly by as \nwater shortages cause death to New Mexico's communities. I hope the \nSenate will give this legislation its every consideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 178\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the exchange of land within the Sierra \nNational Forest, California, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nSierra National Forest Land Exchange Act of 2005, the companion to \nlegislation authored by Representative Radanovich.\n  This legislation would assist the Boy Scout Sequoia Council in taking \nownership of part of the land on which Camp Chawanakee sits. By \nauthorizing the transfer of ownership of part of the camp land to the \nBoy Scouts, we will help make Chawanakee a permanent member of the \nFresno Community, and an asset that youth for generations to come can \nenjoy and benefit from.\n  Specifically, the bill would authorize a land exchange between the \nFederal Government and a private landowner as follows:\n  The landowner would receive 160 acres, 145 of which are submerged, on \nShaver Lake. In exchange, the Forest Service would receive $50,000 and \nan 80 acre inholding that the landowner owns in the Sierra National \nForest.\n  The Forest Service transfer to the landowner is conditional upon his \nconveyance of the parcel to the Boy Scouts within 4 months to benefit \nCamp Chawanakee.\n  Over the years, well over 250,000 youths and leaders from California, \nNevada and Arizona have attended the Boy Scouts' Camp Chawanakee. \nRecently, summer camp attendance has exceeded 3,000 Scouts. While other \ncamps in California have closed in recent years, Camp Chawanakee has \ngrown to become one of the premier Scouting camps in the Nation.\n  I applaud Congressman George Radanovich's commitment to this issue \nand urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 179\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER FOR SUBSEQUENT CONVEYANCE OF \n                   FEDERAL LAND.\n\n       (a) Right of First Offer.--As a condition on the conveyance \n     of the Federal land under section 3 and its reconveyance to \n     the Sequoia Council of the Boy Scouts of America, as required \n     by section 3(d)(1), the Secretary shall require that the \n     Council agree to provide the owner of the easement granted \n     under section 4 the right of first offer to obtain the \n     Federal land, or any portion thereof, that the Council ever \n     proposes to sell, transfer, or otherwise convey.\n       (b) Notice and Offer.--If the Council proposes to sell, \n     transfer, or otherwise convey the Federal land or a portion \n     thereof, the Council shall give the easement owner written \n     notice specifying the terms and conditions on which the \n     conveyance is proposed and offering to convey to the easement \n     owner, on the same terms and conditions, the Federal land or \n     the portion thereof proposed for conveyance.\n       (c) Acceptance or Rejection of Offer.--Within 90 days after \n     the easement owner receives the notice required by subsection \n     (b) and all available documents necessary to perform \n     reasonable due diligence on the proposed conveyance, the \n     easement owner shall either accept or reject the offer. If \n     the easement owner accepts the offer, the closing of the sale \n     shall be governed by the terms of the offer in the notice.\n       (d) Effect of Rejection.--If the hydropower easement owner \n     rejects an offer under subsection (b) or fails to respond to \n     the offer before the expiration of the 90-day period provided \n     in subsection (c), the Council may convey the property \n     covered by the notice to any other person on the same terms \n     and conditions specified in the notice. If those terms and \n     conditions are subsequently altered in any way, then the \n     notice and offer shall again be made to the easement owner \n     under subsection (b). The rejection by the easement owner of \n     one or more of such offers shall not affect its right of \n     first offer as to any other proposed conveyance by the \n     Council.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENSIGN:\n  S. 181. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit against income tax for taxpayers owning certain commercial power \ntakeoff vehicles; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation to \ncorrect an inequity with the United States Tax Code that affects \nthousands of taxpayers every year. The bill I am offering is the Fuel \nTax Equalization Credit for Substantial Power Takeoff Vehicles Act \nwhich will correct an injustice for owners of ready mixed concrete and \nsanitation trucks.\n  Our Tax Code imposes a Federal tax on fuel sold for use in highway \nvehicles. This makes sense because vehicles that use our roads cause \nwear and tear. The money raised from the fuel tax goes directly into \nthe Highway Trust Fund and is used for road repair and maintenance. The \nCode provides fuel tax exemption for ``off highway'' use so that fuel \nused by non-highway vehicles is not taxed. The principle is simple. \nFuel used to move vehicles on our roads is taxed; fuel used for ``off-\nroad'' purposes is not.\n  Mixed concrete and sanitation trucks are ``dual-use'' vehicles. In \naddition to consuming fuel for roadway travel, they use fuel for a \nsecondary purpose such as turning the mixer drum or lifting a dumpster \nand compacting trash. This is known as a ``Power Takeoff Function.'' In \nthe past, this function was performed by a second fuel-driven engine. \nBut times have changed. Today, sanitation and cement trucks are more \nefficient and use one engine for both tasks. Today's vehicles create \nthe situation where technology is in the fast lane but our tax system \nlags behind in the slow lane.\n  The environment benefits with the use of one engine instead of two as \na result of decreased fuel use and exhaust emissions. Using one engine \nreduces the truck's weight which means these trucks can haul more cargo \nwithout violating weight restrictions. This decreases the number of \ntrips these trucks must take which results in less wear and tear on the \nroads.\n  Until recently, owners of dual-use vehicles would estimate the amount \nof fuel taxes they paid for fuel related to off-road use and would \nclaim a tax credit for that amount. The Tax Code does not recognize \n``dual-use'' vehicles but recent IRS regulations support the idea that \nthe fuel tax did not apply to fuel used for non-highway purposes. \nDespite the regulations, the IRS argued in a recent tax court case that \nestimating fuel consumption was too difficult to administer. In other \nwords, the IRS dismissed its own regulations. Unfortunately for \ntaxpayers who own dual use vehicles, the tax court agreed with the \nIRS's position. This decision has had the effect of penalizing \nefficiency, conservation and good environmental practices.\n  Mr. President, by establishing an annual $250.00 per vehicle tax \ncredit my bill resolves this inequity. This legislation should not be \nseen as creating a new tax break. It restores tax fairness to owners of \ndual-use vehicles without resorting to an elaborate fuel measurement \nscheme that would create administrative difficulties. The amount of the \ntax credit is less than the estimated amount of fuel taxes paid for\n\n[[Page S592]]\n\nnon-highway purposes for these vehicles. In order to receive this \ncredit, a vehicle would have to be registered, licensed and insured in \nthe vehicle owner's respective State. This is a measure that will \nsimply restore fairness to a situation involving the fuel tax where \nCongress never intended the tax to apply in the first place.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT:\n  S. 182. A bill to provide for the establishment of the Uintah \nResearch and Curatorial Center for Dinosaur National Monument in the \nStates of Colorado and Utah, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Uintah Research \nand Curatorial Center Act.\n  This bill would authorize the National Park Service, NPS, to \nconstruct a research and curatorial facility for Dinosaur National \nMonument and its partner, the Utah Field House of Natural History \nMuseum, Museum in Vernal UT. The facility would be co-located to with \nthe museum while helping to preserve, protect, and exhibit the vast \ntreasures of one of the most productive sites of dinosaur bones in the \nworld.\n  This is not the first time I have introduced this legislation, which \nwas reported favorably and passed by this body in October 2004. \nUnfortunately there was not enough time before the end of the \nlegislative session for this bill to be considered by the House. It is \nmy hope that this legislation can be addressed by both bodies during \nthe 109th Congress. With this legislation, I believe we can proactively \naddress the Dinosaur National Monument's deteriorating storage \nfacilities, before there is irreparable damage to the resources stored \nthere.\n  Since the first discovery of Jurassic era bones by the paleontologist \nEarl Douglass in 1909, and the subsequent proclamation as a national \nmonument in 1915 by President Woodrow Wilson, the Dinosaur National \nMonument has been a haven for both amateur and expert dinosaur \nenthusiasts.\n  At present, Dinosaur National Monument has more that 600,000 items in \nits museum collection. Unfortunately, these items are currently stored \nin 17 different facilities throughout the park. Many of these resources \nare at risk due to the failure of the scattered facilities to meet \nminimum National Park Service storage standards. A new research and \ncuratorial facility is greatly needed to bring the park's collections \nup to standard and to ensure its protection.\n  The curatorial facility will also fill a critical role as a \ncollection center for the park and partners' fossil, archaeological, \nnatural resource operations and collections, and park archives. \nMoreover, in these days of limited budgets, the decision to co-locate \nthis facility with the State's museum will also save taxpayer dollars. \nThe State of Utah is nearing completion of their new Field House Museum \nat a cost to the State of $6.5 million. Because of the co-location, NPS \nstaff, visiting scholars, interns and volunteers would have access to \nthe State museum's space for exhibit, classroom, conferencing, \neducation, restrooms, public access, parking, and other needs not \nincluded in the curatorial facility.\n  The 22,500 square foot facility will be built outside the boundaries \nof the park on land donated to the Park Service by the city of Vernal \nand Uintah County. The legislation will also permit the Park Service to \naccept the donation of the land, valued at approximately $1.5 million. \nThe Park Service estimates the total cost of adding the research and \ncuratorial center to be $8.7 million.\n  Other Federal agencies, such as the Bureau of Land Management and the \nForest Service, who are also in need of collections storage, have \nbecome minor partners and would utilize a small portion of the storage \nfacility. An additional partner in the project, the Intermountain \nNatural History Association, has agreed to fund and carry out the soil \nand environmental testing necessary to permit the Park Service to \naccept the donation.\n  Mr. President, it is imperative that we care for these \npaleontological resources and ensure their availability to future \ngenerations, both for scientific study and the enjoyment of the public. \nThis legislation is a proactive approach to accomplishing those \nobjectives and is an excellent example of a cost effective partnership \nbetween the National Park Service, the State of Utah Department of \nNatural Resources, the city of Vernal, and Uintah County, of which this \nCongress ought to applaud and support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 183. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide families of disabled children with the opportunity to purchase \ncoverage under the medicaid program for such children, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join once again with my \ngood friend Senator Kennedy to introduce the Family Opportunity Act.\n  The Family Opportunity Act provides states the option to allow \nfamilies with disabled children to buy into the Medicaid program.\n  Mr. President, Senator Kennedy and I have tried to get the Family \nOpportunity Act enacted for many years.\n  The legislation has been scaled back dramatically as we have \nattempted to make the bill less costly. For example, the original \nproposal, introduced in the 106th Congress would have set a family's \neligibility at 600 percent of the Federal Poverty Level, would have had \nan enhanced administrative match and provided coverage for children up \nto age 21.\n  The version we are introducing today sets the family's eligibility at \n300 percent of Federal Poverty Level, no administrative match and \nprovides coverage for children up to age 18.\n  I am very hopeful that these modifications will ensure that the \nFamily Opportunity Act can be enacted this year.\n  The legislation is consistent with the ``compassionate conservative'' \nagenda advanced by the President and the Congressional leadership.\n  It helps families stay together. In some cases, in order to provide \nfor the special needs of their child, parents face the unbearable \nprospect of having to put their child in an out of home placement just \nto keep their child's access to Medicaid covered services.\n  Some of these parents have to refuse jobs, pay raises and overtime in \norder to preserve access to Medicaid for their child with disabilities. \nThese parents are hard working taxpayers.\n  There is precedent for allowing individuals with disabilities to \ncontinue to have access to the services that Medicaid provides while \nenhancing their income and self-esteem through the dignity and the \ncontribution to society that one attains through engagement in the \nworld of work. It only makes sense to extend these principles to adults \nwith a child with a disability.\n  The Family Opportunity Act is an option for States. It is not a \nFederal mandate. Additionally, it encourages the use of private \nemployer sponsored coverage. Hopefully a participating family has some \nprivate insurance. The Family Opportunity Act would allow states to \noffer ``wrap around'' services that the employer sponsored coverage \ndoes not provide, such as physical therapy, mental health services and \ncustomized durable medical equipment.\n  Children with significant disabilities need these services in order \nto properly develop into responsible and contributing members of \nsociety.\n  Additionally, the legislation would provide for the establishment of \ndemonstration projects regarding home and community based alternatives \nto psychiatric residential treatment facilities for children.\n  Under current law, states are not allowed to offer home and community \nbased services as an alternative to inpatient psychiatric hospitals. \nThe legislation proposed by Senator Kennedy and myself would help \nrealize this goal for these children.\n  The Family Opportunity Act would make progress in correcting this \nomission by allowing for demonstration projects to test the \neffectiveness in improving or maintaining a child's functional level \nand cost-effectiveness of providing coverage of home and community \nbased alternatives to psychiatric residential treatment for children in \nthe Medicaid program.\n  Finally, the Family Opportunity Act would provide for the development \nof Family to Family Health Information Centers which help guide \nfamilies\n\n[[Page S593]]\n\nthrough the maze of programs and networks associated with the \nchallenges of raising a child with a disability.\n  The Family Opportunity Act is a good bill. For many years it has \ngarnered the support of a majority of Senators. It has the support of \nnumerous family and child advocacy groups.\n  This legislation is pro-family, pro-work and pro-compassion. I urge \nthe quick enactment of the Family Opportunity Act.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor once again to join my \ncolleague Senator Grassley in introducing the Family Opportunity Act to \nremove the health care barriers for children with disabilities that so \noften prevent families from staying together and staying employed.\n  We know that families of disabled and special needs children continue \nto struggle to help their children learn to live independently and \nbecome fully contributing members of their communities.\n  Eight percent of children in this country have significant mental or \nphysical disabilities, and many of them do not have access to the \ncritical health services they need to improve their lives and prevent \ndeterioration of their health. To obtain needed health services for \ntheir children, families are often forced to become poor themselves, \nstay poor, put their children in out of home placements, or even give \nup custody of their children so that the children can qualify for the \nbroad health coverage available under Medicaid.\n  In a recent survey of 20 States, families of special needs children \nreport they are turning down jobs, turning down raises, turning down \novertime, and are unable to save money for the future of their children \nand family so that their child can stay eligible for Medicaid through \nthe Social Security Income Program.\n  Today we are reintroducing legislation intended to close the health \ncare gap for the Nation's most vulnerable population, and enable \ndisabled children and their families to be equal partners in the \nAmerican dream.\n  As President Bush said in his ``New Freedom Initiative'' on February \n1, 2001, ``Too many Americans with disabilities remain trapped in \nbureaucracies of dependence, and are denied the access necessary for \nsuccess and we need to tear down these barriers''.\n  The Family Opportunity Act will eliminate the unfair barriers that \ndeny needed health care to so many disabled and special needs children.\n  It makes health insurance coverage more widely available for children \nwith significant disabilities, through opportunities to buy-in to \nMedicaid at an affordable rate.\n  It allows States to develop a demonstration program to provide needed \nMedicaid services to children with psychiatric illnesses, instead of \nlimiting such coverage to a residential or institutional setting.\n  It establishes Family to Family Information Centers in each State to \nhelp families with special needs children.\n  The enactment of the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 \ndemonstrated the commitment of Congress to do all we can to enable \npeople with disabilities to lead independent and productive lives. It \nis time for Congress to show that same commitment to children with \ndisabilities and their families.\n  I look forward to working with all members of Congress to enact this \nlegislation and give disabled children and their families across the \ncountry a genuine opportunity to fulfill their dreams and fully \nparticipate in the social and economic mainstream of the Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Hagel, \n        Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 185. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to repeal the \nrequirement for the reduction of certain Survivor Benefit Plan \nannuities by the amount of dependency and indemnity compensation and to \nmodify the effective date for paid-up coverage under the Survivor \nBenefit Plan; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and \nSenators Corzine, Hagel, Durbin and Dayton, I am honored to introduce \nlegislation today that we are convinced is necessary to fix a long-\nstanding problem in our military survivors benefits system.\n  The system in place right now, even with the important changes we \nhave made recently, does not take care of our military widows and \nsurviving children the way it should. We should act to correct this in \nthis session.\n  I have sought and found inspiration on this from Holy Scripture. In \nfact, a simple yet powerful passage in the Book of Isaiah captures so \nmuch of what we are all about as a Nation theses days and what this \nlegislation is trying to do.\n  In Isaiah we are told, ``Learn to do good. Seek justice. Help the \noppressed.'' And then we are admonished to, ``Defend the orphan. Fight \nfor the rights of widows.''\n  Also in the first chapter of James, verse 27 we are told that in \nGod's eyes the true measure of our faith is to look after orphans and \nwidows in their distress.\n  This is powerful and clear direction that speaks to our hearts.\n  Last year, under Senator Reid's leadership and at the Senate's \ninsistence, the Defense authorization bill corrected a long-standing \ninequity by allowing 100-percent disabled military retirees to receive \nconcurrently their full retired pay and disability compensation.\n  That correction in law was long overdue and we need to continue to \nwork to extend this change to include retirees with lower disability \nratings.\n  But there is another related injustice that needs to be addressed. \nThe legislation that we offer today will extend the same protection of \nbenefits to the widows and orphans of our 100-percent disabled military \nretirees and those who die on active duty.\n  Back in 1972, Congress established the military survivors' benefits \nplan--or SBP--to provide retirees' survivors an annuity to protect \ntheir income. This benefit plan is a voluntary program purchased by the \nretiree or issued automatically in the case of service members who die \nwhile on active duty. Retired service members pay for this benefit from \ntheir retired pay. Then upon their death, their spouse or dependent \nchildren can receive up to 55 percent of their retired pay as an \nannuity.\n  Surviving spouses or dependent children of 100-percent service-\nconnected disabled retirees or those who die on active duty are also \nentitled to dependency and indemnity compensation from the Veterans' \nAdministration.\n  But the annuity paid by the survivors' benefits plan and received by \na surviving widow or a child is reduced by the amount of the dependency \nand indemnity compensation received from the VA.\n  I know a little something about insurance and income security plans. \nAnd I don't know of any other annuity program in the government or \nprivate sector that is permitted to offset, terminate, or reduce their \npayments because of disability payments a beneficiary may receive from \nanother plan or program.\n  The legislation that we are proposing today also makes effective \nimmediately a change to the military SBP program that we enacted in \n1999. We have already agreed that military retirees who have reached \nthe age of 70 and paid their SBP premiums for 30 years should stop \npaying a premium. But we delayed the effective date for this relief \nuntil 2008. We should not delay their relief any further.\n  The United States owes its very existence to generations of soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and Marines who have sacrificed throughout our history \nto keep us free. The sacrifices of today are no less important to \nAmerican liberty or tragic when a life is lost in the defense of \nliberty everywhere.\n  We owe them and those they leave behind a great debt.\n  As Abraham Lincoln instructed us, ours is an obligation ``to care for \nhim who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and for his \norphan.''\n  Too often we fall short on this care. We must meet this obligation \nwith the same sense of honor as was the service they and their families \nhave rendered.\n  We will continue to work to do right by those who have given this \nNation their all, and especially for the loved ones they may leave to \nour care.\n  I appreciate the cosponsorship of my colleagues--Senators Corzine, \nHagel, Durbin and Dayton--and look forward\n\n[[Page S594]]\n\nto working with everyone in the days ahead.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 185\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to announce the introduction \nof the Military Retiree Survivor Benefit Equity Act of 2005. This bill \nis a major step forward in making our military's Survivor Benefit \nProgram fairer, more equitable, and more in keeping with our Nation's \npromise to our service members and their families. The bill combines \ntwo important fixes to the SBP. The first corrects a serious inequity \nin SBP that currently requires over a hundred thousand older military \nsurvivors to pay extra into the system for the same benefits as more \nrecent enrollees. I have been fighting to fix this problem since the \nlast Congress and am confident that this year we will succeed in \nproviding basic fairness to these survivors.\n  This bill also eliminates the dollar-for-dollar deduction of the \ndependency indemnity compensation, DIC, which the VA pays to survivors, \nfrom SBP annuities. This policy is effectively a tax on military \nsurvivors at a time when so many of our brave men and women in uniform \nare dying in Iraq and their families are struggling to get by. Senator \nNelson has long fought to eliminate this unfairness, and I am proud to \nstand with him today in introducing this comprehensive legislation.\n  The legislation that I introduced in the last Congress and which is \nincluded in this bill eliminates a major inequity in the SBP arising \nfrom a 1999 congressional act limiting the time required to pay into \nthe plan. That act deemed retirees who are at least 70 years old and \nhave already been paying into SBP for at least 30 years to be fully \n``paid up'' for the purpose of receiving benefits. This was an \nimportant piece of legislation, but, unfortunately, Congress only made \nit effective in 2008. The result was that earlier enrollees--those who \nenrolled between 1972 and 1978--were forced to pay into SBP longer than \nenrollees from 1978 or later, up to 6 extra years of premiums. In other \nwords, they had to pay in longer for the same benefits.\n  This inequity was further magnified by the fact that those earlier \nretirees paid much higher SBP premiums--10 percent of retired pay--for \ntwo full decades, until 1992, when the premium was reduced to 6.5 \npercent of retired pay.\n  This bill, by making the ``paid up'' provision effective this year, \nwill finally grant these survivors--the widows and widowers of the \nGreatest Generation--the same benefits of those who enrolled in SBP in \nsubsequent years. It will provide basic fairness to 135,000 survivors \nand allow us to honor their sacrifice and that of their loved ones.\n  This bill also eliminates the dollar-for-dollar reduction of SBP \nbenefits by the amount received in dependency and indemnity \ncompensation. Under current law, the surviving spouse of an active duty \nor retired military member who dies from a service-connected cause is \nentitled to $993 a month--for a survivor without children--from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. However, the surviving spouse's SBP \nannuity is reduced by the amount of DIC.\n  SBP and DIC payments are paid for different reasons. SBP, in most \ncases, is elected and purchased by the retiree to provide a portion of \nretired pay to the survivor. DIC payments represent special \ncompensation to a survivor whose sponsor's death was caused directly by \nhis or her uniformed service. To offset DIC--which we provide to the \nfamilies of those who have lost their life in the service of their \ncountry--from annuities earned and paid for, is blatantly unfair.\n  This bill has the broadest possible support among organizations \nrepresenting our troops and their families, including Air Force \nAssociation, Air Force Sergeants Association, Air Force Women Officers \nAssociated, American Logistics Association, AMVETS, Army Aviation \nAssociation of America, Associations of Military Surgeons of the United \nStates, Association of the U.S. Army, Commissioned Officers Association \nof the U.S. Public Health Service, CWO and WO Association U.S. Coast \nGuard, Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the U.S., Fleet \nReserve Association, Gold Star Wives of America, Jewish War Veterans of \nthe USA, Marine Corps League, Marine Corps Reserve Association, \nMilitary Officers Association of America, Military Order of the Purple \nHeart, National Association for Uniformed Services, National Guard \nAssociation of the U.S., National Military Family Association, National \nOrder of Battlefield Commissions, Naval Enlisted Reserve Association, \nNaval Reserve Association, Navy League of the U.S., Noncommissioned \nOfficers Association of the United States of America, Reserve Officers \nAssociation, Society of Medical Consultants to the Armed Forces, \nMilitary Chaplains Association of the USA, Retired Enlisted \nAssociation, United Armed Forces Association, USCG Chief Petty Officers \nAssociation, U.S. Army Warrant Officers Association, VFW, and Veterans' \nWidows International Network. The Military Coalition has described this \nbill as a top legislative goal, and it is my expectation that it will \nhave strong support in the Senate.\n  It is vital that we keep faith with the men and women who serve in \nour military as well as their families. The widows and widowers of our \nservice members, those who are serving now and those who served us in \nearlier times, are owed our deepest gratitude. But in the face of their \nsacrifice, there is more that we should do. We cannot ever fully \ncompensate them for their loss. But we can ensure that the benefits \nthat they have earned are fair and just.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Shelby, Mr. \n        McConnell, Mr. Bunning, and Mr. Sarbanes):\n  S. 186. A bill to prohibit the use of Department of Defense funds for \nany study related to the transportation of chemical munitions across \nState lines; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an issue of considerable \nimportance to the people of southern Colorado. For nearly 50 years, the \npeople of\n\n[[Page S595]]\n\nsouthern Colorado have lived with the knowledge that within a few miles \nof their homes, schools, and places of business lies one of the largest \nstockpiles of chemical munitions in the world. The Pueblo Chemical \nDepot was built during World War II and continues to this day to serve \nas an ammunition and material storage facility. Since the mid-1990s, \nthe primary mission of the depot has been to protect the 780,000 \nchemical weapons being stored there.\n  As required by the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Department of \nDefense in 1997 launched an aggressive program to dismantle the U.S. \nchemical weapons stockpile. The program has since repeatedly stumbled \nand has not met the expectations of the international community, \nCongress and, most important, the people who live near these \nstockpiles. The costs of the program have risen from $15 billion in \n1997 to $24 billion in 2001, an increase of $9 billion in 4 years. Some \nhave estimated that the program will cost as much as $30 billion by the \ntime it is completed.\n  The time schedule has experienced unconscionable delays. Last year \ncleanup of Pueblo was expected to be completed by 2011. The \nDepartment's latest budget decision has pushed the date all the way \nback to 2021, 9 years after the Chemical Weapons Convention treaty \ndeadline.\n  Numerous safety incidents have occurred at operational sites, \nshutting down one facility for 9 months. Poor contracting has resulted \nin the shutting down of another facility, which is now costing the \nFederal Government $300,000 a day to keep operationally ready. It was \nhardly a surprise then when the President's own management assessment \nlast year labeled this program as ineffective.\n  On top of these numerous problems, the Department of Defense has \nfailed to fully communicate its intentions to either Congress or the \nlocal community. Last week, for instance, Senator Salazar, my colleague \nfrom Colorado, and I met with two Department of Defense officials to \ndiscuss this program. At that meeting we requested that the Defense \nDepartment answer some questions and were promised a written response \nfrom Under Secretary of Defense Michael Wynne within 3 days. That \nmeeting was held over a week ago, and we have yet to receive a \nresponse.\n  At least we in Congress can get a meeting. Members of the local \ncommunity in Pueblo, CO have been trying to get an official from the \nDefense Department to meet with them to discuss the Pentagon's plans \nfor weeks. Despite the fact that the Defense Department is trying to \nunilaterally shut down the design work at Pueblo, the Pentagon has not \ntaken the time to meet with the residents who, if the Pentagon gets its \nway, will be forced to live for another 15 years near an aging \nstockpile housing three-quarters of a million chemical weapons.\n  The latest and most frustrating Pentagon effort in this program is to \nstudy once again the possibility of transporting the 2,600 tons of \nmustard gas across the State of Colorado to an incinerator site out of \nthe State. Never mind that this option has been studied at least three \ntimes in the past decade, and never mind that current law prohibits the \ntransport of chemical munitions across State lines, and never mind that \ntransporting these weapons out of State would violate the agreement the \nDefense Department made with the people in Pueblo.\n\n  This study is unnecessary and a waste of taxpayers' hard-earned \ndollars. I don't know how simpler we can make it. I have already been \ntold by Pentagon officials that the study is going to conclude that the \ntransportation of chemical munitions across State lines is not \npractical. If that is the case, why do the study? Why waste $150,000 to \nstudy the feasibility of an option that is against the law and has \nalready been determined by the Pentagon to be impractical?\n  With the Department wasting money on meaningless studies, it is no \nwonder that this program is over budget and behind schedule. I think it \nis time we took a stand against the Pentagon's wasteful actions. \nTherefore, I am introducing legislation today that will stop this study \nand force the Department of Defense to recognize that the only option \nfor destroying its chemical munitions is to build a disposal site in \nPueblo.\n  I am pleased to announce that my colleague from Colorado, Senator Ken \nSalazar, has agreed to cosponsor this legislation. I wanted to mention, \nthough, that Senator Mitch McConnell, Senator Bunning, and Senator \nShelby have also agreed to cosponsor. We should not forget that Senator \nMcConnell in particular has been fighting the Department on this issue \nfor over a decade. In many respects, Senator McConnell's hard work has \npaved the way for the legislation I am introducing today along with my \ncolleague from the State of Colorado, Senator Salazar.\n  I urge my other colleagues to join us in putting the Department on \nnotice that this kind of wasteful, meaningless effort will not be \ntolerated.\n  I believe it is time the Pentagon took a good look at its chemical \ndemilitarization program. Our country cannot afford to throw away our \nscarce defense dollars into a program that continues to be so \nincredibly mismanaged. Nor should our Nation's diplomats be put in the \nposition of having to explain why we can't meet our treaty obligations \nto the likes of China, Iran, or France. Most importantly, we cannot \nforget the thousands of innocent Americans who continue to live near \nthese sites. They bear the burden of the Pentagon's mismanagement. It \nis not fair to them when all they have asked for is that these \nmunitions be cleaned up in a manner that is safe and does not harm the \nenvironment.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleagues in \nrelation to the Pueblo Chemical Depot. When the Senate ratified the \nChemical Weapons Convention in 1997, it became U.S. law and our sworn \nobligation to destroy our Nation's chemical weapons stockpiles by 2012. \nWith the advent of the global war on terror, this responsibility has \ntaken on even more importance. We must destroy these weapons to ensure \nthe health and safety of the citizens of the State of Colorado.\n  We must also stand as an example to the world that we are firmly \nresolved in our commitment to reducing the threats posed by weapons of \nmass destruction in our Nation.\n  Given the gravity of the situation, I cannot understand why the \nDepartment of Defense is shirking from their responsibility in this \nmatter.\n  Until recently, the relationship between the Army and the citizens of \nPueblo had an excellent track record, proving that when good people \ncome together and operate from a position of trust, significant \nproblems can be solved. Yet, one day after Senator Allard and I were \nabsolutely assured by the Department of Defense that the chemical \nweapons stored in Pueblo would not be transported, and that the weapons \nwould be destroyed in Pueblo by the environmentally safe method of \nwater neutralization, the Department of Defense turned around and \ncommenced a study on the feasibility of transporting the stockpiles out \nof Pueblo to be incinerated at another site--twenty-four hours after \nthey said they wouldn't.\n  I believe we were given a good faith commitment last week that the \ndestruction of the weapons would continue at Pueblo using the water \nneutralization technology agreed upon, and that the munitions would not \nbe transferred elsewhere. While we wait for the promised clarification \non these matters, Senator Allard and I believe it is necessary to \nemphasize our resolve.\n  To help provide that emphasis, we are introducing this bill. It is a \nstraightforward, one-line bill to prohibit the use of Department of \nDefense funds for any study related to the transportation of chemical \nmunitions across State lines.\n  Mr. President, the sheer number of weapons awaiting destruction at \nthe Pueblo Chemical Depot is staggering: more than three-quarters of a \nmillion artillery shells and mortar rounds. Transporting these weapons \nwould be a dangerous and expensive enterprise. It would be subject to \nlegal challenges by the towns and the States involved, and it is \nagainst Federal law.\n  In short, transporting these weapons will not save time, and it will \nnot save money. But this bill we have brought to the floor will save \nboth time and money, because it stops the frivolous study and returns \nthe focus to the issue at hand: the safe destruction of the chemical \nweapons at Pueblo by water neutralization.\n\n[[Page S596]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, one of the first meetings I had as a \nU.S. Senator 20 years ago was about the aging chemical weapons stored \nat the Blue Grass Army Depot in Richmond, KY. At the time, the Army was \nignoring the concerns of the community and attempting to incinerate the \nweapons irrespective of the potential risk.\n  Not much has changed.\n  I have spent the last 20 years fighting for the citizens of Kentucky \nwho live in proximity to these dangerous weapons, and although the \nparty responsible for the weapons is now the Department of Defense, the \nproblem remains the same. Those responsible for the destruction of the \nchemical stockpiles are ignoring the best interests and concerns of the \ncitizens who live near them.\n  Every time I have helped the community to clear a hurdle, whether it \nwas to force the Army to investigate alternative technologies to \nincineration or the creation of a new organization to manage the new \nmethod of demilitarization, a new obstacle has been put in the path of \nstockpile destruction. Currently, the citizens of Kentucky and Colorado \nare being robbed to pay for the massive cost overruns at incineration \nsites throughout the country.\n  The budgets for demilitarization at Blue Grass and Pueblo have been \nslashed, and the money has been transferred to other accounts in spite \nof the fact that Blue Grass and Pueblo had succeeded in securing \npermits from the local environmental agencies in record time. The \nAssembled Chemical Weapons Agency, which has been tasked with managing \nthe demilitarization of these stockpiles, is respected and trusted by \nthe community. And I believe the Department's decision to cut funding \nfor ACWA in the FY06 budget is a slap in the face to the citizens of \nKentucky and Colorado, and an insult to the fine people at ACWA.\n  Now the Department has suggested it wants to transport the weapons \nfrom these depots through our communities to incineration sites. This \nwill not happen so long as I am a U.S. Senator.\n  After the time and energy I have expended on ensuring these weapons \nare disposed of in a safe and environmentally friendly manner, I am \npersonally insulted by the Department's efforts to delay destruction \nand its suggestion of transporting the weapons elsewhere.\n  The Department has an obligation to the citizens of Kentucky and \nColorado to dispose of these stockpiles in an expeditious and safe \nmanner. Congress and the Department, working with the communities, \ncertified an alternative means of disposal, and it is unacceptable for \nthe Department to walk away from this promise. Destruction of \nstockpiles at Blue Grass and Pueblo deserves full funding from the \nDepartment of Defense, and I will work to put the demilitarization of \nthese stockpiles back on schedule.\n  I want to thank my friend, Senator Allard, for his efforts to safely \ndispose of these dangerous stockpiles. As a member of the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Allard was a tireless advocate for the \ncitizens of Colorado who live near these weapons. I am happy to welcome \nSenator Allard to the Appropriations Committee, where I look forward to \nworking with him to ensure that Blue Grass and Pueblo receive the \nfunding attention that is so long overdue.\n  Although the Department may come to its senses and decide not to \npursue the shipment of decaying stockpiles of chemical weapons through \nsuburban Kentucky or Colorado, I've come to learn that trusting the \nbest judgment of the folks in charge of this program is never a sure \nbet. For that reason, I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of Senator \nAllard's legislation, which will prohibit the shipment of chemical \nweapons from any Army installation. These weapons need to be destroyed, \nbut they need to be destroyed safely at the locations where they \ncurrently are stored. Moving 60-year-old stockpiles of leaking mustard \nagent is not a solution to a budget problem, it is a recipe for \ndisaster.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Smith, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Conrad, Mr. \n        Dayton, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, \n        Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reed, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n        Sarbanes, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Wyden, Ms. Collins, \n        Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. Biden):\n  S. 187. A bill to limit the applicability of the annual updates to \nthe allowance for States and other taxes in the tables used in the \nFederal Needs Analysis Methodology for the award year 2005-2006, \npublished in the Federal Register on December 23, 2004; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I join with Senators Kennedy and Smith \nand twenty-seven of our colleagues today in introducing a very \nimportant piece of legislation, the Ensuring College Access for All \nAmericans Act.\n  This bill would prevent any student from seeing a reduction in the \nPell grants under recent changes by the Bush administration to the \nformula used to calculate student aid eligibility. On December 23, \n2004--just 2 days before the Christmas holiday, I might note--the \nDepartment of Education published updates to the allowance for state \nand other taxes that is used by students and their families to \ncalculate their expected family contribution, or EFC, to college \ntuition. The EFC is the amount that students and their families are \nexpected to contribute towards college in a given year.\n  Changes in a student's ``expected family contribution'' have a direct \nimpact on that student's eligibility for a variety of types of \nfinancial aid. Simply put, as a student's expected family contribution \ngoes up, their eligibility for financial aid goes down.\n  The Administration's changes to the tax tables have the effect of \ncutting $300 million from the successful Pell grant program, upon which \nmore than five million students nationwide rely. It is projected that, \nas a result of these cuts, 1.3 million students will see a reduction in \ntheir Pell grants and another 89,000 will become ineligible for Pell \ngrant assistance.\n  Not only will these changes drastically affect Pell grant eligibility \nand aid, but because the EFC formula is used to calculate eligibility \nfor other forms of Federal aid, including federal student loans, as \nwell as private institutional and state aid, these changes will cut \npractically all forms of student aid. Unfortunately, the Department's \nchanges to the state and local tax allowance will increase the EFC for \nnearly all American families and students. While no New Jersey students \nare projected to lose assistance under this year's proposed cuts, they \nwere projected to lose assistance under similar cuts proposed in 2003. \nI am very concerned that New Jersey students could be hurt going \nforward if the administration continues to update the tax tables based \non outdated tax information.\n  Certainly, I do not disagree that the tax tables used to determine \nEFC, which have not been updated since 1988, may need to be revised to \nreflect current state and local tax burden. However, the \nadministration's proposal does not reflect current tax levels. The \nupdates reduce the credit that families receive for paying state and \nlocal taxes at a time in which they are actually paying more taxes. For \nexample, the administration's new tax tables are based on Fiscal Year \n2002 state tax information. According to the National Association of \nState Budget Officers, though, since FY 2002, states have enacted $14.1 \nbillion in tax and fee increases. Again, because the administration's \nproposal is based on outdated tax information, it does not take into \naccount these substantial increases in State tax burden.\n  In fact, the General Accounting Office issued a report last week that \nfound that the Department of Education's procedures for revising the \ntax tables and the formula the Department used are seriously flawed. \nThe GAO report, entitled Student Financial Aid: Need Determination \nCould be Enhanced through Improvements in Education's Estimate of \nApplicants' State Tax Payments, states, ``Education could not provide \nus with written procedures guiding staff on the routine steps necessary \nto update the tax allowance, nor did it maintain detailed records of \nits efforts to obtain data.'' The report goes on to say of the data the \nDepartment used to revise the tables,\n\n\n[[Page S597]]\n\n\n       As a result of certain limitations of the SOI [statistics \n     of income] dataset for the purpose of calculating the \n     allowance and problems with how Education uses this dataset, \n     the current state and other tax allowance may not fully \n     reflect the amount of taxes paid by students and families. \n     The dataset itself is not ideally suited for calculating the \n     allowance because it is limited to financial data from those \n     who itemize their taxes, does not include state and local \n     taxes, and is several years older than the income information \n     reported by students and families on the FAFSA.\n\n  The report further notes that because the SOI compiles data only for \nthose who itemize their tax deductions, who may pay different tax rates \nthan non-itemizers, the data is further flawed. The GAO goes on to \nsuggest improvements to the Department's calculations and the data they \nuse.\n  These changes also come at a time when tuition is rising dramatically \nat double digit rates, and students and working families are straining \nto provide the financial wherewithal to access America's promise of \neducation. According to the College Board, tuition, room, and board at \na four-year public university costs an average of $11,354, $824 more \nthan last year and $1775 more than 2 years ago. In other words, tuition \nat public institutions has been increasing by almost ten percent a \nyear. In fact, according to the National Association of State \nUniversities and Land-Grant Colleges, tuition and fees at public \ninstitutions in New Jersey has increased by more than 40 percent since \nthe 1999-2000 school year. In some states they've increased by more \nthan 60 percent in the last five years.\n  To really understand these numbers, though, it's necessary to look at \nthe people who are struggling to afford to go to college. To that end, \nI would like to read a couple of personal stories about the importance \nof the Pell grant program to a college-bound student and a student \nstruggling to afford college now.\n  One student writes,\n\n       I am lucky enough to be attending a top-rate University and \n     receiving a quality education, but I rely on many federal \n     loans and aid, including a Pell Grant, in order to remain \n     where I am. When President Bush decided not to fully fund \n     Pell Grants, he left me and many others in a precarious \n     position. My Pell grant is still pending and I really am \n     counting on it to cover some of my basic expenses; it will be \n     a hardship until it comes--or worse if it doesn't come in \n     full. The President says he's an advocate for young people \n     with his dubious social security plans, but he leaves us \n     behind with his non-commitment to higher education.\n\n  A mother who fears she will no longer be able to afford to send her \nson to school writes,\n\n       I've saved money from the day my son was born so that he \n     may attend the college of his dreams. He is a gifted musician \n     and was awarded scholarships to attend Berklee in Boston. \n     With the help of the Pell Grant and other student loans, he \n     is now a freshman there and I'm proud to say is doing very \n     well. However, I am worried that with Bush having lowered the \n     income standard for Pell, Timmy may lose his grant and there \n     won't be enough money saved for him to stay in school. I \n     would like to give him the opportunity to pursue his dreams \n     and let his talent take him where it may. I see Bush cutting \n     programs from the have nots to give to the haves. How many \n     dreams is he going to destroy and how many more programs is \n     he going to cut?''\n\n  It's wrong, to cut $300 million--a small price to pay to ensure that \nlow-income families can afford to send their children to college--from \nthis program. And it's even worse to cut aid to 1.4 million families \nbased on faulty calculations.\n  A college education today is essential to survival in our competitive \nmarketplace. Not only does our economy thrive on an educated workforce, \nbut also those who are educated and as a result are gainfully employed \ncontribute enormously to our tax base. I am willing to venture that the \ncosts of the Pell grant program are more than paid back by those who \nwere able to go to attend college because of a Pell grant and today are \nproductive, tax-paying citizens.\n  The Senate must prevent these cuts from becoming a reality. Thirty \nSenators stand behind the legislation I introduce today a bipartisan \ngroup of thirty Senators, I might add.\n  I hope that we can put politics aside and pass this legislation \nimmediately to prevent any student from losing Pell grant assistance. \nFinally, I strongly urge the administration to take a close look at the \nGAO report and to reform the flawed system they have used to revise the \ntax tables.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 187\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ensuring College Access for \n     all Americans Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ALLOWANCE FOR STATE AND OTHER TAXES.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the annual \n     updates to the allowance for State and other taxes in the \n     tables used in the Federal Needs Analysis Methodology to \n     determine a student's expected family contribution for the \n     award year 2005-2006 under part F of title IV of the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087kk et seq.), published \n     in the Federal Register on Thursday, December 23, 2004 (69 \n     Fed. Reg. 76926), shall not apply to a student to the extent \n     the updates will reduce the amount of Federal student \n     assistance for which the student is eligible.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Today I join Senator Corzine and 26 of our colleagues to \nintroduce legislation to prohibit the implementation of the proposed \nchanges in the State and local tax tables on college students receiving \nneed-based aid.\n  When decisions are made by any administration that affect the price \nthat families pay for college, it is important that the Congress \nunderstands both the factors that influenced that decision and the \nimpact of those decisions on our constituents. In light of the slumping \neconomy, State budget crises, and rising college costs, the \nDepartment's proposed changes come at a very difficult time for \nstudents and their families. Raising the cost of tuition by a few \nhundred dollars may cause a student to have to leave school and it is \nour responsibility to ensure that these changes are being made for \nsound reasons.\n  I urge the Department of Education to work with Congress when making \nthese decisions so that members of this body are made aware of policy \nchanges through a collaborative process--and not the media.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to talk about \nthe advantages of having a college education and the importance of \nensuring access to higher education. That is why I am pleased to join \nas a cosponsor the Corzine-Smith Kennedy Ensuring College Access for \nAll Americans Act of 2005. Due to recent changes made to the formula \ndetermining federal Pell grant awards, many students are at risk of \nlosing needed financial aid. This bill would guarantee that no student \nsees a reduction in his or her Pell grant assistance in the 2005-2006 \nschool year or loses the grant completely.\n  We are all familiar with the adage: education is the great \nequalizer--and that a college education is the economic ladder to \nupward mobility. Not only do individuals reap benefits from having a \ncollege degree, society also values higher education--as we have also \nheard that education is the engine that drives a healthy economy. \nBasically, in addition to all its other benefits, having a good \neducation pays individuals in the long run.\n  According to a recent report by the college board, college graduates \nearn about 73 percent more than high school graduates over their \nworking lives. For those with advanced degrees, earnings are two to \nthree times higher than high school graduates. Moreover, society enjoys \nthe financial returns on the investment in higher education--from \ngenerated higher tax payments to decreased dependency on public income-\ntransfer programs. Overall, higher education improves individual and \nsocietal quality of life.\n  While we are convinced that higher levels of educational attainment \nproduces positive outcomes we need to do more to ensure access to \nhigher education.\n  With the cost of college tuition continuing to rise, financial aid is \nthe decisive factor in determining whether thousands of high school \nseniors are college bound or not. In particular, Federal Pell grants \nare especially critical for low-income students financing their way \nthrough college. According to the college board, college tuition at 4 \nyear institutions increased on average by over 10 percent in the 2004-\n2005\n\n[[Page S598]]\n\nschool year. At 2-year public colleges, tuition increased by over 8 \npercent.\n  However, the Department of Education's recent changes to the formulas \nfor financial aid eligibility will cut $300 million in Pell grant \nassistance to students nationwide, resulting in drastic reductions of \nPell grant awards to more then one million students. The American \nCouncil on Education estimates that 89,000 students who are currently \neligible for a Pell grant will lose this financial assistance. An \nadditional 1.3 million student will likely see a reduction of $100 to \n$300 in their Pell Grants.\n  In my home State, over 4,000 students, just at one college, the \nUniversity of Washington, will be adversely impacted from the change in \nfinancial aid eligibility. Early estimates show that about 3,900 \nstudents of the 6,900 eligible for a Pell Grant will lose up to $200 a \nyear. Two hundred more students will probably lose their minimum grants \nof $400. Many of the students likely to see a decrease in their Pell \ngrant award are low income.\n  Federal financial aid was critical to my own educational \nachievements. I went to college on a Pell grant. It was a critical to \nmy being able to finance my way through school. With these new rules, \nsome students may quit school or will have to spend more time working \nwhen they should be going to class.\n  The Ensuring Access for All Americans Act of 2005 would restore this \ncritical financial assistance to thousands of needy students in the \n2005-2006 school year. At a time when more and more employers are \nrequiring a college degree for employment and tuition costs are \nskyrocketing, government should be opening the doors to educational \nopportunity, not locking students out. I urge prompt Senate action on \nthis measure.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I am pleased to join Senators Corzine \nand Kennedy as a cosponsor of the bill Ensuring College Access for All \nAmericans that restores cuts to the Federal Pell Grant Program for \nmillions of students nationwide.\n  Federal Pell grants are the cornerstone of our need-based financial \naid system ensuring that all students have access to higher education.\n  These grants provide nearly $12.8 billion to help about 5.3 million \nlow-income students attend college.\n  However, approximately 89,000 students currently eligible for a Pell \ngrant will lose it, while an additional 1.3 million students will see \ntheir grants reduced by as much as $100 to $300 due to cuts in the \nFederal Pell Grant Program.\n  In California, nearly 150,000 low-income students will see their \nfederal Pell grants decrease or disappear.\n  These cuts have a huge impact on students at California's public \ncolleges and universities.\n  Within the University of California system, almost half of the 46,000 \nPell grant recipients who attend one of the eight UC campuses will \nreceive reduced grants and about 500 students who receive $400 a year \nwill lose their grants completely.\n  On December 23, 2004, the Department of Education issued a proposal \nthat will cut $300 million from the Federal Pell Grant Program.\n  The proposal updates State and local tax tables used to determine \nfamilies' expected contribution towards college cost in a given year \nresulting in students and their families being expected to contribute \nmore for college expenses.\n  These changes, which use Fiscal Year 2002 State and local data, \nreduce the credit that families receive for paying State and local \ntaxes at a time when they are actually paying more taxes.\n  Senators Corzine and Kennedy's bill ensures that no student loses \ntheir Pell grant or sees a reduction in assistance under the Department \nof Education's proposal to update State and local tax tables.\n  It would simply ``hold harmless'' any student who stands to lose \nunder the new proposal, so that no student would see a reduction in \ntheir Pell grant. Those students in the States that stand to gain would \nstill benefit from the new tax tables.\n  It is imperative that cuts to this important student aid program be \nrestored so that students can continue to receive their Pell grants \nthat they are eligible for.\n  I recently received a letter from one my constituents from Chino, CA, \na parent who is very concerned about the cuts to the Pell grant \nprogram. The letter said:\n\n       This would result in millions of families, many of whom \n     depend on financial aid including Pell grants, such as my \n     children in college, losing all or part of their federal \n     support. . . . this affects us all and our children's future.\n\n  A college student from Contra Costa County in California wrote:\n\n       The amount of my Pell grant will not cover the cost of \n     supplies that I need for the semester. . . . my parents \n     cannot take out loans themselves. . . . so now I have to take \n     out loans of my own, which for the amount I was approved for, \n     doesn't even cover a quarter of my tuition. I really felt let \n     down and disappointed.\n\n  There could not be a worst time for making changes that would take \naway or shrink a student's financial aid.\n  Over 500,000 low and middle-income California students rely on Pell \ngrants for financial assistance. The maximum Pell grant has been frozen \nat $4,050 for 3 consecutive years, while the costs of attending a 4-\nyear public college or private college have increased both nationwide \nand in California.\n  We must do all we can to make college education more accessible and \naffordable for our Nation's students.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senators Corzine and Kennedy in \nsupporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Cornyn, \n        Mrs. Boxer, Mr. McCain, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Crapo, Ms. Cantwell, \n        Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Alexander, and Mr. \n        Lautenberg):\n  S. 188. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nauthorize appropriations for fiscal years 2005 through 2011 to carry \nout the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer today legislation to authorize \nappropriations for fiscal years 2005 through 2011 to carry out the \nState Criminal Alien Assistance Program, SCAAP.\n  I am pleased to be joined on this bill by a bipartisan group of \nSenators, including Senators Kyl, Schumer, Cornyn, Boxer, McCain, \nDurbin, Crapo, Cantwell, Hutchison, Bingaman and Alexander.\n  This legislation is critical to ensuring that cash strapped states \nand localities are at least partially reimbursed for the costs of \nhousing undocumented criminal aliens in their jails. Ultimately, were \nit not for the failure of the federal government to control illegal \nimmigration, States and localities would not have to spend hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in housing these individuals in their prisons and \njails.\n  During the 108th Congress, this bill passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent but stalled in the House of Representatives. This year, passage \nof this legislation is even more critical given that the authorization \nfor appropriations for SCAAP in the Immigration and Nationality Act \nexpired in 2004.\n  While hard numbers can be elusive when determining the actual costs \nto American taxpayers of illegal immigration, not many would disagree \nthat the costs are in the billions of dollars each year. These costs go \nto, for instance, education, medical care and incarceration. And even \nif we consider the tax contributions of undocumented aliens and \nsubtract that from the total costs, we are still left with expenditures \nin the billions of dollars.\n  The cost of incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens alone is a \nstaggering figure--millions of dollars each year. And these dollars \nexpended by States and localities are not optional. They must be \nexpended since incarcerating individuals convicted of committing a \ncrime is not optional.\n  Since funding for SCAAP began in 1995, the amount appropriated has \nbeen as high as $565 million and as low as $250 million--and these \nfigures only covered a portion of the costs expended by States and \nlocalities to house undocumented criminal aliens. Furthermore, every \nday States and localities expend other monies on undocumented criminal \naliens that are not reimbursed by the federal government through SCAAP. \nThose expenses include public safety expenditures, expenses of trial \nproceedings, use of translators, cost of public defenders and the \nincarceration\n\n[[Page S599]]\n\nexpenses of undocumented criminal aliens for minor offenses that do not \nmeet the standards of SCAAP.\n  The reality is that all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto \nRico and the U.S. Virgin Islands requested reimbursement through the \nSCAAP program in fiscal year 2004. In that year, $281,605,292 was \nawarded through the program.\n  Congress has an obligation to reimburse States and localities for the \ncosts of incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens when the federal \ngovernment fails in its responsibility to effectively deter illegal \nimmigration.\n  During the 108th Congress, this bill--S. 460--passed the Senate by \nunanimous consent.\n  This year, passage of this legislation is all the more critical \nbecause authorization for SCAAP funds expired in 2004. Without funding, \ncash strapped states and localities are going to have to re-allocate \nmonies from other areas within their criminal justice system to meet \nthe costs of housing undocumented criminal aliens.\n  We in Congress can assist, albeit in small part, our states by \nsupporting the ``State Criminal Alien Assistance Program \nReauthorization Act of 2005''. This bill would amend section 241(i)(5) \nof the Immigration and Nationality Act to authorize appropriations at a \nlevel of $750 million for FY 2006, $850 million for FY 2007 and $950 \nmillion for FY 2008 through FY 2011.\n  Enacted as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act \nof 1994, SCAAP reimburses States and localities that incur costs for \nincarcerating undocumented criminal aliens. These aliens must be \nconvicted of a felony or two or more misdemeanors in violation of State \nor local law, and incarcerated for at least 4 consecutive days.\n  Funding for SCAAP has been appropriated by Congress annually since \n1995. The program is administered by the Office of Justice Programs' \nBureau of Justice Assistance, which is located in the Department of \nJustice.\n  During FY1997 to FY2003, approximately $3.5 billion was distributed \nto States and localities. California has historically received the \nlargest annual awards since the program's inception, with Arizona, \nIllinois, New York and Texas also consistently receiving large awards. \nUnfortunately, authorization for SCAAP expired in October 2004.\n  SCAAP was established with the belief that protecting the nation's \nborders from illegal immigration is the responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment and that States and localities should be reimbursed by the \nFederal Government for expenses relating to these duties.\n  It is clear to everyone in this Chamber that immigration is a federal \nresponsibility. In fact, the Constitution gives Congress plenary power \nover immigration, so States are legally barred from acting on their \nown. SCAAP has been set up over the years to reimburse states and local \ngovernment for the costs of incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens.\n  It is based on the principle that when the Federal Government fails \nto enforce its laws against immigration violators, it should bear the \nresponsibility for the financial costs of this failure.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation. I also ask unanimous consent that the text of legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 188\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``State Criminal Alien \n     Assistance Program Reauthorization Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2005 \n                   THROUGH 2011.\n\n       Section 241(i)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1231(i)(5)) is amended by striking ``appropriated'' \n     and all that follows through the period and inserting the \n     following: ``appropriated to carry out this subsection--\n       ``(A) such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 2005;\n       ``(B) $750,000,000 for fiscal year 2006;\n       ``(C) $850,000,000 for fiscal year 2007; and\n       ``(D) $950,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2011.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 189. A bill to amend the Head Start Act to require parental \nconsent for nonemergency intrusive physical examinations; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nrequiring parental consent for intrusive physical exams administered \nunder the Head Start program.\n  Young children attending Head Start programs should not be subjected \nto these intrusive physical exams without the prior knowledge or \nconsent of their parents. While the Department of Health and Human \nServices has administered general exam guidelines to agencies, the U.S. \nCode is not clear about prohibiting them without parental consent. To \nclarify the code, my bill will not allow any nonemergency intrusive \nexam by a Head Start agency without parental consent. This would not \ninclude exams such as hearing, vision or scoliosis screenings.\n  This issue was brought to my attention by some of my constituents \nfrom Tulsa, OK who felt their rights were violated when their children \nwere subjected to genital exams and blood tests without their consent. \nI am pleased to see that the Rutherford Institute has taken an interest \nin this crucial issue and are representing my constituents.\n  As a father and grandfather, I believe it is vital for parents to be \ninformed about what is happening to their children in the classroom. I \nhope that my colleagues will join me in support of this important bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the following article be \nprinted in the Record, ``Federal Head Start suit pending.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Federal Head Start Suit Pending\n\n       A lawsuit against Tulsa's Head Start program alleging a \n     violation of the constitutional rights of preschool children \n     remains pending in the U.S. District Court.\n       The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the \n     lawsuit in July 2003 saying the program appears to have \n     ``directly violated'' their rights by subjecting children to \n     genital exams and blood tests without their parents' consent.\n       The appellate decision reversed a 2001 decision by U.S. \n     District Judge Terence Kern in Tulsa in favor of the \n     Community Action Project.\n       The lawsuit arose as a result of exams of Head Start boys \n     and girls at Roosevelt Elementary School on Nov. 5, 1998. The \n     appellate judges said a registered nurse, who was a CAP \n     employee, insisted on the exams over the objection of a \n     parent, who was also a CAP aide.\n       The appeals court also reinstated claims for invasion of \n     privacy and ``technical battery'' under Oklahoma law, and \n     claims against CAP for allegedly interfering with the \n     parents' ``constitutional right to direct and control the \n     medical treatment of their children.''\n       The parents are represented by Steven Aden, chief litigator \n     for the Virginia-based Rutherford Institute, a conservative \n     legal foundation that focuses on religious rights, parental \n     rights and freedom from government intrusion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         By Mr. HAGEL (for himself, Mr. Sununu, and Mrs. Dole):\n\n  S. 190. A bill to address the regulation of secondary mortgage market \nenterprises, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with my \ncolleagues Senators Sununu and Dole, the Federal Housing Enterprise \nRegulatory Reform Act of 2005. This is needed regulatory reform at a \ncritical time for the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae \nthe Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Freddie Mac, and the \nFederal Home Loan Banks.\n  There is no doubt that our housing government sponsored enterprises \nGSEs, have been successful in carrying out their mission of providing \nliquidity for the housing market. The market has remained strong \nthrough tough economic times, and homeownership in this country is at \nan all-time high.\n  The housing GSEs, however, are uncommon institutions with a unique \nset of responsibilities and stakeholders. Fannie and Freddie are \nchartered by Congress, limited in scope, and are subject to \nCongressional mandates, yet they are publicly traded companies with all \nthe earnings pressure that Wall Street demands. Additionally, Fannie \nand Freddie enjoy an implicit\n\n[[Page S600]]\n\nguarantee by the Federal Government that has aided them in developing \nsubstantial clout on Wall Street. With their influence in the markets, \ntheir ability to raise capital at near-Treasury bill rates, and their \nuse of the most sophisticated portfolio management tools, Fannie and \nFreddie today are no longer simply secondary market facilitators for \nmortgages.\n  The significance of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to our economy cannot \nbe overstated. Together, the companies own or guarantee roughly 45.6 \npercent of all mortgage loans in the United States. The companies \ncombined have issued over $3.9 trillion in obligations comprised of \n$2.2 trillion in mortgage backed securities and $1.7 trillion of GSE \ndebt.\n  It is clear that the recent revelations at both Freddie Mac and \nFannie Mae precipitate the need for Congress to address GSE regulatory \nreform. In 2003, Freddie Mac found itself treading through a wave of \naccounting problems and questionable management actions. That led to an \nincome restatement of $5 billion, a penalty of $125 million and the \nremoval of several members of its executive management. One year later, \na similar surge of questionable practices was discovered at Fannie Mae. \nThat led to the retirement and resignation of two of Fannie Mae's top \nmanagement officials, as well as last month's ruling by the Securities \nand Exchange Commission, SEC, that Fannie could face a $9 billion \nincome restatement.\n  At a minimum, the bar for a GSE should not be held lower than it is \nfor any other company. In fact, given its congressionally chartered \nmission to serve a public interest, the bar should be held \nsignificantly higher. The operations of such companies should be \nmanaged with uncompromising integrity and unabridged transparency.\n  Our legislation would create a new independent world class regulator \nfor Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks. Our bill \nprovides the new regulator with enhanced regulatory flexibility and \nenforcement tools like those afforded to the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation, the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller \nof the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision. Furthermore, the \nbill would:\n  Provide the new regulator the authority of receivership to close down \na failing GSE and protect against a taxpayer bailout; provide the new \nregulator greater discretion in raising capital standards to protect \nagainst insolvency; provide the new regulator approval power over new \nprograms and activities proposed by a GSE; provide the regulator with \ngreater authority to limit exit compensation packages or golden \nparachutes for executives removed for cause; require the annual audits \nof Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's affordable housing programs to ensure \nthat these programs support the enterprises' affordable housing \nmission; end presidential appointments to the board of directors of \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and would require all Federal Home Loan \nBank directors to be elected.\n  This reform is important to restoring and maintaining the confidence \nthat investors and the markets require. In light of the recent problems \nat Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, it is even more important. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this reform effort and invite them to cosponsor \nour bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. \n        Santorum):\n  S. 191. A bill to extend certain trade preferences to certain least-\ndeveloped countries, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important \nlegislation aimed at helping some the world's poorest countries along \ntheir path toward economic development and self-sufficiency. Joining me \nin introducing this bill are my colleagues Senator Feinstein, of \nCalifornia; Senator Baucus, of Montana; and Senator Santorum, of \nPennsylvania. I appreciate their efforts in getting us to this point, \nand I look forward to working with them to see that this legislation is \nenacted into law.\n  When President Bush delivered his second inaugural address last week, \nhe reaffirmed in absolute terms the commitment of the United States \ntoward furthering human dignity around the globe. He drew on the words \nand the beliefs of our forefathers that every life has worth and is \ndeserving of the freedom and security of economic independence.\n  The bill that I bring here today is aimed at spreading America's \nideals of economic independence to regions of the world that have seen \nfew such successes. My bill, the Tariff Relief Assistance for \nDeveloping Economies (TRADE) Act of 2005, would extend to some of the \npoorest people of the world the opportunity to work toward a better \nlife.\n  Specifically, my legislation would provide duty-free and quota-free \nbenefits, similar to those afforded under the Africa Growth and \nOpportunity Act, to some of the world's most impoverished nations. The \ncountries covered by this legislation are 14 of the least developed \ncountries (LDCs), as defined by the United Nations and the U.S. State \nDepartment, which are not covered by any current U.S. trade preference \nprogram. They include Afghanistan, East Timor, Maldives, Cambodia, \nBangladesh, and Nepal. My bill also includes a special emergency trade \nprovision to assist Sri Lanka as it struggles through the aftermath of \nthe recent tsunami.\n  The TRADE Act countries are subject to some of the highest U.S. \ntariffs in the world, averaging over 15 percent. This stands in glaring \ncontrast to the nearly negligible tariffs that face our wealthier \ntrading partners in Europe and Japan. The TRADE LDCs have been given \nduty-free entry from all other Organization for Economic Cooperation \nand Development countries, and they need our help now.\n  In prior years Congress has acted generously toward LDCs in the \nCaribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa. It is now time for us to act in a \nsimilar fashion to LDCs of the Asia-Pacific region. By allowing duty-\nfree imports into the United States, we can encourage these countries \nto diversify their economies while creating employment opportunities \nand promoting democracy.\n  In supporting these values, we can also help to bring about a safer \nand more peaceful world. Recent history has shown us the violence and \nresentment that can arise when people lose hope and societies \nbreakdown. Backward economic policies and repressive regimes offer \nfertile breeding ground for radical and dangerous ideologies.\n  In its final report, the 9/11 Commission recommended a U.S. strategy \nto counter terrorism that includes ``economic policies that encourage \ndevelopment, more open societies, and opportunities for people to \nimprove the lives of their families and enhance prospects for their \nchildren's future.''\n  The bill that I am introducing today can help us meet the goal of \ngreater economic development in an increasingly important region of the \nworld. The devastation brought by the recent tsunami coupled with the \nend of the textile quota system make this legislation especially timely \nand hasten the need for its passage. I thank you for the opportunity to \nspeak here today, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in \nCongress to pass this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 192. A bill to provide for the improvement of foreign \nstabilization and reconstruction capabilities of the United States \nGovernment; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. LUGAR. The bill I am introducing today seeks to enhance United \nStates effectiveness in dealing with countries that are either emerging \nfrom civil strife and conflict or threatened with instability. It calls \nfor the creation of certain fundamental capabilities within the \nGovernment, and the Pentagon in particular, that are critical to \nsuccess in what has come to be called stabilization and reconstruction \noperations. These capabilities include the training and equipping of \nsufficient numbers of civilian and military personnel for such \nactivities, as well as the development of a new guiding principle--one \nthat designates stabilization and reconstruction as a prime Defense \nDepartment mission with the same priority as combat operations.\n  Often these missions will occur at the end of major combat \noperations. We have learned from recent experiences in Afghanistan and \nIraq that the\n\n[[Page S601]]\n\nUnited States will encounter significant challenges in seeking to \nensure stability, democracy, and a productive economy in nations \naffected by conflict.\n  While United States Armed Forces are extremely capable of effectively \nprojecting military force and prevailing on the battlefield, achieving \nUnited States objectives also requires successful stabilization and \nreconstruction operations after major fighting has ceased. Without \nsuccess in the aftermath of large-scale hostilities, the United States \nhard-won military victories will be at risk. To achieve this success, \nthe armed forces and civilian agencies of the United States Government \nmust have the capabilities to support stabilization and reconstruction \nand to undertake effective planning and preparation well before the \noutbreak of hostilities.\n  There are many cases, as well, when timely intervention to stabilize \na threatening situation can head off the need for a major combat \noperation. This legislation envisions that the same capabilities \ncreated to stabilize a post-conflict situation may also be used to \nprevent conflict in the first place, thus achieving United States \nobjectives more effectively with less loss of life and less potential \nrisk to our relations with other countries.\n  Much as the military component of a conflict requires extensive \nplanning and training, we must also be well-prepared and trained for \nstabilization and reconstruction operations. To be fully effective in \nsuch operations, the United States needs to have Federal Government \npersonnel deployed continuously abroad for years-long tours of duty so \nthat they become familiar with the local scene and can earn the trust \nof indigenous people. The active component of the Armed Forces cannot \nmeet all of these requirements. Personnel from other Federal agencies, \nreserve component forces, contractors, United States allies and \ncoalition partners, and indigenous personnel must help.\n  This bill complements legislation I introduced last year, S. 2127, \nwhich calls for creation of a stabilization and reconstruction \ncapability within the State Department. I am pleased the State \nDepartment created a new office for such activities. This bill is the \nimportant next step. It calls upon the President to issue a directive \nto develop an intensive planning process for stabilization and \nreconstruction activities, as well as the establishment of joint \ninteragency task forces composed of senior Government executives and \nmilitary officers to ensure coordination and integration of the \nactivities of military and civilian personnel in a particular country \nor area of interest.\n  In addition, the bill calls upon the Secretary of Defense to take \nimmediate action to strengthen the role and capabilities of the \nDepartment of Defense for carrying out stabilization and reconstruction \nactivities as well as to support the development of core competencies \nin planning in other departments and agencies, principally the \nDepartment of State. It further calls for the Secretary of Defense to \ntake certain actions to ensure that stabilization and reconstruction \nbecomes a core competency of general purpose forces through training, \nleader development, doctrine development and the use of other force \nreadiness tools.\n  I recognize that the subject matter of this bill is extremely broad \nin scope, and that it properly falls within the purview of other \ncommittees in addition to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \nHowever, I believe that the only way the United States will achieve \nlong-term success in stabilization and reconstruction operations is if \nall resources of the United States Government are brought to bear on \nthe country or area of concern. It is for that reason that I am \nintroducing this bill, and I hope that my colleagues in this body, in \nparticular Senators Warner and Levin, will agree to take a major role \nin examining the merits of those aspects of this bill that fall within \ntheir jurisdiction and expertise.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 192\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Armed Forces of the United States are extremely \n     capable of effectively projecting military force and \n     achieving conventional military victory. However, achieving \n     United States objectives not only requires military success \n     but also successful stabilization and reconstruction \n     operations in countries affected by conflict.\n       (2) Without success in the aftermath of large-scale \n     hostilities, the United States will not achieve its \n     objectives. Success in the aftermath follows from success in \n     preparation before hostilities.\n       (3) Providing safety, security, and stability is critical \n     to successful reconstruction efforts and for achieving United \n     States objectives. Making progress toward achieving those \n     conditions in a country is difficult when daily life in that \n     country is largely shaped by violence of a magnitude that \n     cannot be managed by indigenous police and security forces.\n       (4) Reconstruction activities cannot and should not wait \n     until safety and security has been achieved. Many elements of \n     reconstruction, including restoration of essential public \n     services and creation of sufficient jobs to instill a sense \n     of well-being and self-worth in a population of a country, \n     are necessary precursors to achieving stabilization in a \n     country affected by conflict. Stabilization operations and \n     reconstruction operations are intrinsically intertwined.\n       (5) Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has \n     begun new stabilization and reconstruction operations every \n     18 to 24 months. Because each such operation typically lasts \n     for five to eight years, cumulative requirements for human \n     resources can total three to five times the level needed for \n     a single operation.\n       (6) History indicates that--\n       (A) stabilization of societies that are relatively ordered, \n     without ambitious goals, may require five troops per 1,000 \n     indigenous people; and\n       (B) stabilization of disordered societies, with ambitious \n     goals involving lasting cultural change, may require 20 \n     troops per 1,000 indigenous people.\n       (7) That need, with the cumulative requirement to maintain \n     human resources for three to five overlapping stabilization \n     operations, presents a formidable challenge. It has become \n     increasingly clear that more people are needed in-theater for \n     stabilization and reconstruction operations than for combat \n     operations.\n       (8) Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has \n     spent at least four times more on stabilization and \n     reconstruction activities than on large-scale combat \n     operations.\n       (9) One overarching lesson from history is that the \n     quality, quantity, and kind of preparation in peacetime \n     determines success in a stabilization and reconstruction \n     operation before it even begins. If an operation starts \n     badly, it is difficult to recover.\n       (10) It is clear from experience in Afghanistan and Iraq \n     that the United States must expect to encounter significant \n     challenges in its future stabilization and reconstruction \n     efforts, including efforts that seek to ensure stability, \n     democracy, human rights, and a productive economy in a nation \n     affected by conflict. Achieving these ends requires effective \n     planning and preparation in the years before the outbreak of \n     hostilities in order for the Armed Forces and civilian \n     agencies of the United States Government to have the \n     capabilities that are necessary to support stabilization and \n     reconstruction. Such capabilities are not traditionally found \n     within those entities.\n       (11) The United States can be more effective in meeting the \n     challenges of the transition to and from hostilities, \n     challenges that require better planning, new capabilities, \n     and more personnel with a wider range of skills.\n       (12) Orchestration of all instruments of United States \n     power in peacetime would obviate the need for many military \n     expeditions to achieve United States objectives, and better \n     prepare the United States to achieve its objectives during \n     stabilization and reconstruction operations.\n       (13) Choosing the priority and sequence of United States \n     objectives, acknowledging that not everything is equally \n     important or urgent, and noting that in other cultures \n     certain social and attitudinal change may take decades, all \n     require explicit management-decisionmaking and planning in \n     the years before stabilization and reconstruction operations \n     might be undertaken in a region.\n       (14) To be fully effective, the United States needs to have \n     Federal Government personnel deployed continuously abroad for \n     years-long tours of duty, far longer than the length of \n     traditional assignments, so that they become familiar with \n     the local scene and the indigenous people come to trust them \n     as individuals.\n       (15) There is a significant need for skilled personnel to \n     be stationed abroad in support of stabilization and \n     reconstruction activities. The active components of the Armed \n     Forces cannot meet all of these requirements. Personnel from \n     other Federal agencies, reserve component forces, \n     contractors, United States allies and coalition partners, and \n     indigenous personnel must help.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) enhancing United States effectiveness in the transition \n     to and from hostilities will require--\n\n[[Page S602]]\n\n       (A) management discipline, that is--\n       (i) the extension of the management focus of the Armed \n     Forces (covering the full gamut of personnel selection, \n     training, and promotion;\n       (ii) planning, budgeting, and resource allocation;\n       (iii) education, exercises, games, modeling, and rehearsal, \n     performance and readiness measurement; and\n       (iv) development of doctrine (now focused on combat \n     operations) to include peacetime activities, stabilization \n     and reconstruction operations and intelligence activities \n     that involve multi-agency participation and coordination; and\n       (B) building and maintaining certain fundamental \n     capabilities that are critical to success in stabilization \n     and reconstruction, including training and equipping \n     sufficient numbers of personnel for stabilization and \n     reconstruction activities, strategic communication, \n     knowledge, understanding, and intelligence, and \n     identification, location, and tracking for asymmetric \n     warfare;\n       (2) these capabilities, without management discipline, \n     would lack orchestration and be employed ineffectively, and \n     management discipline without these capabilities would be \n     impotent; and\n       (3) the study of transition to and from hostilities, which \n     the Defense Science Board carried out in the summer of 2004 \n     at the request of the Secretary of Defense, provides an \n     appropriate framework within which the Department of Defense \n     and personnel of other departments and agencies of the \n     Federal Government should work to plan and prepare for pre-\n     conflict and post-conflict stability operations.\n\n     SEC. 2. DIRECTION, PLANNING, AND OVERSIGHT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that a new coordination and \n     integration mechanism is needed to bring management \n     discipline to the continuum of peacetime, combat, and \n     stabilization and reconstruction operations.\n       (b) Presidential Action.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President should issue a directive to develop an \n     intensive planning process for stabilization and \n     reconstruction activities, and that the directive should \n     provide for--\n       (1) contingency planning and integration task forces, that \n     is, full-time activities that could continue for months or \n     years, to be staffed by individuals from all involved \n     agencies who have expertise in the countries of interest and \n     in needed functional areas to work under the general guidance \n     of the Assistant to the President for National Security \n     Affairs;\n       (2) joint interagency task forces composed of senior \n     Government executives and military officers who operate in a \n     particular country or area of interest and are created to \n     ensure coordination and integration of the activities of all \n     United States personnel in that country or area; and\n       (3) a national center for contingency support, that is, a \n     federally funded research and development center with country \n     and functional expertise that would support the contingency \n     planning and integration task forces and joint interagency \n     task forces and would augment skills and expertise of the \n     Government task forces, provide a broad range of in-depth \n     capability, support the planning process, and provide the \n     necessary continuity.\n       (c) Actions by Secretary of Defense.--While a directive \n     described in subsection (b) is being implemented, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall--\n       (1) take immediate action to strengthen the role and \n     capabilities of the Department of Defense for carrying out \n     stabilization and reconstruction activities;\n       (2) actively support the development of core competencies \n     in planning in other departments and agencies, principally \n     the Department of State;\n       (3) instruct regional combatant commanders to maintain a \n     portfolio of operational contingency plans for stabilization \n     and reconstruction activities similar in scope to that \n     currently maintained for combat operations; and\n       (4) instruct each regional combatant commander to create a \n     focal point within their command for stabilization and \n     reconstruction planning and execution.\n\n     SEC. 3. STABILIZATION AND RECONSTRUCTION CAPABILITIES.\n\n       (a) Core Competency.--The Secretary of Defense and the \n     Secretary of State shall each--\n       (1) make stabilization and reconstruction one of the core \n     competencies of the Department of Defense and the Department \n     of State, respectively;\n       (2) achieve a stronger partnership and closer working \n     relationship between the two departments; and\n       (3) augment their existing capabilities for stabilization \n     and reconstruction.\n       (b) Department of Defense.--\n       (1) Mission.--The Secretary of Defense shall designate the \n     planning for stabilization and reconstruction as a mission of \n     the Department of Defense that has the same priority as the \n     mission of the Department of Defense to carry out combat \n     operations.\n       (2) Supporting actions.--In administering the planning, \n     training, execution, and evaluation necessary to carry out \n     the stabilization and reconstruction mission, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall--\n       (A) designate the Army as executive agent for stabilization \n     and reconstruction;\n       (B) ensure that stabilization and reconstruction \n     operational plans are fully integrated with combat \n     operational plans of the combatant commands;\n       (C) require the Army and the Marine Corps to develop, below \n     the brigade level, modules of stabilization and \n     reconstruction capabilities to facilitate task organization \n     and exercise and experiment with them to determine where \n     combinations of these capabilities can enhance United States \n     effectiveness in stability operations;\n       (D) require the Secretary of the Army to accelerate \n     restructuring of Army Reserve and Army National Guard forces \n     with an emphasis on providing the capability for carrying out \n     the stabilization mission; and\n       (E) ensure that stabilization and reconstruction becomes a \n     core competency of general purpose forces through training, \n     leader development, doctrine development, and use of other \n     force readiness tools and, to do so, shall require that--\n       (i) the Secretaries of the military departments and the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff integrate stabilization and \n     reconstruction operations into the professional military \n     education programs of each of the Armed Forces and the joint \n     professional military education programs, by including in the \n     curricula courses to increase understanding of cultural, \n     regional, ideological, and economic concerns, and to increase \n     the level of participation by students from other agencies \n     and departments in those programs;\n       (ii) stabilization and reconstruction be integrated into \n     training events and exercises of the Armed Forces at every \n     level;\n       (iii) the commander of the United States Joint Forces \n     Command further develop, publish, and refine joint doctrine \n     for stability and reconstruction operations;\n       (iv) the Director of Defense Research and Engineering and \n     the senior acquisition executive of each of the military \n     departments develop and implement a process for achieving \n     more rapid and coherent exploitation of service and \n     departmental science and technology programs and increase the \n     investment in force-multiplying technologies, such as \n     language translation devices and rapid training;\n       (v) the resources for support of stability operations be \n     increased; and\n       (vi) a force with a modest stabilization capability of \n     sufficient size to achieve ambitious objectives in small \n     countries, regions, or areas, and of sufficient capability to \n     achieve modest objectives elsewhere be developed, and \n     consideration be given to the actual capability of that force \n     in making a decision to commit the force to a particular \n     stabilization and reconstruction operation or to expand the \n     force for that operation.\n       (c) Department of State.--\n       (1) Policy on reconstruction integration.--It is the policy \n     of the United States that the capabilities to promote \n     political and economic reform that exist in many civilian \n     agencies of the United States Government, in international \n     organizations, in nongovernmental and private voluntary \n     organizations, and in other governments be integrated based \n     upon a common vision and coordinated strategy.\n       (2) Responsibilities of the secretary of state.--The \n     Secretary of State shall--\n       (A) be the locus for carrying out the policy on \n     reconstruction integration set forth in paragraph (1); and\n       (B) develop in the Department of State capabilities--\n       (i) to develop, maintain, and execute a portfolio of \n     detailed and adaptable plans and capabilities for the \n     civilian roles in reconstruction operations;\n       (ii) to prepare, deploy, and lead the civil components of \n     reconstruction missions; and\n       (iii) to incorporate international and nongovernmental \n     capabilities in planning and execution.\n       (d) Collaboration and Cooperation Between Departments of \n     Defense and State.--The Secretary of Defense shall--\n       (1) assist in bolstering the development of the Office of \n     Stabilization and Reconstruction of the Department of State \n     and otherwise support that objective through the sharing of \n     the extensive expertise of the Department of Defense in \n     crisis management planning and in the process of deliberate \n     planning;\n       (2) work collaboratively with that office and assign to \n     that office at least 10 experts to provide the intellectual \n     capital and guidance on the relevant best practices that have \n     been developed within the Department of Defense; and\n       (3) ensure that extensive joint and collaborative planning \n     for stabilization and reconstruction operations occurs before \n     commencement of a conflict that leads to such an operation.\n\n     SEC. 4. STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION.\n\n       (a) Presidential Directive.--Recognizing an increase in \n     anti-American attitudes around the world, particularly in \n     Islamic and Middle-Eastern countries, the use of terrorism, \n     and the implications of terrorism for national security \n     issues, it is the sense of Congress that the President should \n     issue a directive to strengthen the United States \n     Government's ability--\n       (1) to better understand global public opinion about the \n     United States, and to communicate with global audiences;\n       (2) to coordinate all components of strategic \n     communication, including public diplomacy, public affairs, \n     and international broadcasting; and\n       (3) to provide a foundation for new legislation on the \n     planning, coordination, conduct, and funding of strategic \n     communication.\n\n[[Page S603]]\n\n       (b) NSC Organization.--It is, further, the sense of \n     Congress that the President should establish a permanent \n     organizational structure within the National Security Council \n     to oversee the efforts undertaken pursuant to a directive \n     described in subsection (a) and that such structure should \n     include--\n       (1) a deputy national security advisor for strategic \n     communication to serve as the President's principal advisor \n     on all matters relating to strategic communication;\n       (2) a strategic communication committee, chaired by the \n     deputy national security advisor for strategic communication \n     and with a membership drawn from officers serving at the \n     under secretary level of departments and agencies, to develop \n     an overarching framework for strategic communication \n     (including brand identity, themes, messages, and budget \n     priorities) and to direct and coordinate interagency programs \n     to maintain focus, consistency, and continuity; and\n       (3) an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan center for \n     strategic communication to serve as a source of independent, \n     objective expertise to support the National Security Council \n     and the strategic communication committee, by (among other \n     actions) providing information and analysis, developing and \n     monitoring the effectiveness of themes, messages, products, \n     and programs, determining target audiences, contracting with \n     commercial sector sources for products and programs, and \n     fostering cross-cultural exchanges of ideas, people, and \n     information.\n       (c) Actions by Departments of State and Defense.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of State and the Secretary \n     of Defense shall each allocate substantial funding to \n     strategic communication.\n       (2) Department of state.--Within the Department of State, \n     the Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public \n     Affairs shall be the principal policy advisor and manager for \n     strategic communication.\n       (3) Department of defense.--Within the Department of \n     Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy shall \n     serve as that department's focal point for strategic \n     communication.\n\n     SEC. 5. KNOWLEDGE, UNDERSTANDING, AND INTELLIGENCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The knowledge necessary to be effective in conducting \n     stabilization and reconstruction operations is different from \n     the military knowledge required to prevail during \n     hostilities, but is no less important.\n       (2) To successfully achieve United States political and \n     military objectives, knowledge of culture and development of \n     language skills must be taken as seriously as development of \n     combat skills.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the collection, analysis, and integration of cultural \n     knowledge and intelligence should be ongoing to ensure its \n     availability far in advance of stabilization and \n     reconstruction operations for which such knowledge and \n     intelligence are needed; and\n       (2) a new approach is needed to establish systematic ways \n     to access and coordinate the vast amount of knowledge \n     available within the United States Government.\n       (c) Commanders of Combatant Commands.--\n       (1) Intelligence plans.--The Secretary of Defense shall \n     require the commanders of the combatant commands to develop \n     intelligence plans as a required element of their planning \n     process. Each such plan shall satisfy information needs for \n     peacetime, combat, and stabilization and reconstruction \n     (including support to other departments and agencies) and be \n     developed by use of the same kinds of tools that are useful \n     in traditional pre-conflict and conflict planning.\n       (2) Resources.--The Secretary of Defense shall provide \n     resources to the regional combatant commands for the \n     establishment of offices for regional expertise outreach to \n     support country and regional planning and operations, and to \n     provide continuity, identify experts, and build relationships \n     with outside experts and organizations.\n       (3) Area experts.--In order to increase the number of \n     competent area experts, the Under Secretary of Defense for \n     Personnel and Readiness shall lead a process to set \n     requirements and develop career paths for foreign area \n     officers and a new cadre of enlisted area specialists, a \n     process based on a more formal, structured definition of \n     requirements by the commanders of the combatant commands.\n       (4) Military education.--The Secretaries of the military \n     departments shall improve the regional and cultural studies \n     curricula in the joint professional military education \n     system, as well as in online regional and cultural self-study \n     instruction, in order to broaden cultural knowledge and \n     awareness.\n       (d) Intelligence Reform.--\n       (1) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the United States should shift the focus of intelligence \n     reform from reorganization to the solving of substantive \n     problems in intelligence.\n       (2) Actions.--The Director of National Intelligence, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall--\n       (A) establish a human resource coordination office charged \n     with the responsibility to develop a comprehensive human \n     resource strategy for planning, management, and deployment of \n     personnel that would serve as the basis for optimizing the \n     allocation of resources against critical problems;\n       (B) adopt a new counterintelligence and security approach \n     that puts the analyst in the role of determining the balance \n     between need-to-share and need-to-know that will enable the \n     intelligence community to enlarge its circle of trust from \n     which to draw information and skills;\n       (C) improve integration between networks and data \n     architectures across the intelligence community to facilitate \n     enterprise-wide collaboration;\n       (D) harmonize special operations forces, covert action, and \n     intelligence, and ensure that sufficient capabilities in \n     these specialized areas are developed;\n       (E) accelerate the reinvention of defense human \n     intelligence and ensure that there are enough such personnel \n     assigned and sustained for a sufficient number of years in \n     advance of the nation's need for their services; and\n       (F) enhance the analysis of intelligence collected from all \n     sources, including by improving the selection, recruitment, \n     training, and continuing education of analysts, producing \n     regular and continuous assessment and post-operation \n     appraisal of intelligence products, and creating incentives \n     to promote the creativity and independence of analysts.\n       (e) Foreign Language Proficiency.--\n       (1) Finding.--Congress finds that the utilization of \n     individuals with foreign language skills is critical to \n     understanding a country or a region, yet the Department of \n     Defense lacks sufficient personnel with critical foreign \n     language skills.\n       (2) Actions by secretary of defense.--The Secretary of \n     Defense shall--\n       (A) prescribe the specific foreign language and regional \n     specialist requirements that must be met in order to meet the \n     needs of the Department of Defense, including the needs of \n     the commander of the United States Joint Forces Command and \n     the commanders of the other combatant commands and the needs \n     of the Armed Forces generally, and shall provide the \n     resources for meeting these requirements in the annual budget \n     submissions; and\n       (B) develop a more comprehensive system for identifying, \n     testing, tracking, and accessing personnel with critical \n     foreign language skills.\n       (f) Exploitation of Open Sources of Information.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that open sources of \n     information--\n       (A) can provide much of the information needed to support \n     peacetime needs and stabilization and reconstruction needs; \n     and\n       (B) can be used to develop a broad range of products needed \n     for stabilization and reconstruction operations, including \n     such products as genealogical trees, electricity generation \n     and transmission grids, cultural materials in support of \n     strategic communication plans, and background information for \n     noncombatant evacuation operations.\n       (2) Executive agent for department of defense.--The \n     Secretary of Defense shall designate the Director of the \n     Defense Intelligence Agency to serve as executive agent of \n     the Department of Defense for the development and \n     administration of a robust and coherent program for the \n     exploitation of open sources of information.\n\n     SEC. 6. IDENTIFICATION, LOCATION, AND TRACKING IN ASYMMETRIC \n                   WARFARE.\n\n       The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director \n     of National Intelligence, shall immediately develop a program \n     administered by a new organization established by those \n     officers to provide--\n       (1) an overall technical approach to--\n       (A) the identification, location, and tracking of \n     asymmetric warfare operations carried out against the Armed \n     Forces of the United States or allied or coalition armed \n     forces; and\n       (B) tracking targets in asymmetric warfare in which the \n     Armed Forces of the United States, or allied or coalition \n     armed forces may be engaged;\n       (2) the systems and technology to implement the approach;\n       (3) the analysis techniques for translating sensor data \n     into useful identification, location, and tracking \n     information;\n       (4) the field operations to employ, utilize, and support \n     the hardware and software produced; and\n       (5) feedback to the Secretary of Defense and the Director \n     of National Intelligence on the impact of related policy \n     decisions and directives on the creation of a robust \n     identification, location, and tracking capability.\n\n     SEC. 7. MANAGEMENT IMPLEMENTATION PLANS.\n\n       (a) Requirement for Plans.--Not later than 90 days after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \n     Defense and the Secretary of State shall each submit to \n     Congress a management plan for carrying out the \n     responsibilities of the Secretary of Defense (and the duties \n     of other officials of the Department of Defense) and the \n     responsibilities of the Secretary of State (and the duties of \n     other officials of the Department of State), respectively, \n     under this Act.\n       (b) Content.--Each plan submitted under this section shall \n     include objectives, schedules, and estimates of costs, \n     together with a discussion of the means for defraying the \n     costs.\n\n     SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATIONS OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) Department of Defense.--There is authorized to be \n     appropriated to the Department of Defense for the Office for \n     Stability Operations such sums as may be necessary to enable \n     that office to carry out the planning, oversight, and related \n     stabilization and reconstruction activities required of the \n     Department of Defense under this Act.\n\n[[Page S604]]\n\n       (b) Department of State.--There is authorized to be \n     appropriated to the Department of State such sums as may be \n     necessary for carrying out the planning, oversight, and \n     related stabilization and reconstruction activities required \n     of the Department of State under this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Nebraska (for himself and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 194. A bill to amend the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of \n2002 to permit the planting of chicory on base acres; to the Committee \non Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I am offering \nlegislation with Senator Mike Enzi to remove chicory from the fruit and \nvegetable, FAV, planting prohibition on Direct and Counter-Cyclical \nProgram, DCP, base acres.\n  Diversification is a common theme among farm producers throughout the \ncountry. If we expect our producers to survive, we have to give them \nmore options for diversifying agriculture. Our responsibility should \ninclude the elimination of the disincentive to produce alternative \ncrops. This bill offers a clear opportunity to grow a chicory industry, \ncreating a new revenue stream and helping to diversify agriculture \nproduction.\n  The State of Nebraska currently has the only chicory processing \nfacility in the United States. There is a strong interest from \nproducers in Nebraska and Wyoming to increase the production of \nchicory, due to its relatively low input cost and opportunity for high \nprofits. Only 800 to 1,000 acres of the crop are expected to be planted \nin 2005. Farm bill policies are simply blocking the prospects for \ngrowth in the chicory industry.\n  The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 currently provides \nthree exceptions--lentils, mung beans, and dry peas--to the FAV \nplanting prohibition on DCP base acres. Chicory should be added to this \nlist of exceptions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Dodd, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Obama, Ms. \n        Mikulski, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 195. A bill to provide for full voting representation in Congress \nfor the citizens of the District of Columbia, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the No \nTaxation Without Representation Act of 2005 in an effort to right a \npersistent injustice experienced by the 600,000 citizens of the \nDistrict of Columbia, who have historically been denied voting \nrepresentation in Congress.\n  This injustice is felt directly by District residents, but it is also \na shadow overhanging the democratic traditions of our Nation as a \nwhole. It is absurd that, in this day and age, ours is the only \ndemocracy in the world in which citizens of the capital city are not \nrepresented in the national legislature with a vote. The right to vote \nis a civic entitlement of every American citizen, no matter where he or \nshe resides. It is democracy's most essential right.\n  I am proud to be the chief Senate sponsor of this bill, which \nCongresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton is introducing today in the House, \nbecause it makes us the fully representative democracy we claim to be. \nAnd I am delighted that Senators Obama, Schumer, Mikulski, Sarbanes, \nFeingold, Dayton, Corzine, Dodd and Durbin are joining me as original \nco-sponsors. The point of the legislation is simple: It would provide \nthe residents of the District with full voting representation by two \nSenators and a House Member, guaranteeing the residents of the Nation's \ncapital with the same right to partake in our democracy that the \ncitizens of all 50 States enjoy. Despite this bill's title, it would \nnot exempt residents of the District from paying taxes.\n  In May 2002, the Governmental Affairs Committee, which I then \nchaired, held the first hearing since 1994 on this issue. Five months \nlater, in October, the committee reported out legislation similar to \nthe bill we introduce today. I was and am still proud of that \naccomplishment. Unfortunately, it was not enough. The bill died on the \nSenate floor, and with it, the hope of D.C. residents for equal voting \nrights.\n  The people of this city literally fight and die for their country. \nThey help pay for the benefits to which all Americans are entitled. And \nyet, they are denied voting representation.\n  It is painfully ironic that we are introducing this legislation even \nas the young men and women, including many from the District of \nColumbia, are dying in Iraq so that Iraqis may live and vote in a \nrepresentative democracy. About 1,000 Army and Air National Guardsmen \nand women from the District have been called upon to help fight the war \non terrorism. Three have died in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. Yet, to \nour shame, these brave men and women cannot choose representatives to \nthe Federal legislature that governs them and thus have no say in when \nor whether the nation should go to war.\n  The people of this city, more than most, live under the near constant \nthreat of terrorism, and have been mightily inconvenienced by security \nprecautions because of that threat. And despite Congresswoman Norton's \nability to vote in committee, residents of D.C. have no one who can \nvote when homeland and national security policies are being crafted. A \nrepresentative without the power to vote on the floor of the House \nsimply isn't a real representative.\n  Furthermore, the citizens of Washington, D.C., pay income taxes just \nlike everyone else. Only, they pay more. Per capita, District residents \nhave the third highest Federal tax obligation. And yet they have no \nvoice in how high those taxes will be nor how they will be spent.\n  The vast majority of Americans believe that D.C. residents have \nvoting representation in the Congress. When informed that they don't, \n82 percent of Americans, according to one poll, by the advocacy group \nD.C. Vote, say that they should.\n  In righting this wrong, we won't only be following the will of the \nAmerican people. We will be following the imperative of our history. \nWhen they placed our Capital, which was not yet established in their \nday, under the jurisdiction of the Congress, the Framers of our \nConstitution in effect placed with Congress the solemn responsibility \nof assuring that the rights of D.C. citizens would be protected in the \nfuture, just as it is our responsibility to protect the rights of all \ncitizens throughout this great country. Congress has failed to meet \nthis obligation for more than 200 years, and I, for one, am not \nprepared to make D.C. citizens wait another 200 years.\n  In the words of this city's namesake, our first President, \n``Precedents are dangerous things; let the reins of government then be \nbraced and held with a steady hand, and every violation of the \nConstitution be reprehended: If defective let it be amended, but not \nsuffered to be trampled upon whilst it has an existence.''\n  The people of D.C. have suffered from this Constitutional defect for \nfar too long. Let's reprehend it and amend it together. I urge all of \nmy colleagues to support this essential legislation.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 195\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``No Taxation Without \n     Representation Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The residents of the District of Columbia are the only \n     Americans who pay Federal income taxes and who have fought \n     and died in every American war but are denied voting \n     representation in the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate.\n       (2) The residents of the District of Columbia suffer the \n     very injustice against which our Founding Fathers fought, \n     because they do not have voting representation as other \n     taxpaying Americans do and are nevertheless required to pay \n     Federal income taxes unlike the Americans who live in the \n     territories.\n       (3) The principle of one person, one vote requires that \n     residents of the District of Columbia are afforded full \n     voting representation in the House and the Senate.\n       (4) Despite the denial of voting representation, Americans \n     in the Nation's Capital are third among residents of all \n     States in per capita income taxes paid to the Federal \n     Government.\n       (5) Unequal voting representation in our representative \n     democracy is inconsistent with the founding principles of the \n     Nation and the strongly held principles of the American \n     people today.\n\n[[Page S605]]\n\n     SEC. 3. REPRESENTATION IN CONGRESS FOR DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.\n\n       For the purposes of congressional representation, the \n     District of Columbia, constituting the seat of government of \n     the United States, shall be treated as a State, such that its \n     residents shall be entitled to elect and be represented by 2 \n     Senators in the United States Senate, and as many \n     Representatives in the House of Representatives as a \n     similarly populous State would be entitled to under the law.\n\n     SEC. 4. ELECTIONS.\n\n       (a) First Elections.--\n       (1) Proclamation.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Mayor of the District of Columbia \n     shall issue a proclamation for elections to be held to fill \n     the 2 Senate seats and the seat in the House of \n     Representatives to represent the District of Columbia in \n     Congress.\n       (2) Manner of elections.--The proclamation of the Mayor of \n     the District of Columbia required by paragraph (1) shall \n     provide for the holding of a primary election and a general \n     election and at such elections the officers to be elected \n     shall be chosen by a popular vote of the residents of the \n     District of Columbia. The manner in which such elections \n     shall be held and the qualification of voters shall be the \n     same as those for local elections, as prescribed by the \n     District of Columbia.\n       (3) Classification of senators.--In the first election of \n     Senators from the District of Columbia, the 2 senatorial \n     offices shall be separately identified and designated, and no \n     person may be a candidate for both offices. No such \n     identification or designation of either of the 2 senatorial \n     offices shall refer to or be taken to refer to the terms of \n     such offices, or in any way impair the privilege of the \n     Senate to determine the class to which each of the Senators \n     elected shall be assigned.\n       (b) Certification of Election.--The results of an election \n     for the Senators and Representative from the District of \n     Columbia shall be certified by the Mayor of the District of \n     Columbia in the manner required by law. The Senators and \n     Representative elected shall be entitled to be admitted to \n     seats in Congress and to all the rights and privileges of \n     Senators and Representatives of the States in the Congress of \n     the United States.\n\n     SEC. 5. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES MEMBERSHIP.\n\n       (a) In General.--Upon the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the District of Columbia shall be entitled to 1 \n     Representative until the taking effect of the next \n     reapportionment.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the taxation of income of controlled foreign corporations \nattributable to imported property; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senator Mikulski of \nMaryland and seven of our colleagues in introducing legislation to \nrepeal one of the most egregious tax subsidies found in the U.S. Tax \nCode. Believe it or not, U.S. companies that move their manufacturing \nplants and good-paying jobs overseas will be rewarded with billions of \ndollars in tax breaks over the next 10 years. Unfortunately for both \nAmerican workers and American taxpayers, this is absolutely true. Our \nbill will repeal this wrong-headed fiscal policy that has worked \nagainst the interest of American manufacturers for so many years.\n  Let me describe how this perverse tax subsidy works. Imagine two \ncompeting U.S. companies manufacturing a product for sale in this \ncountry. Company A has a plant with American workers. It sells its \nproduct here at home, immediately paying U.S. taxes on its profits. \nCompany B, however, decides to shut down its U.S. plant, fire its \nAmerican workers and build a new plant in a foreign country because it \ncan produce the same goods at lower cost there, using underpaid foreign \nworkers. Moreover, Company B pays almost no taxes in the foreign \ncountry and no taxes currently in the United States because it is \nentitled to tax ``deferral'' under our income tax laws. The Federal Tax \nCode allows firms like Company B to defer paying any U.S. income taxes \non the earnings from those now foreign-manufactured products until \nthose profits are returned, if ever, to this country.\n  In other words, when United States companies close down a \nmanufacturing plant such as Huffy bicycles or Radio Flyer little red \nwagons, fire their American workers and move those good-paying jobs to \ncountries like China, United States tax law actually gives these \ncompanies a large tax break. This tax break is not available to \nAmerican companies that make the very same products here on American \nsoil. So the U.S. company that decides to stay at home suffers a \ncompetitive disadvantage, a disadvantage that our tax laws have helped \nto create.\n  The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation says that this tax \n``deferral'' loophole will dole out some $6.5 billion in tax breaks \nover the next decade to U.S. manufacturing companies that pack up their \noperations and relocate abroad. This tax loophole likely contributed to \na loss of some 2.7 million U.S. manufacturing jobs since 2000 and \nencouraged the creation of over 1 million new jobs in the foreign \nmanufacturing affiliates of U.S companies since 1993.\n  Last May, Senator Mikulski and I offered an amendment on the Senate \nfloor to try to shut down this perverse $6.5 billion tax break. Our \neffort was supported by a number of organizations concerned about the \nloss of good-paying U.S. manufacturing jobs, including the \nInternational Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & Agricultural \nImplement Workers of America--UAW; the AFL-CIO; the International \nBrotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers \nand Helpers; the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers; and \nthe Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Workers, UNITE.\n  Regrettably, our amendment failed to get the votes it needed to pass. \nThe powerful lobby for large multinational firms was able to keep this \ntax loophole fully intact. But I intend to offer this proposal again \nand again until this tax subsidy is finally repealed.\n  Frankly, I strongly disagree with the majority in the Senate that \nvoted to retain this ill-conceived tax break, which hurts American \nbusinesses and workers. By their vote, our opponents essentially said \nlet's continue to give enormous tax breaks that encourage U.S. \ncompanies to move their operations overseas and contributes to the \ndislocation of thousands of American workers.\n  The bill we are introducing today, like last year's amendment, is \ncarefully targeted. It applies only to U.S. firms that move production \noverseas to low-tax countries and then turn around and import those \nproducts for sale here in the United States. Repealing this U.S. jobs \nexport tax subsidy will not hurt the ability of U.S. firms to compete \nagainst foreign competitors in foreign markets.\n  In the final analysis, the approach taken in our legislation is \nmeasured and long overdue. As we work in Congress to reform the tax \nsystem in the coming year and shut down a number of arcane tax \nloopholes, this one should be at the top of the list. I urge you to \ncosponsor this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 197. A bill to improve safety and reduce traffic congestion at \ngrade crossings; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today in Glendale, CA, there was a tragic \ncommuter train crash. All of the details of the crash are not available \nat this moment. However, at least 10 people were killed and over 100 \ninjured. The National Transportation Safety Board has already sent a \nteam to investigate.\n  I have been talking about the problem of grade crossings and the need \nfor grade separations for several years.\n  According to the Federal Railroad Administration, ``grade crossings \nare the site of the greatest number of collisions and injuries'' in the \nrailroad industry. In 2000, there were 3,502 incidents at grade \ncrossings.\n  In addition, the large volume of freight train traffic from \nCalifornia's ports to the rest of the Nation is a public safety hazard \non many communities\n\n[[Page S606]]\n\nin California where traffic, including emergency vehicles, is severely \ndelayed at these grade crossings.\n  In Riverside, CA, from January 2001 to January 2003, trains delayed \nambulance and fire protection 88 times. This translates into more \npeople possibly dying from health emergencies such as heart attacks and \nlarger and more deadly fires. If there is another terrorist attack, \nimagine what would happen if emergency first responders could not get \nacross the tracks.\n  To address the safety problem of accidents and other safety hazards \nat grade crossings, I am introducing the Rail Crossing Safety Act, part \nof which passed the Senate twice in the last Congress as part larger \nrailroad bills considered in the Commerce Committee.\n  This legislation would direct the Secretary of Transportation, in \nconsultation with State and local government officials, to conduct a \nstudy of the impact of grade crossings both on accidents and on the \nability of emergency responders to perform public safety and security \nduties. This would include the ability of police, fire, ambulances, and \nother emergency vehicles to cross the railroad tracks during \nemergencies.\n  The second part of the legislation would authorize funds for the \nSecretary of Transportation to provide grants to State and local \ngovernments to undertake grade separations, in other words to build \nbridges and tunnels.\n  Today's incident in Glendale only underscores the needs to make our \nstreets and rail lines safer. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAMBLISS (for himself and Mr. Isakson):\n  S. 200. A bill to establish the Arabia Mountain National Heritage \nArea in the State of Georgia, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President a mere 20 minutes away from the hustle \nand bustle of the booming city of Atlanta, GA, lies a quiet refuge that \ncradles historical remnants and nature's beauty. This area around \nArabia Mountain houses the ecosystems of endangered species, historic \nstructures, and archeological sites--a treasure deserving of our \nprotection and our admiration.\n  Arabia Mountain's proximity to Atlanta makes it accessible to \nmillions of Americans, but it also puts this national treasure in \ndanger of urban sprawl. No condominium development should destroy the \nancient soapstone quarry which attracted Native Americans over \nthousands of years ago. Nor should a strip mall tarnish the pristine \nland which contains farms from the days when the area was the heart of \nGeorgia's dairy industry and which contains remnants of Georgia's Gold \nRush in the 1820s.\n  I, along with my colleague Senator Isakson, have introduced \nlegislation to designate Arabia Mountain, which encompasses land in \nDeKalb County, Rockdale County, and Henry County, as a National \nHeritage Area. This designation will help preserve the rare and \nendangered species that inhabit the land, and it will save historic \nbuildings from the wrecking ball that often comes with modernization.\n  Arabia Mountain and its surrounding area is the product of \nsignificant geological changes. Starting several thousand years ago \nwith the quarrying and trading of soapstone, the history of human \nsettlement in the area is closely connected to its geological \nresources. It would be a shame to allow a decade of uncontrolled growth \nto deny future generations from enjoying the history and natural beauty \nof this land.\n  The quest to obtain National Heritage designation for Arabia Mountain \nbegan as a concept between conservationists, neighborhood activists, \nlandowners, and concerned citizens, and support has grown ever since. \nLocal Georgians even voted to tax themselves to support the project. \nSupport has come from both sides of the aisle in both houses of \nCongress.\n  I would like to thank all of those who have worked so hard for this \ndesignation--Kelly Jordan, Chair of the Arabia Mountain Heritage Area \nAlliance; Mayor Marcia Glenn, of Lithonia; Vernon Jones, CEO of DeKalb \nCounty; Mark Towe and Glen Culpepper; and Senator Zell Miller and \nCongresswoman Denise Majette for their efforts in the 108th Congress on \nthis issue. I ask my colleagues to support the preservation of this \ntruly deserving area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/26/senate-section/article/S606-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S606-S612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 13--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON \n                      ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI submitted the following resolution; from the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources; which was referred to the Committee on \nRules and Administration:\n\n                               S.

which was referred to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary:\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 6\n\n       Whereas the Sikh faith was founded in the northern section \n     of the Republic of India in the 15th century by Guru Nanak, \n     who preached tolerance and equality for all humans;\n       Whereas the Sikh faith began with a simple message of \n     truthful living and the fundamental unity of humanity, all \n     created by one creator who manifests existence through every \n     religion;\n       Whereas the Sikh faith reaches out to people of all faiths \n     and cultural backgrounds, encourages individuals to see \n     beyond their differences, and to work together for world \n     peace and harmony;\n       Whereas Siri Singh Sahib Bhai Sahib Harbhajan Singh Khalsa \n     Yogiji, known as Yogi Bhajan to hundreds of thousands of \n     people worldwide, was born Harbhajan Singh Puri on August 26, \n     1929, in India;\n       Whereas at age 8, Yogi Bhajan began yogic training, and 8 \n     years later was proclaimed by his teacher to be a master of \n     Kundalini Yoga, which stimulates individual growth through \n     breath, yoga postures, sound, chanting, and meditation;\n       Whereas during the turmoil over the partition between \n     Pakistan and India in 1947, at the age of 18, Yogi Bhajan led \n     his village of 7,000 people 325 miles on foot to safety in \n     New Delhi, India, from what is now Lahore, Pakistan;\n       Whereas Yogi Bhajan, before emigrating to North America in \n     1968, served the Government of India faithfully through both \n     civil and military service;\n       Whereas when Yogi Bhajan visited the United States in 1968, \n     he recognized immediately that the experience of higher \n     consciousness that many young people were attempting to find \n     through drugs could be alternatively achieved through \n     Kundalini Yoga, and in response, he began teaching Kundalini \n     Yoga publicly, thereby breaking the centuries-old tradition \n     of secrecy surrounding it;\n       Whereas in 1969, Yogi Bhajan founded ``Healthy, Happy, Holy \n     Organization (3HO)'', a nonprofit private educational and \n     scientific foundation dedicated to serving humanity, \n     improving physical well-being, deepening spiritual awareness, \n     and offering guidance on nutrition and health, interpersonal \n     relations, child rearing, and human behavior;\n       Whereas under the direction and guidance of Yogi Bhajan, \n     3HO expanded to 300 centers in 35 countries;\n       Whereas in 1971, the president of the governing body of \n     Sikh Temples in India gave Yogi Bhajan the title of Siri \n     Singh Sahib, which made him the chief religious and \n     administrative authority for Sikhism in the Western \n     Hemisphere, and subsequently the Sikh seat of religious \n     authority gave him responsibility to create a Sikh ministry \n     in the West;\n       Whereas in 1971, Sikh Dharma was legally incorporated in \n     the State of California and recognized as a tax-exempt \n     religious organization by the United States, and in 1972, \n     Yogi Bhajan founded the ashram Sikh Dharma in Espanola, New \n     Mexico;\n       Whereas in 1973, Yogi Bhajan founded ``3HO SuperHealth'', a \n     successful drug rehabilitation program that blends ancient \n     yogic wisdom of the East with modern technology of the West;\n       Whereas in June 1985, Yogi Bhajan established the first \n     ``International Peace Prayer Day Celebrations'' in New \n     Mexico, which still draws thousands of participants annually;\n       Whereas Yogi Bhajan traveled the world calling for world \n     peace and religious unity at meetings with leaders such as \n     Pope Paul VI; Pope John Paul II; His Holiness the Dalai Lama; \n     the President of the former Union of Soviet Socialist \n     Republics, Mikhail Gorbachev; and two Archbishops of \n     Canterbury;\n       Whereas Yogi Bhajan wrote 30 books and inspired the \n     publication of 200 other books through his teachings, founded \n     a drug rehabilitation program, and inspired the founding of \n     several businesses;\n       Whereas Sikhs and students across the world testify that \n     Yogi Bhajan exhibited dignity, divinity, grace, commitment, \n     courage,\n\n[[Page S611]]\n\n     kindness, compassion, tolerance, wisdom, and understanding;\n       Whereas Yogi Bhajan taught that in times of joy and sorrow \n     members of the community should come together and be at one \n     with each other; and\n       Whereas before his passing on October 6, 2004, Yogi Bhajan \n     requested that his passing be a time of celebration of his \n     going home: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes that the teachings of Yogi Bhajan about \n     Sikhism and yoga, and the businesses formed under his \n     inspiration, improved the personal, political, spiritual, and \n     professional relations between citizens of the United States \n     and the citizens of India;\n       (2) recognizes the legendary compassion, wisdom, kindness, \n     and courage of Yogi Bhajan, and his wealth of accomplishments \n     on behalf of the Sikh community; and\n       (3) extends its condolences to Inderjit Kaur, the wife of \n     Yogi Bhajan, his 3 children and 5 grandchildren, and to Sikh \n     and ``Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization (3HO)'' communities \n     around the Nation and the world upon the death on October 6, \n     2004, of Yogi Bhajan, an individual who was a wise teacher \n     and mentor, an outstanding pioneer, a champion of peace, and \n     a compassionate human being.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, \nSenators Domenici and Cornyn, to introduce a resolution honoring the \nlife of Yogi Bhajan. Yogi Bhajan, the chief religious and \nadministrative authority for Sikhism in the West, died in Espanola, NM \non October 6, 2004 at the age of seventy-five. Born Harbhajan Singh \nPuri on August 26, 1929 in Northern India, now Pakistan, he began yogic \ntraining at age 8 and was proclaimed a master of Kundalini Yoga by age \n16. After the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, his family \nmigrated to New Delhi, India where he continued his education. After \ngraduating from Punjab University in economics, he worked for India's \nInternal Revenue Service and later became head of customs at the New \nDelhi Airport.\n  Yogi Bhajan introduced thousands around the world to Sikhism, a \nreligion that carries the message of truthful living and the \nfundamental unity of humanity, and reaches out to people of all \nbackgrounds to work together for world peace. When he came to North \nAmerica in 1968 he recognized that the experience sought by many young \npeople through drugs could be alternatively achieved through Kundalini \nYoga, which stimulates individual growth through breath, chanting, and \nmeditation among other components. Breaking the centuries old tradition \nof secrecy surrounding Kundalini Yoga, he began teaching it publicly. \nSoon after, he founded the Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization, 3HO, a \nnonprofit private educational and scientific foundation with 300 \ncenters in 35 countries, dedicated to improving physical well-being, \ndeepening spiritual awareness, and offering guidance on matters of \nhealth and heart. He later founded 3HO SuperHealth, a successful drug \nrehabilitation program, blending ancient yogic wisdom of the east with \nthe modern technology of the west. SuperHealth was accredited by the \nJoint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and \nreceived its highest commendation. In 1973 it distinguished itself as \nbeing in the top 10 percent of all treatment programs throughout the \nU.S. In 1989 Yogi Bhajan met with then President Mikhail Gorbachev and \nestablished addiction treatment programs in Russia based on the 3HO \nSuperHealth model. Currently a pilot project of SuperHealth is being \nformed by the Punjab State Government in India. He taught Yoga in \nToronto and Los Angeles and finally founded a Sikh Dharma community in \nEspanola, New Mexico. In 1971, the president of the governing body of \nSikh Temples in India gave Yogi Bhajan the title of chief religious and \nadministrative authority for Sikhism in the Western Hemisphere. About \n250,000 Sikhs now reside across the United States, including a \ncommunity of about 500 families in Northern New Mexico.\n  Yogi Bhajan wrote 30 books and inspired 200 more through his \nteaching, and inspired the founding of several businesses, including \nAkal Security, Inc. He had an inclusive view of the world's major \nreligions and considered all of them valid. Throughout his lifetime, he \ntraveled the world and met with world leaders such as Pope John Paul II \nand the Dalai Lama to discuss world peace and religious unity. In June \n1985, Yogi Bhajan established the first International Peace Prayer Day \nCelebration in New Mexico that still draws thousands of participants \nannually.\n  After the events of 9/11/01, Yogi Bhajan reached out to Sikhs across \nAmerica, encouraging and helping them to educate their fellow citizens \nabout Sikhs, and to work with law enforcement and community leaders to \nhelp them protect Sikh populations. His efforts have helped contribute \nto the opening of some major law enforcement agencies to Sikh \nemployees, including the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Yogi \nBhajan established links to human rights advocates nationwide, working \nto make sure that the issue of Sikh identity is understood and \nrespected. When Balbir Singh Sodhi was murdered in Phoenix 5 days after \n9/11 because of his beard and turban, Yogi Bhajan worked with community \nand government leaders in Arizona to help raise awareness about the \nSikh community there.\n  Yogi Bhajan is survived by his wife, Inderjit Kaur; two sons, Ranbir \nSingh and Kulbir Singh; a daughter, Kamaljit Kaur; and five \ngrandchildren. He will be missed by his family, followers and his \nfriends, and his contribution to the cause of world peace will be \nremembered and celebrated for generations to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 7--CONGRATULATING THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE \nFOR CONDUCTING A DEMOCRATIC, TRANSPARENT, AND FAIR RUNOFF PRESIDENTIAL \nELECTION ON DECEMBER 26, 2004, AND CONGRATULATING VIKTOR YUSHCHENKO ON \n HIS ELECTION AS PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE AND HIS COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY \n                               AND REFORM\n\n  Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Frist, Mr. Reid, Mr. Levin, \nand Mr. Durbin) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 7\n\n       Whereas the establishment of a democratic, transparent, and \n     fair election process for the 2004 presidential election in \n     Ukraine and of a genuinely democratic political system have \n     been prerequisites for that country's full integration into \n     the international community of democracies;\n       Whereas the Government of Ukraine has accepted numerous \n     specific commitments governing the conduct of elections as a \n     participating State of the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (OSCE);\n       Whereas the election of Ukraine's next president was seen \n     as an unambiguous test of the extent of the Ukrainian \n     authorities' commitment to implement these standards and \n     build a democratic society based on free elections and the \n     rule of law;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires \n     government and public authorities to ensure that candidates \n     and political parties enjoy equal treatment before the law \n     and that government resources are not employed to the \n     advantage of individual candidates or political parties;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires the \n     full transparency of laws and regulations governing \n     elections, multiparty representation on election commissions, \n     and unobstructed access by candidates, political parties, and \n     domestic and international observers to all election \n     procedures, including voting and vote-counting in all areas \n     of the country;\n       Whereas efforts by national and local officials and others \n     acting at the behest of such officials to impose obstacles to \n     free assembly, free speech, and a free and fair political \n     campaign took place throughout Ukraine during the entire 2004 \n     presidential election campaign without condemnation or \n     remedial action by the Government of Ukraine;\n       Whereas on October 31, 2004, Ukraine held the first round \n     of its presidential election and on November 21, 2004, \n     Ukraine held a runoff presidential election between the two \n     leading candidates, Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich and \n     opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko;\n       Whereas a consensus of Ukrainian and international election \n     observers determined that the runoff election did not meet a \n     considerable number of international standards for democratic \n     elections, and these observers specifically declared that \n     state resources were abused in support of Viktor Yanukovich, \n     and that illegal voting by absentee ballot, multiple voting, \n     assaults on electoral observers and journalists, and the use \n     of counterfeit ballots were widespread;\n       Whereas following the runoff presidential election on \n     November 21, 2004, tens of thousands of Ukrainian citizens \n     engaged in peaceful demonstrations in Kiev and elsewhere to \n     protest the unfair election and the\n\n[[Page S612]]\n\n     declaration by the Ukrainian Central Election Commission that \n     Viktor Yanukovich had won a majority of the votes;\n       Whereas, on November 25, 2004, the Ukrainian Supreme Court \n     blocked the publication of the official runoff election \n     results thus preventing the inauguration of the next \n     president of Ukraine until the Supreme Court examined the \n     reports of voter fraud;\n       Whereas on November 27, 2004, the Parliament of Ukraine \n     passed a resolution declaring that there were violations of \n     law during the runoff presidential election on November 21, \n     2004, and that the results of the election did not reflect \n     the will of the Ukrainian people;\n       Whereas on December 1, 2004, the Parliament of Ukraine \n     passed a no confidence motion regarding the government of \n     Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich;\n       Whereas European mediators and current Ukrainian President \n     Leonid Kuchma began discussions on December 1, 2004, to \n     attempt to work out a resolution to the standoff between the \n     supporters of both presidential candidates;\n       Whereas on December 3, 2004, the Ukrainian Supreme Court \n     ruled that the runoff presidential election on November 21, \n     2004, was invalid and ordered a new presidential election to \n     take place on December 26, 2004;\n       Whereas on December 8, 2004, the Parliament of Ukraine \n     passed laws to reform the Ukrainian electoral process, \n     including to reconstitute the Ukrainian Central Election \n     Commission, and to close loopholes for fraud in preparation \n     for a new presidential election;\n       Whereas on December 26, 2004, the people of Ukraine again \n     went to the polls to elect the next president of Ukraine in \n     what the consensus of domestic and international observers \n     declared as a more democratic, transparent, and fair election \n     process with fewer problems than the previous two rounds;\n       Whereas on January 10, 2005, the election victory of \n     opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko was certified by the \n     Ukrainian Central Election Commission; and\n       Whereas the runoff presidential election on December 26, \n     2004, signifies a turning point for Ukraine which offers new \n     hope and opportunity to the people of Ukraine: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) commends the people and Government of Ukraine for their \n     commitment to democracy and their determination to end the \n     political crisis in that country in a peaceful and democratic \n     manner;\n       (2) congratulates the people and Government of Ukraine for \n     ensuring a free and fair runoff presidential election which \n     represents the true choice of the Ukrainian people;\n       (3) congratulates Viktor Yushchenko on his election as \n     President of Ukraine;\n       (4) applauds the Ukrainian presidential candidates, the \n     European Union and other European representatives, and the \n     United States Government for the role they played in helping \n     to find a peaceful resolution of the crisis;\n       (5) acknowledges and welcomes the strong relationship \n     formed between the United States and Ukraine and expresses \n     its strong and continuing support for the efforts of the \n     Ukrainian people and the new Government of Ukraine to \n     establish a full democracy, the rule of law, and respect for \n     human rights; and\n       (6) pledges its assistance to the strengthening of a fully \n     free and open democratic system in Ukraine, the creation of a \n     prosperous free market economy in Ukraine, the reaffirmation \n     of Ukraine's independence and territorial sovereignty, and \n     Ukraine's full integration into the international community \n     of democracies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url":

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to consideration of S. Con. Res. 7, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 7) congratulating the \n     people of Ukraine for conducting a democratic, transparent, \n     and fair runoff presidential election on December 26, 2004, \n     and congratulating Viktor Yushchenko on his election as \n     President of Ukraine and his commitment to democracy and \n     reform.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor of that concurrent resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to comment. We have a sizable \nUkrainian-American population in Illinois, particularly Chicago, that \nfollowed this election closely. My son lives in a section known as \nUkraine Village, and the neighborhood was covered with orange ribbons \nin support of the newly elected president. So I am happy to join in \npassing this resolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Illinois.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 7) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 7\n\n       Whereas the establishment of a democratic, transparent, and \n     fair election process for the 2004 presidential election in \n     Ukraine and of a genuinely democratic political system have \n     been prerequisites for that country's full integration into \n     the international community of democracies;\n       Whereas the Government of Ukraine has accepted numerous \n     specific commitments governing the conduct of elections as a \n     participating State of the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (OSCE);\n       Whereas the election of Ukraine's next president was seen \n     as an unambiguous test of the extent of the Ukrainian \n     authorities' commitment to implement these standards and \n     build a democratic society based on free elections and the \n     rule of law;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires \n     government and public authorities to ensure that candidates \n     and political parties enjoy equal treatment before the law \n     and that government resources are not employed to the \n     advantage of individual candidates or political parties;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires the \n     full transparency of laws and regulations governing \n     elections, multiparty representation on election commissions, \n     and unobstructed access by candidates, political parties, and \n     domestic and international observers to all election \n     procedures, including voting and vote-counting in all areas \n     of the country;\n       Whereas efforts by national and local officials and others \n     acting at the behest of such officials to impose obstacles to \n     free assembly, free speech, and a free and fair political \n     campaign took place throughout Ukraine during the entire 2004 \n     presidential election campaign without condemnation or \n     remedial action by the Government of Ukraine;\n       Whereas on October 31, 2004, Ukraine held the first round \n     of its presidential election and on November 21, 2004, \n     Ukraine held a runoff presidential election between the two \n     leading candidates, Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich and \n     opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko;\n       Whereas a consensus of Ukrainian and international election \n     observers determined that the runoff election did not meet a \n     considerable number of international standards for democratic \n     elections, and these observers specifically declared that \n     state resources were abused in support of Viktor Yanukovich, \n     and that illegal voting by absentee ballot, multiple voting, \n     assaults on electoral observers and journalists, and the use \n     of counterfeit ballots were widespread;\n       Whereas following the runoff presidential election on \n     November 21, 2004, tens of thousands of Ukrainian citizens \n     engaged in\n\n[[Page S614]]\n\n     peaceful demonstrations in Kiev and elsewhere to protest the \n     unfair election and the declaration by the Ukrainian Central \n     Election Commission that Viktor Yanukovich had won a majority \n     of the votes;\n       Whereas, on November 25, 2004, the Ukrainian Supreme Court \n     blocked the publication of the official runoff election \n     results thus preventing the inauguration of the next \n     president of Ukraine until the Supreme Court examined the \n     reports of voter fraud;\n       Whereas on November 27, 2004, the Parliament of Ukraine \n     passed a resolution declaring that there were violations of \n     law during the runoff presidential election on November 21, \n     2004, and that the results of the election did not reflect \n     the will of the Ukrainian people;\n       Whereas on December 1, 2004, the Parliament of Ukraine \n     passed a no confidence motion regarding the government of \n     Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich;\n       Whereas European mediators and current Ukrainian President \n     Leonid Kuchma began discussions on December 1, 2004, to \n     attempt to work out a resolution to the standoff between the \n     supporters of both presidential candidates;\n       Whereas on December 3, 2004, the Ukrainian Supreme Court \n     ruled that the runoff presidential election on November 21, \n     2004, was invalid and ordered a new presidential election to \n     take place on December 26, 2004;\n       Whereas on December 8, 2004, the Parliament of Ukraine \n     passed laws to reform the Ukrainian electoral process, \n     including to reconstitute the Ukrainian Central Election \n     Commission, and to close loopholes for fraud in preparation \n     for a new presidential election;\n       Whereas on December 26, 2004, the people of Ukraine again \n     went to the polls to elect the next president of Ukraine in \n     what the consensus of domestic and international observers \n     declared as a more democratic, transparent, and fair election \n     process with fewer problems than the previous two rounds;\n       Whereas on January 10, 2005, the election victory of \n     opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko was certified by the \n     Ukrainian Central Election Commission; and\n       Whereas the runoff presidential election on December 26, \n     2004, signifies a turning point for Ukraine which offers new \n     hope and opportunity to the people of Ukraine: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) commends the people and Government of Ukraine for their \n     commitment to democracy and their determination to end the \n     political crisis in that country in a peaceful and democratic \n     manner;\n       (2) congratulates the people and Government of Ukraine for \n     ensuring a free and fair runoff presidential election which \n     represents the true choice of the Ukrainian people;\n       (3) congratulates Viktor Yushchenko on his election as \n     President of Ukraine;\n       (4) applauds the Ukrainian presidential candidates, the \n     European Union and other European representatives, and the \n     United States Government for the role they played in helping \n     to find a peaceful resolution of the crisis;\n       (5) acknowledges and welcomes the strong relationship \n     formed between the United States and Ukraine and expresses \n     its strong and continuing support for the efforts of the \n     Ukrainian people and the new Government of Ukraine to \n     establish a full democracy, the rule of law, and respect for \n     human rights; and\n       (6) pledges its assistance to the strengthening of a fully \n     free and open democratic system in Ukraine, the creation of a \n     prosperous free market economy in Ukraine, the reaffirmation \n     of Ukraine's independence and territorial sovereignty, and \n     Ukraine's full integration into the international community \n     of democracies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url":
