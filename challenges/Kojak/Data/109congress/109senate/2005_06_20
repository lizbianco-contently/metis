Mr. President, today the Senate will resume consideration \nof the Energy bill, which we will complete this week. Chairman Domenici \nwill be here to continue working through amendments. We made very good \nprogress on the bill last week. We are on track to complete the bill \nlater this week. As I announced at the end of last week, it may be \nnecessary to file cloture on the bill tomorrow. If we file cloture \ntomorrow, the cloture vote would then occur on Thursday, which would \nallow us to complete the bill this week.\n  I hope we do not have to file cloture, but I think it is important \nfor people to realize we are going to finish the bill this week. People \nhad the opportunity at the end of last week to offer amendments. They \nwill have the same opportunity today and over the course of this week. \nI do ask our Senators to work with the bill managers to expedite \nconsideration of their amendments early in the week.\n  This evening, we will have a second cloture vote on the nomination of \nJohn Bolton to be ambassador to the United Nations. As announced \nearlier, the debate for that vote has been scheduled between 5 and 6. \nWe plan on having that vote at 6 p.m. today. We have a very busy week \nas we move through the Bolton nomination and the Energy bill. I expect \nwe will have votes every day this week, including Friday, as we wrap up \nwork on the energy legislation; therefore, Senators should be prepared \nand should adjust their schedules accordingly to remain available until \nwe complete passage of this important bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/20/senate-section/article/S6785-7", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6785-S6786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNITION OF MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate minority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I agree with the distinguished majority \nleader. It would be good if we did not have to file cloture. Having \nsaid that, I do not know what it takes to get people to come over and \noffer amendments. Thursday afternoon, we were here. The two managers \nwere willing to stay as long as necessary to meet whatever amendments \nwere offered by Senators. I realize last week was somewhat disjointed \nbecause of the various events, but there was no reason on days and \nevenings when we were actually here and able to take amendments that \npeople could not offer amendments.\n  Today, we have 3 hours to offer amendments on this bill. It will be \ninteresting to see how many show up to offer amendments. I guess the \nalternative would be to see if we could get a finite list of amendments \nand have those the only amendments that would be in order prior to this \nbill's termination.\n  The other problem we have this week is that all over the country, \nthere are base-closing hearings being held by the BRAC hearing \ncommission. For Senators who are involved in these issues, they involve \nthousands of members of the military and thousands of civilians\n\n[[Page S6786]]\n\nwho are tied to these bases, and they are going to leave and go to \nthese hearings. Everyone should know that to wait around here and want \nto make sure that all of the Senators are here for a given vote--it \nwill not work because I think there will be Senators gone virtually \nevery day this week. I have received word from a couple of Senators who \nwill not be here tomorrow. I know some of the hearings are going to be \nheld in New Mexico, and I understand the two Senators from New Mexico \nare going to leave late in the afternoon on Thursday. They are the \nmanagers of the bill. So I hope that we can work into the night on this \nbill this week because if we have any hope of doing those appropriation \nbills next week, we have to finish this bill this week; otherwise, we \nwill spend all next week on this bill, spending a lot of time in quorum \ncalls waiting for people to come and offer amendments.\n  I am a little frustrated because I know there are people on both \nsides of the aisle who say they have amendments but they are not quite \nready or they want to do it at a more convenient time. The convenient \ntimes are over. We will not have 100 Senators here on any day this \nweek. That is the way it is going to be. So some of these very tough, \ntight amendments are going to have to be decided on the votes of less \nthan 100 Senators.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the majority leader and minority leader, I \napologize; I was not here for the entire dialog between the two of \nthem. I know there is this business of who is going to be absent which \ndays, but I say to both Senators, I do not think that should keep us \nfrom continuing to insist that Senators who have amendments bring them \nforward. We have to see them.\n  Mr. REID. That is what we said.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We need to know about them. There are two that we know \nof, one to strike the inventory of offshore assets. That will take a \nlittle while. Somebody should offer that before the day is out. That is \nan hour or two, and there will be a vote. We think Senator Feinstein \nhas one. We would hope that would come forth. I think over the evening \nand midmorning tomorrow something will filter out with reference to \nglobal warming. Whether it is one, two, or whatever, there will be a \nconclusion, and somebody will offer an amendment. That will be the \nlongest one.\n  I do not know what the Senate leadership wants to do about the fact \nthat it is probably real that there will not be 100 Senators each of \nthe days, but I do not know that that ought to keep us from moving \nforward and getting some accord as to finishing this bill. I do not \nknow which day, but we are not in the kind of problem we have been in \nthe past. As both Senators know, we can get to the amendments pretty \nquickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, to clarify the comments that were going \nback and forth between the Senate Democratic leader and myself, we will \nfinish the bill this week. We pay our respects to the Senator from New \nMexico by saying he has been more than willing to be here to receive \namendments. The fact that there were not a lot of people either on \nThursday or today rushing to the floor to offer the amendments actually \nleads me to be very hopeful that we will complete this bill Thursday, \nalthough I know in all likelihood it is going to be Friday. We are down \nto just very few amendments.\n  We recognize that some people will not be here over the course of \neven today, voting tonight, tomorrow, and the next day. That is not \ngoing to slow us down at all in our obligation to address the Nation's \nbusiness. When there are amendments, we will take them to the Senate \nfloor to debate them. I think we are discouraged a little by the fact \nthat people are not rushing down to offer amendments. On the other \nhand, it kind of gives me a little bit of encouragement. It means we \nare going to finish this bill. We are going to file cloture Tuesday in \norder to finish it, in all likelihood, unless we come to some agreement \nby both the managers.\n\n  I congratulate them for where we are today. We intend on finishing \nthe bill with certainty this week.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I would be totally opposed to cloture being invoked if I \nfelt the majority was somehow stopping us from offering amendments, but \nthat has not been the case. There has been ample opportunity for people \nto offer amendments. So I think we either have to have a list of finite \namendments the two managers can agree on or it appears cloture would \nhave to be invoked.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senators for their comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/20/senate-section/article/S6786-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I thank the distinguished chairman for his thoughtfulness.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if the Senator would watch the floor for me \nwhile I leave for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Absolutely. It is my intent to speak on this amendment I \noffer with Senator Dorgan and then lay it aside. My hope is we can work \nsomething out. I know Senator Collins and Senator Levin are working on \nsomething and desire to work with you, as well. If we bring it up now, \nwe can start the discussion on it and work something out.\n  I see Senator Bingaman. He has been so thoughtful throughout the \nprocess as well.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, the reason I have come to the floor \ntoday is because oil prices per barrel are now at an all-time record \nhigh. If you scour this legislation, it is hard to find anything in it \nthat would provide relief to the American consumer any time soon. It is \nmy hope as we go forward with this debate, at a time when prices are in \nthe stratosphere, that we work in a bipartisan way and at least provide \nsome help in this legislation for the consumer who is getting clobbered \nby these historically high costs.\n  What especially concerns me is it seems to this Member of the Senate \nthat the Federal Government actually makes the problem of high oil and \ngasoline prices worse every day. Every single day, the Federal \nGovernment, through its policies, is compounding the problem the \nconsumers are seeing at the pump because it has been the policy of the \nFederal Government to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at the worst \npossible time--when prices are at record-high levels.\n  When the prices are at a record-high level, it seems to me this is \nnot the time to be taking oil out of the private market and putting it \nin the Government reserve. It just does not make economic sense to add \nmore pressure to what is already a very tight oil supply. Reducing the \nsupply of oil on the market, of course, leads to higher oil prices. \nThat is simply supply and demand. Because oil accounts for 49 percent \nof the cost of gasoline, that means higher prices for consumers at the \npump. For the life of me, I do not see how it makes sense for \nconsumers, who are already paying sky-high prices at the pump, to then \nhave their Government force them to pay higher prices by taking oil out \nof the private market and putting it into the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. So it does not make sense for the consumer, and, in my view, \nit does not make sense for taxpayers as well, who have to pay record-\nhigh prices for the oil that is taken off the market.\n  Now, this is not just my opinion. The Senate Energy Committee heard \ntestimony last year by experts who said the policy with respect to \nfilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when prices are so high jacks \nup costs. I asked John Kilduff, senior vice president of energy risk \nmanagement at Fimat USA, whether the SPR fill rate of 300,000 barrels \nper day was contributing to oil price increases. Before the committee \nthat day, which the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nDomenici, chairs, and our friend, Senator Bingaman, is the ranking \nminority Member, when we were all in our committee, the expert \nwitnesses said they do believe these policies are contributing to oil \nprice increases. Mr. Kilduff specifically stated:\n\n       A fill rate of 100,000 represents, obviously, 700,000 \n     barrels for a week. At 300,000 it is 2.1 million barrels. A \n     2.1 million barrel increase in U.S. commercial crude oil \n     inventory in a particular weekly report would be a big build \n     for the particular week and would help with downward pressure \n     on crude oil prices.\n\n  So I would say to colleagues that this notion that this is something \nthe Senate can just let the Secretary of Energy do what he wants is \nbelied by the expert testimony we have had before the Senate Energy \nCommittee where experts specifically said that a fill rate of several \nhundred thousand barrels per day is contributing to oil price \nincreases.\n  As far as I can tell, under the policy we are now seeing at the \nEnergy Department, it does not matter how high the prices are, they are \njust going to keep filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. They will \ncontinue to take oil off the private market no matter how high the \nprices get.\n  I would just like to say, Mr. President and colleagues, I am not \ntalking about taking oil out of the Reserve. I know people very often \nbring that up. I am just saying it does not make sense to have the same \nfill rate when you are talking about historically high prices because \nthat very high cost of filling it at that point directly hurts the \nconsumer at the pump.\n  On Friday, and again today, when the price of oil skyrocketed to the \nhighest price ever recorded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, our \nGovernment has continued to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. \nEarlier this spring, when gasoline prices set an all-time record high \nof $2.28 for a gallon of gas, the Energy Department continued to fill \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve. So I say to those who have \nreservations about what I am advocating, I would simply ask, how high \ndo prices have to go before we stop pursuing policies that drive the \nprices even higher? At some point, there should be some limit when it \ncomes to the Federal Government actually compounding the difficulties \nconsumers are having at the pump.\n  Under the language currently in the bill, there are no limits. There \nseems to be some language about ``excessive'' costs, but there is \nnothing that actually blocks our Government from filling the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve if the price goes even higher than the current record \nprice of $59.23 per barrel. So I want to repeat that. Even if the price \ngoes to $60 or $70 or $80, there is nothing that would force our \nGovernment to change its policy of filling the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve at these very high prices. So with no restrictions in sight, I \nguess the Government can just continue indefinitely to fill the Reserve \nwith these record prices.\n  To address this problem, my amendment directs that the Secretary of \nEnergy suspend the filling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when the \nprices go above the record-high level in the market and stay above that \nrecord-high level for 10 consecutive trading days. The suspension of \nfilling would continue until the price of oil falls back down for 10 \nconsecutive days.\n  I also note the House of Representatives at least is trying to move \nin the direction of a bit of consumer protection because they have \nincluded a prohibition against continuing to fill the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve until the price drops below $40 per barrel. Under my \namendment, current SPR filling could go forward. But additional filling \nwould be halted when prices are at record-high levels unless there is \nsome consumer protection for our citizens.\n\n  The bottom line is we cannot continue to allow filling of the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve when our economy suffers due to high gas \nand oil prices without providing some safety valve. Unless this \namendment is adopted or unless we can work out a compromise with \nSenator Collins and Senator Levin and other colleagues who worked on \nthis--unless we can get some legislation in place--there will be no \nstandard for action or any certainty there will be some consumer \nprotection for our citizens when oil prices are out of control.\n  Now, some may argue there should not be these kinds of price triggers \nfor the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I guess that argument is: Let's \njust leave it to the Secretary of Energy. Well, there are parts of this \nbill, such as section 313, that do not leave matters to the Secretary's \ndiscretion, such as when you are talking about price relief, royalty \nrelief for oil and gas producers. Section 313 of the legislation has \nclear price levels for when the oil companies get a break from the \nnormal royalty policy.\n  So what we have here is a double standard. There are price levels to \nprotect oil and gas producers when it comes to their royalties but \nabsolutely no protection for the consumer who is getting clobbered at \nthe pump and who could get some relief if the Government simply did not \nfill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a time when prices are at a \nrecord-high level.\n  The last point I would make is suspending the fill of the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve when prices are at a record-high level will not hurt \nthis country's energy security. The Reserve already has more than 693 \nmillion barrels now in storage. That is the highest level in history. \nThe Strategic Petroleum Reserve is expected to be filled to\n\n[[Page S6788]]\n\nits current authorized capacity by the end of the summer.\n  What is more, a 2003 study by the Senate Permanent Investigations \nSubcommittee found that increased filling of the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve when prices were high did not increase overall U.S. oil \nsupplies. Instead, because of the higher prices, oil companies took oil \nout of their own inventories rather than buy higher priced oil on the \nmarket. That does not increase our overall oil supply or our Nation's \nenergy security.\n  So what we have is record prices for the consumer, record costs in \nterms of filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and the Federal \nGovernment, in effect, providing free oil storage for high-priced oil \nin the Strategic Petroleum Reserve so oil companies can reduce their \nown inventories and storage costs. That is not energy security; that is \njust pounding the consumer and taxpayers once more.\n  For these reasons, I strongly urge colleagues to place some limits on \nwhen the Energy Department can fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. \nWhen prices are at an all-time high, it seems that to do otherwise \ndenies consumers a fair shake and taxpayers a fair shake. It is my view \nthe Senate can take pressure off the price of a barrel of oil and off \nconsumers who are getting squeezed at the pump without compromising our \nnational security. One way to do it is along the lines of the amendment \nI propose this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Oregon for \nhis comments and his amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Wyden, just offered \nan amendment on his behalf and mine. He spoke in support of it. \nObviously, I am a cosponsor so I support the amendment. It is an \namendment that is very simple. We are putting oil away underground in \nsomething called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve or SPR. The purpose of \nputting oil underground at this point is in the event that we would \nhave an emergency at some point in the future, we would have a \nsubstantial inventory of oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  That SPR is nearly full. As I understand, it is well over 98 percent \nfilled at this point. Yet we are still, each day, taking about 100,000 \nbarrels of oil off the market and putting it underground at a time when \nwe are effectively paying the highest price ever for that oil in order \nto put it there.\n  There are two problems with that. No. 1, at a time when we have very \nhigh prices, which means we have lower supplies and higher demand, it \nmakes no sense to have 100,000 barrels a day taken off the market and \nstuck underground. Even more than that, it makes no sense to do this, \nwith the last increment to be put into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, \nat a time when oil is $55, $57, $58 a barrel.\n  Our amendment is very simple. It would suspend the acquisition of oil \nat these inflated prices, suspend the acquisition of oil at a time when \nwe need more supply, not less, and it would allow the acquisition to \ncomplete filling the SPR when the price of a barrel of oil reaches $40 \nper barrel or below.\n  My hope is the Senate will adopt the amendment. It is just common \nsense. It is not rocket science to believe that if you have a Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve almost filled, you should not go to the market and \ntake $55 or $57 oil in order to take inventory off the market at a time \nwhen you have record prices. That doesn't make any sense.\n  We are asking that the Senate approve the amendment.\n  Before the Senator from New Mexico leaves the floor, I have another \nmatter I wish to address, but I don't intend to address something in \nmorning business that would interrupt the work on the bill. I ask \nunanimous consent to speak in morning business for up to 15 minutes \nwith the understanding that if someone comes to the floor with an \namendment on the Energy bill, I will defer. I don't want to delay the \nbill. I ask unanimous consent for 15 minutes in morning business with \nthat understanding.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I don't think that is going to be any major obstacle to \nthe progress we are making on the Senate floor this afternoon. I have \nno objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield to me for 1 \nminute?\n  Mr. BUNNING. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator, Mr. Bunning \nfrom the State of Kentucky, is going to speak, and I assume he is going \nto talk about the Energy bill; is that correct?\n  Mr. BUNNING. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wish to say as a preamble to his speech, for those \nwho are going to listen to him, that he is a member of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee and has been for some time. Most of the \ntime people think that the committee is a committee of interior, public \nland States, but it also has a lot to do with coal and our energy \nfuture, diversification of our energy resources.\n  We have had a marvelous committee. Part of it is because of Members \nsuch as Senator Bunning. He has been a great participant. He comes to \nthe meetings, he works hard, he offers amendments. He understands we \nneed an energy bill. He does not win all the time, but he has his \nviews, and he has been a strong proponent for us getting our house in \norder and to use as much American energy as possible for our future. I \ncommend him for it.\n  I trust we will get a bill out of the Senate and out of conference, \none he can vote with not just a ``yea'' but with a hearty ``yea,'' not \njust one of those softballs but one of those fastballs he used to \nthrow. That is what we are looking for.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Domenici for his \nextremely hard work in trying to get an energy policy for the United \nStates since I have been in the Senate.\n  Many of us have spoken on this Senate floor several times about the \nneed for our national energy policy. We have been here before debating \nan energy bill. To some, it may seem like the same old song and same \nold dance. But here we are again. I am more optimistic than I have ever \nbeen about finally getting an energy bill to the President's desk.\n  I commend Chairman Domenici for his leadership and determination in \nhelping to put America on an independent path with this energy \nlegislation. It is a pleasure to serve with him on the Energy \nCommittee.\n  The Energy bill before us is a good starting point that attempts to \nstrike a balance between conservation and production. In the past, \nCongress failed to make progress on energy policy because we tried to \nmake a choice between conservation and production, but it does not have \nto be one or the other.\n  Many of us understand that a balanced and sensible energy policy must \nboost production of domestic energy sources as well as promote \nconservation. This Energy bill takes a good step toward striking a \nbalance, and passing an energy bill is important now more than ever.\n  We all know the price of energy has risen very sharply in the last \nfew years, and it is only going to keep rising. It goes without saying \nthat energy costs touch every single part of our economy and our lives. \nThe average\n\n[[Page S6789]]\n\nprice of gasoline has risen, for unleaded regular around this country, \nto about $2.13 a gallon, and the price of oil is bumping up against $60 \na barrel. Natural gas, coal, and other fuels have also seen record \nprices this year. This is hitting Americans in their wallets, \nespecially now when so many families are hitting the road for \nvacations.\n\n  Higher energy prices also slow business growth and force businesses \nto pass increased pricing on to consumers with higher priced goods. \nWhile passing an energy bill might not help energy prices in the short \nterm, it will make a big difference over the long term.\n  This bill's domestic energy production provisions and increased \nconservation provisions will help slow these spikes of price increases. \nBut without a new energy policy, there is not much we can do about \nrising energy prices. Oil producers and production are at full \ncapacity, and with China and India upping their demands for oil, the \nworld oil supply will be drawn down while prices continue to rise. This \nmeans that we cannot just try to conserve our way out of any kind of \nenergy problem. We must find other sources of reliable and low-cost \nfuels or our economy and national security will be at risk.\n  We continue to depend on oil from some of the most dangerous and \nunstable parts of the world. It is a recipe for disaster.\n  The stock market jumps up and down, all around, depending on the \nlatest reports of pipeline sabotage in the Middle East. Everyone \nwonders where the next terrorist attack is going to hit. We also worry \nabout Iran's developing nuclear weapons, and we are trying with our \nallies to figure out a diplomatic answer that will bring stability to \nthe region. But the Iranians do not have a lot of incentive to deal \nwhen they are getting nearly $60 a barrel for their oil. In a way, our \nincreasing need for energy is cutting our influence in the part of the \nworld where we need it the most. We have to reduce our reliance on \nforeign oil and do a better job internally of taking care of our own \nenergy needs.\n  Congress has been playing political football with this issue over the \npast few Congresses, and it is time to end the game. Our Nation and our \nnational security continue to be at risk. We do not want the United \nStates beholden to other countries just to keep our engines running and \nour lights turned on.\n  It impresses me to know that the bill contains some strengthened \nelectrical provisions. We have outgrown our electrical system, and \nchanges need to be made. One of the provisions in the bill is PUHCA \nrepeal, which will go a long way in helping our energy system meet \nincreasing demands.\n  Also, we desperately need to build new transmission lines. I am glad \nto see that this bill has some provisions which will help ensure that \nhappens. Building a better electric system, however, should not require \nmandates for electricity companies to get into regional transmission \norganizations. States and companies should be able to decide on their \nown what is best for their consumers. So I am pleased to see a \nprovision in the bill that explicitly prevents FERC from mandating \nRTOs.\n  The Energy bill will also help reduce our dependence on foreign oil \nby increasing domestic energy production. It also provides important \nconservation provisions which will help protect the environment. And \nbecause coal is such a key industry in Kentucky, I am pleased that this \nbill contains clean coal provisions that I have authored and been \npushing for a long time. The clean coal provisions will help to \nincrease domestic energy production and help improve the environment.\n  Coal is an important part of our energy plans. It is cheap, \nplentiful, and we do not have to go very far to find it. For my home \nState and the States of others, this means more jobs and a cleaner \nplace to live. Clean coal technologies will significantly reduce \nemissions and sharply increase efficiencies in turning coal into \nelectricity.\n  Previously, our Government overpromoted production of one source of \nenergy--natural gas. This not only depleted our supply, but it created \nso much demand that it completely outstripped supply and left Americans \nto pay higher prices for just this one energy source.\n  A sound energy policy should promote the use of many different types \nof fuels and technologies instead of favoring just one source. As we \nhave seen time and again, putting all our eggs in one basket simply \ndoes not work.\n  I am glad we are turning things around and taking steps toward making \nsure clean coal and other sources play a vital role in meeting our \nfuture energy needs.\n  This bill encourages research and development of clean coal \ntechnology by authorizing about $2.4 billion for the department of \nenergy.\n  These funds will be used to advance new technologies to significantly \nreduce emissions and increase efficiency of turning coal into \nelectricity.\n  And almost $2 billion will be used for the clean coal power \ninitiative.\n  This is where the Department of Energy will work with industry to \nadvance efficiency, environmental performance, and cost competitiveness \nof new clean coal technologies.\n  And the Finance Committee's energy tax package provides $2.7 billion \nto encourage the use of coal and deployment of clean coal technologies.\n  Coal plays an important role in our economy. It provides over 50 \npercent of the energy needed for our Nation's energy.\n  The Energy Information Administration expects coal will continue to \nremain the primary fuel for electricity generation over the next 2 \ndecades.\n  As my colleagues can see, I am a little biased when it comes to coal.\n  It means so much to my State, and it is such an affordable and \nplentiful fuel to help America in her quest for energy independency.\n  The 21st century economy is going to require increased amounts of \nreliable, clean, and affordable energy to keep our Nation running, and \nclean coal can help fill that requirement.\n  With research advances, we have the know-how to better balance \nconservation with the need for increased energy production at home.\n  The diversity of this energy package to promote new fuels is quite \nimpressive.\n  There are provisions for nuclear, hydro-power, solar, wind, bio-fuels \nand other renewable energy sources.\n  All this put together with the bill's conservation provisions will \nhelp America meet its sensible and long-term energy strategy and goals.\n  I look forward to the continued debate and consideration of this \nbill.\n  And I hope we can get it approved, conferenced and sent to the \nPresident's desk for his consideration.\n  The quicker we can do this, then the sooner we can help make our \nenvironment, economy, and national security stronger, and the sooner we \ncan become more energy independent from other sources.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to address some statements made \nlast week, during the debate on the Bingaman amendment No. 791, \nregarding community acceptance of renewable energy in Vermont. After I \nleft the floor, one Senator tried to make a point in opposition to the \ncreation of a national renewable portfolio standard by referencing some \nopposition to a wind power project in Vermont. I want to set the record \nstraight: though we have had some siting issues, Vermonters \noverwhelmingly support renewable energy over nuclear, coal, or natural \ngas.\n  The Senate should not confuse local concerns about the appropriate \nlocation for wind power siting in Vermont as a monolithic objection to \nany new renewable energy in my State. In fact, the views are contrary \nto such a conjuncture, even in the case of wind power. Numerous polls \nthroughout the last decade have consistently shown that Vermonters \nsupport wind energy. In fact, a survey in March 2004 found 74 percent \nof respondents said they would consider wind turbines along a Vermont \nmountain ridge either beautiful or acceptable. The same survey found 83 \npercent of Vermonters choose renewable energy from wind, solar, hydro \nand wood as preferable to other energy sources.\n  Lawrence Mott, Chair of Renewable Energy Vermont, which commissioned \nthe energy poll said, ``It's clear, Vermonters want more renewable \nenergy, including wind turbines, and that they find installation on \nridgelines very acceptable.''\n  Vermont's history with wind power goes back to the turn of the \ncentury when farmers used windmills to pump\n\n[[Page S6790]]\n\ndrinking water from their wells. One of the first great experiments in \nconverting wind to energy was conducted atop a peak in Vermont called \nGrandpa's Knob in Castleton, Vermont. It was, at the time, the world's \nlargest wind turbine and produced 1.25 MW with the first synchronous \nelectric generator. I recall visiting this wind turbine with my \ngrandfather, an architect, and we marveled at its beauty and ingenuity. \nIt was the first time energy from a wind turbine was interconnected to \nthe utility grid.\n  Vermont's interest in wind power has continued to grow since then. \nJust look at Green Mountain Power's wind farm in Searsburg, Vermont. \nEleven wind turbines generate enough electricity to power more than \n2,000 homes, reducing toxic air emissions by 22 million pounds compared \nto the impacts if that amount of electricity had been produced through \ncombustion of fossil fuels.\n  Vermont has a tremendous capacity for wind power, as several of my \ncolleagues have demonstrated with wind maps produced from the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy. Industry representatives in Vermont envision a \nhandful of wind farms scattered about Vermont producing enough \nelectricity to power about 50,000 homes, which would account for about \n10 percent of the State's electricity needs.\n  Last week, Vermont Governor Jim Douglas signed a new renewable energy \nbill into law. He did so at the manufacturing plant of Northern Power \nSystems, a world leader in off-grid power systems. Northern Power is \nabout to ship seven 100-kilowatt wind turbines to three communities in \nremote western Alaska, and the Governor used a 31-foot-long blade from \none of these turbines as his writing table.\n  Clearly, Vermont's Governor and Vermont's legislators see the value \nof renewable energy. A large majority of Vermonters support wind energy \nand renewable energy. And I am very optimistic about the role wind \nenergy can play in satisfying a growing proportion of this Nation's \nenergy needs.\n  Last week the Senate defeated an important amendment that would have \nhelped set this nation on a course to significantly reduce our reliance \non foreign oil. It is unfortunate that a majority of my colleagues did \nnot see fit to put the U.S. on the right course--to break our addiction \nto foreign oil.\n  H.R. 6 requires a 1 million barrel a day oil saving goal. \nUnfortunately, this goal would actually result in more oil being \nimported, not less. In fact, the U.S. will still be importing 14.4 \nmillion barrels a day under the underlying bill's goal. Slowing down \nthe increased rate of consumption alone is not enough. We should be \nsetting an ambitious goal that actually reduces imported oil, not a \ngoal that will result in more oil being imported.\n  Instead, the Senate refused to set a national goal to reduce the \nNation's addiction to foreign oil. The Cantwell amendment would have \nestablished that goal--to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil by 40 \npercent by 2025. By turning our backs on this goal, we are sending the \nwrong message. Reducing our addiction to foreign oil is essential to \nthe economic security of our Nation. We cannot continue to rely on \nunstable foreign countries for the energy that runs the economic \nmachine of this Nation.\n  Fluctuating energy prices and instability in the Middle East once \nagain are prompting calls for energy independence for the U.S.\n  Federal efforts to ensure freedom from fluctuations in energy prices \nhave been advocated by every President, both Republican and Democrat, \nsince 1973 and the infamous oil boycott. As Americans we count on \nenergy to protect our security, to fuel our cars, to provide heat, air \nconditioning and light for our homes, to manufacture goods, and to \ntransport supplies. In all of these needs, we, as consumers, pay the \nprice for fluctuations in the global energy market.\n  Reducing our reliance on foreign oil is essential and the most basic \nstep we need to take to address this crisis. The Cantwell amendment \nwould have resulted in about 7.6 million barrels per day less oil being \nimported in 2025. Those savings are equivalent to the amount of oil the \nU.S. currently imports from Saudi Arabia. We can and should stop the \noil cartels from controlling the future of this Nation.\n  In addition, I believe setting an oil saving goal could have \nbeneficial effects on our air quality. Since a vast majority of current \noil consumption is from the transportation sector, I believe setting an \noil saving goal would encourage auto manufacturers to voluntarily \nimprove efficiency of cars and trucks. As our population continues to \ngrow and more people are driving more miles, it is essential to our air \nquality to continue to improve fuel efficiency of the vehicles we \ndrive.\n  As it stands now, this bill does not require auto manufacturers or \nothers in the transportation sector--the plane, train and truck \nsector--to meet corporate average fuel economy standards. I believe \nincreased fuel economy standards can and should also be included in \nthis bill. But short of adding new standards, setting this goal would \nhave been a significant step in that direction.\n  By failing to set an oil saving goal, I think we have failed to state \none of the most basic goals of this bill--a real reduction the amount \nof foreign imported oil.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 799\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Voinovich], for himself, Mr. \n     Carper, and Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an amendment numbered \n     799.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I offer this amendment today as \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air, \nClimate Change, and Nuclear Safety. This amendment is a bipartisan \npiece of legislation that was introduced last Thursday. It is called \nthe Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005, or S. 1265.\n  This bill is cosponsored by Environment and Public Works Committee \nChairman Jim Inhofe and Ranking Member Jim Jeffords and Senators Tom \nCarper, Johnny Isakson, Hillary Clinton, Kay Bailey Hutchison, and \nDianne Feinstein. Focused on improving air quality and protecting \npublic health, it would establish voluntary National and State-level \ngrant and loan programs to promote the reduction of diesel emissions. \nAdditionally, the bill would help areas come into attainment for the \nnew air quality standards.\n  Developed with environmental, industry, and public officials, the \nlegislation complements Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, \nregulations now being implemented that address diesel fuel and new \ndiesel engines. I am pleased to be joined by a strong and diverse group \nof organizations and officials: Environmental Defense, Clean Air Task \nForce, Union of Concerned Scientists, Ohio Environmental Council, \nCaterpillar Inc., Cummins Inc., Diesel Technology Forum, Emissions \nControl Technology Association, Associated General Contractors of \nAmerica, State and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators/\nAssociation of Local Air Pollution Control Officials, Ohio \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, Regional Air Pollution Control Agency \nin Dayton, OH., and the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission.\n  The cosponsors and these groups do not agree on many issues, which is \nwhy this amendment is so special. I ask unanimous consent that letters \nof support from these organizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S6791]]\n\n\n\n\n                                             Caterpillar Inc.,\n\n                                     Mossville, IL, June 16, 2005.\n     Hon. George Voinovich,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Voinovich: Caterpillar is in full support of \n     the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005. Thank you for \n     assembling a broad coalition of stakeholders in this \n     bipartisan effort to modernize and retrofit millions of \n     diesel engines across the country. It is impressive to see \n     such a strong coalition of environmental groups, regulators \n     and industry representatives working hard to advance retrofit \n     as a national energy and environmental policy issue.\n       As a company. Caterpillar has invested more than $1 billion \n     in new clean diesel engine technology. No power source can \n     match the reliability, efficiency, durability and cost \n     effectiveness of the diesel engine. From the late 1980s to \n     2007, Caterpillar will have reduced diesel emissions in on-\n     road trucks and school buses by 98 percent. When meeting \n     Environmental Protection Agency Tier 4 regulations, \n     Caterpillar will reduce emissions for off-road machines an \n     additional 90 percent by 2014. This ensures that clean diesel \n     engines will continue to be the workhorses of our economy for \n     years to come.\n       Our customers who operate fleets of buses, trucks, \n     construction machines and the equipment that safeguards our \n     homes and lives in non-attainment areas are very interested \n     in retrofit technology. However, they need a nationally \n     consistent approach to address these challenges. Your bill, \n     which focuses on grants and loans, wisely lets the market \n     determine the right technologies for various product \n     applications. Retrofitted engines last longer and, most \n     importantly, have fewer emissions.\n       Thank you again for your commitment to this legislation. \n     You can count on Caterpillar's support as the bill moves \n     forward in Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James J. Parker,\n     Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Environmental Defense,\n\n                                      New York, NY, June 17, 2005.\n\n     Re Introduction of the Diesel Emission Reduction Act of 2005.\n\n     Hon. George V. Voinovich,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Voinovich, I am writing to express \n     Environmental Defense's support for the Diesel Emission \n     Reduction Act of 2005 which you are introducing today.\n       As you are aware the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's \n     regulations establishing new standards for diesel buses and \n     freight trucks and new nonroad diesel equipment will slash \n     diesel emissions by more than 80% from 2000 levels, \n     ultimately saving 20,000 lives a year in 2030. But because \n     these federal standards apply only to new diesel engines and \n     because diesel engines are so durable, the high levels of \n     pollution from existing diesel sources will persist \n     throughout the long lives of the engines in service today.\n       Your legislation establishing a national program to cut \n     pollution from today's diesel engines would speed the \n     transition to cleaner diesel engines and achieve healthier \n     air well in advance of that schedule. The program design \n     principles embodied in your bill help ensure that the funds \n     for diesel emission reduction projects will be spent in an \n     equitable and efficient manner.\n       Environmental Defense has long been a proponent of smart \n     policy design. We have promoted market-based and cost-\n     effective programs such as cap-and-trade as a solution to a \n     variety of environmental issues dating back to the 1990 Clean \n     Air Act Amendment.\n       Environmental Defense commends you on your leadership in \n     cleaning up the existing diesel fleet. We look forward to \n     working with you and your staff to ensure the passage and \n     funding of the Diesel Emission Reduction Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Fred Krupp,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            The Associated General\n\n\n                                       Contractors of America,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, June 15, 2005.\n     Hon. George V. Voinovich,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Voinovich: The Associated General Contractors \n     of America (AGC) thanks you for taking the lead in \n     introducing The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) to \n     provide assistance for owners to retrofit their diesel \n     powered equipment. The legislation would establish grant and \n     loan programs to achieve significant reduction in diesel \n     emissions. This initiative could prove to be extremely \n     beneficial to local areas attempting to come into compliance \n     with the Clean Air Act.\n       The construction industry welcomes this legislation because \n     it will provide the needed assistance to help contractors \n     retrofit their off road equipment. Contractors use diesel \n     powered off road equipment to build projects that enhance our \n     environment and quality of life by improving transportation \n     system, water quality, offices, homes, navigation and other \n     vital infrastructure. This equipment tends to have a long \n     life, and therefore is in use for many years before it is \n     replaced.\n       Reducing the emissions from the engines that power this \n     equipment is a costly undertaking and is particularly \n     burdensome for small businesses. Providing grants to aid \n     contractors with the expense of retrofitting is a highly cost \n     effective use of federal funds.\n       AGC applauds your efforts in taking an incentive approach \n     to addressing environmental concerns. AGC urges that this \n     legislation be enacted quickly so that environmental benefits \n     can be achieved as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Stephen E. Sandherr,\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Cummins Inc.,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 14, 2005.\n     Hon. George V. Voinovich,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Voinovich: Cummins Inc. strongly supports the \n     Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005, which establishes a \n     voluntary national retrofit program aimed at reducing \n     emissions from existing diesel engines, and congratulates you \n     on your efforts to bring the diesel industry and \n     environmental groups together on this effort.\n       The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005 recognizes the \n     clean air challenges ahead of us and puts in place a system \n     to help address them. In the near future, states must develop \n     plans to address particulate matter and ozone emission \n     reductions to meet the new air quality standards. A federally \n     sponsored voluntary diesel retrofit initiative is a great \n     tool to help states and communities meet these new air \n     quality standards. Your legislation recognizes that one size \n     does not fit all, and there are a number of technologies, \n     which can be implemented to modernize diesel fleets. The term \n     retrofit not only describes an after treatment exhaust device \n     used to reduce key vehicle emissions but also refers to \n     engine repair/rebuild, refuel, repower, and replacement.\n       The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005 represents a \n     sound use of tax payer dollars. Diesel retrofits have proven \n     to be one of the most cost-effective emissions reductions \n     strategies. Furthermore, another advantage to retrofits is \n     that reductions can be realized immediately after \n     installation and can be particularly important in \n     metropolitan areas where high volumes of heavy-duty trucks \n     are prevalent and/or where major construction projects are \n     underway for long periods of time.\n       Finally, I, again, wanted to congratulate you on your \n     efforts to bring our industry together with the environmental \n     community on this legislation. This legislation is truly a \n     model on how to find solutions to environmental problems. It \n     is our hope that the process, which you put together to craft \n     this legislation, can be used to further address the older \n     fleets as well as advance efforts, which recognize the energy \n     efficiency and environmental benefits of clean diesel \n     technologies.\n       Again, Cummins thanks you for your vision on these issues \n     and looks forward to working with you to pass this \n     legislation.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Mike Cross,\n       Vice President, Cummins Inc. and General Manager, \n     Fleetguard Emission Solutions.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Diesel Technology Forum,\n\n                                      Frederick, MD, June 9, 2005.\n     Hon. George Voinovich,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Voinovich: We would like to recognize and \n     thank you for your leadership in developing the Diesel \n     Emissions Reduction Act of 2005. We are especially encouraged \n     by the broad coalition of industry and environmental groups \n     from whom you have successfully sought not just cooperation, \n     but real collaboration in development and support of this \n     important legislation.\n       As you know, the recent advancements in new clean diesel \n     technology have been substantial. New emissions control \n     devices such as particulate filters oxidation catalysts, and \n     other technologies will play an important role in the clean \n     diesel system of the future, allowing new commercial truck \n     engines to be over 90 percent lower in emissions than those \n     built just a dozen years ago. And, as we have learned over \n     the last 5 years, these technologies can also be applied to \n     some existing vehicles and equipment. Your legislation will \n     play an important role in helping to deploy more clean diesel \n     retrofit technologies to thousands of small businesses and \n     equipment owners who might otherwise not be able to afford \n     the upgrading of their equipment.\n       Because of its unique combination of energy efficiency, \n     durability and reliability, diesel technology plays a \n     critical role in many industrial and transportation sectors, \n     powering two-thirds of all construction and farm equipment \n     and over 90 percent of highway trucks. Diesel technology has \n     played and will continue to play a vital role in key sectors \n     of our economy. Thanks to your legislation, diesel technology \n     will continue to serve these sectors and help assure this \n     country's continued clean air progress.\n       We look forward to continuing to promoting a greater \n     awareness of the benefits of clean diesel retrofits and your \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                               Allen R. Schaeffer,\n\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n[[Page S6792]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                     State of Ohio\n\n\n                              Environmental Protection Agency,\n\n                                      Columbus, OH, June 15, 2005.\n     Hon. George V. Voinovich,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Voinovich: It has been a great pleasure to \n     meet you and discuss air quality issues with you over these \n     last few months. Ohio's air quality has improved dramatically \n     over the last 30 years. However, as you are well aware, Ohio \n     faces a significant challenge in achieving compliance with \n     the new federal air quality standards for ozone and fine \n     particle matter. We have 33 counties that don't meet the more \n     stringent ozone standard, and all or part of 32 counties that \n     don't meet the more stringent particulate standard.\n       Diesel emissions are part of the problem in both of those \n     scenarios. That is why I am so encouraged by your efforts to \n     develop bipartisan legislation to provide federal financial \n     assistance for a voluntary diesel retrofit initiative. In \n     many cases, lack of funding is the only thing keeping people \n     from using the cleaner technology that is available.\n       As Ohio develops its clean air plans for ozone and \n     particulate matter, we need to consider every tool available \n     to us. A funding program to help reduce pollution from diesel \n     engines is a valuable tool.\n       I look forward to the successful passage of your bill and \n     the clean air benefits it bring to Ohio and the nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Joseph P. Koncelik,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Ohio Environmental Council,\n                                      Columbus, OH, June 13, 2005.\n     Subject: Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005.\n\n     Hon. George Voinovich,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Voinovich: The Ohio Environmental Council \n     offers its hearty support for the Diesel Emissions Reduction \n     Act of 2005. This landmark legislation will help clean up one \n     of Ohio's and the nation's largest sources of dangerous air \n     pollution; diesel engines.\n       From our initial meeting with you in April of 2004 to \n     discuss the impacts of diesel pollution, we have been \n     impressed by your leadership in addressing this significant \n     contributor to Ohio's, and the nation's, air quality \n     problems. As you know, approximately one-third of Ohio \n     counties are failing federal air quality standards for \n     ground-level ozone and fine particulate matter. Much of the \n     nation faces a similar burden with an estimated 65 million \n     people living in areas exceeding the fine particulate \n     standard and 111 million people living in areas exceeding the \n     8-hour ozone standard.\n       Diesel engines contribute significantly to this problem \n     with on-road and off-road diesel engines accounting for \n     roughly one-half of the ozone contributing nitrogen oxide and \n     fine particulate mobile source emissions nationwide. \n     According to EPA, diesel exhaust also contains over 40 \n     chemicals listed as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), some of \n     which are known or probable human carcinogens including \n     benzene and formaldehyde. Numerous studies have suggested \n     that diesel pollutants contribute to health effects such as \n     asthma attacks, reduced lung function, heart and lung \n     disease, cancer and even premature death.\n       Fortunately, unlike many complex environmental problems \n     that have very complicated solutions, the clean-up of diesel \n     air pollution is easy. Technologies are available today to \n     retrofit existing diesel engines, reducing emissions from the \n     tailpipe by 20-90%--reductions realized immediately after \n     installation. In fact, due to EPA's Diesel Rules, starting in \n     2007 we will see the cleanest diesel engines ever coming off \n     production lines. Unfortunately, those rules do not address \n     the 11 million diesel engines in use today. In order to meet \n     EPA's goal to modernize 100% of these existing engines by \n     2014, states and fleets will need assistance.\n       That is why the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005 is \n     so imperative. It will establish an unprecedented $200 \n     million annual national grant and loan program to assist \n     states, organizations and fleets in reducing emissions from \n     diesel engines. These efforts will serve to help counties in \n     complying with federal air standards as well as minimize the \n     health toll of diesel emissions on the public.\n       I am proud to offer the Ohio Environmental Council's \n     support to you, Senator Voinovich, with the introduction of \n     the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Vicki L. Deisner,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                        Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission,\n\n                                       Columbus, OH, June 14, 2005\n     Hon. George V. Voinovich,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Voinovich: Our membership, comprised of 41 \n     local governments in central Ohio, has identified our ozone \n     and PM2.5 nonattainment status as one of the most daunting \n     challenges facing our region. Numerous health studies \n     demonstrate the negative health impacts of polluted air, \n     especially for asthmatic children and older adults with heart \n     disease. In addition to these, health impacts, failure to \n     clean up our air could inhibit business expansion and \n     investment in transportation.\n       Freight transportation is one of the primary growth sectors \n     for central Ohio. Yet, we do not want growth at the expense \n     of a diminished quality of life for our residents. Therefore, \n     it is important that we do whatever we can to encourage \n     public and private on and off-road fleets to improve \n     emissions from existing diesel engines that will continue to \n     operate for many years.\n       MORPC's Air Quality Committee is working diligently with a \n     broad coalition of local governments, manufacturers, \n     industry, health organizations, and environmental groups to \n     identify and implement cost effective ways to reduce nitrogen \n     oxide (NOX) and particulate matter (PM) emissions \n     that contribute to ozone and particle pollution in central \n     Ohio. We strongly support the introduction of the Diesel \n     Emissions Reduction Act of 2005 to provide federal funds to \n     spur local investment in voluntary diesel emission reduction \n     programs. This will be an invaluable tool to help us meet the \n     Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ambient air quality \n     standards.\n       We look forward to working with you to continue to develop \n     support for the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005. \n     Please let me know if we can be of any assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 William C. Habig,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Clean Air Task Force,\n\n                                        Boston, MA, June 16, 2005.\n     Re Letter of support for the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act \n         of 2005.\n\n     Hon. George V. Voinovich,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Voinovich: The Clean Air Task Force is proud \n     to be one of the core members of a group of industry, \n     environmental and government representatives that worked \n     together on a collaborative effort to find ways of reducing \n     harmful emissions of air pollution from existing diesel \n     engines. We strongly support legislation that grew out of \n     that effort, the Diesel Emissions Reductions Act of 2005. We \n     thank you and your staff for your leadership on this \n     important issue.\n       Heavy-duty diesel engines powering vehicles and equipment \n     such as long-haul trucks, buses, construction equipment, \n     logging and agricultural equipment, locomotives and marine \n     vessels produce a wide variety of dangerous air pollutants, \n     including particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and air toxics. \n     These pollutants, emitted at ground level often in populated \n     areas, produce substantial harm to human health and the \n     environment, up to and including premature death.\n       Recently, EPA has determined that 65 million people live in \n     areas where the air contains unhealthy levels of fine \n     particulate matter (PM2.5), areas that EPA has \n     thus classified as nonattainment for the PM2.5 \n     NAAQS. In order for those areas to meet the attainment \n     requirements in the Clean Air Act, substantial reductions of \n     PM2.5 emissions will be required. The largest \n     local source of potential PM2.5 reductions in most \n     urban areas is the existing fleet of heavy-duty diesel \n     engines. Although EPA has promulgated regulations to \n     substantially reduce emissions from heavy duty highway and \n     nonroad diesels, many of these engines are long-lived and the \n     air quality benefits of EPA's new engine rules won't be fully \n     realized for more than two decades--a full generation away \n     and long past applicable NAAQS attainment deadlines.\n       Fortunately, efficient and cost-effective means of \n     substantially reducing diesel emissions are readily available \n     today. For example, diesel particulate filters can reduce \n     diesel PM2.5 emissions by about 90% from many \n     heavy-duty diesel engines. Widespread use of such controls \n     could dramatically reduce harmful diesel emissions in our \n     cities and states, would save thousands of lives, produce \n     billions of dollars of societal benefits, and help states \n     meet their attainment obligations under the Clean Air Act.\n       One of the primary barriers to the widespread installation \n     of diesel emission control technology is a lack of resources. \n     Many heavy-duty diesel fleets, such as buses, refuse trucks, \n     highway maintenance equipment, trains and ferries are owned \n     or operated by public agencies with limited resources.\n       The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005 will provide \n     $200 per year for the next 5 years to help fund reductions of \n     air pollution from in-use diesel engines, including those \n     operated by cash-strapped public agencies. This will produce \n     human health and environmental benefits far in excess of the \n     costs, and will provide timely assistance to many areas to \n     help them achieve EPA's health based air quality standards \n     for particulate matter and ozone.\n       CATF urges your support of the Diesel Emissions Reductions \n     Act of 2005.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                              Conrad G.

George V. Voinovich,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate, Committee on Environment and Public \n         Works, Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate Change and \n         Nuclear Safety, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Voinovich: On behalf of the State and \n     Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators (STAPPA) and \n     the Association of Local Air Pollution Control Officials \n     (ALAPCO)--the national associations of state and local air \n     pollution control agencies in 53 states and territories and \n     more than 165 metropolitan areas across the country--I am \n     pleased to offer support for the Diesel Emissions Reduction \n     Act of 2005 and to commend your leadership in introducing \n     this legislation and in working with a broad coalition of \n     diverse stakeholders to draft it.\n       Emissions from dirty diesel engines pose serious threats to \n     public health and the environment. These emissions are not \n     only substantial contributors to unhealthful levels of ozone \n     and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), they cause or \n     exacerbate unacceptably high levels of toxic air pollution in \n     most areas of the country. Although our nation has taken \n     significant action to reduce emissions from new highway and \n     nonroad diesel engines, and additional federal measures are \n     planned to address new diesel marine and locomotive engines, \n     several critical opportunities remain for achieving further \n     reductions in diesel emissions. Chief among them is cleaning \n     up existing diesel engines by retrofitting these engines with \n     new emission control technologies. By authorizing funds for \n     grants and loans to states and other organizations for the \n     purpose of reducing emissions from diesel engines, the Diesel \n     Emissions Reduction Act of 2005 will help states and \n     localities achieve their air quality goals, including \n     attaining and maintaining health-based National Ambient Air \n     Quality Standards for ozone and PM2.5 and reducing \n     exposure to toxic air pollution.\n       STAPPA and ALAPCO are pleased to support this bill and look \n     forward to working with you and other stakeholders as it \n     proceeds through the legislative process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                S. William Becker,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Union of Concerned Scientists,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 10, 2005.\n       The Union of Concerned Scientists, and our 140,000 members \n     and activists nationwide, strongly support the Diesel \n     Emissions Reduction Act of 2005. This landmark legislation \n     will improve air quality across the country by providing $200 \n     million in grants and loans to reduce pollution from diesel \n     vehicles and equipment.\n       The exhaust from conventional diesel-powered engines may \n     cause or exacerbate serious health problems such as asthma, \n     bronchitis and cancer, and can even lead to premature death. \n     In addition to its public health toll, diesel exhaust exacts \n     enormous social costs, with escalating health care \n     expenditures, loss of work and school days, and the most \n     costly impact of all--the loss of human lives.\n       Although standards for new diesel engines offer important \n     health benefits, they do not address the biggest polluters: \n     existing diesel engines. The bulk of diesel pollution now and \n     for the next decade or more come from engines already in use. \n     Fortunately, there are a wide range of readily available \n     cleanup technologies and strategies, including replacing \n     high-polluting engines and retrofitting with emissions \n     controls. The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act will help get \n     diesel cleanup technologies off the shelf and onto today's \n     vehicles and equipment.\n       USC is pleased to be part of a diverse coalition of \n     groups--including environmental and health groups, the diesel \n     industry, and public agencies--that is working \n     collaboratively on reduciug diesel pollution. This unique mix \n     of voices all agree that reducing pollution from diesel \n     engines is a public health priority, and that federal and \n     state funding is a key strategy to clean up diesel engines.\n       The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act will accelerate the \n     public health benefits of the new engine emissions standards, \n     and will help Americans breathe easier.\n           Sincerely,\n     Patricia Monahan,\n       Senior Analyst, Transportation Program.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      Regional Air\n\n\n                                     Pollution Control Agency,\n\n                                        Dayton, OH, June 15, 2005.\n     Hon.

RAPCA is a six county \n     local air pollution control agency charged with protecting \n     the residents of the Dayton/Springfield area from the adverse \n     health impacts of air pollution. We would like to thank you \n     and your staff for offering this vital piece of legislation \n     which will greatly help the citizens of our area breathe \n     healthier air.\n       Diesel emission reductions offer a significant opportunity \n     in the effort to clean the nation's air. Diesel emissions \n     represent approximately one-half of the nitrogen oxide and \n     particulate matter emissions from the mobile source sector \n     and numerous air toxics.\n       Like many areas across the county, the Dayton/Springfield \n     area is nonattainment for both ozone and fine particulate \n     matter. RAPCA strongly believes that this bill provides a \n     unique opportunity to help the area attain these standards, \n     especially fine particulates, as well as reducing the health \n     risks associated with air toxics. Furthermore, many of the \n     diesel vehicles that would be affected by this bill operate \n     in the urban core, thus providing health benefits to many \n     individuals.\n       Again we would like to express our sincere thanks to you \n     for offering the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005, \n     which will help millions of Americans breathe easier.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John A.

George Voinovich,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Voinovich: On behalf of the Emission Control \n     Technology Association (ECTA), I would like to thank you for \n     introducing the Diesel Retrofit Reduction Act of 2005, and \n     advise you of our wholehearted support for this legislation. \n     If enacted, this legislation will help states to reduce \n     diesel engine emissions, thereby, strengthening the economy, \n     public health, and the environment.\n       On-road heavy duty diesel vehicles and non-road diesel \n     vehicles and engines account for roughly one-half of the \n     nitrogen oxide (NOX) and particulate matter (PM) \n     mobile source emissions nationwide. These emissions \n     contribute to ozone formation, fine particulate matter, and \n     regional haze. With more than 167 million Americans living in \n     counties that do not achieve the National Ambient Air Quality \n     Standard (NAAQS) established by the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, it is more important than ever that states and other \n     organizations are given the means to address this growing \n     problem. Clean diesel retrofits are a highly cost effective \n     means of reducing these emissions, costing approximately \n     $5,000 per ton equivalent of air pollution removed. The \n     Diesel Retrofit Reduction Act of 2005 will ease the growing \n     burden states are feeling as they strive to reach attainment \n     of these national standards, by providing them with grants \n     and loans for the purpose of reducing emissions from diesel \n     engines.\n       There are several programs that demonstrate the \n     achievements made by clean diesel retrofits. A prime example \n     is the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) Retrofit \n     Program in San Francisco, California. As part of the MTC \n     program, more than 1,700 emission control systems were \n     installed on diesel buses. It is estimated that 2,500 pounds \n     of NOX and 300 pounds per day of particulates will \n     be eliminated as a result of the MTC transit bus retrofit \n     program. We are certain that the Diesel Retrofit Reduction \n     Act of 2005 will accomplish similar feats upon its passage.\n       ECTA thanks you for authoring this important legislation \n     and for your leadership on this issue. We look forward to \n     working with you and your staff to ensure its passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Timothy Regan,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. The process for developing this legislation began last \nyear when several of these organizations came in to meet with me. They \ninformed me of the harmful public health impact of diesel emissions. \nOn-road and non-road diesel vehicles and engines account for roughly \none-half of the nitrogen oxide and particulate matter mobile source \nemissions nationwide.\n  I was pleased to hear that the administration had taken strong action \nwith new diesel fuel and engine regulations, which were developed in a \ncollaborative effort to substantially reduce diesel emissions. However, \nI was told that the full health benefit would not be realized until \n2030 because these regulations address new engines and the estimated 11 \nmillion existing engines have a long life. Diesel engines have a very \nlong life.\n  I was pleased that they had a constructive suggestion on how we could \naddress this problem. They informed me of successful grant and loan \nprograms at the State and local level throughout the Nation that are \nworking on a voluntary basis to retrofit diesel engines.\n  I was also cognizant that the new ozone and particulate matter air \nquality standards were going into effect and that a voluntary program \nwas needed to help the Nation's 495 and Ohio's 38 nonattainment \ncounties--especially those that are in moderate nonattainment like \nNortheast Ohio.\n  Additionally, I have visited with University of Cincinnati Medical \nCenter\n\n[[Page S6794]]\n\ndoctors--as recently as earlier this month--to discuss their Cincinnati \nChildhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study. Some of the early results \nindicate disturbing impacts on the development of children living near \nhighways because of emissions from diesel engines.\n  It became clear to me that a national program was needed. We then \nformed a strong, diverse coalition comprised of environmental, \nindustry, and public officials. The culmination of this work was \nreleased last Thursday with the introduction of the Diesel Emissions \nReduction Act of 2005.\n  The amendment that I am offering today is the same as this bill. It \nwould establish voluntary national and State-level grant and loan \nprograms to promote the reduction of diesel emissions. The amendment \nwould authorize $1 billion over 5 years--$200 million annually. Some \nwill claim that this is too much money and others will claim it is not \nenough--so probably it is the right number.\n  We should first recognize that the need far outpaces what is \ncontained in the legislation. This funding is also fiscally responsible \nas diesel retrofits have proven to be one of the most cost-effective \nemissions reduction strategies. For example, let's compare the cost \neffectiveness of diesel retrofits versus current Congestion Mitigation \nand Air Quality program projects.\n  We are talking about the per ton of Nitrogen Oxides reduced, cost on \naverage. We are talking about 1 ton of nitrogen oxides and how much it \ncosts to reduce them: $126,400 for alternative fuel buses; $66,700 for \nsignal optimization; $19,500 for bike racks on buses; and $10,500 for \nvanpool programs.\n  This is compared to $5,390 to repower construction equipment and \n$5,000 to retrofit a transit bus.\n  The bottom line is that if we want to clean up our air to improve the \nenvironment and protect public health, diesel retrofits are one of the \nbest uses of taxpayers' money.\n  Furthermore, as a former Governor, I know firsthand that the new air \nquality standards are an unfunded mandate on our States and \nlocalities--and they need the Federal Government's help. We are going \nto find that out. Many Americans are not aware, because of the ozone \nand particulate standards that many communities are going to have a \ndifficult time complying with these new ambient air standards.\n  This legislation would help bring counties into attainment by \nencouraging the retrofitting or replacement of diesel engines, \nsubstantially reducing diesel emissions and the formation of ozone and \nparticulate matter.\n  The amendment is efficient with the Federal Government's dollars in \nseveral ways. First, 70 percent of the program would be administered by \nthe EPA. The remaining 20 percent of the funding would be distributed \nto States that establish voluntary diesel retrofit programs. Ten \npercent of the amendment's overall funding would be set aside as an \nincentive for state's to match the Federal dollars being provided.\n  The hope is this amendment leverages additional public and private \nfunding with the creation of State level programs throughout this \ncountry. The amendment would expand on very successful programs that \nnow exist in Texas and California.\n  Second, the program would focus on nonattainment areas where help is \nneeded the most.\n  Third, it would require at least 50 percent of the Federal program to \nbe used on public fleets since we are talking about using public \ndollars.\n  Fourth, it would place a high priority on the projects that are the \nmost cost effective and affect the most people.\n  Lastly, the amendment includes provisions to help develop new \ntechnologies, encourage more action through nonfinancial incentives, \nand require EPA to reach out to stakeholders and report on the success \nof the program.\n  EPA estimates this billion-dollar program would leverage an \nadditional $500 million, leading to a net benefit of almost $20 billion \nwith the reduction of 70,000 tons of particulate matter. This is a \nquite substantial 13-1 cost-benefit ratio.\n  The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005 enjoys broad bipartisan \nsupport and is needed desperately. I urge my colleagues to vote for \nthis amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays, and I ask unanimous consent 10 minutes \nbe set aside prior to the vote on the amendment for sponsors to speak \non its behalf.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, could I ask the Senator from Ohio a \nquestion about his amendment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator may.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, if we could get copies of the amendment, \nSenator Domenici would be anxious to review it. I would, as well. It \nsounds very meritorious as described, but before actually agreeing to a \nunanimous consent as to the timing of the vote and the amount of time \nneeded in anticipation of a vote, it would be better to get a copy at \nthis point, if we could. That is just a suggestion.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nis a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I withdraw the request for the 10 minutes until the \nranking member has an opportunity to review the amendment, and we can \ndiscuss at that time how much time the Senator is willing to give.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. That will be very good. I appreciate that opportunity. \nWe will be back in touch with the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I will ask the Senator from Ohio a \nquestion. I walked in about two-thirds of the way through his remarks.\n  Do I understand that this is legislation that helps reduce sulfur in \nthe air by retrofitting diesel engines so they comply with the new EPA \nrequirements for low sulfur?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Right. This is one of the most effective ways, \nactually, to reduce nitrogen oxide and also particulate matter. In my \nremarks I mentioned the study at the University of Cincinnati on \nchildren. The negative impact is amazing on children who live very \nclose to freeways with this diesel fuel. Retrofitting would be the most \ncost-efficient way of dealing with that problem.\n  This program fundamentally is a voluntary program. It is a program in \nwhich we encourage all of the States to participate. If they did, each \nState would get 2 percent of the money. If they didn't, those States \nthat participated would benefit from this on a per capita basis, 30 \npercent of the program allocated to them and 70 percent of it would be \ndistributed by the Environmental Protection Agency based on submissions \nsubmitted and also on the basis of giving priority to public requests \nfor this money.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Ohio. He has \nspent a long time in this session working on clean air legislation.\n  As one Senator, I am extremely interested in that for our country. \nThe Great Smoky Mountains--2 miles from where I live, and on the other \nside is the Senator from North Carolina, the Presiding Officer--is the \nmost polluted National Park in America.\n  Many of our counties are not in attainment. Our biggest problem is \nsulfur. But NOX is also a major problem. Of course, a major \ncontributor is the big diesel trucks on the road.\n  One of the President's greatest accomplishments in terms of sulfur is \ntighter restrictions on the fuel that will be used in these trucks. \nThey also are major contributors to NOX, nitrogen oxide. My \nunderstanding from my visits and discussions with people who know about \nthe big trucks is that the retrofitting of these older engines is not \nas good as a new engine, but it is a very substantial--70 or 80 percent \nas good as having a new engine.\n  I look forward to reading the legislation. The Clean Energy Act that \nwe are working on is not the Clean Air Act that the Senator spent so \nmuch time on, but clean energy is the solution to the clean air \nproblem. I am glad the Senator is bringing this to our attention. I \nlook forward to reading it. It looks like a welcome contribution.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I thank the Senator from Tennessee. The administration \nshould be complimented. The new diesel regulations will go into effect \nnext year. The fact is, 11 million on- and off-road vehicles will still \nbe on the road for many years to come. As the Senator pointed out \nregarding retrofitting,\n\n[[Page S6795]]\n\nwe had a bus retrofit. We are talking about 85 percent reduction. The \ndiesel fuel is fine, but if you do not have the retrofit, it will not \ngive you the desired emissions control.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 800\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1936 to provide energy \n                tax incentives, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On behalf of the leader, we have cleared the amendment \nat the desk. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside. I further ask that the Grassley-Baucus amendment No. 800 which \nis at the desk be considered and agreed to and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid on the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment (No. 800) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I strongly support the Finance Committee's \nenergy tax language.\n  Why are the incentives proposed in this language so important? First \nand foremost, they are important because of the energy challenges \nfacing the Nation.\n  Energy is critical to our Nation's economy and security. Our \ncontinuing dependence on foreign oil increasingly threatens our vital \nnational interests.\n  As the world's demand for oil continues to grow at a record pace, the \nworld's oil producers strain to meet consumption. Today, OPEC is \npumping close to full capacity. Even so, refined products remain \nscarce.\n  The price of oil has soared to more than $55 a barrel. The price of \ngas at the pump is a daily reminder of the scarcity of energy. \nIncreasing energy prices stifle economic growth.\n  Folks in my home State of Montana are hit hard by rising energy \nprices. High gas prices particularly hurt folks who have to drive great \ndistances. And high energy prices hurt small businesses, ranchers, and \nfarmers by raising the costs of doing business.\n  We can do more to provide reliable energy from domestic sources. That \nis our first challenge.\n  Our next great energy challenge is to ensure safe, clean, and \naffordable energy from renewable resources. Energy produced from wind, \nwater, sun, and waste holds great potential. But that energy cannot \ncurrently meet our national energy demands. Technology is helping to \nbridge the gap. But further development requires financial assistance.\n  The energy tax incentives take an evenhanded approach to an array of \npromising technologies. We do not yet know which new technologies will \nprove to be the most effective. As we go forward and provide the needed \nincentives to develop these new technologies, we also need appropriate \ncost-benefit assessments to guide future investments.\n  The energy tax language reflects the incentives endorsed by the \nFinance Committee last Thursday. These incentives make meaningful \nprogress toward energy independence. They provide a balanced package of \ntargeted incentives directed to renewable energy, traditional energy \nproduction, and energy efficiency.\n  These incentives would encourage new energy production, especially \nproduction from renewable sources.\n  They would encourage the development of new technology.\n  And they would encourage energy efficiency and conservation.\n  To encourage production, the tax language provides a uniform 10-year \nperiod for claiming production tax credits under section 45 of the Tax \nCode. This encourages production of electricity from all sources of \nrenewable energy. It would not benefit one technology over another.\n  In Judith Gap, MT, wind whips across the wheat plains. Wind is a \ngreat and promising resource in Montana. But future development of wind \nprojects needs support, like that provided in the tax language.\n  The tax language recognizes the value of coal and oil to our economy. \nIt provides tax incentives for cleaner-burning coal and much-needed \nexpansion of refinery capacity.\n  The lack of refinery capacity is driving up the price of oil. And our \nlack of domestic capacity increases our vulnerabilities. A new refinery \nhas not been built in the U.S. since 1976. The tax language would \nencourage the development of additional refinery capacity domestically \nby allowing the development costs to be expensed.\n  The tax language also rewards energy conservation and efficiency, and \nencourages the use of clean-fuel vehicles and technologies. It provides \nan investment tax credit for recycling equipment. These incentives are \nenvironmentally responsible. They reduce pollution. And they improve \npeople's health.\n  The energy tax provisions would make meaningful progress toward \nenergy independence. They are balanced and fair. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/20/senate-section/article/S6795-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6795-S6802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF JOHN ROBERT BOLTON TO BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNITED \n            STATES OF AMERICA TO THE UNITED NATIONS--Resumed\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session for the consideration of \nCalendar No. 103, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of John Robert \nBolton, of Maryland, to be Representative of the United States of \nAmerica to the United Nations.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 6 p.m. shall be equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today the Senate again takes up the \nnomination of John Bolton to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. \nThis nomination has traveled a long road. I am hopeful that we can \nconclude the debate today.\n  I appreciate that several of my colleagues continue to be \ndissatisfied that their requests for information have not been granted \nin their entirety. Under the rules, clearly they can continue to block \nthis nomination as long as 60 Senators do not vote for cloture. \nAlthough I acknowledge their deeply held opposition to this nominee, we \nurgently need an ambassador at the United Nations. A clear majority of \nSenators is in favor of confirming Secretary Bolton.\n  The President has stated repeatedly that this is not a casual \nappointment. He and Secretary Rice want a specific person to do a \nspecific job. They have said that they want John Bolton, an avowed and \nknowledgeable reformer, to carry out their reform agenda at the United \nNations.\n  Regardless of how each Senator plans to vote today, we should not \nlose sight of the larger national security issues concerning U.N. \nreform and international diplomacy that are central to this nomination. \nWe should recall that U.N. reform is an imperative mission of the next \nambassador. In fact, on Friday, our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives passed an extensive U.N. reform bill. This body is also \nworking on various approaches to reform.\n  In 2005, we may have a unique opportunity to improve the operations \nof the U.N. The revelations of the oil-for-food scandal and the urgency \nof strengthening global cooperation to address terrorism, the AIDS \ncrisis, nuclear proliferation, and many other international problems \nhave created momentum in favor of constructive reforms at the U.N. \nSecretary General Kofi Annan has proposed a substantial\n\n[[Page S6796]]\n\nreform plan that will provide a platform for reform initiatives and \ndiscussions.\n  Few people in Government have thought more about U.N. reform than \nJohn Bolton. He served 4 years as the Assistant Secretary of State \noverseeing international organizations under the first President Bush. \nHe has written and commented extensively on the subject. During his \nconfirmation hearing, Secretary Bolton demonstrated an impressive \ncommand of issues related to the United Nations. Senator Biden \nacknowledged to the nominee at his hearing that, ``There is no question \nyou have extensive experience in U.N. affairs.'' Deputy Secretary Rich \nArmitage has told reporters: ``John Bolton is eminently qualified. He's \none of the smartest guys in Washington.''\n  This nomination has gone through many twists and turns. But now we \nare down to an issue of process. The premise expressed for holding up \nthe nominee is that the Senate has the absolute right as a co-equal \nbranch of Government to information that it requests pertaining to a \nnominee. Political scientists can debate whether this right actually is \nabsolute, but there is a flaw in this premise as it applies to the \nBolton nomination. This is that the Senate, as a body, has not asked \nfor this information. The will of the Senate is expressed by the \nmajority. A majority of Senators have voted to end debate. By that \nvote, a majority of Senators have said that they have the information \nthey need to make a decision.\n\n  If Members are intent upon exercising their right to filibuster this \nnominee, they may do so. But they cannot claim that the Senate as an \ninstitution is being disadvantaged or denied information it is \nrequesting when at least 57 Senators have supported cloture knowing \nthat invoking it would lead to a final vote. Senate rules give 41 \nSenators the power to continue debate. But neither a filibuster nor a \nrequest from individual Senators counts as an expression of the will of \nthe Senate.\n  Minds are made up on this nomination, as they have been for weeks. In \nfact, with few exceptions, minds have been made up on this nominee \nsince before his hearing occurred. Nevertheless, the Foreign Relations \nCommittee conducted an exhaustive investigation. I would remind my \ncolleagues that Republicans on the Foreign Relations Committee assented \nto every single witness that the minority wanted to interview. The \ncases for and against Secretary Bolton have been made extensively and \nskillfully. In the context of an 11-week investigation involving 29 \nwitnesses and more than 1,000 pages of documents culminating in 14 \nhours of floor debate, the remaining process dispute over a small \namount of information seems out of proportion. This is particularly the \ncase given that the ostensible purpose of obtaining documents and \ninterviewing witnesses is to help Senators make up their minds on how \nto vote.\n  If we accept the standard that any Senator should get whatever \ndocuments requested on any nominee despite the will of the Senate to \nmove forward, then the nomination process has taken on nearly limitless \nparameters. Nomination investigations should not be without limits. It \nis easy to say that any inquiry into any suspicion is justified if we \nare pursuing the truth. But as Senators who are frequently called upon \nto pass judgment on nominees, we know reality is more complicated than \nthat. We want to ensure that nominees are qualified, skilled, honest \nand open. Clearly, we should thoroughly examine each nominee's record. \nBut in doing so, we should understand that there can be human and \norganizational costs if the inquiry is not focused and fair.\n  I reiterate that the President has tapped Secretary Bolton to \nundertake an urgent mission. Secretary Bolton has affirmed his \ncommitment to fostering a strong United Nations. He has expressed his \nintent to work hard to secure greater international support at the U.N. \nfor the national security and foreign policy objectives of the United \nStates. He has stated his belief in decisive American leadership at the \nU.N. and underscored that an effective United Nations is very much in \nthe interest of U.S. national security. I believe that the President \ndeserves to have his nominee represent him at the United Nations. I \nurge my colleagues to invoke cloture.\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent that \nquorum calls be charged equally to both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I state at the outset that the vote we are \nabout to take is not about John Bolton. The vote we are about to take \nis about taking a stand--about the Senate taking a stand. The vote is \nabout whether the Senate will allow the President to dictate to a \ncoequal branch of Government how we, the Senate, are to fulfill our \nconstitutional responsibility under the advice and consent clause. It \nis that basic. I believe it is totally unacceptable for the President \nof the United States, Democrat or Republican--and both have tried--to \ndictate to the Senate how he, the President, thinks we should proceed.\n  The fact that the President of the United States in this case says he \ndoes not believe the information we seek is relevant to our fulfilling \nour constitutional responsibility is somewhat presumptuous, to say the \nleast. I am aware--as we all are on both sides of the aisle--of the \nsometimes admirable but most times excessive obsession with secrecy on \nthe part of this administration. But notwithstanding that, we should \nnot forfeit our responsibility in order to accommodate that obsession.\n  I do not hold John Bolton accountable for this administration's \narrogance. John Bolton was gentleman enough to come see me. At the \nrequest of the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, who contacted me, I \nsaid I would be willing to sit with John Bolton last week and speak \nwith him about what we were seeking and why we were seeking it. I did \nthat. As a matter of fact, one of my colleagues, the Senator from \nConnecticut--although it wasn't his idea, and I caught him on the way \nto have dinner with his brother--was kind enough to come and sit with \nme and listen to John Bolton.\n  I believe Mr. Bolton would be prepared to give us this information. \nWhether that is true is, quite frankly, irrelevant, because the fact is \nwe both told Mr. Bolton this dispute about the documents is not about \nhim. I say to my colleague from Indiana, this is above his pay grade. \nHe indicated under oath in our committee hearing that he was willing to \nlet all of this information come forward. So I actually went to the \nextent of sitting with Mr. Bolton and suggesting how, as it related to \na matter on which I have been the lead horse--on Syria--we could \naccommodate an even further narrowing and detailing of the information \nwe are seeking and why.\n  Last month, after the Senate stood up for itself and rejected cloture \non the Bolton nomination, the Democratic leader and I both promised \npublicly--and today I pledge again--that once the administration \nprovides the information we have requested and information that no one \nthus far has suggested we are not entitled to--we will agree to vote up \nor down on the Bolton nomination.\n  At the outset, it should be emphasized that these are not--and I \nemphasize ``not''--new requests made at the 11th hour to attempt to \nderail a vote. Nobody is moving goalposts anywhere except closer, not \nfurther away.\n  The committee made these requests, the same two requests, back in \nApril. First, we requested materials relating to testimony on Syria and \nweapons of mass destruction prepared by Mr. Bolton and/or his staff in \nthe summer and fall of 2003.\n  We already know from senior CIA officials that Mr. Bolton sought to \nstretch the intelligence that was available on Syria's WMD program well \nbeyond what the intelligence would support.\n  We think the documents we are seeking will bolster the case that he \nrepeatedly sought to exaggerate intelligence data. Some who are \nlistening might say: Why is that important? Remember the context in the \nsummer of 2003. In the summer of 2003, there were assertions being made \nin various press accounts and by some ``outside'' experts and some \npositing the possibility that\n\n[[Page S6797]]\n\nthose weapons of mass destruction that turned out not to exist in Iraq \nhad been smuggled into Syria and that Syria had its own robust weapons \nof mass destruction program.\n  Remember, people were speculating about ``who is next?'' Newspaper \nheadlines and sub-headlines: Is Syria next? Syria was at the top of the \nlist--not the only one on the list. There was speculation, as I said, \nthat the weapons of mass destruction we could not find in Iraq had been \nsmuggled into Syria.\n  We know, at that same time, the CIA says Mr. Bolton was trying to \nstretch--stretch--the intelligence case against Syria on weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  The Syrian documents may also raise questions as to whether Mr. \nBolton, when he raised his hand and swore to tell the truth and nothing \nbut the truth, in fact may not have done that because he told the \nForeign Relations Committee that he was not in any way personally \ninvolved in preparing that testimony. The documents we seek would \ndetermine whether that was true or not. It may be true, but the \ndocuments will tell us.\n  Second, we have requested access to 10 National Security Agency \nintercepts. That means conversations picked up between a foreigner and \nan American, where they may have relevance to an intelligence inquiry \nand where the name of the foreigner is always listed, but it says \nspeaking to ``an American,'' or an American representing an American \nentity.\n  Mr. Bolton acknowledged, under oath, that he had sought--which is not \nunusual in the sense that it has never happened, but it is noteworthy--\nhe sought the identities of the Americans listed in 10 different \nintercepts.\n  When I asked him why he did that, he said intellectual curiosity and \nfor context. It is not a surprise to say--and I am not revealing \nanything confidential; I have not seen those intercepts--that there \nhave been assertions made by some to Members of the Senate and the \nstaff members of the Senate that Mr. Bolton was seeking the names of \nthese individuals for purposes of his intramural fights that were going \non within the administration about the direction of American foreign \npolicy. These requests resulted in Mr. Bolton being given the names of \n19 different individuals. Nineteen identities of Americans or American \ncompanies were on those intercepts.\n  Mr. Bolton has seen these intercepts. Mr. Bolton's staff has seen \nsome of these intercepts, but not a single Senator has seen the \nidentities of any of these Americans listed on the intercepts.\n  I might note, parenthetically, we suggested--I was reluctant to do \nit, but I agreed with the leader of my committee--that we would yield \nthat responsibility to the chairman and vice chair of the Intelligence \nCommittee. Later, the majority leader, in a genuine effort to try to \nresolve this issue, asked me what was needed. I said he should ask for \nthe names--not the chairman--he should ask for the names. He said he \ndid, and he said they would not give him the names either.\n  It has been alleged, as I said, that Mr. Bolton has been spying on \nrivals within the bureaucracy, both inferior and superior to him. While \nI doubt this, as I said publicly before, we have a duty to be sure that \nhe did not misuse this data.\n  The administration has argued that the Syrian testimony material is \nnot relevant to our inquiry. I simply leave it by saying that is an \noutrageous assertion. The administration may not decide what the Senate \nneeds in reviewing a nomination unless it claims Executive privilege or \na constitutional prohibition of a violation of separation of power. As \nmy grandfather and later my mother would say: Who died and left them \nboss? No rationale has been given for the testimony.\n  Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: How much time have I consumed?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority has just under 18 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have two colleagues who wish to speak. I \nwill be brief. We have narrowed the request of the documents. We \nnarrowed them on several different occasions. I am grateful to Chairman \nRoberts and Director Negroponte for accepting the principle that they \ncan cross-check names on the list we have with the list of names on the \nintercepts. But I hope everyone understands, as my friend from \nConnecticut will probably speak to, that in offering to provide a list \nof names, we were trying to make it easier. We were not trying to move \nthe goalposts; we were trying to make it closer for them.\n  The bottom line is, it is very easy to get this resolved. It is not \ninappropriate for me to say that I had a very good conversation not \nonly with Mr. Bolton but with Mr. Card, who indicated he was sure we \ncould resolve the Syrian piece of this. I indicated from the beginning \nthat was not sufficient. We had two requests for good reason: One \nrelating to intercepts and one relating to the Syrian matter. The \nSyrian matter is within striking distance of being resolved. I said in \ngood faith to him: Do not resolve that if you think that resolves the \nmatter, unless you are ready to resolve the matter of the issue \nrelating to Mr. Bolton and the intercepts.\n  Absent that material being made available, I urge my colleagues to \nreject cloture in the hope that the administration will finally step up \nto its constitutional responsibility of providing this information to \nus.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of actually voting \non John Bolton's nomination. I listened to my colleague's arguments, \nand I listened to the studious and accurate statement of the chairman \nof the Foreign Relations Committee regarding this long-debated, long-\nconsidered nomination.\n  The Senate has had this nomination for 5 months. Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations is a very important post. In fact, it is a very \nimportant position at this particular time, as democracy is on the \nmarch, as freedom is on the march throughout the world, whether in \nLebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, or elsewhere.\n  It is important also to note that even the United Nations recognizes \nthat it is time for reform. It is vitally important that the taxpayers \nof this country, who put in $2 billion every year into the United \nNations, ought to have a man such as John Bolton leading our efforts. \nJohn Bolton is a reformer, and that is why the President nominated him.\n\n  The President was elected by the people of this country. A President \nneeds to have the men and women he desires to effectuate his goals, his \npolicies, and to keep the promises he made to the people of this \ncountry.\n  This nomination has been held up through obstructionist tactics. I am \nhopeful that my colleagues will review the thorough and extensive \nvetting process. I am hoping that they will actually take off their \npolitical blinders and look at this nomination, look at the record of \nperformance, and look at all the evidence, all the charges, all the \nrefutations, and look at the facts regarding Mr. Bolton.\n  I think it is highly irresponsible for the Senate to keep obstructing \nreform of the United Nations. And, Mr. President, that is what is \nhappening. This obstruction of John Bolton's nomination, while a \npolitical effort, I suppose, in some people's point of view, clearly \ncould be characterized as obstructing reform of the United Nations. \nUntil we have our ambassador there with the strength and the support of \nthe Senate and the people of this country, we do not have someone \narguing for the American taxpayers, arguing for accountability, trying \nto stop the waste, the fraud, and the corruption in the United Nations.\n  We have gone through every germane argument and stretched allegation \nagainst John Bolton. Instead of talking about reforming the United \nNations, we have been on a fishing expedition. Every time on this \nfishing expedition we end up seeing a dry hole.\n  First, there was concern about his general views in saying the United \nNations needed to be reformed. Then the opposition recognized: Gosh, \nthe American people also think the United Nations needs reforming.\n  Then there was a great fixation and focus on the drafting of \nspeeches. And wasn't that very interesting, how speeches are crafted?\n  Then there was a worry about the sensibilities of some people being \noffended by John Bolton.\n  Then there was a worry about a woman--I forgot where it was,\n\n[[Page S6798]]\n\nKazakhstan or Moscow--that was refuted as not being a fact.\n  Then there was a concern about a speech that John Bolton gave where \nhe said that North Korea was a repressive dictatorship and that it was \na hellish nightmare to live in North Korea. That was supposedly \nterrible for him to say, when in fact that is a pretty good description \nof North Korea.\n  Then there were worries about Great Britain and what John Bolton \nmight have done with Great Britain. Within hours our British friends \nsaid: No, we had no problems whatsoever.\n  Then the other side said: We want a list of names; we want to see a \ncross-check, that request got to Senator Roberts and Senator \nRockefeller, the chair and cochair on the Intelligence Committee.\n  Then there were a few names cross-checked. There was nothing new \nthere. What comes up? Now we want 3 dozen names cross-checked as the \nfishing expedition continues.\n  Now there is a fixation, an interest in the crafting of testimony or \na speech dealing with Syria.\n  It is just going to continue and continue. It does not matter what \nthe answers are. It does not matter what the truth is. It does not \nmatter about the facts. What they want to do, unfortunately, is ignore \nthe dire need for reform in the United Nations. The opposition seems to \nwant to completely ignore John Bolton's qualifications and outstanding \nrecord of performance for the people of this country.\n  John Bolton has played a significant role in negotiating a number of \ntreaties that will result in reducing nuclear weapons, or keeping them \nfrom falling into the hands of rogue nations and terrorist \norganizations. His work on the Moscow Treaty will reduce by two-thirds \noperationally deployed nuclear weapons in both the United States and \nRussia.\n  John Bolton also led the U.S. negotiations to develop President \nBush's Proliferation Security Initiative, which garnered the support of \n60 countries. This Proliferation Security Initiative is an important \nsecurity measure to stop the shipment of weapons of mass destruction, \ntheir delivery systems, and related materials worldwide.\n  John Bolton also helped create the global partnership at the G8 \nsummit, which doubled the size of the nonproliferation effort in the \nformer Soviet Union. By committing our G8 partners to match the $1 \nbillion-per-year cooperative threat reduction of the United States, or \nas we call it here, the Nunn-Lugar program. John Bolton also has proven \nthat he can work well within the United Nations. He has previously \nserved as Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations, \nwhere he worked intensively on U.N. issues, including the repealing of \nthe offensive United Nations resolution which equated Zionism to \nracism. That is one of the reasons B'nai Brith supports his nomination.\n  John Bolton has the knowledge, the skills, the principles, and the \nexperience to be an exceptional ambassador to the United Nations. He \nhas the right, steady, and strong principles to lead the U.S. mission \nat a time when the United Nations is in desperate need of reform.\n  I believe the people of America do not want a lapdog as our \nambassador to the United Nations, they want a watchdog. They want to \nmake sure the billions of dollars we are sending to the United Nations \nis actually helping advance freedom; helping to build representative, \nfair, just, and free systems in countries that have long been \nrepressed. It is absolutely absurd and farcical that countries such as \nSyria, Zimbabwe, or other repressive regimes are on the Human Rights \nCommission. Even the United Nations recognizes they need reform. So \nthat is why the President has sent forth an individual, John Bolton, to \nbring this organization into account and reform it.\n  Whether it is fraud or corruption, this country does not think the \nUnited Nations ought to be placating or rewarding dictators and \noppressive tyrants. We have heard many absurd arguments since the \nPresident has sent John Bolton's nomination to the Senate 5 months ago. \nWhat my colleagues will see as they look at each and every one of these \ncharges as the process has dragged on, is that they are wild, they are \nunsubstantiated, or they have been proven false. Some claims against \nMr. Bolton have even been retracted.\n  This nomination has been considered for a long time. Throughout, new \ncharges have been made, and each time they do not stand up when placed \nin the accurate context or studied fully. They have been shown to be \nmisleading, exaggerated, false, or irrelevant.\n  This is the definition of a fishing expedition, and its sole goal is \nto bring down a nominee because of differing policy views. Many of \nthose are leading very articulately, even if I disagree with them, on \nthe Bolton nomination. The five leading most senior members of the \nForeign Relations Committee, who talked about speeches and offending \nsensibilities of people, they all were against Mr. Bolton in 2001 \nbefore any of these accusations arose. So this is just a continuation \nof that opposition.\n  I hope Senators the other side of the aisle who are refusing to bring \nthis issue to a close would note what Chairman Roberts noted, that they \nseem to be intent on preserving John Bolton's nomination as a way to \nembarrass our President.\n  The President was elected by the people of America. It is logical and \nit is important that our CEO, our President, be accorded the ability to \nbring in and to lead our efforts consistent with his principles, with \npeople who are loyal to those views, and who will effectuate those \ngoals.\n  There is little question that one of the most fair chairmen in this \nentire Senate is the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Lugar. He has negotiated \nin good faith on this issue. Unfortunately, time after time some on the \nother side keep moving the goalpost. I know they do not like that term, \nbut every time there is something answered, every time this gets ready \nfor a vote, there is always a new allegation, a new request, something \nelse to delay a vote on this nomination. Obstruction in this case, as \nin many others, has gone on for too long. It is time to vote on John \nBolton's nomination. The continued delaying tactics can only be viewed \nas obstructionism for petty partisan reasons.\n  This nomination has received inordinate scrutiny and review. Yet \nopponents of voting up or down continue to demand even more \ninformation. This position has been vacant for 5 months, we need to \nhave a conclusion. Mr. Bolton has an exemplary career in public \nservice. The extensive oversight that the Senate has undertaken in \nconsidering this nomination means that Senators ought to have the guts \nto get out of these cushy seats and vote yes or vote no. Anyone who \nvotes to continue to obstruct this nomination can be fairly \ncharacterized as delaying and obstructing the much needed, reforms in \nthe United Nations. And it is also contrary to the will of the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will cast my vote today in opposition \nto ending the debate on the nomination of John Bolton to be the U.S. \nAmbassador to the United Nations.\n  I am distressed the administration has not provided the Congress with \nthe documents it has requested that are essential for judging the \nquality of Mr. Bolton's performance in his past positions. When the \nPresident sends the Congress a request for approval of a nominee for a \ntop position, the President must be prepared to assist Congress in a \nthorough inspection of that individual's prior Government service. \nWithholding information needed by Congress, even classified information \nthat can be handled in a secure fashion, is detrimental to the \nsuccessful functioning of our Government. The administration's full \ncooperation with Congress is not optional, but essential.\n  If Mr. Bolton's nomination comes to the full Senate for a vote, I \nplan to vote no. I do not oppose him because of his skeptical view of \nthe UN. I do not oppose him because he believes the UN should be \nreformed. If the President wants to change U.S. policy toward the UN, \nhe has the right to choose an ambassador who will attempt to do so. The \nCongress should evaluate that nominee on his or her ability to do the \njob for which the individual has been selected.\n  I am opposing Mr. Bolton because his past record leads me to believe \nhe does not have the skills to do the job of Ambassador to the UN. As \nthe second-ranking foreign policy job in any administration, it is very \nimportant that\n\n[[Page S6799]]\n\nthis job be done right. My review of his prior experience leads me to \nconclude that Mr. Bolton is not a man who builds consensus, who \nappreciates consensus, or who abides by consensus. No matter what one \nthinks of the UN's performance, or how its functionality and mission \nought to be reformed, one must be able to build support among our \nallies in order to effect change. As we have seen, nothing is \naccomplished at the UN by banging one's shoe on the podium. The work of \nthe UN requires respect for national differences, searching for common \nground, and development of consensus on what actions must be taken. It \nwould be irresponsible to approve a UN ambassador who is not capable of \nperforming these tasks.\n  The record shows that on occasion when his personal beliefs clashed \nwith administration policy, Mr. Bolton has not hesitated to take \nmatters into his own hands, to misuse secret materials, to threaten \nFederal employees with personal retribution and to endanger national \nsecurity in order to advance his own view of a situation. This is not \nwho we should be sending to the UN as our chief representative. We can, \nand we must, do better by an institution that should be an important \npart of a successful American foreign policy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield 6 minutes on my time, and I am told the \ndistinguished Senator from California has 5 minutes of leader time. I \nyield to the Senator from California.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware has 16 \nminutes in total remaining.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nis equally divided until 6. Extending the time past 6 would take a \nunanimous consent request.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Senator Reid gave me 5 minutes of his leader time, and I \nask unanimous consent that I might add that to my 6 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield 6 minutes on my time to the distinguished Senator \nfrom California.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think we need to take a deep breath and \na reality check. All this talk from Senator Allen about how \nobstructionist the Democrats are being--now, here is the truth: The \nRepublicans run the Foreign Relations Committee. They did not even have \nthe votes to vote John Bolton out of that committee and bring it to the \nfloor with a positive recommendation.\n  This is a very divisive and controversial nomination. Since 1945, the \nSenate has confirmed 24 men and women to serve as U.N. ambassador. \nNever before has any President of either party made such a divisive and \ncontroversial nomination. In 60 years, only two nominees have had a \nsingle Senator cast a ``no'' vote against them. Andrew Young was one. \nHe was confirmed 89 to 3 in 1977, and Richard Holbrooke was confirmed \n81 to 16 in 1999. Every other time the nominee has been approved \nunanimously. I long for those days.\n  This is a President who said he wanted to be a uniter, not a divider. \nYet in light of all the controversy, he sticks with this nominee. The \nfact is, 102 former diplomats, both Republican and Democrat, signed a \nletter opposing John Bolton. They wrote that his past activities and \nstatements indicate conclusively that he is the wrong man for this \nposition at a time when the U.N. is entering a critically important \nphase of democratic reforms.\n  Senator Voinovich said it well, and he is a Republican. He is a \nmember of the committee. He said: Frankly, I am concerned that Mr. \nBolton would make it more difficult for us to achieve the badly needed \nreforms we need.\n  John Bolton has said that there is no United Nations. He has said if \nthe U.N. Secretariat Building in New York lost 10 floors, it would not \nmake a bit of difference. How does someone with that attitude get the \nrespect required to bring the reforms?\n  As we know, today is not about whether Senators should vote for or \nagainst John Bolton. Today is a different vote. It is a vote as to \nwhether the Senate deserves, on behalf of the American people, to get \nthe information that Senators Biden and Dodd have taken the lead in \nasking for. By the way, Senator Lugar, at one point in time, had signed \nsome of those letters requesting the information.\n  Why is this important? It is important because every Senator is going \nto decide whether to vote up or down on Mr. Bolton. We need to know \nwhat this information will show. Yes, as Senator Biden has said, we get \nthe information, we schedule a vote. But we will look at the \ninformation. What if the information shows that, in fact, John Bolton \nwas trying to spy on other Americans with whom he had an ax to grind? \nWhat if the information shows that John Bolton did not tell the truth \nto the committee and that he had written a speech about Syria which was \nmisleading and which could have, in many ways, made that drumbeat for \nwar against Syria much louder than it was?\n  There is a third piece of information that Senators Dodd and Biden \ndid not think was that important, but I still think is important and we \nhave asked for, which is the fact that Mr. Bolton has an assistant, \nsomeone he has hired, who has outside clients so that while he, Mr. \nMatthew Friedman, is getting paid with taxpayer dollars, he has outside \nclients.\n  Who are these outside clients? We cannot find out. We called Mr. \nFriedman's office. The secretary answered. This is a private office, \nhis private business, and she said: Oh, yes, he is here. He will be \nright with you.\n  Then, upon finding out it was my office, suddenly Mr. Friedman was \nnowhere to be found and has not returned the call.\n  I represent the largest State in the Union. Believe me, it is a \ndiverse State. We have conservatives and liberals and everything in \nbetween. We have every political party represented there, and many \nindependent voters. But they all want me to be able to make an informed \ndecision. This information is very important. Therefore, I think \ntoday's vote is crucial.\n  There is one more point I would like to make.\n  Mr. President, I ask how much time I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. This is the point. When we had the whole debate over a \njudge a long time ago, a judge named Richard Paez, at that time Dr. \nFrist, Senator Frist supported the filibuster against Judge Paez. What \nhe said in explaining his vote was it is totally appropriate to have a \ncloture vote--as we are going to do today--when you are seeking \ninformation. That is totally appropriate.\n  I have the exact quote here, and I would like to read it. He said:\n\n       Cloture, to get more information, is legitimate.\n\n  I agree with Senator Frist. It is legitimate to hold out on an up-or-\ndown vote, to stand up for the rights of the American people and the \ninformation they deserve to have through us.\n  I thank Senator Dodd and Senator Biden for their leadership, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time under my \ncontrol to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut has 9 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Delaware, as well \nas my colleague from California for her comments. Let me say to the \ndistinguished chairman of our committee, I know this has been a long \nordeal, now going up to 2 months that this nomination has been before \nus. No one, except possibly the chairman of the committee, would like \nthis matter to be terminated sooner rather than later more than I \nwould. I am sure the Senator from Delaware feels similarly, as I know \nmy colleague from California does as well.\n  But there is an important issue before this body that transcends the \nnomination of the individual before us. That is whether as an \ninstitution we have a right to certain information pertaining to the \nmatter before us. Certainly the matter that we have requested--Senator \nBiden has and I have--regarding this nomination is directly on point \nwhen it comes to the qualities of this nominee.\n\n[[Page S6800]]\n\n  For nearly a month since our May 26th cloture vote on this \nnomination, the administration has stonewalled our efforts to get the \nadditional information we believe the Senate should have to make an \ninformed judgment on this nomination.\n  Senator Biden and I have attempted to reach an accommodation with the \nadministration on the two areas of our inquiry--draft testimony and \nrelated documents concerning Syria's weapons of mass destruction \ncapabilities and the nineteen names contained in ten National Security \nAgency intercepts which Mr. Bolton requested and was provided during \nhis tenure as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security. Senator Biden has narrowed the scope of his \nrequest related to Syria. I have offered to submit a list of names of \nconcern related to the NSA intercepts to be cross checked by director \nNegroponte against the list of names provided to Mr. Bolton.\n  I am very puzzled, Mr. President, by the intransigent position that \nthe administration has taken, particularly with respect to the \nintercept matter.\n  If the intercepts are ``pure vanilla'' as our colleague, Senator \nRoberts, has described them, then why does the administration continue \nto withhold the information from the Senate?\n  The answer is we don't know.\n  Was Mr. Bolton using the information from the intercepts to track \nwhat other officials were doing in policy areas he disagreed with?\n  Or was he simply utilizing the information in the normal course of \ncarrying out his responsibilities?\n  Again, we don't know.\n  Under ordinary circumstances, I would not be inquiring whether a \nState Department official had sought access to sensitive intelligence \nfor anything other than official purposes.\n  But we know from the Foreign Relations Committee investigation of \nthis nominee--from interviews of individuals who served with Mr. Bolton \nin the Bush administration--that Mr. Bolton's conduct while at the \nState Department was anything but ordinary.\n  We learned how Mr. Bolton harnessed an abusive management style to \nattempt to alter intelligence judgments and to stifle the consideration \nof alternative policy options--all in furtherance of his own personal \nideological agenda.\n  According to a story that appeared in today's Washington Post, we now \nknow that Mr. Bolton's machinations weren't limited to Cuba or Syria \nweapons of mass destruction. It would seem he was the ``Mr. No'' of the \nDepartment on a wide variety of policy initiatives, acting as a major \nroadblock to progress on such important initiatives as U.S.-Russian \ncooperative nuclear threat reduction.\n  Mr. Bolton has done a disservice to the Bush administration and to \nthe American people by putting his agenda ahead of the interests of the \nadministration and the American people.\n  It is not only that he had his own agenda that is problematic. It is \nthe manner in which he sought to advance that agenda by imposing his \njudgments on members of the intelligence community and threatening to \ndestroy the careers of those with the temerity to resist his demands to \nalter their intelligence judgments.\n  In so doing, he breached the firewall between intelligence and policy \nwhich must be sacrosanct to protect U.S. foreign policy and national \nsecurity interests.\n  That is not to say there should not be a vibrant and healthy \ndisagreement where one exists. There ought to be, in fact, more \ndisagreements where these matters have caused friction. But the idea \nthat you would allow that friction, those disagreements to transcend \nthe firewall where you would then seek to have people dismissed from \ntheir jobs because you disagreed with their conclusions, that goes too \nfar. Mr. Bolton went to far and for those reasons, in my view, does not \ndeserve to be the confirmed nominee as ambassador to the United \nNations. That fact is painfully clear to all Americans following the \nserious and dangerous intelligence failures related to Iraqi weapons of \nmass destruction.\n\n  We know that Mr. Bolton's efforts to manipulate intelligence wasn't \nsome anomaly because he was having a bad day. The entire intelligence \ncommunity knew of his reputation.\n  We were fortunate to have individuals, like Dean Hutchings, Chairman \nof the National Intelligence Council from 2003-2005, who disapproved of \nand resisted Bolton's efforts to cherry pick intelligence.\n  We also know that Mr. Bolton needed adult supervision to ensure that \nhis speeches and testimony were consistent with administration policy. \nDeputy Secretary Armitage took it upon himself to personally oversee \nall of Mr. Bolton's public pronouncements to ensure that he stayed on \nthe reservation.\n  Is this really the kind of performance we want to reward by \nconfirming this individual to the position of United States \nRepresentative to the United Nations?\n  Is Mr. Bolton the kind of individual who we can trust to carry out \nthe United States agenda at the United Nations at this critical \njuncture?\n  I think not.\n  We all know that these are difficult times. Our responsibilities in \nIraq and Afghanistan are significant and costly. Other challenges to \ninternational peace and stability loom large on the horizon: Iran, \nNorth Korea, Middle East Peace. Humanitarian crises in Africa and Asia \ncry out for attention.\n  The United States can not solve all these problems unilaterally. We \nneed international assistance and cooperation to address them. And the \nlogical focal point for developing that international support is the \nUnited Nations.\n  But international support will not automatically be forthcoming.\n  It will take real leadership at the United Nations to build the case \nfor such cooperation. That United States leadership must necessarily be \nembodied in the individual that serves as the United States Ambassador \nto the United Nations. Based on what I know today about Mr. Bolton, I \nbelieve he is incapable of demonstrating that kind of leadership.\n  The United States Ambassador to the United Nations is an important \nposition. The individual who assumes this position is necessarily the \nface of our country before the United Nations.\n  For all of the reasons I have cited--Mr. Bolton's management style, \nhis attack on the intelligence community, his tunnel vision, his lack \nof diplomatic temperament--I do not believe that he is the man to be \nthat face at the United Nations.\n  I hope that when it comes time for an up or down vote on Mr. Bolton \nthat my colleagues will join me in opposing this nominee.\n  But this afternoon's vote is about who determines how the Senate will \ndischarge its constitutional duties related to nominations. Will the \nexecutive branch tell this body what is relevant or not relevant with \nrespect to its deliberations on nominations? Or will the Senate make \nthat determination?\n  If you believe as I do that the Senate is entitled to access to \ninformation that is so clearly relevant in the case of the Bolton \nnomination, then I would respectfully ask you to join Senator Biden and \nme in voting against cloture.\n  But this vote isn't just about the nomination of Mr. Bolton, it is \nalso about setting a precedent for future requests by the Senate of the \nexecutive on a whole host of other issues that may come before us--in \nthis administration and in future administrations.\n  For that reason I strongly urge all of our colleagues to support us \nin sending the right signal to the administration by voting no on \ncloture when it occurs at 6 p.m.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, having listened to my Democrat colleagues \ndiscuss the Bolton nomination last week, I very briefly come to the \nfloor to set the record straight.\n  The plain, simple truth is that some on the other side of the aisle \nare obstructing a highly qualified nominee and, I believe, by not \nallowing him to\n\n[[Page S6801]]\n\nassume this position yet, are doing harm to our country. I say that \nbecause John Bolton has a long record of successfully serving his \ncountry. He has been confirmed by this body no fewer than four times.\n  We have had 12 hours of committee hearings, 23 meetings with \nSenators, 31 interviews conducted by the staff of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, and 157 questions for the record submitted by \nmembers of the committee. The committee has had nearly 500 pages of \ndocuments from State and USAID. After reviewing thousands of pages of \nmaterial, the intelligence community has provided over 125 pages of \ndocuments to the Foreign Relations Committee. The nominee has had 2 \ndays of floor debate. The list goes on and on.\n  The chair and vice chair of the Intelligence Committee have both \nreviewed the NSA intercepts. Both have concluded that there is nothing \nthere of concern.\n  I am satisfied with their conclusions, and I am satisfied that the \nprerogatives of the Senate have been respected.\n  I have been more than willing to try and reach a fair accommodation \nwith Senators Dodd and Biden, but the goal posts keep moving from a \nhandful of names to now, three dozen. What is going on here looks and \nsmells like a fishing expedition.\n  I supported Senator Roberts' initiative last week to strike a \ncompromise. 1t made sense. It fairly and appropriately allowed the \nDirector of National Intelligence to review names.\n  The names Senator Roberts vetted with the DNI were taken straight \nfrom the minority report of the Foreign Relations Committee. They are \nalso names of persons that were raised by Senator Dodd and Senator \nBiden during committee hearings and deliberations.\n  The fact that none of these names was in any of the 10 intercepts \nconfirms what Senator Roberts and Senator Rockefeller have said \npreviously. John Bolton did nothing improper in requesting these \nintercepts, and there is no reason for concern.\n  Last week, Senator Dodd and Senator Biden stated again that they \nwanted to see earlier drafts of Secretary Bolton's 2003 Syria testimony \nbefore the House.\n  I don't believe those documents are necessary, because what really \nmatters is the final draft.\n  That said, I have been working with the White House to make this \nhappen, and to give Senator Dodd and Senator Biden a chance to review \nthese documents.\n  What is important is to get this process moving, to give John Bolton \na fair up-or-down vote, and to get our Ambassador to the U.N.\n  We will find out today if that will happen and if Members will do \nwhat is right for our country or if pointless obstruction will continue \nto stymie the process and damage America's foreign affairs.\n  The United States has not had an ambassador at the U.N. for over 5 \nmonths now. It is time to stop the grandstanding and give this nominee \na vote.\n  John Bolton is a smart, principled, and straightforward man who will \neffectively articulate the President's policies on the world stage.\n  We need a person with Under Secretary Bolton's proven track record of \ndetermination and success to cut through the thick and tangled \nbureaucracy that has mired the United Nations in scandal and \ninefficiency.\n  It is no accident that polling shows that most Americans have a dim \nview of the United Nations. In recent months, we have seen multiple \nnegative reports about the world body.\n  We now know that Saddam Hussein stole an estimated $10 billion \nthrough the Oil-for-Food Program. The U.N. official who ran the \noperation stands accused of taking kickbacks, along with other \nofficials.\n  Last month, the head of the Iraq Survey Group told the Council on \nForeign Relations that as a result of the Oil-for-Food corruption, \nSaddam came to believe he could divide the U.N. Security Council and \nbring an end to sanctions.\n  He did divide us, but he didn't stop us.\n  The U.N. failed to stop the genocide in Rwanda in the 1990s. The U.N. \nnow seems to be repeating that mistake in Darfur.\n  In the Congo, there are numerous allegations that U.N. peacekeepers \nhave committed sexual abuse against the innocent, female war victims \nthey were sent to protect.\n  Meanwhile, the U.N.'s Human Rights Commission, which is charged with \nprotecting our human rights, includes such human rights abusers as \nLibya, Cuba, Zimbabwe, and Sudan.\n  These failures are very real and very discouraging. They can be \nmeasured in lives lost and billions of dollars stolen. And they can be \nmeasured in the sinking regard for an organization that should be held \nin some esteem.\n  America sends the United Nations $2 billion per year. Our \ncontribution makes up 22 percent of its budget. We provide an even \nlarger percentage for peacekeeping and other U.N. activities. It is no \nsurprise that Americans are calling out for reform.\n  John Bolton is the President's choice to lead that effort. He \npossesses deep and extensive knowledge of the United Nations and has, \nfor many years, been committed to its reform\n  Under Secretary Bolton has the confidence of the President and the \nSecretary of State, and it is to them he will directly report.\n  As Senator Lugar has pointed out, Under Secretary Bolton has served 4 \nyears in a key position that technically outranks the post for which he \nis now being considered.\n  This is a critical time for the United States and for the world. \nBecause of the President's vision and commitment, democracy is on the \nmarch around the globe. The United Nations can and should play a \ncentral role in advancing these developments.\n  I believe in the U.N.'s potential if it is reformed and more rightly \nfocused. It has been an important forum for peace and dialogue. And, \nlike the President, I believe that an effective United Nations is in \nAmerica's interest.\n  As we all know, there has been one cloture vote. Tonight, in a few \nminutes, we will have that second cloture vote.\n  Mr. President, John Bolton is the right man to represent us in the \nUnited Nations. He is a straight shooter, a man of integrity. He is \nexactly what we need at this time in the United Nations. He is exactly \nwhat the United Nations needs from us. A vote for John Bolton is a vote \nfor change there. A vote for John Bolton is a vote for reform there. We \nhave had dilatory tactics and obstructionism that has been thinly \nveiled in words of ``Senate prerogative.'' John Bolton deserves a vote, \nand the American people deserve a strong, principled voice in the \nUnited Nations.\n  Mr. President, I encourage our colleagues to vote for cloture tonight \nbecause John Bolton deserves an up-or-down vote as the nominee to the \nUnited Nations ambassadorship.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the motion to proceed to the motion to \nreconsider the failed cloture vote on this nomination is agreed to, the \nmotion to reconsider the failed cloture vote is agreed to, and the \nSenate will proceed to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the \nnomination.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Under the previous order, the clerk will report the motion to invoke \ncloture.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Executive \n     Calendar No. 103:\n         William Frist, Richard Lugar, Richard Burr, Pat Roberts, \n           Mitch McConnell, Jeff Sessions, Wayne Allard, Jon Kyl, \n           Jim DeMint, David Vitter, Richard Shelby, Lindsey \n           Graham, John Ensign, Pete Domenici, Robert Bennett, Mel \n           Martinez, George Allen.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 783\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 783.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is set aside. \nThe clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Martinez], for Mr. Nelson of \n     Florida, for himself, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Corzine, Mrs. Boxer, \n     Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Dole, and Mr. \n     Burr, proposes an amendment numbered 783.\n\n(Purpose: To strike the section providing for a comprehensive inventory \n       of outer Continental Shelf oil and natural gas resources)\n\n       Beginning on page 264, strike line 1 and all that follows \n     through page 265, line 12.\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ, Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity that the \nchairman, Senator Domenici, the ranking member, Senator Bingaman, and \nother members have given me to work on this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I came late to the work of this committee on this bill, having joined \nthe Senate just this year. Much of the work had previously been done.\n  As the chairman himself has said, this bill will make a real \ndifference in America's energy landscape.\n  I must tell my colleagues that I want to vote for this bill. I think \nit contains a lot of what this Nation needs.\n  I have grave reservations about one particular provision that calls \nfor an inventory of the resources off this Nation's outer continental \nshelf.\n  It is for this reason that I rise today to oppose the inventory, \noffer an amendment to strike the inventory language, and ask for the \nsupport of my colleagues. The inventory language is opposed by both \nSenators from Florida and a number of coastal State Senators because it \nopens the door to the development of offshore drilling.\n  In my State of Florida, such an inventory off our coastlines would \ntake place entirely within a Federal moratorium that bans offshore \ndrilling.\n  I oppose the inventory because it encroaches on an area off of \nFlorida's coast that we expect will remain under that drilling ban in \nperpetuity.\n  My colleagues should be aware that this proposed inventory will cost \nin excess of a billion dollars and the result will tell us much of what \nwe already know.\n  I am asking my colleagues to strike the proposed inventory language \ncontained in this bill and protect the rights of States that have no \ninterest in drilling off their shores.\n  This provision offered by my colleague, Mr. Senator Landrieu of \nLouisiana, proposes to require a ``seismic survey inventory'' of all \nouter continental shelf areas, including within sensitive coastal \nwaters long-protected from all such invasive activities by the 24-year \nbipartisan congressional moratorium.\n  I opposed this amendment in committee because it contains something \nwe in Florida don't want and it opens the door to a number of problems, \nenvironmental problems, economic problems, and unnecessary challenges \nfor our military.\n  Why would we inventory an area where we are never going to drill?\n  The inventory is a huge problem for Florida. It tantalizes pro-\ndrilling interests. It basically puts the State at risk.\n  I have received assurances from my friends on the other side of this \nissue that States such as Florida, States that do not want drilling on \ntheir coast, will not have to do it. Fine. That is Florida's position.\n  I can clearly state that we do not want drilling now, and I do not \nsee a scenario anywhere on the horizon where we would change that \nposition. So why, given our objection to drilling, would we spend the \nresources, more than a billion dollars, and damage the environment in \nthe eastern planning zone to do this inventory? I would also say to my \ncolleagues that an inventory is not a benign thing.\n  Seismic surveys involve extensive acoustic disruption to marine \necosystems and fisheries. Recent scientific studies have documented \npreviously-unknown impacts from the millions of high-intensity airgun \nimpulses used in such inventories. These sudden, repetitive explosions \nbring about a potential for harm that is simply too great.\n  Seismic surveys are an invasive procedure, inappropriate for \nsensitive marine areas and economically important fishing grounds.\n  And if one looks at the cost of this inventory, the Minerals \nManagement Service reports that using the most up-to-date technology to \nperform an inventory of this magnitude will cost between $75 million \nand $125 million for each frontier planning area. Nowhere in this \nlegislation can I find a section that suggests how we recoup the cost \nof such an inventory.\n  So I ask my colleagues to strike the inventory. Going forward will \nencroach upon our coastal waters, waters covered by a drilling ban, and \nwould do little more than act as enticement to oil companies that want \nour drilling moratorium lifted.\n  Last year, more than 74 million people visited Florida to enjoy its \ncoastline, its wonderful climate, its excellent fishing. Families \nreturn year after\n\n[[Page S6803]]\n\nyear to their favorite vacation spots to relax under our brilliant blue \nskies, our powdery white beaches, and our crystal-clear emerald waters.\n  The people of Florida share a love and appreciation of the Atlantic \nOcean and the Gulf of Mexico, its coastal habitat and our wetlands, \nwhich make a very complex ecosystem, and also a very special place to \nlive.\n  I share these facts for one reason: The people of Florida are \nconcerned their coastal waters are coming under increased pressure to \nexploit possible oil and gas resources. The people of Florida do not \nwant that to happen. Floridians are adamantly opposed to oil and gas \nexploration off our coastal waters. We have very serious concerns that \noffshore exploration will weaken the protections we have built over \nthese many years. The inventory is but a foot in the door; it seriously \nthreatens marine wildlife and the coastal habitat off the coast of \nFlorida.\n  One other area of concern that perhaps has not been highlighted \nenough and I know my colleague from Florida shares my view, is that it \nhas a tremendous impact on military uses of waters off Florida to \nconduct extensive training and testing. For whatever time it would take \nto conduct an inventory off our coastline, it would be the exact amount \nof time our military will be put at a disadvantage.\n  We must afford our military the most and best training possible for \nbattle preparedness. Vieques used to give our men and women that \ncapability. Now that Vieques is closed, Florida's Panhandle plays an \nincreasingly significant role. Oil and gas exploration would have the \npotential to halt that important work for an indefinite period of time.\n  Here are just some of the current missions using our section of the \nGulf: F-15 combat crew training; F-22 combat crew training; Navy cruise \nmissile exercises; special forces training; carrier battle group \ntraining; composite and joint force training exercises; air-to-surface \nweapons testing; surface-to-air weapons testing; and mine warfare \ntesting.\n  Any military mind knows that it takes months to schedule training \nopportunities when joint operations are involved. If we were to \ncontinue on this path of mandating an inventory in Florida's waters, we \ncould bring a halt to a number of important exercises.\n  In fact, one of the main reasons the military uses this area so \nextensively is due to the protections currently in place. Here is what \nMG Michael Kostelnik, the base commander of Eglin Air Force Base, said \nin May of 2000:\n\n       We continue to place the most severe restrictions in the \n     eastern portion of the proposed sale area where oil and gas \n     operations would be incompatible with military training and \n     testing operations.\n\n  If we allow exploration there now, the military will suffer a setback \nin their training and preparedness.\n  As many of my colleagues know, Senator Nelson and I are working \ntogether to engage a coalition of Senators to help beat back any \nefforts to encroach upon our coastal waters. I am proud to say in doing \nso I follow in the footsteps of our predecessors, former Senators \nConnie Mack and Bob Graham, and a bipartisan Florida delegation, in our \nfirm opposition to drilling off our coasts.\n  Let me again take a moment to praise Chairman Domenici and Ranking \nMember Bingaman for putting together a comprehensive, bipartisan, and \nsignificant energy policy that is forward looking, forward thinking, \nand a road map of where we as a Nation need to go in order to address \nthe challenges that confront us today.\n  The problem is that this inventory language is a bad provision in a \ngood bill. I cannot emphasize enough how damaging this will be to \nFlorida, other coastal States, and our military training and testing \noperations in the Gulf. The inventory will have a chilling affect on \nall of these interests.\n  The amendment I offer here tonight is simple in that it strikes the \nlanguage requiring a ``seismic survey inventory'' of all outer \ncontinental shelf areas. I believe striking this language makes the \noverall bill stronger and I ask for my colleagues to support such an \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague \nfrom Florida, as we have introduced this amendment to strike the \nportion of the Energy bill that would set up an inventory on the Outer \nContinental Shelf.\n  I want to show how extensive this inventory is going to be. The Outer \nContinental Shelf is all of the west coast of the United States, the \nPacific coast, the area in yellow off the coast of Washington, Oregon, \nand California. All of that area would be subject to the inventory. All \nof this area in the Gulf of Mexico is presently covered by the \nmoratorium about which Senator Martinez and I fought very hard last \nweek to get an agreement from the two leaders and managers of the bill \nthat they would not come in and support any amendments that would offer \ndrilling in the Gulf of Mexico off Florida.\n  But look at the Outer Continental Shelf. It extends from Maine all \nthe way down to Florida. We are talking about a huge area that would be \ninventoried. That sounds innocent enough, but let me tell you why I \noppose it. I oppose it because it is unnecessary unless you are \npreparing to drill in areas off our coast that are currently subject to \nthis moratorium; otherwise, why would we want to take an inventory if \nall of this Outer Continental Shelf is now under a moratorium so you \ncannot drill for oil and gas?\n  I oppose it also because it is harmful to marine life and commercial \nfish, and the Minerals Management Service already conducts inventories \nof the economically recoverable oil and gas reserves on the Outer \nContinental Shelf, including moratoria areas, every 5 years. In fact, \nthe MMS will complete its next inventory this summer. Its last \ninventory came out in the year 2000. If that is the case, why do we \nneed another inventory? How is the inventory in this bill different \nfrom the one that is already in effect? Two words: seismic exploration.\n  What is seismic exploration--in other words, what they call survey? \nIt is an expensive, invasive, and harmful practice used by oil and gas \ncompanies to determine where to drill. Why doesn't MMS use seismic \nexploration currently to complete their inventory? Because it is too \ncostly and it is considered a precursor to drilling.\n  If you are not going to drill, you should not be spending hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to tell you where to put the drill. MMS estimates \nthat these surveys would cost between $75 million and $125 million for \neach of the planning areas. Remember, in the Outer Continental Shelf, \nthere are nine planning areas. At $75 million to $125 million apiece \nfor seismic exploration, that means we would be having MMS spend $675 \nmillion to $1 billion to survey our moratorium areas, areas on our \ncoastline that are under a moratorium until the year 2012, pursuant to \na Presidential directive.\n  Let me tell you a little bit about what seismic exploration and \nsurveying is. Oil and gas companies use seismic air guns. They are \nlong, submersible cannons that are towed behind boats in arrays, firing \nshots of compressed air into the water every 10 seconds. Interestingly, \nthese air guns have replaced dynamite as the industry's primary method \nof exploration. But they create sound rivaling that of dynamite. A \nlarge seismic array can produce peak pressures of sound that are higher \nthan virtually any other manmade source, save for explosives like \ndynamite--over 250 decibels.\n  The oil and gas industry typically conducts several seismic surveys \nover the life of their offshore leases. They use these seismic surveys \nto determine the best placement of oil rigs and pipelines and to track \nfluid flows within the reservoirs. Seismic surveys are massive, \ncovering vast areas of the ocean, with thousands of blasts going off \nevery few seconds, in some cases over the course of days, weeks, \nmonths. The arrays towed by boats consist of 12 to 48 individual air \nguns, synchronized to create a simultaneous pulse of sound outputting a \ntotal of 3,000 to 8,000 cubic inches of air per shot. The sounds are so \npowerful because the array is attempting to generate echoes from each \nof several geologic boundary layers at the bottom of the ocean. Echoes \nproduced by these seismic impulses are recorded, and they are analyzed \nby oil and gas companies to provide information on the subsurface \ngeological features.\n\n[[Page S6804]]\n\n  The noise pollution from these tests can literally be heard across \noceans. If the sea floor is hard and rocky, the noise might be heard \nfor thousands of miles. And the sound can mask the calls of whales and \nother animals that rely on the acoustic environment to breed and \nsurvive. Scientists are documenting more and more problems associated \nwith the seismic surveys. Whales, dolphins, fish, sea turtles, and \nsquid have all been impacted adversely by the seismic activity. I sure \nwould not want to be a scuba diver in the water with one of these \nseismic blasts going off.\n  The 2004 International Whaling Commission's Scientific Committee, one \nof the most well-respected bodies of whale biologists in the world, \nconcluded that increased sound from seismic surveys was a ``cause for \nconcern'' because there is a growing body of evidence that seismic \npulses kill, injure, and disturb marine life.\n  The impacts range from strandings to temporary or permanent hearing \nloss, to abandonment of habitat and disruption of vital behaviors such \nas mating and feeding.\n  Studies have also shown substantial impacts on commercial species of \nfish. Fishermen, beware. One series of studies demonstrated that air \nguns caused extensive and apparently irreversible damage to the inner \nears of snapper, and the snapper were several kilometers from the \nseismic surveys.\n  The scientific community is not the one that is raising the alarm \nbells. Courts and governments are starting to realize the dangers posed \nby seismic exploration. In 2002, a California Federal court stopped a \ngeologic research project in the Sea of Cortez, when two beaked whales \nwere found dead with an undeniable link to the seismic activity.\n  The Canadian Government slowed a geologic project off its west coast \nand is looking closely at an oil and gas seismic survey off Cape Breton \nas a result of dangers posed by the surveys.\n  The Australian Government refused to issue permits for a survey near \na marine park because the proponents of the survey could not prove it \nwould not harm the marine park.\n  And the Bermuda Government refused to issue a permit for seismic \ngeologic surveys off its coast, citing concerns for impacts on marine \nmammals.\n  Air gun activity associated with seismic surveys must be considered \nan invasive procedure, inappropriate for sensitive marine areas and \neconomically important commercial fishing grounds.\n  We have to continue to remember that the United States has 3 percent \nof the world's oil reserves.\n  Yet the United States uses four times more oil than any other nation, \naccording to the report from the National Commission on Energy Policy. \nAccording to Alan Greenspan in a speech he gave in April of this year, \nthe 200 million personal vehicles currently on the U.S. highways \nconsume 11 percent of the total world oil production. We cannot drill \nour way to energy independence.\n  Spending hundreds of millions of dollars on harmful exploration in \nareas whose economic livelihood depends on their fishing industry and \ntheir marine ecosystem could have devastating effects.\n  For these reasons, I must oppose this invasive, duplicative, and \nharmful exploration on the moratoria areas on the Outer Continental \nShelf.\n  The bottom line is, if you have the Outer Continental Shelf under \nmoratoria, why do we need to try to inventory all of that if you are \nnot supposed to have any drilling under Presidential directive at least \nuntil the year 2012? Why go in with the risk to Mother Nature with this \nkind of seismic exploration?\n  I yield to my colleague from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. If the Senator will yield, I wonder if in any part of \nthis bill the Senator noticed any area that would denote how the $1 \nbillion, the cost of exploration, would be paid for?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. That is an excellent question. If you are \ngoing to do the seismic exploration which this bill would allow in the \nnine areas under the moratoria, it is going to cost between $650 \nmillion and $1 billion. In a Congress that is so concerned about budget \ndeficits to the tune of almost half a trillion a year, where are we \ngoing to get that kind of money?\n  The Senator's point is well taken. I thank my colleague from Florida \nfor making that point.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. A further question: It seems to me, when we have a \nmoratoria, drilling is prohibited right now. To do this inventory in \nthat particular area, it certainly seems to me to be a waste of \ntaxpayer dollars since there is no prospect of drilling with the \ncongressional and Presidential moratoriums in place.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator is correct. Since a President of \nthe United States established this moratorium on the Outer Continental \nShelf and it is to run to 2012, why do we need to be spending money on \nseismic surveying on an area that is off limits to drilling, which the \nmoratorium has in place until the year 2012?\n  I thank the Senator for joining to offer this amendment. I ask the \nSenate to consider helping continue to preserve the moratorium.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are on the eve of a turning point in \nthe energy future of our country. As we move closer to voting on a \ncomprehensive energy bill, we have a truly historic opportunity to \ntransform the way we think about energy. We have an opportunity to make \na decisive step away from dependence on foreign imports and fossil \nfuels and toward an independent future based on the abundant natural \nhuman and technological resources found right here within our borders.\n  As we wean ourselves from the oil fields of the unstable Middle East \nand other parts of the world and rely increasingly on field crops and \nfuel cells produced in America's heartland, we will build an energy \nfuture that will make us more secure and a future of which we can be \nproud.\n  This is the bottom line. When we talk about moving toward energy \nindependence in this country, we are talking primarily about reducing \nAmerica's dependence on imported oil. Petroleum accounts for more than \n85 percent of our energy imports. As everyone is acutely aware, much of \nthe 85 percent comes from some of the world's most unstable and, in \nsome cases, openly hostile countries.\n  Today, rising global demand for petroleum is driving prices for \ngasoline and home heating oil to record levels. This year, China passed \nJapan as the world's second largest consumer of energy. China's use of \noil is expected to grow exponentially over the next few years. So the \nfocus of any national energy strategy must be to reduce our dependence \non foreign oil in a sustainable way and as rapidly as possible.\n  By far, the largest use of petroleum in this country is in the \ntransportation sector, and 97 percent of today's transportation fuel \ncomes from petroleum. Thankfully, we know the solution. It is \ntechnologically feasible. We need to build vehicles that use less \ngasoline or no gasoline, and we need to make an aggressive transition \nto clean, renewable domestic fuels such as ethanol, biodiesel, and fuel \ncells.\n\n  The goal is a future of vehicles powered by fuel cells. The hydrogen \nis used to create the electricity to turn the motors that turn the \nwheels. The power from the fuel cell comes from hydrogen that will be \nmade by renewable resources such as wind, photovoltaic, and other forms \nof renewable energy.\n  The biggest single step right now that we can take is to improve \nvehicle fuel economy. This bill takes a modest step in this direction, \nfor example, by offering tax incentives for hybrid gas-electric \nvehicles, but we need improvements across the board, including raising \nthe corporate average economy standard for vehicles.\n  Another commonsense way to reduce reliance on fossil fuels is to make \ngreater use of clean and homegrown fuels. This bill has several \nprovisions that take us in the right direction on this front, starting \nwith the robust 8-billion-plus renewable fuel standard first proposed \nby Senator Lugar and I and overwhelmingly approved by this Senate last \nweek.\n  It is very disturbing that even with the price of ethanol well below \nthat of gasoline, fuel blenders are still turning their backs on this \ncleaner, cheaper, homegrown alternative and turning instead to imports \nof refined gasoline.\n\n[[Page S6805]]\n\n  This chart illustrates that. Right now, going back to 5 years ago, \nthere has been a steady increase in the imports of gasoline. This is \nweekly total gasoline imports--thousands of barrels per day. From April \n28 of 2000 until March of this year, gasoline imports increased 66 \npercent. This is not oil, this is gasoline. This is oil that has been \nrefined in some foreign country, put on a tanker, and shipped to this \ncountry. So right now, we are up to just about a million barrels a day. \nThink about that, that is just gasoline. Not too many people know that. \nMost people think we are just importing oil. We are importing about a \nmillion barrels a day of refined gasoline into this country. That is at \nthe expense of American dollars and jobs. This is taking us in the \nwrong direction.\n  A recent report by the Consumer Federation of America found consumers \nwould be saving up to 8 cents a gallon at the pump if refiners were \ninstead adding it to the gasoline at just 10-percent blends.\n  My consumers in Iowa, right now, are saving as much as 10 cents per \ngallon on ethanol-blended fuels, for an average savings of at least \n$100 a year for a typical family.\n  I believe Americans all across the country deserve the cost and clean \nair benefits that ethanol-blended fuels provide. It is imperative we \ninsist on our strong 8-billion-gallon renewable fuels standard when \nthis Energy bill goes to conference with the House.\n  In addition to the renewable fuels standard, this bill in front of us \nincludes tax incentives for alternative motor vehicles and fuels. This \nis very important. But we need to act more aggressively. For example, I \nbelieve we need to mandate that gasoline vehicles sold in this country \nbe flexible-fuel vehicles that can run on E-85; that is, 85 percent \nethanol or some other biofuel.\n  Now, flexible-fuel vehicles only cost maybe, right now, between $100 \nand $200 per vehicle. That is with just a small amount that are being \nmade. If every vehicle was a flexible-fuel vehicle, the cost per \nvehicle would drop way below $100 per vehicle. The savings a consumer \nwould get on that few dollars extra added to the sticker price of a car \nwould be more than made up for, probably within the first year or so of \nbuying flexible fuels.\n  So I am saying, right now we do not have that many flexible-fuel \nvehicles. We need to mandate that cars sold in America--not made here, \nsold in America--be a flexible-fuel vehicle. You might say: Is that \npossible? Well, Brazil is planning on having all of its new cars \nflexible-fuel ready by 2008. I want to ask the question: If the \nBrazilians can do it, why can't we? If the Brazilians can do it, of \ncourse we can do it.\n  Now, of course, consumers need access to the renewable fuels. So I am \nglad the bill in front of us includes incentives for the installation \nof flexible-fuel pumps at fueling stations. So now the bill has in it, \nas I said, incentives for installing flexible-fuel pumps at fuel \nstations. But we do not have a mandate to build flexible-fuel cars.\n  Right now, there is a fuel savings credit that auto manufacturers get \nfor making E-85 vehicles. It is called the CAFE credits. But it is on \nthe assumption that these vehicles will run on E-85 at least half the \ntime. In other words, an auto manufacturer gets the credits for \nbuilding a flexible-fuel vehicle on the assumption the vehicle will use \nE-85 half the time.\n  But the truth is, most people who own flexible-fuel vehicles do not \neven know it. So E-85 does not get used at all for that reason, and for \nthe reason there are not many pumps out there. So we call this the \ndual-fuel loophole because carmakers get the credit for alternative \nfuels even if no alternative fuel is used. We should close that \nloophole now by tying CAFE credits to the amount of flexible fuel that \nis actually used, or by simply letting the credit expire.\n  So what I am saying is we need a three-pronged approach. We have the \nincentives in the bill to add flexible-fuel pumps at fueling stations. \nSecondly, we need to provide these credits will go only--only--on the \namount of flexible fuel that is actually used. Third, what I am saying \nis we actually need a mandate that cars sold in America be flexible \nfueled.\n  Now, another important provision of the Energy bill extends the \nincome tax credit for the production of biodiesel, another excellent \nrenewable fuel. Biodiesel offers tremendous energy savings by providing \n3.5 times more energy than is used to produce it, and by offering \nimproved air quality over traditional diesel.\n  In addition to investment in today's biofuels, we also need a strong \ninvestment in the future of bio-based fuels and products of all kinds. \nNew technology is making it possible to produce biofuels and a host of \nindustrial and commercial products out of biomass; that is, \nagricultural material such as corn stalks and wheat straw and \nswitchgrass and wood pulp and things like that--dedicated energy crops \nthat together are expected to produce 10 times the current volume \nof ethanol at prices equal to or less than that of gasoline, and, \nagain, with tremendous benefits to our environment and our rural \neconomy.\n\n  A recent study found that farmers can expect to earn an additional \n$35 per acre just by selling the excess biomass--the stalks and the \nstraw--from traditional corn and wheat operations.\n  Now, ethanol made from this residual biomass is expected to have near \nzero or even negative net carbon dioxide emissions. How can that be? If \nyou are using it, you are burning it, burning the fuel in a car, you \nput carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. That is true. But as these \nplants grow, they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere more than \nwhat is burned in the automobile. So biomass is a vital part of \ncombating climate change.\n  Now, the biorefineries that produce this ethanol will also give us \nbio-based products to supplement or replace everyday products now made \nfrom petroleum. I have a couple of posters that indicate that. Shipping \nmaterials, building construction materials, roofing materials, \nelastomeric-type roofing materials, paints, hand sanitizers, and even \ncarpets are made from renewable resources, biodegradable resources. For \nhome and automotive use, just think of all the plastic cups, all these \ncontainers made out of petroleum now. And there are lubricants, soy \noil. Even rubber tires are made out of renewable resources which are \nbiodegradable. All of these things can be made from the biorefineries \nthat will be producing the ethanol and the biodiesel that we will use \nin transportation. Many of these products are on the market, not in the \nfuture but today.\n  Tripling the use of bio-based products could add $20 billion in \neconomic benefits just by the year 2010--5 years from now. Replacing \nthe Nation's petrochemicals with bio-based equivalents would save some \n700 million barrels of petroleum a year. Just replacing plastics with \nbio-based counterparts would save another 100 million barrels or more. \nSo there is great potential here. We need to get serious about \nsupporting these bio-based products, and the Federal Government needs \nto take the lead.\n  Now, I know we are talking about the Energy bill, and that is what I \nhave been talking about. But I am just going to digress for a minute \nand talk about a provision that was in the farm bill that was passed in \n2002 because it has a lot to do with this Energy bill. Keep in mind \nwhat I have been saying is, by getting the biorefineries going and \nmaking more ethanol and biodiesel, we have byproducts that can also be \nmade. As I mentioned, they are the plastic containers and the building \nmaterials and things like that. There is an important provision in the \nfarm bill, section 9002, that we worked very hard to get in the farm \nbill, passed and signed by the President 3 years ago this month. \nSection 9002 requires all Government Departments and Agencies to give a \npurchasing preference to bio-based products. Now, here is the exact \nwording. This is section 9002. This is law. It has been the law for 3 \nyears:\n\n       Each Federal agency . . . shall--\n\nIt does not say ``may''--\n\n     shall, in making procurement decisions, give preference to \n     such items composed of the highest percentage of bio-based \n     products practicable . . . unless such items (A) are not \n     reasonably available; (B) fail to meet performance standards; \n     or (C) are available only at an unreasonable price.\n\n  So price, performance, and availability--as long as it meets those \nthree criteria, each Federal agency shall buy them. That is what it \nsays, period.\n  Think of all the plastic cups and forks used every day in the Senate \ncafeteria alone.\n\n[[Page S6806]]\n\n  Think of the Department of Defense, think about all of the plastic \nmaterials they use in serving the troops every day. Think of the \nmillions of gallons of metal-working fluids, lubricants, and paint used \nby the Department of Defense. Yet 3 years after the passage of the farm \nbill, we still do not have a bio-based procurement program in place in \nthe Federal Government. That has been there. It has been the law. And \nwe are still not doing it. McDonald's can go buy plastic cups made out \nof renewable resources. Good for them. Why can't the Department of \nDefense? Why can't the Department of Interior that operates in our \nnational parks? Why aren't they using more biodegradable materials? The \nlaw says they are supposed to, but they are not doing it because USDA \nhas yet to issue the rules.\n  Again, I bring that up because this is part and parcel of the Energy \nbill. This saves us energy because right now all this material is made \nfrom imported oil, or most of it. It could be made by homegrown \nproducts here in America. We need to have the Federal Government \nsetting an example and leading the way in reducing dependence on \nproducts made from foreign oil. I am sorry to say that 3 years later we \nstill are not doing it.\n  We also need to invest in research and commercialization of bio-based \nfuels and products. That is why a few weeks ago, I, along with Senators \nLugar, Obama, and Coleman, introduced the National Security and \nBioenergy Investment Act of 2005. Our bill promotes targeted biomass \nresearch and development in order to expand the cost-effective use of \nbio-based fuels, products, and power. It provides incentives for the \nproduction of the first 1 billion gallons of biofuels from cellulosic \nbiomass; that is, crop residues like corn stocks and wheat straw, or \nwood chips from lumber mills. It provides bioeconomy development grants \nto small bio-based businesses. It creates a new Assistant Secretary \nposition at the Department of Agriculture to carry out energy and bio-\nbased initiatives.\n  It requires the Capitol complex to lead by example by procuring bio-\nbased products. This bill has the support of a broad coalition of \nagricultural producers, clean energy and environment groups, and \nnational security experts. I have a number of letters from these \norganizations supporting the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am excited about this new bill. I hope \nmy colleagues will get behind it. In fact, we may be offering an \namendment to the Energy bill that would take a small part of that and \nadd it to the Energy bill. I hope we can get that done this week.\n  America's dangerous dependence on fossil fuels extends beyond oil. \nNatural gas prices have skyrocketed, hurting everyone who uses gas to \nheat their home or fuel their appliances or to make fertilizer for our \nfarmers. Americans now pay two to three times what Europeans pay for \nnatural gas due to our ever-growing demand and limited availability. \nFarmers are hit hard. Our farmers rely on natural gas not only to heat \nhomes and run much of their equipment but also for fertilizer in the \nfields. These impacts on farmers are severe and getting worse. We need \nan energy bill that looks for sensible ways to lower natural gas costs \nfor all Americans. We need to look for environmentally sensitive ways \nto increase our supply.\n  That is why I keep saying, the House put in a bill to drill for oil \nin the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, but we all know that oil \ndoesn't amount to anything. Most of that oil--I could be corrected--I \nbelieve all of that oil is going to go to Japan. It is a drop in the \nbucket compared to what we use. But what else they have in Alaska is a \nlot of natural gas, and we need to pipe that natural gas from Alaska \ndown to the lower 48. That has been on the drawing boards in the past \nto get that natural gas down here. And for various and sundry reasons \nthat I don't need to go into here, it has been held up.\n  I call upon the Governor of Alaska to move expeditiously to reach the \nagreements that are necessary to get the natural gas pipeline \nconstructed and built to deliver the natural gas down to the lower 48. \nThey have been talking a lot about how they would pipe it down--they \nwould liquefy it and then send it down to the west coast, or maybe to \nthe Gulf States. That costs a lot of money when you liquefy natural \ngas, when we could build a pipeline that could be environmentally safe \nand bring that gas right down to the Midwest where it is needed, not \nonly for the Midwest but for the upper part, the northern part of the \nUnited States. So we need to move ahead aggressively on that, and we \nare not doing it.\n  We need to look for all environmentally sensitive ways to increase \nsupply, and we need to look for solar and biomass and wind. I am glad \nso many colleagues from both sides of the aisle joined together in \napproving the amendment offered by Senator Bingaman requiring 10 \npercent of this country's electricity to come from renewable resources \nby 2020. Wind power in particular has tremendous potential to provide \nclean, abundant energy in many parts of the country. Wind power \ngeneration can provide thousands of dollars in additional revenue to \nour farmers and ranchers and people in rural areas, while continuing to \nallow for crop production and grazing. Valuable incentives for wind \npower production exist in the section 45 wind production tax credit. \nHowever, development of this vital industry has been tied up by \nCongress's refusal to provide a long-term extension of this incentive.\n  In 2004, when extension of the production tax credit was delayed, \nmore than $2 billion in wind power investment was put on hold. I am \npleased a 3-year extension of the production tax credit for wind \nhas been included in this bill. We could do more, much more. It should \nbe extended longer than that, but at least this minimal amount should \nprovide developers the certainty they need to move ahead with wind \npower projects.\n\n  We also need to make sure farmers and farmer co-ops can be full \nparticipants in wind power projects. The farm bill's energy title, \nsection 906, is providing grants and loans to farmers and rural small \nbusinesses to install wind and other renewable energy systems on their \nproperty. It also supports energy-efficient improvements to farm and \nsmall business operations. This program has been a real success over \nthe past several years. We expect it to grow substantially in the years \nahead.\n  I have also introduced a bill, S. 715, to help more farmers and other \nrural citizens become active investors in wind energy by removing \nrestrictions that are in the production tax credit. This bill I am \nsponsoring includes a pass through of the wind production tax credit to \ncooperative members, just like the small ethanol producer credit pass \nthrough right now. This will provide another needed boost to rural \nAmerica's wind power development. Right now, if a co-op builds an \nethanol plant, they can get the production tax credits passed through \nto their members. If a co-op wants to build windmills, however, they \ncan't pass it through to their members. Hopefully, we can lift this \nrestriction, and we can do it on this Energy bill before us.\n  Finally, we need to look to the longer term future, and we need to do \nit now by laying the groundwork. To deliver truly sustainable energy \nthat will not add to climate change and global warming, that will not \npollute the environment, we must invest in clean technologies. What I \nam talking about is hydrogen. It offers real potential for a clean, \ndomestic, sustainable energy future. But only if it is produced from \nrenewable resources. That is why we need to support research and \ndemonstration of technologies to produce hydrogen from ethanol and \nother renewable resources. My bill, S. 373, the Renewable Hydrogen \nTransportation Act, would do just that, by funding the installation of \nan ethanol-to-hydrogen reformer, as well as the operation of hybrid \nelectric vehicles converted to run on renewable hydrogen instead of \ngasoline.\n  Making hydrogen from ethanol and other renewable fuels makes a lot of \nsense for transportation--one, because we can use the existing ethanol \nproduction and distribution network; two, because it could well be the \nleast expensive renewable hydrogen option available. I appreciate the \nwillingness of the chairman and the ranking member to work with me to \nput this modest, but meaningful, initiative in the bill.\n\n[[Page S6807]]\n\n  Again, to get to that sustainable future, we have to think about \nmaking hydrogen from renewable resources. You use the wind power. When \nthe wind blows at night and you don't need all that electricity and you \ncannot store it, what do you do with it? You waste it. It is gone. But \nif you can use that wind at night to turn a turbine that makes \nelectricity, and you can use that electricity to hydrolyze water--\nremember the old chemistry experiment where you put positive and \nnegative in water, and off of one comes oxygen and off of the other \ncomes hydrogen. There are two atoms for oxygen for every atom of \nhydrogen. As long as those turbines are turning, we can make hydrogen. \nYou can store hydrogen. You can save it. You can compress it. You can \npipe it. So, therefore, at times when you don't need a lot of \nelectrical power and the wind is blowing, you can make hydrogen. You \ncan store it and take the hydrogen and put it through a fuel cell to \nmake the electricity when you need it. The beauty of doing that is you \nonly get one product--H2O, water. Nothing else. It doesn't \npollute, doesn't add to global warming or anything. So that is the \ncycle that we need. Use the Sun, use the wind, hydropower, whatever is \nrenewable, take that and make hydrogen, store it, compress it, put it \nthrough a fuel cell, and make the electricity, and the cycle starts all \nover again. I know a lot of this is some years down the pike. We cannot \ndo it tomorrow. But we can start now by building assistance that will \nenable us to move to a renewable hydrogen-based economy in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, let me close by thanking Senator Domenici and Senator \nBingaman for the extraordinary job they have done during the past \nmonths and during floor consideration of the bill. The bipartisan \ncooperation we are seeing is due largely to their example and \nimpressive leadership, and the entire Senate owes them a debt of \ngratitude for a job well done.\n  Of course, we are not done yet. Hurdles remain. We are headed, \nthough, toward concluding a strong, bipartisan bill that leads America \ndecisively into the new world of clean, renewable, home-grown energy. \nWhen the time comes, we need to stand firm for the Senate provisions \nwhen we go to conference.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                     June 9, 2005.\n     Re The National Security and Bioenergy Investment Act of \n         2005.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard Lugar,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Harkin and Lugar: The National Corn Growers \n     Association (NCGA), the American Soybean Association (ASA), \n     and the Renewable Fuels Association are writing to express \n     our support for the National Security and Bioenergy \n     Investment Act of 2005. In particular, we strongly support \n     the increased procurement of biobased products by Federal \n     agencies and all Federal government contractors. Biobased \n     products represent a large potential growth market for corn \n     and soybean growers in areas such as plastics, solvents, \n     packaging and other consumer goods to provide markets for \n     U.S.-grown crops. The biobased product industry has already \n     started to grow, bringing new products to consumers, new \n     markets to growers and new investments to our communities.\n       The procurement of biobased products promotes energy and \n     environmental security. Products made from corn and soybeans \n     could replace a variety of items currently produced from \n     petroleum, and aid in reducing dependence on imported oil. \n     Already the production of ethanol and biodiesel reduces \n     imports by more than 140 million barrels of oil. The \n     production of biobased products generates less greenhouse gas \n     than traditional petroleum-based items. There are also \n     tremendous opportunities for grower-owned processing \n     facilities and rural America and agriculture as a whole. New \n     jobs and investments will be brought into rural communities, \n     as new processing and manufacturing facilities move into \n     those communities to be near renewable feedstocks.\n       NCGA, ASA and RFA applaud your continued efforts to promote \n     the use of biobased I products that will encourage the \n     development of new markets for corn and soybeans and \n     ultimately help to revitalize rural economies and the \n     agriculture industry as a whole. We have been avid supporters \n     of the biobased products industry, and we look forward to \n     working with you as you continue to provide vision and \n     direction for this emerging industry.\n           Sincerely,\n     Leon Corzine,\n       President, National Corn Growers Association.\n     Neal Bredehoeft,\n       President, American Soybean Association.\n     Bob Dinneen,\n       President, Renewable Fuels Association.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Governors' Ethanol Coalition,\n\n                                                     June 9, 2005.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington DC.\n     Hon. Barack Obama,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington DC.\n     Hon. Richard Lugar,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington DC.\n     Hon. Norm Coleman,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senators: On behalf of the thirty members of the \n     Governors' Ethanol Coalition, we strongly support and endorse \n     the National Security and Bioenergy Investment Act of 2005, \n     as well as your efforts to expand development of other \n     biofuels and co-products. The Governors' Ethanol Coalition is \n     pleased that this bill embodies the recommendations developed \n     by the Coalition in Ethanol From Biomass: America's 21st pi \n     Century Transportation Fuel. When signed into law, this act \n     will catalyze needed research, production, and use of \n     biofuels and bio-based products, thereby enhancing our \n     economic, environmental, and national security.\n       The Coalition believes that the nation's dependency on \n     imported oil presents a huge risk to this country's future. \n     The combination of political tensions in major oil-producing \n     nations with growing oil demand from China and India is \n     seriously threatening our national security. Moreover, as we \n     import greater amounts of oil each year, we are draining more \n     and more of the wealth from our states.\n       The key provisions contained in your bill bring focus and \n     resources to biomass-derived ethanol research and \n     commercialization efforts. The result, over time, will be the \n     replacement of significant amounts. of imported oil with \n     domestically produced fuels--improving our rural economies, \n     cleaning our air, and contributing to our national security. \n     Of particular importance is the bill's aim to broaden ethanol \n     production to include all regions of the nation so that many \n     more states will reap the benefits of biofuels.\n       Again, thank you for inclusion of the Coalition's \n     recommendations in this landmark legislation. Please let us \n     know how the Coalition can help with the passage of this very \n     important legislation. The continued expansion of ethanol \n     production and use, particularly biomass-derived fuels, and \n     the accompanying economic growth and environmental benefits \n     for our states is essential to the nation's long-term \n     economic vitality and national security.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tim Pawlenty,\n       Chair, Governor of Minnesota.\n     Kathleen Sebelius,\n       Vice Chair, Governor of Kansas.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Natural Resources Defense Council,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 2005.\n       Dear Senators Harkin and Lugar: The Natural Resources \n     Defense Council strongly supports the National Security and \n     Bioenergy Investment Act of2005, which you introduced today. \n     This important bill would expand and refine research, \n     development, demonstration and deployment efforts for the \n     production of energy from crops grown by farmers here in \n     America. The bill would also expand and improve the \n     Department of Agriculture's efforts to promote a biobased \n     economy, federal bio-energy and bioproduct purchasing \n     requirements, and federal educational efforts.\n       The Research and Development (R) title of this bill \n     continues your tradition of leadership in this area by \n     updating the Biomass Research and Development Act of2000, \n     which you also crafted. This title will not only extend the \n     provisions of the original bill and greatly increase the \n     funding for these provisions, it will also refine the \n     direction of this funding. Taken together, these changes \n     maximize the impacts of R on the greatest challenges facing \n     cellulosic biofuels today.\n       Your bill also creates extremely important production \n     incentives for the first one billion gallons of cellulosic \n     biofuels. The production incentives approach taken by the \n     bill a combination of fixed incentives per gallon at first, \n     switching over to a reverse auction will maximize the \n     development of cellulosic biofuels production while \n     minimizing the cost to taxpayers.\n       In addition, the bill creates an Assistant Secretary of \n     Agriculture for Energy and Biobased Products. Coupled with \n     the bill's development grants, tax incentives, biobased \n     product procurement provisions, and educational program, the \n     bill would make a huge contribution to developing a \n     sustainable biobased economy, reducing our oil dependence and \n     improving our national security.\n       The technologies advanced by this bill will undoubtedly \n     make important contributions to reducing our global warming \n     pollution and the air and water pollution that comes\n\n[[Page S6808]]\n\n     from our dependence on fossil fuels. We are concerned, \n     however, that the eligibility provisions for forest biomass \n     do not exclude sensitive areas that need protecting, \n     including roadless areas, old growth forests, and other \n     endangered forests, and do not restrict eligibility to \n     renewable sources or prohibit possible conversion of native \n     forests to plantations. We know that you do not want to see \n     this admirable legislation applied in ways that exploit these \n     features, and will be happy to work with you in the future to \n     take any steps needed if abuses arise.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Karen Wayland,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Energy Future Coalition,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 2005.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Hon. Richard G. Lugar,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Harkin and Lugar: On behalf of the Energy \n     Future Coalition, I am writing to commend your leadership and \n     vision in drafting the National Security and Bioenergy \n     Investment Act of 2005.\n       In our judgment, America's growing dependence on foreign \n     oil endangers our national and economic security. We believe \n     the Federal government should undertake a major new \n     initiative to curtail U.S. oil consumption through improved \n     efficiency and the rapid development and deployment of \n     advanced biomass, alcohol and other available petroleum fuel \n     alternatives.\n       With such a push, we believe domestic biofuels can cut the \n     nation's oil use by 25 percent by 2025, and substantial \n     further reductions are possible through efficiency gains from \n     advanced technologies. That is an ambitious goal, but it is \n     also an extraordinary opportunity for American leadership, \n     innovation, job creation, and economic growth.\n       You took an important step forward by introducing S. 650, \n     the Fuels Security Act, incorporated into the Senate energy \n     bill during Committee markup. This legislation is another \n     important step, authorizing the additional research and \n     development and federal incentives needed to accelerate the \n     adoption of biobased fuels and coproducts. We are pleased to \n     support it.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Reid Detchon,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       National Farmers Union,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 2005.\n     Hon. Richard Lugar,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Lugar and Harkin: On behalf of the family \n     farming and ranching members of the National Farmers Union, \n     we are writing to express our strong support for your \n     bipartisan, National Security and Bioenergy Investment Act of \n     2005 legislation. The provisions within this act contain \n     crucial measures that will benefit not only rural, but all of \n     America.\n       Importantly, your legislation would create an Assistant \n     Secretary for Energy and Biobased Products position at USDA, \n     which we feel would complement and reinforce initiatives \n     created by the energy section of the 2002 Farm Bill.\n       We also applaud your proposals for promoting the usage of \n     biobased products within the U.S. government, which will \n     expand future development of these technologies. These \n     products, and their use, are an asset to the rural producers \n     of the commodities used in the production of these commonly \n     used items. Also, the more we increase the use of these \n     items, the better it will be environmentally for future \n     generations.\n       We wholeheartedly support your legislation and look forward \n     to working with you to promote the expansion of biobased \n     products.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            David J. Frederickson,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Biotechnology\n\n\n                                        Industry Organization,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 2005.\n     Senator Tom Harkin,\n     Ranking Democratic Member,\n     Senator Richard Lugar,\n     Member, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Harkin and Lugar: The Biotechnology Industry \n     Organization (BIO) Industrial and Environmental Section fully \n     supports the National Security and Bioenergy Investment Act \n     of 2005. We greatly appreciate your vision and initiative to \n     expand the Biomass Research and Development Act and to create \n     new incentives to produce biofuels and biobased products.\n       America's growing dependence on foreign energy is eroding \n     our national security. We must take steps to drastically \n     increase production of domestic energy. As an active \n     participant in the Energy Future Coalition, BIO believes this \n     country needs a major new initiative to more aggressively \n     research, develop and deploy advanced biofuels technologies. \n     With sufficient government support, we can meet up to 25% of \n     our transportation fuel needs by converting farm crops and \n     crop residues to transportation fuel.\n       The National Security and Bioenergy Investment Act of 2005 \n     will boost the use of industrial biotechnology to produce \n     fuels and biobased products from renewable agricultural \n     feedstocks. With the use of new biotech tools, we can now \n     utilize millions of tons of crop residues, such as corn \n     stover and wheat straw, to produce sugars that can then be \n     converted to ethanol, chemicals and bio-based plastics. These \n     biotech tools can only be rapidly deployed if federal policy \n     makers take steps to help our innovative companies get over \n     the initial hurdles they face during the commercialization \n     phase of bioenergy production, and your bill will help get \n     that job done.\n       We are pleased to endorse this visionary legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Brent Erickson,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Environmental Law & Policy Center,\n\n                                        Chicago, IL, June 8, 2005.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Hon. Richard G. Lugar,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Harkin and Lugar: The Environmental Law and \n     Policy Center (``ELPC'') is pleased to support the National \n     Security and Bioenergy Investment Act of 2005, and we commend \n     you for your leadership and vision in introducing this \n     legislation. This bill would accelerate research, \n     development, demonstration and production efforts for energy \n     from farm crops in the United States, especially cellulosic \n     ethanol. It also will expand and prioritize the United States \n     Department of Agriculture's leadership responsibilities to \n     promote clean and sustainable energy development, and it will \n     increase procurement of biobased products.\n       By significantly expanding the development and production \n     of clean energy ``cash crops,'' this legislation will improve \n     our environmental quality, stimulate significant rural \n     economic development, and strengthen our national energy \n     security. ELPC also appreciates that this legislation \n     reflects your longstanding support for farm-based sustainable \n     energy programs. ELPC strongly supported your successful \n     efforts to create the new Energy Title in the 2002 Farm Bill, \n     which established groundbreaking new federal incentives for \n     renewable energy and energy efficiency, while renewing \n     existing programs such as the Biomass Research and \n     Development Act of 2000.\n       The National Security and Bioenergy Investment Act of 2005 \n     is a natural complement to the 2002 Farm Bill Energy Title \n     programs, and it will help to strengthen support for the \n     right bioenergy production programs in the 2007 Farm Bill. \n     Accordingly, ELPC is pleased to support this legislation.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                Howard A. Learner,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Institute for Local Self-Reliance,\n\n                                                     June 6, 2005.\n     Senator Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Tom Harkin: Congratulations on your bill, \n     National Security and Bioenergy Investment Act of 2005. It is \n     a breakthrough piece of legislation. Your well-conceived \n     bill, combining needed executive branch changes, welcome \n     increases in research and development funding and innovative \n     commercialization techniques, can move the use of plants as a \n     fuel and industrial material from the margins of the economy \n     to the mainstream. I urge everyone with an interest in our \n     environmental, agricultural and economic future to support \n     this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     David Morris,\n                                                   Vice President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 805\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from Iowa for \nhis being always thoughtful. We even want to produce ethanol plants and \nwind in New York. We just don't want to transport it over to Iowa. I am \nnot from Iowa. In any case, I am not here to talk about that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nlaid aside, and I send an amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. This is the sense of the Senate amendment on the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will temporarily set it aside, and then we will \nreturn to where we were. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I believe the amendment is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 805.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6809]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding management of \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve to lower the burden of gasoline prices \non the economy of the United States and circumvent the efforts of OPEC \n                       to reap windfall profits)\n\n       On page 208, after line 24, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 303. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MANAGEMENT OF SPR.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the prices of gasoline and crude oil have a direct and \n     substantial impact on the financial well-being of families of \n     the United States, the potential for national economic \n     recovery, and the economic security of the United States;\n       (2) on June 13, 2005, crude oil prices closed at the \n     exceedingly high level of $55.62 per barrel, the price of \n     crude oil has remained above $50 per barrel since May 25, \n     2005, and the price of crude oil has exceeded $50 per barrel \n     for approximately \\1/3\\ of calendar year 2005;\n       (3) on June 6, 2005, the Energy Information Administration \n     announced that the national price of gasoline, at $2.12 per \n     gallon, could reach even higher levels in the near future;\n       (4) despite the severely high, sustained price of crude \n     oil--\n       (A) the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \n     (referred to in this section as ``OPEC'') has refused to \n     adequately increase production to calm global oil markets and \n     officially abandoned its $22-$28 price target; and\n       (B) officials of OPEC member nations have publicly \n     indicated support for maintaining oil prices of $40-$50 per \n     barrel;\n       (5) the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (referred to in this \n     section as ``SPR'') was created to enhance the physical and \n     economic security of the United States;\n       (6) the law allows the SPR to be used to provide relief \n     when oil and gasoline supply shortages cause economic \n     hardship;\n       (7) the proper management of the resources of the SPR could \n     provide gasoline price relief to families of the United \n     States and provide the United States with a tool to \n     counterbalance OPEC supply management policies;\n       (8) the Administration's policy of filling the SPR despite \n     the fact that the SPR is nearly full has exacerbated the \n     rising price of crude oil and record high retail price of \n     gasoline;\n       (9) in order to combat high gasoline prices during the \n     summer and fall of 2000, President Clinton released \n     30,000,000 barrels of oil from the SPR, stabilizing the \n     retail price of gasoline;\n       (10) increasing vertical integration has allowed--\n       (A) the 5 largest oil companies in the United States to \n     control almost as much crude oil production as the Middle \n     Eastern members of OPEC, over \\1/2\\ of domestic refiner \n     capacity, and over 60 percent of the retail gasoline market; \n     and\n       (B) Exxon/Mobil, BP, Royal Dutch Shell Group, Conoco/\n     Philips, and Chevron/Texaco to increase first quarter profits \n     of 2005 over first quarter profits of 2004 by 36 percent, for \n     total first quarter profits of over $25,000,000,000;\n       (11) the Administration has failed to manage the SPR in a \n     manner that would provide gasoline price relief to working \n     families; and\n       (12) the Administration has failed to adequately demand \n     that OPEC immediately increase oil production in order to \n     lower crude oil prices and safeguard the world economy.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President should--\n       (1) directly confront OPEC and challenge OPEC to \n     immediately increase oil production; and\n       (2) direct the Federal Trade Commission and Attorney \n     General to exercise vigorous oversight over the oil markets \n     to protect the people of the United States from price gouging \n     and unfair practices at the gasoline pump.\n       (c) Release of Oil From SPR.--\n       (1) In general.--For the period beginning on the date of \n     enactment of this Act and ending on the date that is 30 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, 1,000,000 barrels of \n     oil per day shall be released from the SPR.\n       (2) Additional release.--If necessary to lower the burden \n     of gasoline prices on the economy of the United States and to \n     circumvent the efforts of OPEC to reap windfall crude oil \n     profits, 1,000,000 barrels of oil per day shall be released \n     from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for an additional 30 \n     days.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New Mexico for his \ngrace, as usual. I will be brief as I make a statement on the \namendment.\n  I rise to offer this amendment, which will express the sense of the \nSenate that the Federal Government should take long, overdue action to \ncurb the record-high gasoline prices that are plaguing American \nconsumers at the pump. As my colleagues are well aware, for weeks, oil \nand gasoline prices have been placing an immense burden on working \nfamilies and threatening our fragile economic recovery, and it is time \nthat this body took action to protect our Nation's economic security \nfrom the sky-high oil prices and the whims of the OPEC cartel.\n  This amendment would urge the administration to provide the American \nconsumer with relief by releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve through a swap program in order to increase the supply, quell \nthe markets, and bring down prices at the pump. Of course, the other \nside of the swap is that we would buy back the oil when the price was \nlower and put it back in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is now \njust about full.\n  Mr. President, what we are faced with here is simple market economics \nof supply and demand. If demand goes up, price goes up. If supply goes \nup, price goes down. At a time facing record-breaking gasoline prices, \nit is hard to believe that the Federal Government would be taking oil \noff the market and exacerbate the high energy costs to working \nfamilies.\n  The price of crude oil has remained at near record highs for over \none-third of 2005, with oil having traded at over $50 a barrel since \nMay 25. Just today, we saw the biggest jump yet, with oil closing at \nalmost $60 a barrel. OPEC used to claim it was interested in helping to \nkeep prices under $30 a barrel. That is when it went from a $22 to $28 \nrate. It may be fun to double down in Las Vegas but not in the oil \nmarket, and certainly not at the gas pump.\n  These prices have already burdened Americans in New York and in the \nrest of the Northeast. We get a double whammy because we have high home \nheating oil prices, as well as high gasoline prices because we depend \non heating oil more than most parts of the country. Other parts are \nwarmer or use more natural gas. I know these families were hoping for a \nquick spring so they could enjoy a brief respite from the high energy \nprices.\n  Unfortunately, that hasn't been the case, as the increased burden of \noil costs has just moved from the home to the highway. As Americans are \nbeginning to plan for their road trips and summer vacations, the \nnational price of gasoline has seemingly reached a new record high \nevery week. Last week, the Energy Information Administration reported \nthat prices had increased for the second straight week, to $2.13 for \nregular self-service. That is an increase of almost 49 cents from last \nyear. Unfortunately, it could give way to even higher prices in the \nfuture.\n  We know who is being hurt by these oil prices, and we know who is \nbenefiting--OPEC. Last year, OPEC made $300 billion in oil revenue. \nThey stand to gain much, much more if the price of oil stays as high as \nit is--stratospheric levels. In order to institutionalize the profits \nfrom these spikes, OPEC agreed to abandon their longstanding price \ntarget of $22 to $28 a barrel, as I mentioned before, and some of its \nmembers say they could be comfortable with oil remaining at $40 to $50 \npermanently. I know who will not be comfortable--American families who \ndepend on affordable oil to commute to work, heat their homes, and \nprovide for their energy needs.\n  Some of my colleagues may be asking: Didn't OPEC agree to increase \nproduction in March by 500,000 barrels a day?\n  The reality is that OPEC's pledge to increase production on paper has \nnot reduced prices at the pump. OPEC, after having cut production by 1 \nmillion barrels in the face of rising oil prices--it is not that \namazing--claimed that they would increase production by half the \nprevious cut. While this would seem like a step in the right direction, \nthe reality is they were already producing 700,000 barrels over their \nquota, so as a result this paper increase added no oil to U.S. markets.\n  These are exactly the type of shell games that the OPEC cartel uses \nto take money out of Americans' pockets to put toward OPEC profits.\n  We have to act to stop it. Once again, OPEC is talking about another \n500,000-barrel increase. We will see if they actually follow through.\n  Instead of standing up to OPEC, what has this administration done? It \nhas continued, incredibly enough, taking oil off the market and placing \nit in the SPR. This policy, which further tightens oil markets by \ntaking much needed supplies out of commerce, is slated to take an \naverage of almost 85,000 barrels per day off the market during the \nheight of the driving season, between April and the end of August, \ndespite the fact that the SPR is almost completely full.\n  I understand that some of my colleagues think the SPR should never be\n\n[[Page S6810]]\n\ntouched, even to safeguard our economic security. I would argue that \nconcerns to this degree do not properly balance America's physical \nsecurity needs against its economic security needs. With the SPR almost \nfull, we can easily reduce 30 million barrels through a swap and still \nhave an effective safeguard against a physical supply disruption.\n  Initiating a swap of oil from the SPR to increase the supply of oil \nis a proven way to reduce the price of gasoline and heating oil. In the \nfall of 2000, the Clinton administration announced a swap of 30 million \nbarrels over 30 days, causing crude oil prices to quickly fall by over \n$6 a barrel and wholesale prices to fall 14 cents a gallon. Under a \nswap, the Federal Government could decide on a set quantity of oil to \nrelease from the SPR and accept bids from private companies for the \nrights to that oil. The companies would then bid on how much oil they \nwould be willing to return, in addition to the oil they would receive \nunder the swap, to the SPR at a later date.\n  The administration has had these tools in its hands and could have \nacted more quickly, earlier, to stand up for the American consumer, but \nit has not. Instead, despite repeated urgings from Members of this \nbody, among others, it has steadfastly refused to intervene and to \nallow oil prices to soar. It has been good for oil companies, it has \nbeen good for OPEC and bad for the American consumer.\n  This amendment says enough is enough and gives this body an \nopportunity to do what others have refused by hitting the breaks to \nstop runaway gasoline prices.\n  An oil swap would result in a win-win situation where gasoline prices \nare lowered and long-term contributions to the SPR are augmented at no \nadditional cost to the taxpayers. The SPR is intended to provide relief \nat times when American families are struggling to make ends meet. The \ntime is now. The summer driving months are just beginning.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in protecting the pocketbooks of \nworking families from OPEC profiteering by supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we will not argue our case against the \ncase of the Senator from New York yet. We will do that tomorrow. \nSuffice it to say we are talking about a reserve. It is there as a \nsafety valve in the event something were to happen, and we will talk \nabout the perils of that and why the amendment should not be adopted.\n  For now, it looks as if we are lining up a number of amendments for \ntomorrow, including some amendments that should be in place with \nreference to global warming and some agreements and understanding \nregarding them. Later on, an amendment about the inventory of offshore \nassets, resources, will be discussed and when that amendment to strike \nwill be taken up. So we might have some understanding by morning on a \nseries of votes.\n  For now, I do not think we are going to do anything else other than \nwrap up business, and we will take care of that in due course.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to speak about the Corporation for \nPublic Broadcasting. My understanding is their board of directors is \nmeeting today. I don't know whether they are going to select a new \npresident for the corporation, but I know that was at least announced \nas the intention today of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Let \nme go all the way back to Big Bird. Everyone who grows up watching \nSesame Street and Children's Television Workshop understands that \nCookie Monster, Big Bird, and all of those things represent learning \ndevices and the wonderful characters on Sesame Street. The Corporation \nfor Public Broadcasting was created a long while ago as a part of an \napproach to do something unique.\n  The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Public Television, and \nNational Public Radio have been pretty remarkable. Every week 94 \nmillion Americans watch public television or some portion of public \ntelevision and 46 million people listen to public radio. That is a \nremarkable statistic. Public radio and public television are available \nto over 90 percent of American homes. We have come a long way since \nPresident Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.\n  It is the case that public broadcasting will tackle issues that other \nbroadcasters don't tackle. I admit you won't see Fear Factor on public \ntelevision. You won't tune in and see someone sitting in front of a \nbowl of maggots to see whether they can eat an entire bowl in 15 or 30 \nseconds. That is not the kind of television I watch. But occasionally \nwhen you are browsing through the television routine, you tune in to \nprograms that have that kind of approach. You wonder what has become of \ngood television. Or you might tune in to another program where you see \na couple of women or men engaged in a fist fight over some romance that \nturned sour, where on that program day after day they hold this \nimperfection up to the light and say: Isn't this ugly? Let's entertain \nourselves with everyone else's dysfunctional behavior.\n  You won't find that on public broadcasting. They sink their teeth \ninto some pretty interesting things. I mentioned Big Bird. I suppose \ncould you say Big Bird isn't quite so serious, but a lot of children \ngrow up with Sesame Street watching Big Bird and the lessons therein. \nFrankly, it is wonderful television--more than television for children, \nI will give you an example of the kinds of things public broadcasting \ntackles that others will not.\n  Do you think ABC, CBS, NBC or FOX is going to tackle the question of \nconcentration in broadcasting? There are no more than five or six \ncompanies and people that control what we see, hear, and read. Because \nwe see all of these concentrations of television stations and radio \nstations, the Federal Communications Commission decided in their \nruling, which the court subsequently stayed, that it is OK to open this \nup. And the Federal Communications Commission said: We believe that in \none major American city, one company ought to be able to own eight \nradio stations, three television stations, the cable company, and the \ndominant newspaper. We think that is fine.\n  It is not fine with me. It is limiting what people can see and read \nand hear. The controversy surrounding public television, public radio, \nthe Corporation for Public Broadcasting saddens me. My hope is that \nperhaps actions taken in the next couple of days might resolve that.\n  There is apparently a board meeting this afternoon and apparently \nanother meeting of some type tomorrow where they will choose a new \npresident. This all is with the backdrop of the chairman of the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting, who has consistently and publicly \nsaid that public broadcasting, public television, public radio has a \nliberal bias. There have been all of those allegations over some long \nperiod of time. A liberal bias, it is easy to say. It doesn't have a \nliberal bias. It is just independent television which most people \nappreciate.\n  Let me talk for a moment about my concern about where we are heading. \nPress accounts from last week noted that the House Appropriations \nCommittee approved a spending bill on Thursday that would slash \nspending for public television and radio by nearly half. That includes \na 25-percent cut in financing for the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting and a total of $112 million in additional cuts for \nprograms that provide continuing children's programming.\n  Just the news coming out of the Appropriations Committee in the House \nis\n\n[[Page S6811]]\n\nominous. But more than that, inside the organization, the chairman of \nthe Corporation for Public Broadcasting hired a consultant to evaluate \nthe bias in public broadcasting. He hired a consultant to go after the \nprogram called ``NOW with Bill Moyers.'' He hired that consultant \nwithout notifying the board of directors. This is the chairman of the \nboard. He hired that consultant with public funds.\n  As an appropriator, I asked him: Would you provide me with the \ninformation that the consultant provided you.\n  This is what I received. I received a substantial amount of what he \ncalled raw data. It didn't include any summary, just raw data. I was \nstruck and disappointed to see that a consultant was hired, and this is \na summary of April 4 to June 4, just to pick one. And they go through \nthe list of programs, and they label anti-Bush, anti-Bush, anti-DeLay. \nI guess if he reported on the controversy about Tom DeLay, it is anti-\nDeLay programming.\n\n  It says, ``anticorporation.'' In fact, they did a program about some \nwaste. It might have been about Halliburton, although I have done \nhearings on Halliburton. I guess that would then be declared \nanticorporation. It is really not. Again, it reads anti-Bush, anti-\nBush, pro-Bush.\n  I am struck that it is way out of bounds to be paying money for a \nconsultant who decides to evaluate public broadcasting through the \nprism of whether or not it supports the President. That is not the role \nof public broadcasting, to decide whether it supports the President of \nthe United States. If we ever get to the point where you can't be \ncritical of public policy, Democrats and Republicans, Congress and the \nPresident, then there is something wrong.\n  Interestingly enough, they used another approach on another set of \nprogramming, and they divided these segments that were shown into \neither liberal or conservative segments. And there was a segment on \nJune 7 last year and Senator Hagel from Nebraska, a conservative \nRepublican, was on that segment and apparently said something that \nwasn't completely in sync with the White House. So he is labeled as a \nliberal. A conservative Republican Senator from Nebraska is labeled a \nliberal by the consultant for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. \nWhy? Because he said something liberal? No, apparently he just didn't \nhave the party line down and said something that was perhaps at odds \nwith policy coming out of the White House.\n  This list goes on and on. My guess is my colleague Senator Hagel is \ngoing to be mighty surprised to discover that a consultant hired by the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting views his appearances on public \nbroadcasting as appearances that contribute to a liberal bias because a \nconservative Republican Senator from Nebraska shows up on public \nbroadcasting.\n  I don't mean to make light of this. I think it is serious. In \naddition to all of this, an allegation of bias--a relentless allegation \nof bias by the chairman of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, in \naddition to his hiring a consultant to do this kind of thing--evaluate \nprogramming, whether it is anti-Bush or pro-Bush--in addition to all of \nthat, there is now a discussion and potentially even a vote today in \nwhich they would select a new president of the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting, and the leading candidate for that job is a former \ncochairman of the Republican National Committee.\n  I would not think it appropriate for a former cochair of the \nDemocratic National Committee to assume the presidency of the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting; nor would I think it would be wise \nfor Mr. Tomlinson, the chairman of the board, to usher in a former \npartisan as president of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n  Again, I only say that, going back some 35 years and more, I think \npublic broadcasting has been a real service to our country. Public \ntelevision and public radio tackle things other interests will not \ntackle in this country. They are, in fact, independent. That is \nprecisely what drives some people half-wild. My hope is that the \nactions of Mr. Tomlinson, the chairman, the actions of the board, \nwhatever they might be today--my hope is that those actions will not \nfurther contribute to injuring public broadcasting.\n  We fund public broadcasting because we think it is a great \nalternative to commercial television. If you tune in--nothing against \nbroadcasts in the evening on the commercial station, but I happen to \nthink Jim Lehrer has one of the best newscasts in our country. He \ncovers both sides aggressively. I think it contributes to our country \nand I think, in many ways, public broadcasting is a national treasure. \nI regret that I have to describe these things--consultants who evaluate \nwhether or not something is anti-Bush. That is not the prism through \nwhich one should evaluate whether something makes sense. I will wait to \nsee what happens today at the meeting taking place of the board. My \nhope is that they will not take action that will further injure and be \ndetrimental to public broadcasting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/20/senate-section/article/S6811-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             25TH ANNIVERSARY OF ANDRE'S FRENCH RESTAURANT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Chef Andre \nRochat, the Dean of Las Vegas Chefs. Twenty-five years ago, he opened \nthe doors to his first restaurant, Andre's French Restaurant. In the \ndecades since, he has served patrons--including my wife Landra and I--\nthe finest French cuisine in the city.\n  I first encountered Andre in the 1970s--a few years before he opened \nAndre's. At that time, he was operating the Savoy French Bakery and \nselling the most wonderful pastries you could find. Bolstered by the \nbakery's success, he opened Andre's in 1980 in a converted Spanish-\nstyle home one block east of Las Vegas Boulevard. It was an unlikely \nlocation for a restaurant--but he quickly found success.\n  Twenty-five years later, Andre's has become what some have called the \n``most honored, awarded and respected restaurant in Las Vegas.'' The \nrestaurant's intimate dining rooms, wonderful food and outstanding \nservice have made it a landmark.\n  Andre's arrival in our city was the result of hard work and \ndetermination.\n  He was born in the Savoie region of the French Alps and inherited a \nlove for his trade from his parents, who owned a delicatessen and \nbutcher shop. At 14, Andre left home and began an apprenticeship at \nLeon de Lyon, in Lyon, France. After serving in the French Navy, Andre \ncame to the United States in 1965, landing in Boston with just $5 and \nhis knives. Eventually, he made his way to Las Vegas and forever \nchanged the city's dining scene.\n  Today Las Vegas is home to many great chefs. But Andre was one of the \nfirst. He now has two more restaurants in the city, and both of them \ncontinue in the award winning tradition begun by Andre's French \nRestaurant 25 years ago.\n  I congratulate Andre on 25 great years and thank him for sharing his \noutstanding gifts. Las Vegas is privileged to be able to enjoy his \nworld-renowned talents, and it won't be long before Landra and I return \nto Andre's to enjoy our favorite meal, the Imported Dover Sole Sauteed \nVeronique with Lemon Tarts for dessert.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/20/senate-section/article/S6811-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6811-S6812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DRAKE DeLANOY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Drake DeLanoy \nof Las Vegas, NV as he reaches two incredible milestones in life: his \n55th wedding annirersary and his 77th birthday. For four decades, Drake \nhas been a friend and mentor of mine, and I wish him and his wife \nJackie all the best as they mark these two occasions.\n  Drake DeLanoy was raised in Reno. He graduated from the university of \nNevada, Reno, and married Jackie on June 19, 1950. Drake earned his law \ndegree from Denver University.\n  Following law school, Drake served in the United States Air Force and \neventually returned to Nevada to practice law, which is where I had the \ngood fortune of working with him.\n  Drake and I practiced together for 13 years, beginning in the mid-\n1960s. When we started working together, I was right out of law school \nand an inexperienced attorney. But Drake and his partners William \nSingleton and Rex Jameson took me under their wing.\n  These three men were great teachers who gave me the freedom to learn \nand grow. They let me take the legal cases I wanted to pursue, and they \nallowed me to watch them in the courtroom\n\n[[Page S6812]]\n\nand observe them work during trials. They also gave me the opportunity \nto be politically involved, and I have no doubt that the freedom and \nsupport I enjoyed with them allowed me to serve and now be in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  At the age of 77, Drake DeLanoy continues to build on his strong \ncareer. As an appointee of the Governor, Drake now serves on the \nGoverning Board of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, which protects \nand preserves the beauty of the Tahoe basin.\n  I will forever be grateful to Drake DeLanoy. The lessons he taught \nand the experiences he provided have stayed with me all these years.\n  As Drake and Jackie celebrate their 55th anniversary and Drake looks \nforward to another year, I congratulate them both and wish them many \nmore years of happiness together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/20/senate-section/article/S6812-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      lance corporal chad maynard\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to remember one of \nColorado's fallen heroes, Marine LCpl Chad Bryant Maynard who was \nkilled last week in Ar Ramadi, Iraq. He was only 19 years old.\n  Lance Corporal Maynard hailed from Montrose, CO, on the Western \nSlope. Growing up, it was his dream to serve his country. Chad \nMaynard's deep patriotism was a family tradition--his father served in \nthe Marines, and his brother Jacob returned from his second tour in \nIraq a few months ago.\n  As a high school student, Chad had secretly contacted recruiters when \nhe was 16 about his wish to join the Marines. His parents remember him \nsneaking recruiting brochures into the house. The recruiters had to ask \nhim to stop contacting them until he was 18.\n  But Lance Corporal Maynard was determined to serve his country. He \njoined the junior ROTC at Montrose High School. One of his friends once \nquipped, ``God rested on the seventh day and on the eighth day made \nMaynard for the Marines. . . .'' He worked hard at his classes so he \ncould graduate early to go to boot camp. At his 2004 graduation from \nMontrose High, Chad Maynard stood proudly in his Marine Corps dress \nuniform.\n  Lance Corporal Maynard's friends and instructors remember him as a \nyoung man who took his commitment to his country very seriously. On \nSeptember 11, Lance Corporal Maynard organized a prayer around the \nflagpole at school. He sought out the Marines because he wanted to be \non the front lines, making a difference for his country.\n  Today in Montrose is the funeral for Lance Corporal Maynard. Just 1 \nyear and 6 days after he picked up his diploma, Chad Maynard was taken \nfrom us, a life of extraordinary promise snuffed out all too soon. He \nserved his Nation with honor and distinction.\n  LCpl Chad Maynard set an example for all those around him to follow \nand left a positive mark on every life he touched. Chad's brave and \nselfless actions have made the world a better and safer place for all \nof us and we owe him a debt of gratitude which we will never be able to \npay. To his wife Becky and their soon-to-be-born child, I send my \nhumble thanks for Chad's sacrifice on our behalf. Your family will \nremain in my thoughts and prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/20/senate-section/article/S6812-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I speak about the need for hate crimes \nlegislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes \nlegislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, \nsending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our \nsociety. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight \na separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  A 17-year-old transgender woman and her 18-year-old friend were shot \nin the head while sitting in a SUV, which was set on fire. The SUV was \nfound in an isolated parking lot after the two had been missing for a \nday. Their bodies were burned beyond recognition. The perpetrator \nallegedly killed the two victims when he discovered that one of them \nwas a crossdresser.\n  The Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them \nagainst the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law Enforcement \nEnhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that \nby passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/20/senate-section/article/S6812-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY IN DARFUR\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, Senator Brownback and I have submitted a \nresolution to designate July 15-17, 2005 as a National Weekend of \nPrayer and Reflection to draw attention to the genocide and Crimes \nAgainst Humanity occurring in Darfur, Sudan, and to find a solution to \nthis great moral challenge. The resolution calls upon the people of the \nUnited States to pray and reflect. Churches, synagogues, mosques, other \ncommunities of faith, and all individuals of compassion will join \ntogether to acknowledge, observe, and reflect upon the crimes against \nhumanity that continue to occur in Darfur, so that we can together end \nthe genocide and bring about lasting peace to Sudan.\n  The Congress and administration have already defined the atrocities \nin Darfur as genocide. Estimates of the death toll range from 180,000 \nto 400,000. More than two million people have been displaced from their \nhomes, including over 200,000 refugees in Chad. Recent accounts of \nthese atrocities, as reported by Doctors without Borders, include \ndocumented rapes by soldiers and government-backed militia.\n  Many religious and human rights leaders, communities, and \ninstitutions throughout the world have already spoken out, and called \nfor an end to the genocide. In my own state, thousands participated in \na Darfur Sabbath Weekend on May 14-15, 2005, when clergy and \ncongregations throughout New Jersey addressed this crisis during their \nworship services. With my friend and colleague Representative Donald \nPayne, I was privileged to visit a mosque, a synagogue, a Catholic \nrectory, an African American Baptist Church and a United Methodist \nChurch during those two days.\n  Whatever the denomination, we spoke to each other in the same \nlanguage, and committed ourselves to the same determination to act \naccording to our words and the dictates of our universal conscience. \nThat profound experience impels me to this broader outreach. I want to \ntake this opportunity to urge my fellow members of Congress to join me \nin saying, ``never again.'' Never again, will we accept the slaughter \nof fellow human beings. Never again, will we stand by as systematic \ncrimes are inflicted upon humanity. I ask that you join me, Senator \nBrownback and people all across the globe in supporting this unified \nmovement to tell the world that humanity will never again allow \ngenocide to occur.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/20/senate-section/article/S6812-4", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6812-S6813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL HISTORY DAY\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I salute today the students who \nparticipated in the National History Day national contest that was held \nlast week at the University of Maryland. More than 700,000 students in \ngrades 6 through 12 from all over the country chose topics, researched, \nand presented their projects at State and local competitions this year. \nI am proud that 52 students from Tennessee made it to Washington. I \nespecially want to recognize two of those students, Daniel Jordan and \nTyler Sexton, eighth graders at St. John Neumann School in Knoxville.\n  Their National History Day project is a documentary on Sequoyah's \nSyllabary, which they presented at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. \nSequoyah was a Cherokee warrior who was born in east Tennessee and \ncreated a syllabary, which is often called the Cherokee alphabet. He \nwas born in 1776 in the village of Tuskeegee, which was very near \nVonore, TN, where the Sequoyah Birthplace Museum is located.\n  Daniel and Tyler say the seed for their documentary was planted \nduring a visit to the Sequoyah Birthplace Museum. The two boys got \ntired and decided to sit on several bales of hay in the center of a \nfield. After a few minutes, two Cherokee approached the boys and \nexplained that they were sitting on a holy prayer circle. The boys \napologized profusely and removed themselves, but not before they \nlearned\n\n[[Page S6813]]\n\nmore from Star Medicine Woman and Elk Dreamer about the Cherokee \nIndians, especially Sequoyah and the relation to present-day culture. \nThe boys were fascinated and appreciated the kindness shown to them.\n  Along with congratulating these outstanding students, I also \nrecognize their teacher, Judy Buscetta, who is the winner of the \nNational History Day in Tennessee's Teacher of the Year award. Daniel \nsaid it best in a letter he wrote to me to let me know he was going to \nbe in Washington. He said: Without good teachers, we do not have a \nchance.\n  I am proud of Judy and Daniel and Tyler. Students and teachers like \nthem are who I had in mind when I introduced legislation along with the \ndistinguished minority leader to put the teaching of American history \nand civics back into our classrooms, so our children grow up learning \nwhat it means to be an American. I am proud that the Presidential \nacademies for teachers and congressional academies for students in \nAmerican history and civics through the Department of Education are \nbeginning this summer as a result of Congress passing and the President \nsigning that bill into law.\n  I have also introduced legislation with Senator Edward Kennedy of \nMassachusetts to create a 10-State pilot study to provide State-by-\nState comparisons of U.S. history and civics test data for 8th and 12th \ngrades administered through the National Assessment of Educational \nProgress, NAEP, to assess and improve knowledge of American history.\n  I appreciate National History Day and its commitment to improving the \nteaching and learning of American history in our schools. I also \nappreciate Daniel, Tyler and Judy, fellow Tennesseans, who are working \nto keep history alive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/20/senate-section/article/S6813-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ELIGIBILITY FOR AUTOMATIC COMPENSATION\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to \ncelebrate a landmark achievement for former nuclear weapons workers in \nIowa. Today marks the completion of an administrative process whereby \nworkers from the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, who assembled some of the \nmost significant nuclear weapons in this Nation's history and \nsubsequently developed devastating forms of cancer, will become \neligible for automatic compensation.\n  Reaching this point has been an example of both the best and the \nworst in our system of government. I first started working on this \nissue back in 1997 when I received a letter from a constituent, Bob \nAnderson, who wrote about how he and many of his former coworkers had \nbecome ill after working on nuclear weapons in Burlington, IA. I shake \nmy head every time I think of what Bob's reaction must have been when \nhe got a letter back from me, telling him that the Department of the \nArmy had assured my office that they never made nuclear weapons in \nBurlington!\n  In fact, the list of weapons that were made by Bob and 4,000 other \nIowans includes many familiar names: Polaris, Titan, Pershing, \nMinuteman the list just goes on and on. It's a tribute to the workers \nin Burlington that while the Cold War was going on, no one beyond the \nworkers at the plant--including me--ever had a clue about the work that \nwas occurring. They did their job with excellence, and they did it at \ngreat personal peril. The men and women of Burlington truly were on the \nfront lines of the Cold War. They received no medals, no thank-you's, \nno special pay. Instead, they paid a terrible price. The levels and \ntypes of cancer that have afflicted this workforce are shocking. And \nalong with these illnesses have come financial hardships--pain and \nsuffering--which family members have witnessed and nursed loved ones \nthrough--and, in too many cases, premature death.\n  Today, finally, workers from IAAP, including Bob Anderson, at long \nlast, will receive compensation. Equally importantly, at long last, \nthey have some measure of justice.\n  This has been a long process. It seems like more than seven years \nsince I brought then-Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson to the plant \nto meet with workers. It seems like more that six years since I got a \nteam from the University of Iowa School of Public Health to track and \nanalyze the illnesses that workers had developed. And it has been \nalmost five years since Congress passed the Energy Employees \nOccupational Illness Compensation Act to actually provide compensation \nto these workers.\n  For almost five years we have struggled through one of the worst \nbureaucratic processes that I have ever seen. We have been required to \ndemonstrate that no documents existed that would allow the radiation \ndoses the workers received to be accurately reconstructed. It has been \nmind-boggling that a program designed to compensate people who had been \ndeceived by the government, could put those same people through a \nsecond bureaucratic nightmare.\n  But today is a day to celebrate. It is also a time to say thank you \nfor the marvelous team effort that has made this day possible. IAAP was \nthe first facility to file a petition for automatic compensation, and \nonly the 2nd in the Nation to be approved. While I have worked hard to \nmake that happen, it simply could not have happened without the workers \nthemselves, as well as the University of Iowa scientists.\n  I would like to say a special thank you to Jack Polson, Sy Iverson, \nPaula Graham, and Vaughn Moore. It was their willingness to repeatedly \nchallenge the assumptions that were made about the work performed at \nthe plant, and about how that work was done, that forced the Government \nto acknowledge that the documents from the plant were just inadequate \nto accurately reconstruct the levels of radiation that workers were \nexposed to.\n  I also want to thank Joe Shannon, Laska Yerington, Sharon Shumaker, \nMarge Foster and Nancy Harman for there service on the Advisory Board \nhere in Burlington and Shirley Wiley and Ed Webb for their help with \nthe petition.\n  No thank-you is complete without acknowledging how fortunate we were \nto have the help of the University of Iowa team: Laurence Fuortes, Bill \nField, Kristina Venske, Howard Nicholson, Christina Nichols, Marek \nMikulski, Phyllis Scheeler, Stephanie Leonard, and Laura McCormick.\n  I would also like to thank my own staff. Alison Hart, my staffer in \nDavenport, Iowa, has put her heart into helping hundreds of workers and \ntheir families navigate this whole process.\n  I would also like to thank Peter Tyler, Lowell Unger, Michelle \nEvermore, Jenny Wing, Ellen Murray, and Beth Stein of my Washington, \nDC, staff for their years of sustained work on this effort. And a \nspecial thank you is owed to Richard Miller of the Government \nAccountability Project for his assistance and his commitment to making \nthis compensation program work.\n  Finally, I would like to thank Bob Anderson and his wife Kathy. Bob \nand Kathy have weathered the ups and downs of this process with \npatience, good humor, and great fortitude. It will be a proud day for \nme when they actually receive a compensation check in hand from the \nTreasury. It speaks volumes that a letter from one Iowan can set in \nmotion a monumental process that, in the end, will bring \nacknowledgement, compensation, and a measure of justice to so many.\n  While more than 700 former workers are still seeking compensation, \ntoday marks our first significant victory. The people who will now be \nreceiving compensation include at least 364 of those who got the most \nserious illnesses from their work at IAAP. Unfortunately, this group \nincludes far too many workers who are no longer with us. In their honor \nand in their memory, I thank all of the former workers of the Iowa Army \nAmmunition Plant for their patience, their persistence, and their \nservice to America. They are genuine patriots.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/20/senate-section/article/S6813-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6813-S6814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMMEMORATING 142 YEARS OF WEST VIRGINIA STATEHOOD\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I commemorate 142 years of \nstatehood for my State of West Virginia. In doing so, I believe that it \nis important to note my State's motto, ``Mountaineers Are Always \nFree.'' This phrase, as relevant today as it was 142 years ago, truly \nembodies a people who have done so much to contribute to our great \nNation and a State so abundant in natural beauty.\n\n[[Page S6814]]\n\n  Historically, West Virginia's magnificent landscape has nurtured and \ninspired her inhabitants, endowing willing adventurers the freedom to \nexplore, experience, and utilize her natural wonders. Native Americans \ncame to West Virginia over 9,000 years ago and established the State's \nfirst permanent settlement in present-day St. Albans. Their ancient \nartifacts and impressive monuments, such as the Grave Creek Burial \nMound, in Moundsville, serve as lasting tributes to the land's eternal \ncontributions to mankind.\n  Today, the people of West Virginia remain free to explore and enjoy \nthe State's unspoiled, majestic terrain. Mountainous views extend for \nmiles in every direction, and blend seamlessly with glades of \nrhododendron and deep river valleys.\n  Hundreds of thousands of acres of forests, such as the Monongahela \nNational Forest, blanket our State with lush plant life. West Virginia \nhas over 50 State and national parks that protect our natural habitat \nand provide recreation to millions of visitors each year. Nearly 20 \ndifferent species of endangered or threatened animals, including the \nbald eagle, have found refuge within our ecosystem.\n  Pocahontas County's pristine rivers and streams provide some of the \nbest trout fishing in the State, and offer those who visit countless \nopportunities to escape into the serenity of the Appalachian Mountains. \nThe county is known as the ``Birthplace of Rivers'' because 8 different \nrivers have headwaters there, with their only source of water being the \nfresh mountain rain.\n  In addition to the freedoms provided by West Virginia's natural \nenvironment, the citizens of West Virginia have fostered a social \nclimate of acceptance, where all are free to express their thoughts and \nbeliefs and take advantage of the benefits of a good education.\n  Booker T. Washington, following President Abraham Lincoln's \nemancipation proclamation, sought refuge in West Virginia and was \nraised in a small mining town called Malden. It was there that he was \nencouraged to follow his dream of education, and there that he \ndeveloped the skills to become one of our country's foremost educators \nand leaders.\n  Another location, the Sumner School in Parkersburg, became the \nNation's first free school for African-American children below the \nMason-Dixon. It was operated until school segregation ended in 1954 and \ncurrently houses the Sumnerite African-American History Museum.\n  In addition to these advances to freedom and education made within \nour home State, West Virginians have consistently and overwhelmingly \ndevoted their lives to protect the ideals on which this Nation was \nfounded--liberty and equality.\n  Five hundred thousand West Virginians, since the time of the Civil \nWar, have fought to protect our country in battles and conflicts all \nover the world. There are currently 200,000 veterans in West Virginia, \ngiving my State the highest per capita ratio of veterans in the Nation.\n  Such an impeccable record of devotion to freedom is not surprising \nfrom a State with origins like West Virginia. It was born out of the \nCivil War in 1863 and became the ultimate manifestation of a State's \nloyalty to our young country.\n  For 142 years West Virginians have been selfless in our love for this \nNation, and our contributions to this country are best reflected in \nPresident Abraham Lincoln's own words. As our great President Lincoln \nsaid:\n\n       We can scarcely dispense with the aid of West Virginia in \n     this struggle . . . Her brave and good men regard her \n     admission into the Union as a matter of life and death. They \n     have been true to the Union under very severe trials.\n\n  The meaning of these words, and the contributions of my State in the \ndevelopment of this country's freedom, continue to hold immense \nimportance with West Virginians today. I am proud to be a West \nVirginian. So, today, as we celebrate West Virginia's 142nd birthday, \nwe remember our history, celebrate our present, and look with hope \ntoward the future of our truly wonderful State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/20/senate-section/article/S6814-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               100TH ANNIVERSARY OF FORBES, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I salute the North Dakota \ncommunity of Forbes as it celebrates its centennial this July 2-4. Its \n100th anniversary is a testament to the resilience and dedication of \nthe 64 residents who call this North Dakota town home.\n  Located in Dickey County a few miles east of the Coteau Hills and on \nthe North Dakota border with South Dakota, Forbes is a town rich in \nNorth Dakota history even though it is the youngest town in the county. \nIt boasts the Schulstad Stone House Museum, a stone house built in 1907 \nand furnished to that time period, and the Shimmin Tveit Museum, which \nhas displays of historical artifacts from American Indians and early \nsettlers. From railroad agent and town merchant, S.F. Forbes, for whom \nthe town bears its name, to current mayor, Troy Anliker, this town has \nbeen a home on the prairie for several generations of farmers, \nranchers, and business people.\n  The southern Dickey County area where Forbes is located boasts a \ndiversified agricultural economy. The area has farmers who plant and \nharvest wheat, barley, corn, sunflowers, and soybeans, along with \nranchers who manage several prominent cattle operations. Like most of \nrural North Dakota, the area has a rich heritage in farming and \nranching.\n  As a part of the community's celebration, organizers have planned to \nhonor Forbes' centennial with food, a pickup pull, a demolition derby, \ndancing, beard and dress judging, crafts, team penning, fireworks, a \nbeer garden, a pancake breakfast, and plenty of games for kids.\n  Again, I salute the current and past residents of Forbes as they \ncelebrate this momentous occasion, and urge my colleagues to \ncongratulate Forbes and its residents on their first 100 years and wish \nthem well through the next century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/20/senate-section/article/S6814-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               100TH ANNIVERSARY OF NEKOMA, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD.

On July 9 and \n10, the residents of Nekoma, ND, will celebrate their community's \nhistory and founding.\n  Nekoma is a small town in the northeastern part of North Dakota with \na population of 51. Despite its small size, Nekoma holds an important \nplace in North Dakota's history. Charles B. Billings was the postmaster \nof the town's first post office, which opened in 1898. The town was \nnearly named Polar, but it changed after the Soo Line Railroad townsite \nwas plotted in 1905. The name Nekoma was selected by the Postal \nDepartment from a list of names submitted by the first appointed \npostmaster, Orzo B. Aldrich.\n  Nekoma is the site for America's only Safeguard ABM and Missile Site \nRadar military installations. Nicknamed the ``prairie pyramid,'' the \ninactive installation site is just northeast of the town. The SALT \ntreaty between the United States and the former Soviet Union, stated \nthat only two safeguard sites were allowed--one of which was the site \nin Nekoma, ND, and the other in Washington, DC.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Nekoma, \nND, and its residents on their first 100 years and in wishing them well \nthrough the next century. By honoring Nekoma and all the other historic \nsmall towns of North Dakota, we keep the pioneering frontier spirit \nalive for future generations.

Garrison holds an important place \nin North Dakota's history. Founded by two brothers, Cecil and Theodore \nTaylor in 1903, Garrison, like most small\n\n[[Page S6815]]\n\ntowns in North Dakota, got its start when the railroad stretched \nthroughout the State. The post office was established in June 17, 1903, \nand Garrison was organized into a city on March 20, 1916. In its early \nyears, Garrison was known as a town ``bustin' at the seams'' with gun \ncarrying rascals.\n  Today, Garrison is a magnet for sports fisherman who venture to tap \ninto the abundance of walleye prevalent in Lake Sakakawea. Garrison is \nthe host for the North Dakota's Governor's Cup Walleye Tournament that \nattracts hundreds of serious sports enthusiasts from across the \ncountry.\n  For those who call Garrison home, it is a comfortable place to live, \nwork, and play. It is certainly true, as its residents say, that it is \n``a town worth knowing from the start.'' The people of Garrison are \nenthusiastic about their community and the quality of life it offers. \nThe community has a wonderful centennial weekend planned that includes \nan all school reunion, parade, pitch fork fondue, street dance, \nfireworks, games, and much more.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating \nGarrison, ND, and its residents on their first 100 years and in wishing \nthem well through the next century.

On July 2, \n2005, the residents of Alsen, ND, will celebrate their community's \nhistory and founding.\n  Alsen is a small town in the northeastern part of North Dakota with a \npopulation of 68. Despite its size, Alsen holds an important place in \nNorth Dakota's history. In August 1905, this Soo Line Railroad townsite \nwas founded. Originally named Storlie when it was established on April \n6, 1899, the township was named after Halvor Storlie, who was the \ncounty clerk and postmaster. On August 31, 1905, officials of the Tri-\nState Land Co. plotted a town site in another area of Storlie Township, \nand named it Alsen for the local settlers, who had come from Alsen \nIsland off of the coast of Denmark. The village of Alsen was \nincorporated in 1920 and reached its peak population of 358 in 1930.\n  Alsen's citizens are very proud of the Alsen Farmers' Elevator, the \nSwiss Mennonite Church, and the Alsen Post Office.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Alsen, \nND, and its residents on their first 100 years and in wishing them well \nthrough the next century.

Students compete to demonstrate their \nknowledge, not simply of how the government works, but of why it works, \nand how it is best able to provide for the protection of its people and \ntheir natural liberties.\n  Programs such as this help to ignite the noble flame of civic duty \nand democratic spirit in the souls of our young people, and it is with \ngreat pride that I wish to commend the students of Highland High School \nfor their placing in the top 10 of the Nation and received an honorable \nmention.

On July 29, 2005, citizens of Arlington will celebrate \ntheir city's proud past and look forward to a promising future.\n  Located near the eastern border of South Dakota in Kingsbury County, \nArlington is only 35 miles from the Minnesota line. Like many towns in \nSouth Dakota, Arlington got its start with help from the railroad in \n1880. In fact, the town's original name, Nordlund, was given by the \nDakota Central Railroad, inspired by the large number of Scandinavians \nwho settled in the area. In 1884, however, the Western Town Lot Company \nobjected and the county commissioner renamed the town Denver. That \ntitle was also short lived, as one year later, in 1885, the local post \noffice insisted on again renaming the community. This time, the Dakota \nCentral Railroad chose Arlington, and 120 years later, its name \nendures.\n  Arlington's spirited residents live in the midst of some of South \nDakota's most fertile farmland, as this rural community is a dependable \ncorn producer. Additionally, Arlington's 1,000 residents have come to \ncount on The Sun, founded in 1885, for quality and accurate reporting \non local events.\n  In the twelve and a half decades since its founding, Arlington has \nproven its ability to flourish and serve farmers and ranchers \nthroughout the region. Arlington's proud residents celebrate its 125th \nanniversary on July 29, 2005, and it is with great pleasure that I \nshare with my colleagues the achievements of this great \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/20/senate-section/article/S6815-4", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6815-S6816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING THE TOWN OF WAUBAY, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to publicly recognize \nthe 125th anniversary of the founding of the city of Waubay, South \nDakota. On July 2, 2005, Waubay citizens look back on their city's \nproud past and look forward to a promising future.\n  Platted on November 16, 1880, the community was first known as \nStation #50 until later that year, when crew members of the Milwaukee \nRailroad Company named it Blue Lake. It was not until 1885 that the \ntown took on its current name of Waubay, meaning ``Nesting place of the \nbirds,'' given by the Sioux Indians. One hundred twenty five years \nlater, Waubay thrives as the oldest city in Day County.\n  Waubay, like many South Dakota towns and communities, got its start \nwith the help of the railroad. Although the rail tracks that pass \nthrough the town ran as far as Bristol and were ready for travel in \n1880, the first train to ever pass through Waubay didn't arrive until \nMay, 1881. A severe blizzard hit the region in October of 1880, and the \nsnow and subsequent run-off in the spring rendered the rail line \nimpassable.\n  The town, which was incorporated as a village in 1894 and as a city \nin 1920, grew rapidly in its early years. Station #50 began with only \n50 residents, yet\n\n[[Page S6816]]\n\nWaubay swelled to a population of 1,007 in 1925; currently, about 625 \nSouth Dakotans live in the town. By the early 1900s, the community \nboasted a general store, a lumber yard, a corner drug store, a livery \nbarn, a railroad depot, several coal sheds, the Waubay Clipper, The \nAdvocate, a power company, several banks, a creamery, several grain \nelevators, a school, and many stores.\n  In May of 1890, the Waubay Clipper, owned by Charles W. Stafford and \nhis son, published the paper's first issue. It was the only newspaper \nin town for two decades, until The Advocate began under the direction \nof Major Maynard in 1910. However, in December 1917, the Clipper \npurchased The Advocate and merged the two, again returning the \nClipper's status as Waubay's sole news publication. Despite management \nturnover over the years, Waubay residents still rely on the Clipper for \nquality and accurate reporting on local events 115 years later.\n  Prior to 1910, most Waubay residents lacked the convenience of \nelectricity. However, in 1884, officials partitioned the town into \nwards, which Roy Thompson used to his advantage in 1900 when he devised \na lighting system utilizing windmill power. In 1910, Dr. Park Jenkins, \na prominent Waubay resident, established an electricity plant in back \nof the Yellowstone Garage. Although the plant was quite successful \nduring the early portion of the 20th century, the Ottertail Power \nCompany ultimately became the primary service provider for Waubay, and \nstill maintains that role to this day.\n  Waubay was home to South Dakota's State Board of Health in the early \n1900s. Headed by Dr. Park Jenkins, who in 1913 was appointed Board \nSuperintendent, the office employed 22 people at its peak. The board \nmoved to Pierre, SD in 1933.\n  Today, Waubay is a multicultural community that includes many \nresidents of Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate, as well as those of European \ndescent. It is also home to Waubay National Wildlife Refuge, managed by \nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Waubay's location near several area \nlakes makes it a prime location for fishermen. Blue Dog State Fish \nHatchery is just one mile north of Waubay, producing walleyes, \nnortherns, perch, bass, bluegills, crappies, and trout.\n  In the twelve and a half decades since its founding, Waubay's \ninnovative and resourceful residents have proven their ability to \nthrive as a community. It is with great pleasure that it share with my \ncolleagues the admirable, pioneer spirit still present in these \nwonderful South Dakotans, as they celebrate Waubay's 125th anniversary \non July 2, 2005.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/20/senate-section/article/S6816-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING THE CITY OF EGAN, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to honor and publicly \nrecognize the town of Egan, South Dakota as it celebrates its 125th \nanniversary on July 4, 2005. It is at this time that I would like to \ndraw to my colleagues' attention the achievements and history of this \ncharming town on the prairie. Egan stands as an enduring tribute to all \nthose who had the courage to pursue their greatest dreams on the plains \nof South Dakota.\n  Egan is a small community nestled amongst the fertile farmland of \nsoutheastern South Dakota. It was founded in 1880 to service the \nMilwaukee Railroad as it made its way west through Dakota Territory. \nThe town was first incorporated by Joe Enoe, Alfred Brown, and John \nHobart. Rectangular in shape, Egan grew quickly and soon included seven \nsquare miles of Moody County, thereby encompassing a new mill on the \nBig Sioux River and the small village of Roscoe--which was, by the way, \na different community than the Roscoe, SD that exists in Edmunds County \ntoday.\n  Roscoe had been started four years earlier, in 1876, when Decatour D. \nBidwell chose the spot on the Big Sioux River for his new mill. Roscoe \nalso served as a stopping point for the numerous travelers who used a \nnearby river crossing, one of the best fords for many miles. Soon the \ntown of Roscoe boasted two restaurants, a store, a saloon, a newspaper, \nand the first courthouse in Moody County. However, due to Egan's \nincreasing growth and popularity, in addition to the railroad's new \nsturdy and reliable bridges that phased out Roscoe's river crossing, \nall that remains of the pioneer village of Roscoe is a small pasture \nscattered with pieces of millstone.\n  The Baptist and Methodist Episcopal churches were the first to be \nbuilt in the town of Egan. These two churches were constructed by all \nmembers of the community, regardless of faith or profession, in \nresponse to a promise made by Mr. Egan, the prominent railroad official \nfor whom the city is named. Mr. Egan promised a church bell to the \nfirst church with a belfry equipped to receive it. The Baptist Church \nwas the first completed, and therefore received the much-desired bell. \nWhile the bell now hangs in the tower of the Methodist Church, it is \nstill used to call worshippers to services every Sunday morning.\n  Egan experienced a great deal of economic prosperity in the early \ntwentieth century. In 1904, Egan boasted nearly seven hundred people \nand more than fifty prosperous business enterprises. These included a \nstate bank, three hotels, two hardware stores, an implement house, four \ngrain elevators, six general stores, a flourishing mill, two lumber \nyards, two doctors, a newspaper, a furniture store, and an opera house.\n  The curtailment of the railroad, better roads providing alternate \nroutes that sidestepped Egan, and the rise of more modern methods of \ntransportation fostered travel to larger towns in the state, thus \nmaking it more difficult for businesses in Egan to draw in customers. \nNevertheless, technology and progress can never undermine the firm \nresolve and remarkable work ethic that is characteristic of the great \npeople of this country's heartland. The vision of those individuals who \nhad the courage to make a home for themselves on the plains of the \nDakotas serves as inspiration to all those who believe in the honest \npursuit of their dreams. On July 4, 2005, the 257 proud residents of \nEgan will celebrate their vibrant history and the legacy of the pioneer \nspirit with the 125th anniversary of the city's founding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/20/senate-section/article/S6816-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams: one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/20/senate-section/article/S6816-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/20/senate-section/article/S6816-4", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6816-S6817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT OF THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \n   THE RISK OF NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION CREATED BY THE ACCUMULATION OF \n    WEAPONS-USABLE FISSILE MATERIAL IN THE TERRITORY OF THE RUSSIAN \n                           FEDERATION--PM-13\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Reqister and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice to the Federal Reqister for publication, stating that \nthe emergency declared with respect to the accumulation of a large \nvolume of weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of the \nRussian Federation is to continue beyond June 21, 2005. The most recent \nnotice continuing this emergency was published in the Federal Reqister \non June 18, 2004 (69 FR 34047).\n  It remains a major national security goal of the United States to \nensure\n\n[[Page S6817]]\n\nthat fissile material removed from Russian nuclear weapons pursuant to \nvarious arms control and disarmament agreements is dedicated to \npeaceful uses, subject to transparency measures, and protected from \ndiversion to activities of proliferation concern. The accumulation of a \nlarge volume of weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of the \nRussian Federation continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary \nthreat to the national security and foreign policy of the United \nStates.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Hawaii relative to Social Security reform; to \n     the Committee on Finance.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 76\n\n       Whereas, Social Security is our country's most important \n     and successful income protection program and provides \n     economic security to workers, retirees, persons with \n     disabilities, and the surviving spouses and keiki of deceased \n     workers; and\n       Whereas, Social Security provides essential benefits to \n     over 195,000 people in Hawaii, including 139,300 retired \n     workers, 16,090 widows and widowers, 16,790 disabled workers \n     and 13,630 children; and\n       Whereas, Social Security has reduced the poverty rate of \n     our kupuna from over thirty per cent down to 10.2 per cent in \n     the last forty years, and without Social Security, thirty-\n     four per cent of elderly women in Hawaii would be poor; and\n       Whereas, six out of ten of today's beneficiaries derive \n     more than half of their income from Social Security, and in \n     most low-income households of retirement age, Social Security \n     represents eighty per cent or more of their retirement \n     income; and\n       Whereas, the Social Security Trust Fund is large enough to \n     pay one hundred per cent of promised benefits until 2042, and \n     after that, seventy-three per cent of benefits could still be \n     paid; and\n       Whereas, proposals are being considered in Washington, D.C. \n     that would privatize Social Security and threaten the \n     retirement security of millions of Americans and their \n     families; and\n       Whereas, diverting more than one-third of the 6.2 per cent \n     of wages that workers currently contribute to Social Security \n     into private accounts drains money from Social Security and \n     will cut guaranteed benefits; and\n       Whereas, diverting money from Social Security will increase \n     the national debt by almost $2 trillion over the next ten \n     years--a debt that will be passed on to future generations; \n     and\n       Whereas, privatization is particularly harmful to women and \n     minorities who rely most on Social Security by replacing a \n     portion of a secure benefit with investment risk--a risk that \n     they cannot afford; and\n       Whereas, widows would experience enormous cuts under \n     privatization--reducing their Social Security from $829 to \n     $456 per month, which is only sixty-three per cent of the \n     poverty level, even when proceeds from private accounts are \n     included in the total; and\n       Whereas, private accounts do not provide the lifetime, \n     inflation-adjusted benefit that Social Security does, and \n     they can be depleted by long life and market fluctuation; and\n       Whereas, Social Security needs to be strengthened now for \n     our children and grandchildren, but the solution should not \n     be worse than the problem; and\n       Whereas, the Social Security System also needs to be \n     changed sensibly in order to honor obligations to future \n     generations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate of the Twenty-third Legislature of \n     the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2005, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, That the Hawaii State Legislature \n     opposes the privatization of Social Security and urges \n     Hawaii's congressional delegation to reject such proposed \n     changes to the Social Security System; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President Pro Tempore of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and each member of Hawaii's congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-112. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Hawaii \n     relative to the privatization of Social Security; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 100\n\n       Whereas, people throughout human history have faced \n     uncertainties, especially those uncertainties brought on by \n     death, disability, and old age; and\n       Whereas, prior to the turn of the twentieth century, the \n     majority of individuals living in the United States lived and \n     worked on farms, relying in part on immediate and extended \n     family, friends, and neighbors to provide them with economic \n     and social security; and\n       Whereas, as the United States moved through the Industrial \n     Revolution and became an industrial power, increasing numbers \n     of individuals began moving to the cities and suburbs where \n     employment opportunities abounded; and\n       Whereas, this migration from the farmlands to the \n     industrial centers of the United States reduced the degree to \n     which a person's immediate and extended family and neighbors \n     could augment the economic security of those living in the \n     cities and suburbs; and\n       Whereas, with the stock market crash in 1929 and the \n     beginning of the Great Depression, the United States found \n     its economy in crisis and individuals in this country, \n     especially elder Americans, were faced with economic \n     hardships never before seen; and\n       Whereas, in an address to Congress on June 8, 1934, \n     President Franklin Delano Roosevelt stating that he intended \n     to provide a program for the social security of Americans, \n     subsequently created, by Executive Order, the Committee on \n     Economic Security (Committee), with instructions to study the \n     problem of economic insecurity and make recommendations for \n     legislative consideration; and\n       Whereas, in 1935, six months after its establishment, the \n     Committee made its report to the President and Congress, who \n     after deliberations and compromise, enacted the Social \n     Security Act of 1935, which created a social insurance \n     program designed to pay retirees age 65 or older a continuing \n     income after retirement, and to keep these retirees out of \n     poverty; and\n       Whereas, Social Security taxes were collected for the first \n     time in 1937, with initial lump-sum payments being made that \n     first month and regular monthly benefit payments being made \n     beginning in January, 1940; and\n       Whereas, today, Social Security provides a guaranteed \n     income for more than 147 million retirees, family members of \n     workers who have died, and persons with disabilities; and\n       Whereas, Social Security beneficiaries earn their benefits \n     by paying into the system throughout their years of \n     employment, and currently serves as the main source of income \n     for a majority of retirees, with over two-thirds of retirees \n     currently dependent on Social Security for financial \n     survival; and\n       Whereas, for the past 70 years Social Security has remained \n     solvent and has been able to pay benefits to millions of \n     Americans with few adjustments; and\n       Whereas, although the Social Security trustees state that \n     in its present form, Social Security has enough funds in its \n     reserve to be able to meet 100 percent of its obligations \n     until 2042 and, there is concern over the solvency of the \n     current Social Security system and whether it will be able to \n     pay benefits for the millions of Americans scheduled to \n     retire over the next decade; and\n       Whereas, individuals who support efforts to reform Social \n     Security are currently reviewing a three-prong approach \n     including raising of the retirement age, increasing the \n     maximum annual earnings subject to Social Security tax, and \n     allowing the establishment of voluntary private investment \n     accounts; and\n\n[[Page S6818]]\n\n       Whereas, the current focus on the national level has been \n     the establishment of private investment accounts to allow \n     taxpayers to put a portion of their social security tax into \n     stocks, bonds, and other investments that may pay them a \n     higher return and increase their retirement benefits; and\n       Whereas, contrary to the original purpose of Social \n     Security, which established a comprehensive and secure safety \n     net to keep retirees out of poverty, private investment \n     accounts may result in Social Security beneficiaries with \n     poor returns on their investments to fall through the cracks \n     of the system; and\n       Whereas, the costs of transitioning to this system of \n     private investment accounts may effectively scuttle the \n     current Social Security system; and\n       Whereas, it has been estimated that transitioning to a \n     system of private investment accounts will generate costs as \n     high as $2-$3 trillion, which will degrade any investment \n     earnings of these private accounts; and\n       Whereas, diverting a portion of Social Security money to \n     private accounts will leave fewer dollars available to pay \n     Social Security benefits, and reduce system reserves and the \n     cash on hand to pay beneficiaries; and\n       Whereas, it has further been estimated that by allowing for \n     the establishment of private investment accounts, the current \n     Social Security trust fund reserves could be wiped out by \n     2021, a full 20 years sooner than if the system had been left \n     alone; and\n       Whereas, arguments have also been made that the way to \n     ``fix'' Social Security is not to change the system and its \n     purpose, but rather to help individuals establish their own \n     private pensions and retirement savings accounts such as \n     Individual Retirement Accounts, to supplement the guaranteed \n     benefit of Social Security; and\n       Whereas, with the myriad of difficult choices to be made to \n     keep the Social Security system solvent, and given the fact \n     that the Social Security system will still be solvent for a \n     good number of years, the issue of strengthening Social \n     Security and making any changes or adjustments to the system \n     should be carefully studied and planned to ensure that future \n     generations will be provided the retirement security received \n     by past generations; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2005, that this body hereby urges President George W. Bush to \n     reconsider his plans to hurriedly enter into a Social \n     Security privatization plan; and be it further\n       Resolved, that this body also urges President George W. \n     Bush to carefully study the effects that privatization may \n     have on the basic purpose of Social Security, and on the \n     welfare of current and future beneficiaries, and to consider \n     privatization within a comprehensive review of alternative \n     methods of adjusting Social Security, such as raising the \n     retirement age, increasing the maximum annual earnings \n     subject to Social Security tax, and helping more individuals \n     establish supplementary private pension and retirement \n     savings accounts; and be it further\n       Resolved, that certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the members of \n     Hawaii's congressional delegation, and the Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-113. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Utah \n     relative to the privatization of Social Security; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                           House Resolution 3\n\n       Whereas, demographic changes and cost increases will drain \n     the existing Social Security system;\n       Whereas, without significant changes to the system, costs \n     will exceed revenues starting in 2018 and the system may not \n     be able to pay any benefits by 2042;\n       Whereas, anyone born after the year 1970 will not receive \n     full Social Security benefits if changes are not made to the \n     system;\n       Whereas, not reforming the system will require a tax \n     increase on every working American or a benefit cut; and\n       Whereas, allowing younger workers to invest a portion of \n     their income in personal retirement accounts will avoid any \n     benefit cuts or tax increases: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the House of Representatives of the State of \n     Utah urges Utah's congressional delegation to oppose \n     increases in payroll taxes and cuts in Social Security \n     benefits; and be it further\n       Resolved, that the House of Representatives urges Utah's \n     congressional delegation to support optional Social Security \n     Personal Retirement Accounts; and be it further\n       Resolved, that a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     members of Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-114. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Utah \n     relative to the United States entering into a Free Trade Area \n     of the Americas; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                           House Resolution 9\n\n       Whereas, the United States of America has always been the \n     world leader in pushing for free trade, which is a hallmark \n     of our capitalistic society;\n       Whereas, free trade only thrives where there is a level \n     playing field of government regulations between trading \n     partners;\n       Whereas, the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement \n     (NAFTA) was supposed to bring additional prosperity to the \n     United States and level the playing field with Canada and \n     Mexico, thus perpetuating free trade between our nations;\n       Whereas, notwithstanding the good intentions of NAFTA, our \n     nation has suffered the loss of almost 900,000 jobs due to \n     NAFTA, many of them coming in the manufacturing sector;\n       Whereas, manufacturing jobs in the United States have \n     plunged from 19.3 million in 1980 to only about 14.6 million \n     today, in large part because of these types of trade issues;\n       Whereas, the United States has gone from a trade surplus \n     with Mexico prior to NAFTA to a substantial trade deficit;\n       Whereas, the United States is a current member of the World \n     Trade Organization (WTO), which has been called ``The United \n     Nations of World Trade'';\n       Whereas, the United States consistently bows to the wishes \n     of the WTO, only proving the words of Texas Congressman Ron \n     Paul to be prophetic: ``The most important reason why we \n     should get out [of the WTO] is to maintain our nation's \n     sovereignty. We should never deliver to any international \n     governing body the authority to dictate what our laws should \n     be. And this is precisely the kind of power that has been \n     given to the WTO.'';\n       Whereas, both the WTO and NAFTA, through the use of trade \n     tribunals, now claim the sovereign authority to overrule \n     decisions of American courts and make awards to foreign \n     businesses for violations of trade agreements;\n       Whereas, Abner Mikva, a former chief judge on the federal \n     appellate bench and a former congressman, has stated: ``If \n     Congress had known there was anything like this in NAFTA, \n     they never would have voted for it.'';\n       Whereas, the United States is considering entering into a \n     new 34-member Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) in 2005; \n     and\n       Whereas, based upon the experience that the United States \n     has had with NAFTA and the WTO, United States membership in \n     the planned FTAA would increase manufacturing flight in the \n     state of Utah and throughout the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that House of Representatives of the state of \n     Utah respectfully but firmly urges all members of the United \n     States Congress to vote no on any agreement for the United \n     States to enter into a Free Trade Area of the Americas \n     (FTAA); and be it further\n       Resolved, that the House of Representatives of the state of \n     Utah urges the United States Congress to not enter into the \n     FTAA until the United States has had more experience with and \n     a greater understanding of the impacts of NAFTA and the World \n     Trade Organization (WTO); and be it further\n       Resolved, that a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     Majority Leader of the United Sates Senate, Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of Utah's \n     congressional delegation, the World Trade Organization (WTO), \n     and the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-115. A joint resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Utah relative to United States \n     trade negotiations; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                         House Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, although the United States Constitution places the \n     regulation of trade with foreign countries within the \n     prerogative of the Federal Government, the primary \n     responsibility for protecting public health, welfare, and \n     safety is left to the states;\n       Whereas, the United States Congress has consistently \n     recognized, respected, and preserved the states' power to \n     protect the health, welfare, and environments of their states \n     and their citizens in a variety of statutes, such as the \n     Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Safe Drinking Water Act;\n       Whereas, it is vital that the Federal Government not agree \n     to proposals in the current negotiations on trade in services \n     that might in any way preempt or undercut this reserved state \n     authority;\n       Whereas, proposed changes should not, in the name of \n     promoting increased international trade, accord insufficient \n     regard for existing regulatory, tax and subsidy policies, and \n     the social, economic, and environmental values those policies \n     promote;\n       Whereas, statutes and regulations that the states and local \n     governments have validly adopted, that are plainly \n     constitutional and within their province to adopt, and that \n     reflect locally appropriate responses to the needs of their \n     citizens, should not be overridden by federal decisions \n     solely in the interests of increased trade;\n       Whereas, states are concerned about retaining a proper \n     scope for state regulatory authority in actual commitments in \n     agreements with one or more United States' trading partners;\n       Whereas, it is crucial to maintain the principle that the \n     United States may request, but not require, states to alter \n     their regulatory regimes in areas over which they hold \n     constitutional authority;\n       Whereas, if the United States makes broader offers later in \n     the negotiations and the legislation is ``fast tracked,'' \n     there will be little opportunity for states to have improper \n     positions reversed;\n       Whereas, it is critical that there be full and effective \n     coordination and consultation\n\n[[Page S6819]]\n\n     with the states before the United States Trade Representative \n     (USTR) makes any binding commitments;\n       Whereas, while the State Point of Contact system was meant \n     to create a clearly marked channel for two-way \n     communications, the reality has not lived up to those \n     intentions;\n       Whereas, a broader and deeper range of contacts with a \n     variety of state entities, particularly with those bearing \n     regulatory and legislative authority, must be improved and \n     maintained over the next several years;\n       Whereas, it is important for state authorities to engage \n     with the USTR in the communications process and to respond to \n     timely requests in any equally timely manner;\n       Whereas, as negotiations with other nations continue, they \n     should also be conducted in ways that will avoid litigation \n     in world courts;\n       Whereas, the United States is the signatory to the World \n     Trade Organization's General Agreement on Trade in Services \n     (GATS);\n       Whereas, the United States Trade Representative has \n     published proposals that would apply trade rules under GATS \n     to regulation of electricity by state and local governments;\n       Whereas, these proposals would cover regulation of services \n     related to transmission, distribution, and access of energy \n     traders to the grid and, if implemented, might conflict with \n     state energy policy and alter the balance of domestic \n     authority between states and the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission (FERC);\n       Whereas, concerns include the impact of market access rules \n     on the structure of Regional Transmission Organization (RTO), \n     state jurisdiction over utilities that are part of an RTO, \n     RTO contracts for reliability of the electricity grid, and \n     potential roles for the RTO to structure or facilitate \n     wholesale trade and brokering services;\n       Whereas, another question is the impact national treatment \n     rules may have on tax incentives to produce wind energy, and \n     market access rules that may impact renewable portfolio \n     standards that mandate minimum quotas for acquisition from \n     renewable sources;\n       Whereas, another question is the impact that GATS rules on \n     domestic regulation may have on rate setting and the public \n     interest standard for exercising regulatory authority by \n     state public utility commissions; and\n       Whereas, in early 2004, a working group of state and local \n     officials consulted three times with staff of the USTR who \n     described the meeting as timely, productive, and \n     unprecedented; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of the state of Utah urges \n     the United States Trade Representative to conduct trade \n     negotiations in a manner that will preserve the \n     responsibility of states to develop their own regulatory \n     structures and that will avoid litigation in world courts, \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of the state of Utah urges \n     the USTR to take further steps to enhance the level of \n     consultation before negotiations commence on any trade \n     commitments under the World Trade Organization's General \n     Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS); and be it further\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of the state of Utah \n     commends the USTR staff for its willingness to consult with \n     the working group and learn about the potential impact of \n     GATS rules on state and local regulation of the energy \n     sector; and be it further\n       Resolved, that the Legislature urges the USTR to disclose \n     to the public the United States' requests for GATS \n     commitments from other nations, and be it further\n       Resolved, that the Legislature urges the USTR to give prior \n     notice of the next United States' offer or counter offer for \n     GATS commitments so that state and local governments have \n     time to discuss its potential impact; and be it further\n       Resolved, that the Legislature urges the USTR to \n     participate in public discussions of trade policy and energy; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, that a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     United States Senate Finance Committee, the House Ways and \n     Means Committee, the Senate Subcommittee on International \n     Trade, the House Subcommittee on Trade, the Secretary of the \n     Department of Energy, the United States Trade Representative, \n     the National Association of Attorneys General, the National \n     Conference of State Legislatures, the President of the United \n     States, and Utah's Congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Utah relative to the United \n     States entering into a Free Trade Area of the Americas; to \n     the Committee on Finance.\n\n                          Senate Resolution 1\n\n       Whereas, the United States of America has always been the \n     world leader in pushing for free trade, which is a hallmark \n     of our capitalistic society;\n       Whereas, free trade only thrives where there is a level \n     playing field of government regulations between trading \n     partners;\n       Whereas, the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement \n     (NAFTA) was supposed to bring additional prosperity to the \n     United States and level the playing field with Canada and \n     Mexico, thus perpetuating free trade between our nations;\n       Whereas, notwithstanding the good intentions of NAFTA, our \n     nation has suffered the loss of almost 900,000 jobs due to \n     NAFTA, many of them coming in the manufacturing sector;\n       Whereas, manufacturing jobs in the United States have \n     plunged from 19.3 million in 1980 to only about 14.6 million \n     today, in large part because of these types of trade issues;\n       Whereas, the United States has gone from a trade surplus \n     with Mexico prior to NAFTA to a substantial trade deficit;\n       Whereas, the United States is a current member of the World \n     Trade Organization (WTO), which has been called ``The United \n     Nations of World Trade'';\n       Whereas, the United States consistently bows to the wishes \n     of the WTO, only proving the words of Texas Congressman Ron \n     Paul to be prophetic: ``The most important reason why we \n     should get out [of the WTO] is to maintain our nation's \n     sovereignty. We should never deliver to any international \n     governing body the authority to dictate what our laws should \n     be. And this is precisely the kind of power that has been \n     given to the WTO'';\n       Whereas, both the WTO and NAFTA, through the use of trade \n     tribunals, now claim the sovereign authority to overrule \n     decisions of American courts and make awards to foreign \n     businesses for violations of trade agreements;\n       Whereas, Abner Mikva, a former chief judge on the federal \n     appellate bench and a former congressman, has stated: ``If \n     Congress had known there was anything like this in NAFTA, \n     they never would have voted for it'';\n       Whereas, the United States is considering entering into a \n     new 34-member Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) in 2005; \n     and\n       Whereas, based upon the experience that the United States \n     has had with NAFTA and the WTO, United States membership in \n     the planned FTAA would increase manufacturing flight in the \n     state of Utah and throughout the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the Senate of the state of Utah respectfully \n     but firmly urges all members of the United States Congress to \n     vote no on any agreement for the United States to enter into \n     a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) at this time; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, that the Senate of the state of Utah urges the \n     United States Congress to not enter into the FTAA until the \n     United States has had more experience and greater \n     understanding of the impacts of NAFTA and the World Trade \n     Organization (WTO); and be it further\n       Resolved, that a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     Majority Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, the members of \n     Utah's congressional delegation, the World Trade Organization \n     (WTO), and the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-117. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah relative to Medicaid reform; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 15\n\n       Whereas, the Medicaid program provides access to health \n     care for Utah's most vulnerable citizens, including low-\n     income children, parents, pregnant women, people with \n     disabilities, and senior citizens;\n       Whereas, growth in Medicaid spending per capita has \n     remained relatively low when compared to private health \n     insurance premiums;\n       Whereas, current federal and state Medicaid expenditures \n     are growing at a rate of 12% per year and averaging almost \n     22% of states' annual budgets primarily because of the recent \n     economic downturn, rising health care costs, and an increase \n     in the aging population; and\n       Whereas, new funding challenges for state government will \n     become more acute as states absorb new costs to help \n     implement the Medicaid Modernization Act: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of the state of Utah urges \n     the United States Congress to reject any budget reduction and \n     budget reconciliation process for fiscal year 2006 related to \n     Medicaid reform that would shift additional costs to the \n     states; and be it further\n       Resolved, that the Legislature urges the United States \n     Congress to reject any cap on federal funding for the \n     Medicaid program, whether in the form of an allotment, an \n     allocation, or a block grant; and be it further\n       Resolved, that the Legislature urges the United States \n     Congress to work with state policymakers to enact reforms \n     that will result in Medicaid cost savings for both the states \n     and the Federal Government; and be it further\n       Resolved that the Legislature urges the United States \n     Congress to establish a benefits program for the ``dual \n     eligible'' population, people eligible for both Medicaid and \n     Medicare, that would be 100% funded by Medicare instead of \n     Medicaid; and be it further\n       Resolved, that a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     Majority Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, and to the \n     members of Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-118.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii relative to national park \n     status for the Kawainui Marsh Complex; to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 51\n\n       Whereas, the Convention on Wetlands was signed on February \n     2, 1971 in Ramsar, Iran; and\n       Whereas, in 1987, the United States joined the Ramsar \n     Convention, an international treaty that aims at halting the \n     worldwide loss of wetlands and to conserve those that remain; \n     and\n       Whereas, the treaty's one hundred forty-four contracting \n     parties have designated one thousand four hundred four \n     wetlands sites totaling more than three hundred million acres \n     for inclusion in the Ramsar List of Wetlands of International \n     Importance; and\n       Whereas, despite the great value of wetlands, they have \n     been shrinking worldwide, including in the United States; and\n       Whereas, on Earth Day 2004, President George W. Bush \n     announced an aggressive new national initiative to create, \n     improve, and protect at least three million wetland acres \n     over the next five years in order to increase overall wetland \n     acreage and quality; and\n       Whereas, wetlands are a source of water, food, recreation, \n     transportation, and, in some places, are part of the local \n     religious and cultural heritage. They provide groundwater \n     replenishment, benefiting inhabitants of entire watersheds; \n     and\n       Whereas, wetlands play a vital role in storm and flood \n     protection and water filtration. In addition, they provide a \n     rich feeding ground for migratory birds, fish, and other \n     animals; and\n       Whereas, the United States designated three new Ramsar \n     sites last month: the two thousand five hundred-acre Tijuana \n     River National Estuarine Research Reserve in San Diego \n     County, California; the one hundred sixty thousand-acre \n     Grassland Ecological Area in western Merced County, \n     California; and the one thousand-acre Kawainui and Hamakua \n     Marsh Complex located on the northeast coast of the island of \n     Oahu; and\n       Whereas, these additional sites bring the total number of \n     United States Ramsar sites to twenty-two, covering nearly 3.2 \n     million acres: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate of the Twenty-third Legislature of \n     the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2005, that the State \n     of Hawaii's elected Representatives and Senators in the \n     United States Congress are respectfully requested to support, \n     work to pass, and vote for National Park protection for the \n     one thousand-acre Kawainui and Hamakua Marsh Complex located \n     on the northeast coast of the island of Oahu; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, that certified copies of this Senate Resolution \n     be transmitted to the President of the United States, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the State of \n     Hawaii's Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-121.

and\n       Whereas, in light of all the benefits that participation \n     could bring to the state of health of people not only in \n     Taiwan, but also regionally and globally it seems \n     appropriate, if not imperative, for Taiwan to be involved \n     with the WHO: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the House of Representatives of the state of \n     Utah urges the Bush Administration to support Taiwan and its \n     23 million people in obtaining appropriate and meaningful \n     participation in the World Health Organization (WHO); and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, that the House of Representatives urges that \n     United States' policy should include the pursuit of some \n     initiative in the WHO which would give Taiwan meaningful \n     participation in a manner that is consistent with the \n     organization's requirements;

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada relative to the Community Services Block \n     Grant Program; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \n     and Pensions.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 13\n\n       Whereas, The Community Services Block Grant program, \n     administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, \n     was created by the federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act \n     of 1981 and is designed to provide a range of services to \n     address the needs of low-income persons to ameliorate the \n     causes and conditions of poverty; and\n       Whereas, The money allocated by the program is used to \n     provide services that assist such persons in attaining the \n     skills, knowledge and motivation necessary to achieve self-\n     sufficiency and may also be used to provide the immediate \n     necessities of life such as food, shelter and medicine; and\n       Whereas, Throughout the nation, local governments have \n     created more than 1,080 Community Action Agencies as public \n     or private entities to channel the money provided by the \n     Community Services Block Grant program into communities to \n     coordinate resources and empower communities in rural and \n     urban areas; and\n       Whereas, In Nevada, each dollar received by Community \n     Action Agencies leverages at least $19 brought in from other \n     sources, and this money is reinvested in the business \n     communities of Nevada, thus enhancing the economic vitality \n     as well as the social fabric of the entire State; and\n       Whereas, Using money provided by the Community Services \n     Block Grant program, Community Action Agencies in this State \n     not only assist low-income persons in obtaining employment, \n     training, education, including participation in Head Start, \n     energy assistance, senior services, and health and nutrition \n     benefits, but the Agencies also acquire the infrastructure to \n     develop affordable housing projects, assist first-time home \n     buyers in paying down-payment and closing costs, and help \n     senior citizens repair their homes; and\n       Whereas, When such activities relating to housing are \n     considered, the leverage for each federal dollar received by \n     the State of Nevada increases up to $29; and\n       Whereas, The proposed federal budget for Fiscal Year 2006 \n     recommends the elimination of the Community Services Block \n     Grant program; and\n       Whereas, The elimination of the program would negatively \n     impact not only the residents of Nevada but citizens all \n     across the United States and would significantly hinder the \n     ability of Community Action Agencies and other businesses to \n     improve the economic viability of families and businesses, \n     hurting those in need and lessening their ability to live a \n     decent life; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That the members of the 73rd Session of the Nevada \n     Legislature urge Congress to preserve the Community Services \n     Block Grant program as an independent program administered by \n     the Department of Health and Human Services and to \n     appropriate money for the program for Fiscal Year 2006 that \n     meets or exceeds the funding level for Fiscal Year 2005; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as the presiding officer of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Secretary of the \n     Department of Health and Human Services, and each member of \n     the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-124.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah relative to the federal No Child Left \n     Behind Act; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n\n                      House Joint Resolution No. 3\n\n       Whereas, the state of Utah applauds the laudable goals \n     proposed by the President and the United States Congress and \n     articulated in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002, those \n     goals being to close the achievement gap and increased \n     student performance;\n       Whereas, these are the same goals the state of Utah has \n     pursued and continues to pursue under the Utah Performance \n     Assessment System for Student (U-PASS), which accounts for \n     individual student growth and the difference among our \n     children;\n       Whereas, the stakeholders in public education in the state \n     of Utah are more experienced and have a better understanding \n     of the unique needs of Utah students, evident by the fact \n     that the state has performed above the national average on \n     the National Assessment of Educational Progress while \n     maintaining the lowest per pupil expenditures in the nation;\n       Whereas, No Child Left Behind greatly expends the reach of \n     the federal government into the education governance \n     structure in Utah, bypassing critical stakeholders in the \n     policymaking process and dealing directly with individual \n     schools and districts, negating state and local board control \n     and undermining the state's ability to meet its \n     constitutional duty to provide a system of public education \n     in Utah;\n       Whereas, prior to No Child Left Behind, the federal \n     government's involvement in education in the state was \n     focused primarily on a small percentage of students, \n     commensurate, with the 7% contribution to the state's \n     aggregate spending on K-12 education;\n       Whereas, No Child Left Behind greatly expands the authority \n     of the U.S. Department of Education by impacting all students \n     in the state, without a significant increased in its 7% \n     contribution to the state, making the U.S. Department of \n     Education's mandates on public education no longer \n     commensurate with the resources it provided to Utah;\n       Whereas, federal funding for No Child Left Behind falls \n     dramatically short of sufficient funds for remedial services \n     for struggling students, and No Child Left Behind therefore \n     requires substantial supplemental state funding;\n       Whereas, No Child Left Behind represents the greatest \n     federal intrusion in the history of our nation, over what has \n     historically been a right of the states, to direct public \n     education in a way that best fits the needs of individual \n     students;\n       Whereas, while No Child Left Behind was appropriately \n     intended, it was nonetheless poorly designed, in that it is \n     too punitive, too prescriptive, and sets unrealistic \n     expectations that demoralize students and educators and \n     confuse the general public;\n       Whereas, No Child Left Behind contains fundamental \n     conflicts between competing federal education laws that \n     govern the treatment of students with special needs, as well \n     as between federal law and state statutory and constitutional \n     requirements, and is built on inadequate methods for \n     measuring student and school performance;\n       Whereas, No Child Left Behind may cause unintended \n     consequences to Utah's education system in that it will \n     redirect the allocation of resources, amend state and local \n     curriculum, standards, and assessments, and do more damage in \n     labeling Utah's schools and students than it does to improve \n     student performance, making it a less effective method for \n     Utah to measure student achievement;\n       Whereas, No Child Left Behind includes expectations for \n     teacher qualifications that ignore realities in rural \n     settings and in specialty assignments; and\n       Whereas, while No Child Left Behind includes provisions, \n     such as Sections 9401 and 9527, that would protect states and \n     provide regulatory relief from concerns raised about its \n     shortcomings, there has been very little effort by the U.S. \n     Department of Education to encourage or allow states to \n     utilize these provisions: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah \n     recognizes that the Legislature, the Utah State Board of \n     Education, and local boards of education have an \n     understanding of Utah's schools that surpasses that of \n     federal government entities in terms of missions, needs, \n     goals, and values of those schools; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature recognizes that the U-PASS \n     should be the basis by which students and schools in Utah \n     will be assessed and monitored; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature recognizes that in order to \n     increase student achievement, Utah should utilize competency-\n     measured education and student growth measurements as \n     described in U-PASS and Utah State Senate bill 154, 2003 \n     General Session; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature recognizes that the state \n     should control its public education budget and allocate \n     education dollars according to Utah's priorities and needs, \n     driven by decision-making of local school boards; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature recognizes that until and \n     unless the federal government substantially amends No Child \n     Left Behind, extends waiver authority under Section 9401 to \n     acknowledge that Utah is complying with the intent and spirit \n     of the law through U-PASS, and that the federal government \n     provides funding commensurate with what an independent \n     analysis of implementation costs indicates is required to \n     fully implement the law or the Congress significantly alters \n     the law such that control of public education is fully \n     restored to our state, Utah should utilize its own proven \n     system of student accountability and reassert its historic \n     leadership role in providing a quality public education for \n     its citizens; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     Utah State Board of Education, each of Utah's local boards of \n     education, the United States Department of Education, and to \n     the members of Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-126.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to Equal Pay Day; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 7\n\n       Whereas, Forty-two years after the passage of the Federal \n     Equal Pay Act of 1963 and forty-one years after the passage \n     of Title VII of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, \n     American women continue to suffer disparities in wages that \n     cannot be accounted for by age, education, or work \n     experience; and\n       Whereas, According to statistics released in 2004 by the \n     U.S. Census Bureau, year-round, full-time working women in \n     2003 earned only 76% of the earnings of year-round, full-time \n     working men, indicating little change or progress in pay \n     equity; and,\n       Whereas, A General Accounting Office report on women's \n     earnings shows that there exists an inexplicable wage gap of \n     approximately 20 percent between men and women, even after \n     taking into account work experience, education, occupation, \n     industry of current employment, and other demographic and job \n     characteristics; and\n       Whereas, Since, the passage of the Equal Pay Act, the gap \n     has narrowed by less than half, from 41 cents per dollar to \n     22 cents, and research by the Institute for Women's Policy \n     Research finds that recent change is due in large part to \n     men's real wages falling, not women's wages rising; and\n       Whereas, California ranks fifth among all states in equal \n     pay, yet it ranks 39th among all states in progress in \n     closing the hourly wage gap, and at the current rate of \n     change California working women will not have equal pay for \n     another 40 years; and\n       Whereas, The consequences of the wage gap reach beyond \n     working women and extend to their families and the economy to \n     the extent that; in 1999, even after accounting for \n     differences, in education, age, location, and the number of \n     hours worked, America's working families lost $200 billion of \n     annual income to the wage gap, with an average of $4,000 per \n     family; and\n       Whereas, Women play a crucial role in maintaining the \n     financial well-being of their families by providing \n     significant percentage of their household incomes and, in \n     many cases, women head their own households; and\n       Whereas, Pay inequity results in a higher poverty rate for \n     women, particularly in women-headed households, as evidenced \n     by figures from the McAuley Institute which indicate that for \n     families that are headed by a woman and have children under \n     the age of five years, the poverty rate is an astonishing \n     46.4 percent; and\n       Whereas, Women currently comprise 48 percent of the labor \n     force; and\n       Whereas, Educated women are not exempt from pay disparity; \n     and\n       Whereas, In 2001 the average income for a woman with a \n     bachelor's degree was 24 percent lower than that of a man \n     with the same level of education--$32,238 versus $42,292; and\n       Whereas, The wage gap is also prevalent within minority \n     communities, as shown by a 2002 report that African-American \n     women earned 91 percent of what African-American men earned, \n     and Hispanic women earned 88 percent of what Hispanic men \n     earned; and\n       Whereas, Even in professions in which women comprise a \n     majority of workers, such as nursing and teaching, men earn \n     an average of 20 percent more than women working in these \n     same occupations; and\n       Whereas, According to the data analysis of over 300 job \n     classifications provided by the United States Department of \n     Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, women are paid less in \n     every occupational classification for which sufficient \n     information is available; and\n       Whereas, The average 25-year-old woman who works fulltime, \n     year round, is projected to earn $523,000 less over the \n     course of her career than the average 25-year-old man who \n     works full time, year round; and\n       Whereas, If women were paid the same as men who work the \n     same number of hours, have the same education and same union \n     status, are the same age, and live in the same region of the \n     country, then the annual family income, of each of these \n     women would rise by $4,000, and the number of families who \n     live below the poverty line would be reduced by half; and\n       Whereas, The wage gap continues to affect women in their \n     senior years as lower wages result in lower pensions and \n     incomes after, retirement, and affect a woman's ability to \n     save, thereby contributing to a higher poverty rate for \n     elderly women; and\n       Whereas, Half of all older women with income from a private \n     pension receive less than $5,600 per year, as compared with \n     $10,340 per year for older men; and\n       Whereas, Men live an average of 77 years and women live an \n     average of 81.7 years; and\n       Whereas, Assuming men and women retire at age 65; men will \n     rely on their state pensions to help them through 12 years of \n     life, while a woman's pension will have to last 16.7 years; \n     and\n       Whereas, There is a greater likelihood that a female worker \n     would outlive her defined contribution plan; and\n       Whereas, It is estimated that it would cost a man $654,000 \n     to purchase an annuity based on 25 years of service and a \n     $6,000 final-month salary, while it would cost a woman over \n     $700,000 to purchase the same annuity with the same monthly \n     benefits; and\n       Whereas, if both a man and a woman invested $750,000 in \n     this same annuity, it is estimated the women would receive a \n     little under $3,420 per month while the man would receive \n     $3,670, or a 7-percent difference: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate and the Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature hereby declares \n     April 19, 2004, to be ``Equal Pay Day'' in California and \n     urges California citizens to recognize the full' value and \n     worth of women and their contributions to the California \n     workforce; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature respectfully, urges the \n     Congress of the United States to protect the fundamental \n     right of all American women to receive equal pay, for equal \n     work, and to continue to provide more effective remedies to \n     victims of discrimination in the payment of wages on the \n     basis of sex; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, and to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-129.

A bill to expedite the transition to digital television \nwhile helping consumers to continue to use their analog televisions; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nsupport the Nation's finest: our police, fire fighters and other \nemergency response personnel. The ``Spectrum Availability for \nEmergency-response and Law-enforcement to Improve Vital Emergency \nServices Act,'' otherwise known as ``The SAVE LIVES Act of 2005.'' This \nbill is drafted in response to the 9/11 Commission's Final Report, \nwhich recommended the ``expedited and increased assignment of radio \nspectrum for public safety purposes.''\n  To meet this recommendation, the SAVE LIVES Act would set a date \ncertain for the allocation of spectrum to public safety agencies, \nspecifically the 24 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band that Congress \npromised public safety agencies in 1997. This is a promise Congress has \nyet to deliver to our Nation's first responders. Access to this \nspecific spectrum is essential to our Nation's safety and welfare as \nemergency communications sent over these frequencies are able to \npenetrate walls and travel great distances, and can assist multiple \njurisdictions in deploying interoperable communications systems.\n  In addition to setting a date certain, this bill would authorize \nfunds for public safety agencies to purchase emergency communications \nequipment and ensure that Congress has the ability to consider whether \nadditional spectrum should be provided for public safety communications \nprior to the recovered spectrum being auctioned. The bill contains \nsignificant language concerning consumer education in anticipation of \nthe digital television transition. The bill would mandate that warning \nlabels be displayed on analog television sets sold prior to the \ntransition, require warning language to be displayed at television \nretailers, command the distribution at retailers of brochures \ndescribing the television set options available to consumers, and call \non broadcasters to air informational programs to better prepare \nconsumers for the digital transition.\n  The bill would ensure that no television viewer's set would go \n``dark'' by providing digital-to-analog converter boxes to over-the-air \nviewers with a household income at or below 200 percent of the poverty \nline and by allowing cable companies to down convert digital signal \nsignals if necessary. I continue to believe that broadcast television \nis a powerful communications tool and important information source for \ncitizens. I know that on 9/11, I learned about the attack on the Twin \nTowers and the Pentagon by watching television like most Americans. \nTherefore, this bill seeks to not only protect citizens' safety, but \nalso the distribution of broadcast television.\n  Lastly, the bill would require the Environmental Protection Agency to \nreport to Congress on the need for a national electronic waste \nrecycling program.\n  The 9/11 Commission's final report contained harrowing tales about \npolice officers and fire fighters who were inside the twin towers and \nunable to receive evacuation orders over their radios from commanders. \nIn fact, the report found that this inability to communicate was not \nonly a problem for public safety organizations responding at the World \nTrade Center, but also for those responding at the Pentagon and \nSomerset County, Pennsylvania crash sites where multiple organizations \nand multiple jurisdictions responded. Therefore, the Commission \nrecommended that Congress accelerate the availability of additional \nspectrum for public safety.\n  The SAVE LIVES Act would implement that important recommendation and \nensure that WHEN our Nation experiences another attack, or other \ncritical emergencies occur, our police, fire fighters and other \nemergency response personnel will have the ability to communicate with \neach other and their commanders to prevent another catastrophic loss of \nlife. Now is the time for Congressional action before another national \nemergency or crisis takes place.\n  Several lawmakers attempted to act last year during the debate on the \nIntelligence reform bill, but our efforts were thwarted by the powerful \nNational Association of Broadcasters. This year, I hope we can all work \ntogether and pass a bill that ensures the country is not only better \nprepared in case of another attack, but also protects the vital \ncommunications outlet of broadcast television. I believe the SAVE LIVES \nAct achieves both goals.\n  In an effort to expeditiously retrieve the spectrum for the Nation's \nfirst responders, to preserve over-the-air television accessibility to \nconsumers and to ensure the adequate funding of both, I urge the \nenactment of The SAVE LIVES Act. Additionally, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1268\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nclarify certain activities the conduct of which does not require a \npermit; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pest \nManagement and Fire Suppression Flexibility Act. I am proud to be \njoined by ten of my colleagues, Senators Lincoln, Crapo, Bond, Isakson, \nCraig, Chambliss, Cochran, Thomas, Hagel and Roberts. This legislation \ncodifies long-standing Democratic and Republican Administration policy \nof not requiring a Clean Water Act permit for pesticides in full \ncompliance with their EPA-approved label. It will further affirm \nhistoric a Federal practices with regard to the Clean Water Act and \nfire suppression and other foreset management activities.\n  In 1972, Congress enacted both the Clean Water Act and the Federal \nInsecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. CWA authorized the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to protect the Nation's waterways by \nregulating discharges of large industrial operations and wastewater \nfacilities through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. \nFIFRA proyided the EPA with the authority to regulate the sale and use \nof pesticides through a comprehensive registration and labeling \nprotocol.\n  Until some recent court decisions, the application of agricultural \nand other pesticides in full compliance with labeling requirements did \nnot require NPDES permits. Because pesticides undergo lengthy testing \nunder FIFRA including tests to ensure water quality and aquatic species \npreservation, a NPDES permit was considered unnecessary and \nduplicative. These court decisions commonly known as Talent and \nForsgren contradict years of Federal policy and undermine the manner in \nwhich the Federal Government regulates farmers, foresters, irrigators, \nmosquito abatement officials, and other pesticide applicators.\n  Similar cases are pending. Groups are now using the notice of intent \nto sue to intimidate farmers, mosquito abatement districts and Federal \nand State agencies into stopping or reducing West Nile virus prevention \nand crop loss rangeland protection operations. While EPA has proposed a \nrule to ensure that pesticides sprayed to, near, or over waters do not \nneed a permit, the rule needs to be codified in statute. \nEnvironmentalists who filed notices of intent to sue Maine's two \nlargest blueberry farmers have indicated that they plan on threatening \nothers with lawsuits including more farmers and foresters.\n  Our legislation fills this regulatory gap left by EPA. While the \nagency's rule is a step in the right direction, our legislation \ncodifies the agency's longstanding policy that the application of \nagricultural and other pesticides, in accordance with their label, does \nnot require an NPDES permit. Moreover, the rule does not protect \nfarmers, irrigators, mosquito abatement districts, fire fighters, \nFederal and State agencies, pest control operators or foresters \nvulnerable to citizen's suits, simply for performing long-practiced, \nexpressly approved and already heavily regulated pest management and \npublic health protection activities. Without such protection, those who \nprotet us from mosquito borne illnesses and other pest outbreaks or \ncombat destructive and potentially deadly forest fires will continue to \nbe potential victims of mischievous citizen's suits.\n  My bill codifies EPA's rulemaking, as well as affirms Congressional \nintent and the long-held positions of Republican and Democratic \nadministrations with regard to the CWA and pesticide applications \ngenerally, as well as fire suppression and other forest management \nactivities. I am pleased to be joined by so many of my colleagues in \nthis effort and encourage others to cosponsor our proposal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Nebraska:\n  S. 1272.

A bill to provide for the sale and adoption of excess wild \nfree-roaming horses and burros; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I rise on behalf of myself and Senator \nEnsign to offer legislation that will give greater protections to our \nNation's wild horses and make needed improvements to the Bureau of Land \nManagement's wild horse and burro adoption program.\n  Right now there are an estimated 32,000 wild horses on our Nation's \npublic lands. This is 4,000 more horses than our rangeland can sustain. \nThe Bureau of Land Management has established that nationwide, the \nAppropriate Management Level for wild horses and burros is 28,000. \nUnfortunately, after many years of trying, the BLM has been unable to \nreach this benchmark, even after many significant budget increases for \nthe wild horse and burro program. This situation is compounded by the \nfact that wild horses naturally reproduce at a rate of 20 percent per \nannum, adding to management difficulties and placing greater strain on \nour public rangelands.\n  In Nevada, we feel the failures of the wild horse and burro program \nmost acutely. Of the 32,000 horses on America's public lands, roughly \nhalf are in Nevada. So when the program fails, it hits us hard. In \nrecent years, the program's shortcomings have been amplified by an \nongoing drought in the Southwest that has, in places, seriously \njeopardized the health and well-being of wild horses and burros and has \ndevastated the rangeland upon which they depend for their survival.\n  At present, the wild horse program is failing on both ends. The BLM \nis struggling to remove sufficient numbers of horses from the range and \nmany of the horses that are removed are placed into an adoption program \nthat is not locating a sufficient number of willing adopters. This \nmeans that more horses stay in Government hands, driving the cost of \nthis troubled program ever higher. As a result, today we have nearly \n22,000 wild horses sitting in long-term holding facilities in the \nMidwest, costing the U.S. taxpayer approximately $465 per horse, per \nyear. And this is only part of the roughly $40 million we are spending \nthis year to manage our Nation's wild horses and burros. Add this to \nthe fact that the cost of running this program has doubled in the last \nfive years and it becomes clear that reform is needed.\n  Last year, Congress passed language that allowed the BLM to sell a \nlimited number of the horses that are held in long-term holding \nfacilities. Unfortunately, this additional management tool has been \nabused by a handful of people and a small number of horses ended up at \nslaughter. These unfortunate events have led to calls for greater \nprotections for wild horses that are being offered to the public under \nthe sale program.\n  Mr. President, the legislation that we offer today provides that \ngreater protection for wild horses, while also giving the BLM greater \nleverage to put more horses into the hands of good, caring owners.\n  Currently, wild horses that are acquired through the BLM's adoption \nprogram are federally protected for 1 year. This is the strongest \nprotection available to wild horses that are placed into private \nownership and our bill extends this protection to horses that are \nacquired under sale authority.\n  Our legislation also gives the BLM more flexibility in finding good \nhomes for wild horses. We do this by giving the BLM the authority to \nmake all horses that are not suitable for the adoption program \navailable for purchase by caring owners.\n  We also lift the limit on the number of horses that an approved \nadopter can take title to in a single year, and we lower the minimum \nadoption fee from $125 to $25. It is our firm belief that when good \npeople want to adopt horses and meet the requirements set forth by the \nBLM, they should have as few barriers to overcome as possible. By \nincreasing the number of horses that can be adopted and lowering the \nadoption fee, we believe that we can put more horses into the hands of \nmore quality owners.\n  Our goal is to give all wild horses the maximum protection available \nunder our current system and to provide the BLM with the management \ntools they need to get tens of thousands of wild horses and burros into \nsafe and caring homes. We believe that this is the right thing to do.

Mr. President, earlier this month, Cam Neely of the \nBoston Bruins was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, \nCanada, and he will be formally inducted into the Hall on November 7.\n  Cam has inspired a generation of ice hockey fans in Boston and New \nEngland, and throughout the Nation with his extraordinary skill and \nbrilliant accomplishments. He is truly one of hockey's immortals, and \nhe eminently deserves this high honor.\n  In addition, he is also well-known to all of us in Boston for his \ngood citizenship and impressive participation in inspiring our \ncommunity.\n  I am submitting a resolution today to honor Cam Neely for his on-ice \naccomplishments and also for his continuing commitment to charitable \ncauses in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\n                              S. Res. 176\n\n       Whereas on June 8, 2005, Cam Neely was elected to the \n     Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, Canada, and will be formally \n     inducted into the Hall of Fame on November 7, 2005;\n       Whereas as a member of the Boston Bruins, Cam Neely became \n     one of ice hockey's greatest players, defining the position \n     of ``power forward'';\n       Whereas although his career was cut short when he retired \n     at the age of 31 due to injury, Cam Neely scored 395 goals \n     and had 299 assists in 726 games in his brilliant career;\n       Whereas Cam Neely led the Boston Bruins in goals for 7 \n     seasons, led the team in scoring for 2 seasons, and was the \n     team's all-time leader in goals during playoffs;\n       Whereas Cam Neely had three 50-goal seasons for the Boston \n     Bruins, including back-to-back 50-goal seasons in 1989-1990 \n     and 1991-1992;\n       Whereas Cam Neely, returning to the Boston Bruins after an \n     injury in 1993-1994, scored 50 goals and was awarded the \n     National Hockey League's Bill Masterton Trophy as the \n     ``player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, \n     sportsmanship, and dedication to hockey'';\n       Whereas Cam Neely, number 8, became the tenth Boston Bruin \n     to be honored by having his uniform number retired;\n       Whereas Cam Neely continues to provide invaluable \n     assistance to charitable causes in the Commonwealth of \n     Massachusetts, including the establishment of the Neely House \n     and the Neely Foundation, which comfort, support, and offer \n     hope to cancer patients and their families: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the extraordinary achievements of Cam Neely \n     during his brilliant career in ice hockey with the Boston \n     Bruins;\n       (2) commends Cam Neely for his recent and eminently well-\n     deserved induction into the Hockey Hall of Fame; and\n       (3) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution to:\n       (A) Cam Neely;\n       (B) Jeremy Jacobs, owner of the Boston Bruins;\n       (C) Harry Sinden, president of the Boston Bruins; and\n       (D) Mike Sullivan, head coach of the Boston Bruins.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/20/senate-section/article/S6833-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6833-S6834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 177--ENCOURAGING THE PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF \n                                REFUGEES\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Leahy, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \nLieberman, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Coleman, and Mr. Lautenberg) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 177\n\n       Whereas the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees \n     dated July 28, 1951 (189 UST 150) (hereinafter referred to as \n     the ``Convention'') and the Protocol Relating to the Status \n     of Refugees done at New York January 31, 1967 (19 UST 6223) \n     (hereinafter referred to as the ``Protocol'') provide that \n     individuals who flee a country to avoid persecution deserve \n     international protection;\n       Whereas such protection includes freedom from forcible \n     return and the basic rights necessary for a refugee to live a \n     free, dignified, self-reliant life, even while in exile;\n       Whereas such rights, as recognized in the Convention, \n     include the right to earn a livelihood, to engage in wage-\n     employment or self-employment, to practice a profession, to \n     own property, to freedom of movement and residence, and to \n     receive travel documents;\n       Whereas such rights are applicable to a refugee independent \n     of whether a solution is available that would permit the \n     refugee to return to the country that the refugee fled;\n       Whereas such rights are part of the core protection mandate \n     of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees;\n       Whereas warehoused refugees have been confined to a camp or \n     segregated settlement or otherwise deprived of their basic \n     rights;\n       Whereas more than 50 percent of the refugees in the world \n     are effectively warehoused in a situation that has existed \n     for at least 10 years;\n       Whereas donor countries, including the United States, have \n     typically offered less developed countries hosting refugees \n     assistance if they keep refugees warehoused in camps or \n     segregated settlements but have not provided adequate \n     assistance to host countries that permit refugees to live and \n     work among the local population; and\n       Whereas warehousing refugees not only violates the rights \n     of the refugees but also debilitates their humanity, often \n     reducing the refugees to enforced idleness, dependency, \n     disempowerment, and despair: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the United States Senate--\n       (1) expresses deep appreciation and gratitude for those \n     States which have and continue to host refugees and offer \n     refugee resettlement;\n       (2) denounces the practice of warehousing refugees, which \n     is the confinement of refugees to a camp or segregated \n     settlement or other deprivation of the refugees' basic rights \n     in a protracted situation, as a denial of basic human rights \n     and a squandering of human potential;\n       (3) urges the Secretary of State to actively pursue models \n     of refugee assistance that permit refugees to enjoy all the \n     rights recognized in the Convention and the Protocol;\n       (4) urges the Secretary of State to encourage other donor \n     nations and other members of the Executive Committee of the \n     United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' Programme to \n     shift the incentive structure of refugee assistance and to \n     build mechanisms into relief and development assistance to \n     encourage the greater enjoyment by refugees of their rights \n     under the Convention;\n       (5) encourages the international community, including donor \n     countries, host countries, and members of the Executive \n     Committee of the United Nations High Commissioner for \n     Refugees' Programme, to denounce resolutely the practice of \n     warehousing refugees in favor of allowing refugees to \n     exercise their rights under the Convention;\n       (6) calls upon the United Nations High Commissioner for \n     Refugees to monitor refugee situations more effectively for \n     the realization of all the rights of refugees under the \n     Convention, including those related to freedom of movement \n     and the right to earn a livelihood;\n       (7) encourages those countries that have not yet ratified \n     the Convention or the Protocol to do so;\n       (8) encourages those countries that have ratified the \n     Convention or the Protocol, but have done so with \n     reservations on key articles pertaining to the right to work \n     and freedom of movement, to remove such reservations; and\n       (9) encourages all countries to enact legislation or \n     promulgate policies to provide for the legal enjoyment of the \n     basic rights of refugees as outlined in the Convention.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today is World Refugee Day and I welcome \nthis opportunity to reaffirm the fundamental rights embodied in the \nUnited Nations Refugee Convention of 1951. It is an honor to join my \ncolleagues--Senators Brownback, Leahy, DeWine, Lieberman, Snowe, \nDurbin, Coleman, and Lautenberg--in introducing this bipartisan \nresolution to focus attention on the plight of millions of refugees \nthroughout the world who are endlessly confined in refugee camps or \nsegregated settlements. These ``warehoused'' refugees are denied basic \nrights under the Convention, such as the right to work, to move freely, \nand to receive a basic education. The deprivation goes on for years and \nin some cases, even for generations.\n  Worldwide, more than 7 million refugees have been restricted to camps \nor isolated settlements for 10 years or more. These populations \nconstitute more than half of the refugees around the world.\n  In Tanzania, nearly 400,000 refugees from Burundi and the Democratic \nRepublic of Congo are confined in 13 camps along the western border. \nSome of these camps have existed for more than a decade. Many refugees \nconfined in these camps find it extremely difficult to find employment, \nlet alone obtain other basic necessities of life. Other refugee \npopulations have been warehoused and forgotten for over 20 years, such \nas Angolans in Zambia, Afghans in Iran and Pakistan, Bhutanese\n\n[[Page S6834]]\n\nin Nepal, Burmese in Thailand, and Somalians and Sudanese in Kenya.\n  Sadly, the number of warehoused refugees may soon increase as violent \nconflicts continue around the world. According to the recently \npublished 2005 World Refugee Survey, the total number of refugees and \nasylum seekers worldwide exceeds 11 million, and 21 million more are \ninternally displaced. As these shameful statistics demonstrate, there \nis far more the world community can do to ease their plight.\n  The resolution we are offering denounces the practice of warehousing \nrefugees and urges all nations to grant them their basic rights under \nthe Refugee Convention of 1951. Refugee camps are often created quickly \nto address a crisis. But the solution creates a greater problem, if \ntemporary camps are allowed to become long-term places of confinement.\n  Under the 1951 Convention, refugees have the right to earn a \nlivelihood, to have a job and earn wages, to practice a profession, to \nown property, and to have freedom of movement and residence. Warehoused \nrefugees can do none of these things. Unable to work, travel, own \nproperty or obtain an education, they live unlived lives, without the \nbasic freedoms they are entitled to have under the 1951 Convention.\n  This resolution denounces the practice of warehousing refugees and \ncalls for conditions that enable refugees to exercise their rights. It \nencourages donor countries, including the United States, to increase \ntheir assistance to host countries that allow refugees to live and work \namong the local population.\n  It urges the Secretary of State and the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Refugees to adopt models of refugee assistance that \nachieve the rights recognized in the Refugee Convention. It also \nencourages all nations to ratify the Convention, and without \nreservations, and to enact legislation and policies that protect human \nrights and end the denial of these rights to any refugees.\n  The U.S. must strengthen our own commitment and work with other \ncountries to solve this problem.\n  As a number of authorities have pointed out, we may well have to face \nan urgent aspect of the issue ourselves if conditions in Iraq continue \nto deteriorate and significant numbers of Iraqis are free to become \nrefugees because of their ties to us.\n  Over 130 international organizations support the end of warehousing, \nincluding more than 25 agencies based in the United States. Nobel \nLaureates have condemned this practice, including Archbishop Desmond \nTutu of South Africa, and so has the Vatican.\n  We must find long-term solutions and alternatives to this abominable \npractice. It is a gross violation of both refugee rights and human \nrights. It is wrong to squander the immense human potential and condemn \nhuman refugees to live in despair and isolation for unacceptable \nlengths of time.\n  Refugees around the world depend on us to hear their pleas and \nrespond to the assistance they so desperately need and deserve. We must \ndo all we can to protect the rights and dignity of refugees everywhere.\n  I look forward to working with our colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, as well as in the international community, to pass this \nimportant resolution and take steps toward implementing its provisions \nand achieving its objectives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/20/senate-section/article/S6834-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 178--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n                  UNITED STATES-EUROPEAN UNION SUMMIT\n\n  Mr. BENNETT (for himself and Mr. Lugar) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MANAGEMENT OF SPR.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the prices of gasoline and crude oil have a direct and \n     substantial impact on the financial well-being of families of \n     the United States, the potential for national economic \n     recovery, and the economic security of the United States;\n       (2) on June 13, 2005, crude oil prices closed at the \n     exceedingly high level of $55.62 per barrel, the price of \n     crude oil has remained above $50 per barrel since May 25, \n     2005, and the price of crude oil has exceeded $50 per barrel \n     for approximately \\1/3\\ of calendar year 2005;\n       (3) on June 6, 2005, the Energy Information Administration \n     announced that the national price of gasoline, at $2.12 per \n     gallon, could reach even higher levels in the near future;\n       (4) despite the severely high, sustained price of crude \n     oil--\n       (A) the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \n     (referred to in this section as ``OPEC'') has refused to \n     adequately increase production to calm global oil markets and \n     officially abandoned its $22-$28 price target; and\n       (B) officials of OPEC member nations have publicly \n     indicated support for maintaining oil prices of $40-$50 per \n     barrel;\n       (5) the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (referred to in this \n     section as ``SPR'') was created to enhance the physical and \n     economic security of the United States;\n       (6) the law allows the SPR to be used to provide relief \n     when oil and gasoline supply shortages cause economic \n     hardship;\n       (7) the proper management of the resources of the SPR could \n     provide gasoline price relief to families of the United \n     States and provide the United States with a tool to \n     counterbalance OPEC supply management policies;\n       (8) the Administration's policy of filling the SPR despite \n     the fact that the SPR is nearly full has exacerbated the \n     rising price of crude oil and record high retail price of \n     gasoline;\n       (9) in order to combat high gasoline prices during the \n     summer and fall of 2000, President Clinton released \n     30,000,000 barrels of oil from the SPR, stabilizing the \n     retail price of gasoline;\n\n[[Page S6868]]\n\n       (10) increasing vertical integration has allowed--\n       (A) the 5 largest oil companies in the United States to \n     control almost as much crude oil production as the Middle \n     Eastern members of OPEC, over \\1/2\\ of domestic refiner \n     capacity, and over 60 percent of the retail gasoline market; \n     and\n       (B) Exxon/Mobil, BP, Royal Dutch Shell Group, Conoco/\n     Philips, and Chevron/Texaco to increase first quarter profits \n     of 2005 over first quarter profits of 2004 by 36 percent, for \n     total first quarter profits of over $25,000,000,000;\n       (11) the Administration has failed to manage the SPR in a \n     manner that would provide gasoline price relief to working \n     families; and\n       (12) the Administration has failed to adequately demand \n     that OPEC immediately increase oil production in order to \n     lower crude oil prices and safeguard the world economy.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President should--\n       (1) directly confront OPEC and challenge OPEC to \n     immediately increase oil production; and\n       (2) direct the Federal Trade Commission and Attorney \n     General to exercise vigorous oversight over the oil markets \n     to protect the people of the United States from price gouging \n     and unfair practices at the gasoline pump.\n       (c) Release of Oil From SPR.--\n       (1) In general.--For the period beginning on the date of \n     enactment of this Act and ending on the date that is 30 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, 1,000,000 barrels of \n     oil per day shall be released from the SPR.\n       (2) Additional release.--If necessary to lower the burden \n     of gasoline prices on the economy of the United States and to \n     circumvent the efforts of OPEC to reap windfall crude oil \n     profits, 1,000,000 barrels of oil per day shall be released \n     from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for an additional 30 \n     days.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SA 806.
