Mr. President, today, we will have a brief period of \nmorning business before we resume consideration of S. 852, the asbestos \nbill. Although Members may come down and make statements relative to \nthe bill, there are going to be no rollcall votes today, as I explained \nlast night.\n  Last night, we vitiated cloture and confirmed a nomination that was \nscheduled for a vote today; and given that action, it is not necessary \nto have that vote this morning.\n  We did hope to consider and vote on amendments during today's \nsession. However, at this time, there is a motion to waive the budget \npending, and that will require further debate.\n  In addition, we are approaching the final week prior to the \nPresident's Day recess. We want to use all our time effectively to work \nthrough the asbestos bill and other remaining business. I talked with \nthe Democratic leader about a number of issues that we will address \nover the course of the next 8 or 9 days. There is the tax \nreconciliation bill that has gone to conference. We have 10 hours on \nthat. There are the issues surrounding the PATRIOT Act that needs to be \nreauthorized.\n  Great progress has been made over the last 24 hours in a bipartisan \nway. At the close of business today, I will outline next week's \nschedule. Senators should plan on a very busy week prior to the recess, \nwith voting over the course of next week.\n\n\n                                Asbestos\n\n  I briefly want to comment on the asbestos bill and where we are today \nand the significance of this underlying bill. We have been on this for \na week, in terms of debate. I think my colleagues and the American \npeople realize how important this bill is and why it is the first major \npiece of legislation we are taking in this current session of Congress \nand have brought it to the floor.\n  I want to share briefly what my personal experience is with this \ndisease, and it comes from having spent many months in Southampton, \nEngland, working as a surgeon a couple of decades ago. To me, those \nimages apply today, of individuals, patients suffering from cancer from \nasbestos, asbestosis, and the clinical manifestations of the diseases \nrelated to it, such as mesothelioma. As we all know, based on the \ndiscussions that have taken place, this asbestos fiber is one that \ncauses a reaction that can be a localized reaction in the lungs or a \nsystemic reaction, and it is particularly prevalent in workers in \nshipyards; and, of course, Southampton was and has been one of the \ngreat shipyards in the world. Therefore, you see a lot of this \nmesothelioma.\n\n[[Page S1048]]\n\n  The mesothelioma in those patients starts with a shortness of breath \nthat is uncomfortable, but then it gradually builds to this gasping for \nevery single breath. And then it turns into the agony of not getting \nenough breath into your lungs. It starts with a little bit of a cough \nassociated with that shortness of breath, and that cough eventually \nturns into a hacking cough with blood coming forth, a loss of the \nvoice, initially becoming coarse and raspy. The symptoms of the most \ncommon type of mesothelioma expand to the point that surgery is, in \nmany cases, tried. It is a difficult surgery because of the encasement \nof the lung with the reaction to this asbestos fiber. It is malignant \ncancer.\n\n  I say that because the reality is there are many patients, victims of \nexposure to asbestos, who are not being fully compensated by the system \nwe have, the system that is outdated, that is inefficient and unfair. \nEverybody agrees with that.\n  If there is one thing we have been able to accomplish over the last \nweek, it is that it is an unfair process that results in a lot of waste \nand inefficiency--the fact that patients themselves, the victims--out \nof the dollars that should be directed to them--only get 42 cents of \nthe dollar that is put on the table to compensate them, and that is \nsimply unfair. Our discussions and debate over the last week have \npointed to the fact that 58 cents of the dollar that should be going to \nthe victims is being spread through a system that is inefficient and \ngoes, in large part, to the pockets of trial lawyers--not all trial \nlawyers, but the few who are taking advantage of this system.\n  That is why it is so important for us to address this FAIR Act, which \nwe call it, to debate it and not use procedural moves to kill it. \nBecause once we kill this bill or it is moved off the table, we are not \ngoing to be able to come back to it, from a realistic standpoint. This \nyear is so short that we have to address it now or never. That is why \nwe have to be very careful, in terms of having procedural moves that \nare made and people hiding behind those procedural moves and not \naddressing the real substance of the bill. The bill itself has strong \nbipartisan support. We talk about all of the partisanship that \ncharacterizes so much of this body in Washington, DC, and in Congress. \nThis bill is not partisan. It is not a Republican or Democratic bill. \nIt has strong bipartisan support.\n  I have to applaud the leadership of Chairman Specter and Senator \nLeahy on this bill, taking it through the Judiciary Committee. I want \nto also point out that people say we have only had 1 day on amendments. \nWe were ready to bring the bill up on Friday. We have had it Monday, \nTuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and now it is Friday. We have had some \nslow walking on the bill. We had to file a cloture motion to proceed to \nthe bill. It shows the reluctance by some people to say it is a problem \nand that it is one that we need to address and fix. But that cloture \nvote was successful. That postponement was overridden by the will of \nthis body.\n  About midweek, the other side reversed course and decided to let us \ndebate this bill, and that debate has begun in earnest. We have had a \ngreat debate, with a much better understanding among our colleagues and \namong the American people as to how big this problem is. The fact that \nthe victims, the patients whom physicians are treating, are not being \ntreated fairly by this system, that must be fixed. We have those trial \nlawyers who are reaping the benefits of this broken system, taking \nadvantage of the system, taking advantage of the funds that are to be \nused as compensation for those victims or potential victims.\n  The FAIR Act is a trust fund approach, which is a comprehensive \napproach. We had good debate yesterday with Senator Cornyn's amendment, \nin terms of a medical criteria bill. The one item that came out in that \ndiscussion is that the trust fund approach in the FAIR Act is the \ncomprehensive approach. Senator Cornyn proposed that we resolve the \nreal problem with a medical criteria proposal, which many of us support \nin terms of concept, but you have to look at who is left out. The \nunimpaired claimants are left out of that system. The trust fund \naddresses those people who may be unimpaired but who are victims and \nwill be victims, from a medical standpoint, in the future.\n  The bill we talked about yesterday--there is a sort of incompleteness \nof that bill, but reflecting on the more comprehensive approach of the \nunderlying bill and the fact that it did not address the fact that 40 \npercent of the awards are going to the victim and 60 percent is going \nto the system. Wealthy trial lawyers are the real beneficiaries here, \nwhich is not addressed in the smaller bills that may be brought forth \nor the smaller amendments brought to the floor.\n  It was mentioned yesterday that the medical criteria bill itself \nleaves out veterans. Again, that is addressed in the underlying FAIR \nAct, which is on the floor. Under the medical criteria bill, they could \nnot sue the Government for their injuries--the veterans of service who \nare fighting wars all over the globe--because of sovereign immunity. I \nwas also worried about those victims who worked at companies that are \nnow bankrupt. Again, the medical criteria bill does nothing to ensure \nthat attorneys are prevented from taking from those victims that share \nof compensation that should be going to the victims.\n  I know there are a lot of businesses, today and yesterday, that are \nlobbying Senators on both sides of the aisle because they are concerned \nthat the underlying bill will hurt them in some way. I know some of \nthem argue that the medical criteria approach is the better solution \nbecause it is less complicated than the trust fund. I respect that \nposition. It is a position that we and the leadership and the leaders \non this bill, the sponsors, are addressing. We will make sure that we \ndo all we can to ensure that no company is hurt, no company goes \nbankrupt because of the trust fund approach.\n  Senator Kyl's amendment, which is yet to be debated and fully \nconsidered, addresses that very important aspect, to make sure \ncompanies are not unduly hurt by the trust fund approach.\n  I firmly believe we should do what is in the interests of the Nation \nright now, not just what is in the interests of one company or another, \nand that is addressed in the FAIR Act--again, open for debate and open \nfor amendment. That is our responsibility, to tackle these big issues.\n  The underlying bill is not perfect. It needs to remain on the floor. \nIt needs to remain on the floor for discussion and debate. It is a \ncomprehensive approach that I strongly support, that the administration \nstrongly supports, and that much of the leadership in the House, in my \nconversations with them, strongly supports.\n  If we do not pass this bill, those victims whom I opened with, the \npeople who are being hurt by the cancer, who are struggling for those \nlast breaths, who do need that operation, are simply not being treated \nfairly and will not be treated fairly in the future.\n  Meaningful solutions to these tough and challenging problems are what \nwe are debating. Again, I commend the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee for his tremendous work on this important issue.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the majority leader yield for a very brief \ndiscussion on this point?\n  Mr. FRIST. Absolutely.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the leader very much for the \ncomments he just made. I would like to pick up on just a couple of \nthem.\n  What is generally misunderstood, notwithstanding how many times we \nhave said it, is that there is no Federal money in this bill. The bill \nis ironclad that the Federal Government will have no obligation at all, \nand even though it has been said repeatedly, talking to Senators in the \nwell of the floor yesterday, it has not really sunk in. I can \nunderstand why it has not sunk in--because the bill is so complicated--\nbut it is worth repeating. There is no Federal money in the bill.\n  The objection which is raised is that some future Congress may want \nto add money to the bill from the Federal Treasury. But that is not a \nvalid consideration for this Congress. We are doing the best job we can \nhere in the year 2006. But if some future Congress 20 years from now or \n30 years from now or 15 years from now makes another decision, we have \nto respect that. We are not so smart to handle the current problems, \nlet alone anticipate what is going to happen a decade or more from\n\n[[Page S1049]]\n\nnow. So when people raise the issue about more expenditures, they are \nnot doing it because of this bill; they are doing it because of what \nsome future bill may provide.\n  There is another consideration which the leader and I were just \ndiscussing which is worth commenting about on the floor so others may \nhear it, and that is that out of respect for the committee system, this \nbill ought not to fall on a budget point of order. The Judiciary \nCommittee has spent years--really working on it for decades but \nintensively for the past 3 years--and we passed it out 13 to 5, all 10 \nRepublicans for it, albeit with some reservations, and 3 Democrats--\nSenator Leahy, Senator Feinstein and Senator Kohl. It is bipartisan.\n  People are surprised to hear that on the point of order, it is the \nBudget Committee which makes the determination and not the \nParliamentarian. When I tell my colleagues that, they are surprised. \nBut as I conferred with the Parliamentarian yesterday, he confirmed the \nfact that the practice here is not to have the Parliamentarian rule but \nto have the Budget Committee rule and really to have the chairman make \nthe decision.\n  After working intensively on this issue for the 25 years I have been \nhere, and intensely for the past 3 years, it seems to me as a matter of \nbasic equity that we ought not to have this bill pulled from the floor \nby a single vote when we are in the midst of adding amendments which \nmay cure all of the problems people see. Senator Cornyn, for example, \nwho proposed the medical criteria bill yesterday, has told me that he \ndoes not favor upholding the point of order, that he thinks the bill \nought to go forward. Senator Cornyn has said he may have as many as \nfour more amendments. Senator Kyl has an amendment on the floor now \nwhich will protect the smaller companies. Senator Coburn may have an \namendment on tightening up the medical criteria.\n  When we have worked for 3 years intently, why not let this bill stand \nfor 3 more days next week to see if we can work out the problems?\n  I submit to all of my colleagues, and especially my colleagues on the \nBudget Committee, this is not where it ought to be decided by a \nsupermajority. This body had very intensive debate on when a filibuster \nought to be allowed, and we came to the conclusion that it should be \nextraordinary circumstances. I think the analogy right on all fours, as \nwe say in the law--on all fours. To defeat this bill by a \nsupermajority, there ought to be some extraordinary circumstance, which \nthere is not. This may be too strong a word, but, frankly, this is how \nI feel about it: I believe it is insulting to the Judiciary Committee \nto have these years of work at risk by a single vote because of what \nanother committee says, when we have gone through this bill A to Z and \nwe are still open for business to make changes.\n  It is worth note, the editorial support which I think is a bit \nremoved.\n\n  We have already had the New York Times speak very forcefully.\n  The Washington Post says, in part, ``legislation that serves the \npublic interest'' in coming out for the bill.\n  The Washington Times, which is noted for its more conservative view, \nendorses the bill today, saying, ``this bill should pass.''\n  One of the issues which the Washington Times raises is the key one \nraised by the Budget Committee as to what is going to happen in the \nfuture; that is, as they say:\n\n     and how can one minimize the chances of some future Congress \n     putting taxpayers on the hook for likely overruns?\n\n  OK, we are still working on it. But the Washington Times faces up \nsquarely to that consideration as to what a future Congress may do.\n  I have found that, while talking to Senators individually and they \nbegin to understand it, there is a good response. I have visited \nindividually with many Senators on both sides of the aisle, and I \nintend to continue to do so when we have the time to do so. But it is \nmy hope that my colleagues will look closely at respect for the \ncommittee system and what the Judiciary Committee has done here and \nwill at least give this bill a few more days and will not superimpose a \nsupermajority on legislation which ought to be decided, as our \ncustomary Democratic procedures are, by a democratic vote.\n  I thank the distinguished leader of our party for all of his hard \nwork on this, bringing it to the floor, and his steadfast support, and \nnotify all of our Republican colleagues that the leader and Senator \nMcConnell and Senator Sessions and Senator DeWine and maybe others and \nI will be talking individually, and I put my Democratic colleagues on \nnotice, too, that I am about to call them up for a private meeting.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorials I referenced from today's \nWashington Post and Washington Times be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From washingtonpost.com, Feb. 10, 2006]\n\n                          Forward on Asbestos\n\n       In a triumph of good sense and bipartisan cooperation, the \n     Senate voted on Tuesday to go forward with a bill that would \n     fix the broken asbestos litigation system. Hundreds of \n     thousands of asbestos injury claims have already landed in \n     the courts, contributing to the bankruptcy of more than 70 \n     companies. Without reform, this process will drag on, \n     triggering the bankruptcy of yet more firms, many of which \n     have only tenuous asbestos connections, because the main \n     firms responsible have already gone under. Meanwhile, many \n     who are ill from asbestos-related diseases won't be able to \n     get timely compensation or, in some cases, any compensation. \n     Unless the bill passes, Navy veterans, for example, will go \n     uncompensated for diseases caused by asbestos on ships. \n     Veterans are not allowed to sue the government, and many of \n     the shipbuilders are long since bankrupt.\n       The bill will be debated and amended, and it may face a \n     second attempted filibuster before it gets a vote. Some \n     amendment may be reasonable at the margins, but the bill's \n     central idea--to replace litigation with a $140 billion \n     compensation fund to be financed by defendant companies and \n     their insurers--must be preserved. Democrats complain that \n     the fund won't have enough money to compensate asbestos \n     victims; Republicans complain that the fund will have too \n     much money, the raising of which will constitute a burden on \n     small and medium-size firms. The fact that the bill is being \n     attacked from both directions suggests that its authors, \n     Sens. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) and Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), \n     have balanced competing interests in a reasonable manner.\n       Unfortunately, the bill's critics are not always so \n     reasonable. Sen. Harry M. Reid of Nevada, the Democratic \n     minority leader, has complained, ``One would have to search \n     long and hard to find a bill in my opinion as bad as this.'' \n     He has even described the legislation as the work of \n     lobbyists hired by corporations to limit asbestos exposure. \n     But the truth is that the bill's main opponents are trial \n     lawyers, who profit mightily from asbestos lawsuits and who \n     constitute a powerful lobby in their own right. Mr. Specter \n     and Mr. Leahy are in fact model resisters of special \n     interests who have spent more than two years crafting \n     legislation that serves the public interest. For Mr. Reid to \n     demean this effort in order to fire off campaign sound bites \n     is reprehensible.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Feb. 10, 2006]\n\n                          The Asbestos Debate\n\n       There are three questions the Senate should focus on as it \n     considers the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act: \n     Will the proposed $140 billion asbestos trust fund actually \n     cost $140 billion, or will its fine print eventually require \n     it to pay out much more? Can the medical criteria be \n     tightened to ensure that only people who have genuinely \n     suffered harm from asbestos are compensated? And how can one \n     minimize the chances of some future Congress putting \n     taxpayers on the hook for likely overruns?\n       This bill should pass; Senators Arlen Specter, Pennsylvania \n     Republican, and Patrick Leahy, Vermont Democrat, are due \n     accolades for getting this far on a longstanding problem that \n     has befuddled everyone for decades. Many asbestos victims \n     have suffered or died of mesothelioma or other illnesses \n     while the courts and Washington struggled with a resolution. \n     The victims and their families deserve to be made whole.\n       One good sign is the 98-1 Senate vote Tuesday to move \n     forward, indicating broad agreement that the FAIR Act is \n     acceptable as a starting point for the full Senate's debate. \n     The other is trepidation from Senate Minority Leader Harry \n     Reid: After making noises about a filibuster, Mr. Reid said \n     the bill benefited ``a few large companies'' while supposedly \n     leaving the little guy in the lurch. Really? Why, then, do \n     insurance giants AllState and AIG oppose the bill? Why are \n     many plaintiffs anxious to see it pass? In reality the big \n     guys speak through Mr. Reid--in this case, unscrupulous \n     lawyers who stand to profit greatly from keeping asbestos \n     cases in the courts. Under the FAIR Act, fees for lawyers top \n     out at five percent of the award--far less than they get in \n     court.\n       Of course, there are good reasons to worry about the \n     ``little guy''--just not the ones Mr. Reid suggests. If \n     previous federal ``trust fund'' schemes are any indication, \n     this fund could bleed billions of dollars only a few years \n     from now and demand either a federal bailout or a return to \n     the courts. The first is bad for the average taxpayer; the \n     other is\n\n[[Page S1050]]\n\n     bad for most claimants. As for the first, the nonpartisan \n     National Taxpayers Union opposes the trust fund on the \n     grounds that a bust is likely. It calls the fund ``a fiscal \n     time bomb.'' The second would land claimants back in limbo in \n     courts (to the great pleasure of asbestos lawyers, of course, \n     who clog up the system with questionable cases).\n       The precedents show how daunting this month's debate will \n     be. As we've reported previously, only one of the many \n     smaller trust funds created over the years has been able to \n     meet its obligations, according to Francine Rabinovitz, a \n     trust-fund expert at the University of Southern California. \n     Last year she told Sens. Jon Kyl, Arizona Republican, and Tom \n     Coburn, Oklahoma Republican, that ``none of the bankruptcy \n     trusts created prior to 2002 have been able to pay over the \n     life anywhere close to 50 percent of the liquidated value of \n     qualifying claims.'' Claims against the Johns Manville \n     bankruptcy fund--one flawed effort to solve asbestos-injury \n     claims--outstripped resources by a factor of 20.\n       That begs some questions. Will this $140 billion fund \n     ``sunset'' in three years like its conservative critics say \n     it will? Even the Congressional Budget Office predicts it \n     will bleed $6.5 billion a year by 2015.\n       What about the medical criteria? A group of conservative \n     senators on the Judiciary Committee worried about the fund's \n     solvency cited this among concerns when they sent the bill to \n     the Senate floor last year. Sens. Jon Kyl, Arizona \n     Republican, and Tom Coburn, Oklahoma Republican, said that \n     they were ``deeply concerned that this fund will run out of \n     money and prove unable to pay all qualifying claimants.''\n       This debate will play out fully in the Senate over the \n     coming days. In the meantime, it's worth pointing out what \n     the FAIR Act offers that nothing previously has: A light at \n     the end of the tunnel for claimants. Under FAIR, compensation \n     ranges from $25,000 for people who suffer breathing \n     difficulties to as much as $1.1 million for victims of the \n     deadly cancer mesothelioma. It has taken long enough to get \n     this far. The Senate is close to leading the way out.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Very briefly in response, this is an important bill that, \nagain, is not a partisan bill at all. If you look at the votes today, \nyou will see the split is between each caucus. I say that because so \nmany bills come to the floor as partisan bills or bills proposed by one \nparty, and they see such discussion and procedural moves. It is \nincumbent upon each Senator, looking within themselves and their own \nconscience, to ask the question: Is this a problem that deserves \nfixing?\n  I believe, based on the discussions today--that is the good thing \nabout this last week--that it is a tragedy in terms of the victims, in \nterms of the jobs lost, in terms of the pensions lost--all due to a \nbroken system. It would be a tragedy if we did not address it. We have \na bipartisan bill which has come out of committee. It is open for \ndebate on the floor of this body.\n  Just to clarify, we do have pending a budget point of order that \nneeds to be discussed. Every Senator must understand what our chairman \nwas saying through conversations because we will have a vote early next \nweek on this point of order.

That \nresponsibility would be shoved aside.\n  I encourage my colleagues to look at this point of order, what it \nmeans in terms of procedure, and then answer the question, Is there a \nproblem out there? And if the answer is yes, now is the time to fix it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/10/senate-section/article/S1050-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson).

Mr. President, 9 years ago, scientific advances in the \ntechnology of nuclear transfer permitted the cloning of a sheep named \nDolly. The immediate reaction of most Americans, and most Members of \nCongress, was to try to make certain that this process was never used \nto create a human being, never allowing a human Dolly to be cloned. I \nremember thinking at the time that I personally did not want to live in \na world where I was walking down the street and saw myself coming in \nthe opposite direction.\n  Why this reaction? After all, cloning is an acceptable thing in the \nagricultural world. The difference, of course, is that human beings \nhave a unique dignity. When parents decide to have a child, they do it \nfor the benefit of the baby, to nurture that new life to live up to the \npotential and live out the plan which God created for him or her. All \nof us agree that people should not be cloned because the only reason \nyou clone something is to use it, and human beings should and do exist \nfor reasons of greater dignity than simply to be used by others. I \nthink we all understand that if we were ever to allow a race of clones \nto be created as workers or body parts warehouses for society, we would \ncheapen the dignity of humanity to the point where none of the rest of \nus would be safe in our lives or freedoms.\n  Yet, despite this shared impulse against cloning, it has been 9 years \nsince Dolly was created, and no safeguards against cloning have passed \nthe Congress. Nor are there prospects of any such bill passing in the \nnear future. The reason is that there is an area of overlap between the \nissues of cloning and stem cells. Many scientists believe that stem \ncells from a cloned human embryo may have unique advantages for medical \nresearch. This part of the scientific community has resisted the total \nban on cloning which has been introduced each of the last 6 years in \nthe belief that such a ban would inhibit one important aspect of stem \ncell research. Both sides have settled into what has now become a rigid \nstalemate, like the Western Front in WWI. Even though the idea of \ncloning human beings is morally repugnant to most of us, there is \ncurrently no Federal prohibition or even regulation of any aspect of \nhuman cloning, or for that matter of warehousing body parts and \ncreating ``fetus farms,'' and no prospect of getting such prohibitions.\n  I have spent the better part of a year researching this issue, \nmeeting with people on all sides: groups who oppose cloning embryos to \nget stem cells, scientists who support it, parents who don't know who \nor what to believe but who are desperate for a cure for their children. \nMany to whom I have spoken have strong opinions about the underlying \nmoral issues. In every case, I respected the sincerity and passion of \nthose whom I spoke with. I have strong opinions of my own.\n  I believe human beings are precious. I am concerned about the \ntendency of our society to devalue people because they are too old, too \nyoung, or too inconvenient to have around. At the same time, I \nunderstand the desperation of parents whose children are sick\n\n[[Page S1051]]\n\nor dying and who are desperate for treatments that will make them well. \nI often tour neonatal units. It breaks my heart to see children there \nfighting for life. I also meet with kids who are struggling heroically \nwith chronic disease. I want to find cures for these children--but I \nalso want them to grow up in a society that values them for their \ninherent dignity, for who they are, regardless of their age, infirmity, \nor level of achievement in the world's eyes.\n  Just because we are deadlocked about what to do in the present is no \nreason we cannot agree on what we want the future to be. We find \nourselves at the beginning of a great new era of biology. I believe we \ncan and should determine what our children's future will look like, and \nwhat objectives we want for our Nation. And, clearly, for all of us \nthis would include progress in biomedicine built upon a solid \nfoundation of moral principles in defense of human dignity.\n  I have come to the floor of the Senate today because there are just \nsuch hopeful prospects for the future. As is so often the case, the \ntechnology that generates the problem may also provide the solution. \nJust as recent scientific advancements created a moral dilemma, \ndiscoveries that are even more recent may provide a way out. Within a \nshort time, it may be possible to get the exact stem cells researchers \nsay they need without cloning an embryo. This means that we need no \nlonger argue about such important but difficult questions as whether an \nembryo is fully a person or whether and when stem cell research may \nactually produce medical cures. The good news is that we can \neffectively prohibit human cloning and do it with a consensus that \nheretofore has not been possible; we can honorably reconcile our \npositions without requiring anyone to compromise their principles--\nprovided that we are willing to approach the cloning issue humbly and \npractically, and provided also that both sides really do want what they \nsay they want.\n  Mr. President, one of the difficulties with this issue is that much \ndepends on understanding at least the basics of the science involved, \nand the science is complicated--especially for those of us who limped \nthrough high school biology. So I want to review some of the facts \nabout stem cells and in particular about how stem cell research \nintersects with cloning.\n  A stem cell is a cell that does not itself perform a physiological or \nstructural function in the body but instead serves as a source for \ncells that do perform such functions. During early development, stem \ncells help form the human body; in adult life, stem cells stand in \nreserve, to be used as needed to create new blood cells, brain cells, \nliver cells, and many other cells with a specific function in the body.\n  In current scientific language, there are two basic categories of \nstem cells: first, adult stem cells and, second, embryonic stem cells, \nwhich are also called pluripotent stem cells.\n  Adult stem cells exist all over the body. Their purpose is to \nmaintain and repair damaged tissue. Science has known about, researched \nand used adult stem cells for years. To date, adult stem cell research \nhas resulted in the development of a variety of therapeutic treatments \nfor diseases: over 60 peer-reviewed treatments using adult stem cells \nexist today. These treatments include autoimmune diseases such as lupus \nand multiple sclerosis and blood diseases such as sickle cell disease.\n  A few years ago, American scientists announced that they had isolated \nstem cells from human embryos as well. These stem cells, called, \nnaturally, ``embryonic'' stem cells, are the cells that, during the \nfirst days of life, begin dividing and differentiating, developing into \nthe various parts of the body. Currently the cells can only be obtained \nfrom embryos created through in vitro fertilization, IVF. Once \nisolated, however, embryonic stem cells are self-replicating, which \nmeans an individual embryonic stem cell can produce tens of thousands \nof additional stem cells.\n  There is an important difference between ``adult'' and ``embryonic'' \nstem cells. Adult stem cells are found in the developed tissue or \norgans of the body and they can in general differentiate only to yield \nthe cell types of the tissue or organ from which they came. In general, \nthat means that an adult stem cell can become only one kind of tissue. \nA heart stem cell, for example, becomes heart tissue; a liver adult \nstem cell becomes liver tissue, and so on. Remember, the primary roles \nof adult stem cells are to maintain and repair the tissue in which they \nare found.\n  An embryonic stem cell, on the other hand, is considered \n``pluripotent.'' That means an embryonic stem cell could develop into \nany of the different cell types of the body. They could in theory, if \nproperly controlled, be commanded to become any one of a number of \ndifferent tissues. This is logical, because embryonic stem cells are \nderived from the very cells in the embryo that are awaiting genetic \ninstructions on what organ or other part of the body they will become. \nIt is important to remember that the major reason science wants \nembryonic stem cells is because of this pluripotent quality. The fact \nthat pluripotent stem cells come from embryos is a problem rather than \na good thing, because of the obvious ethical concerns in extracting a \ncell from a human embryo and thereby destroying the embryo.\n  Whereas the value of adult stem cell research is accepted by \nconsensus, there is more controversy over the scientific efficacy of \nembryonic stem cell research. The pluripotency of embryonic stem cells \ngives them more diverse potential, since they can in theory be \n``programmed'' to become any kind of tissue. In practice, controlling \npluripotent stem cells enough to produce actual treatments has been \nvery difficult, and researchers to whom I have spoken, while supporting \nresearch with these cells, have emphasized that cures are likely to be \nmany years away, if they come at all.\n  Because of this, some have argued that pluripotent stem cell research \nis of negligible value and that we should feel no compunction about \npreventing such research. But too many scientists of different \nbackgrounds have insisted otherwise for me to be certain of that \nconclusion. The truth is that it is simply too soon to know whether \nscience can control pluripotent stem cells well enough to use them for \nmedical therapies; to the extent there is a consensus on this issue, it \nis that such research is speculative but promising.\n  Even more recently science has determined that a third category of \nstem cells may be useful. These stem cells are genetically matched to \nthe patients who need the cell therapies. For several years, scientists \nhave believed that it may be possible to derive these genetically \nmatched stem cells through a process called somatic cell nuclear \ntransfer or SCNT.\n  In SCNT the nucleus of an unfertilized human egg, which contains 23 \nchromosomes, is removed and replaced by the nucleus of an adult body \ncell. The new ``transferred'' nucleus would be genetically complete, \ncontaining all 46 chromosomes of the donor cell. This imitates the \neffect of normal fertilization in which the sperm's 23 chromosomes add \nto the egg's 23 to make the needed 46. The egg with the transferred \nnucleus is then stimulated and begins dividing like a naturally \nfertilized embryo. If all goes well, in 4 to 5 days it gets to a stage \nof development, called the blastocyst, from which embryonic stem cells \nwould be harvested. These stem cells would be distinct from the \nembryonic stem cells derived from IVF in that they would genetically \nmatch the donor. Proponents of SCNT are hopeful that assuming they can \novercome the challenge of controlling the development of any \npluripotent stem cell, and assuming that they can successfully complete \nSCNT at all, these genetically matched stem cells would be superior to \nother forms of pluripotent stem cells in curing disease.\n  Again, stem cell research in general has nothing to do with SCNT. It \nis only with respect to one particular type of embryonic stem cell--a \nstem cell which no one has ever developed but that might have \nincremental advantages over other embryonic stem cells--that science \nwants to do SCNT. The reason SCNT is controversial is that it is a form \nof cloning. In fact, it is the same technique that was used \nsuccessfully to create Dolly the sheep.\n  Both the proponents and opponents of SCNT agree that, if successful, \nit would result in the cloning of a human embryo.\n  Some supporters of SCNT, however, argue that a human embryo does not\n\n[[Page S1052]]\n\nbecome a human being until it is implanted in a womb, and that unless \nresearchers intend to implant the cloned embryo, SCNT should be \npermitted. The opponents of SCNT believe just as passionately that a \nhuman being does not depend on developmental age, and that a human \nembryo is therefore a human being from its beginning. From this \nperspective SCNT is the creation of a human being for purely \ninstrumental use exactly what, in theory, a cloning ban is designed to \nprevent. But up until now, both sides have assumed that any nuclear \ntransfer procedure which would result in the creation of pluripotent \nstem cells must first have produced a human embryo.\n\n  Yet the most recent scientific developments suggest that this is not \ntrue. In May 2005 the President's Council on Bioethics released a white \npaper entitled ``Alternative Sources of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells.'' \nIn this report, the council outlined four specific proposals for a \nscientific solution to our current political impasse over stem cell \nresearch. In the months since that report was issued, progress in each \nof these approaches has been reported in the leading peer-reviewed \nscientific journals. Research on one of these proposals, altered \nnuclear transfer, is especially encouraging and suggests that all the \nscientific and medical goals of SCNT could be realized without the \ncloning or destruction of human embryos.\n  Remember, with somatic cell nuclear transfer researchers would take \nthe genetic material out of a human egg, replace it with the complete \ngenetic code of the donor, and then shock it so that it starts to \ndivide. In theory, an organism created in such a way--artificially \nrather than naturally--could divide and grow until it became an adult \nhuman being. Altered nuclear transfer is a form of somatic cell nuclear \ntransfer in that it uses nuclear transfer but with a preemptive \nalteration of the genetic material. To put it simply, the somatic cell \nis altered prior to being transferred. The resultant entity would be \ncapable of producing pluripotent stem cells but because of the \npreemptive alterations during the transfer process it would be \nincapable, from its creation, of the organization and developmental \npotential that are the defining characteristics of an embryo.\n  Altered nuclear transfer is a broad umbrella concept with many \npossible specific approaches. For example, one proposed approach using \nANT is called ANT-OAR. This form of ANT involves reprogramming the \nsomatic cell to enter directly into a pluripotent stem cell state, \nwithout going through any of the normal developmental stages. All of \nthis means that ANT could create genetically matched stem cells without \never having to produce anything with the capacity to be considered a \nhuman embryo.\n  This distinction between SCNT and ANT is vital from a moral and legal \nperspective. Until the last few months, everyone has assumed that \nnuclear transfer which was successful in generating pluripotent stem \ncells must first have created a human embryo. The entity which ANT \ncould create would produce pluripotent stem cells from a laboratory-\nconstructed cellular source lacking the developmental potential of a \nhuman embryo. In layman's terms, the entity which ANT would create \ncould only develop for a few days and would then ``close down.'' ANT \nthus transcends the moral dilemma which has heretofore prevented any \nlegislation from passing. It renders moot the question of whether human \nlife begins at creation or implantation of an embryo since the entity \nthat ANT could create would not have at its inception the \norganizational and developmental capability to be considered a human \nlife.\n  Further exploration of the ANT proposal already has the support of a \nlong list of scientists and ethicists and religious leaders, including \nthe former chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops \nCommittee on Doctrine. The author and most vocal champion of ANT is Dr. \nWilliam Hurlbut of Stanford. Dr. Hurlbut assured me months ago that ANT \nwas technologically feasible and would soon be validated through animal \nmodels. And, indeed, just 4 months ago stem cell biologists, Alexander \nMeissner and Rudolf Jaenisch, of the Whitehead Institute at MIT, used \naltered nuclear transfer to produce fully functional pluripotent stem \ncells from a laboratory-construct that is dramatically different in \ndevelopmental potential than a natural embryo. In testimony to an \nOctober 2005 Senate hearing on stem cells, Dr. Jaenisch explained that \nthis procedure is simple and straightforward and does not involve the \ncreation of an embryo. Dr. Jaenisch said, ``Because the ANT product \nlacks essential properties of the fertilized embryo, it is not \njustified to call it an ``embryo.'' That was October 19, 2005 testimony \nat an Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, \nEducation hearing on ``An Alternative Method for Obtaining Embryonic \nStem Cells.'' This scientific advance was widely reported precisely \nbecause it signals the end of the ethical dilemma in this area of \nresearch; it suggests that science may soon be able to get this special \nkind of stem cell--pluripotent stem cells that genetically match the \ndonor/patient--without cloning, creating, or destroying a human embryo.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the patience of the Senate in bearing \nwith me as I wound my way through the scientific thicket. I believe it \nwas necessary to lay this foundation before proceeding, and I suspect \nthat the Senate may already see the practical suggestion which I see as \nthe logical result given the latest technological developments and the \ncurrent stalemate.\n  Again, to reaffirm my central point, many scientists have resisted a \ntotal ban on human cloning because they believed it was necessary to \nclone human embryos for a narrow purpose: to get pluripotent stem cells \nwhich are a genetic match of the person whom they hope to treat \nmedically. However, it now appears that it will be possible to get such \nstem cells without cloning an embryo.\n  Some may argue that these alternative forms of nuclear transfer and \nother new technologies are unproven and may never produce usable new \ndiscoveries. But the same thing can be said of embryonic stem cell \nresearch in general and SCNT in particular. Bear in mind that science \nhas yet to succeed in getting pluripotent stem cells from SCNT at all. \nNor, for that matter, is there a single new cure from embryonic stem \ncells derived from any source. If researchers cannot learn how to \nisolate and control genetic signals, then pluripotent stem cell \nresearch will turn out to have little medical application; if such \ncontrol does prove possible, then there should soon be no reason to \nhave to get the stem cells by a method that clones or destroys a human \nembryo.\n\n  As I mentioned earlier, we appear to be at a legislative stalemate. \nThe key to reaching the proper legislative solution, I believe, is to \nrecognize that the new scientific developments create possibilities for \nan honorable reconciliation that simply did not exist at the time \nSenators developed and sponsored the various cloning bills that are \ncurrently introduced in the Congress. In effect, the new technology is \nrendering the approach of those pieces of legislation out of date.\n  For example, the main anti-cloning bill, S. 658, of which I am a \ncosponsor, would ban the use of nuclear transfer whenever it resulted \nin the creation of a human embryo or an organism that was ``virtually \nidentical'' to a human embryo. This standard satisfies one of the \nimportant principles of the pro-life community, because it recognizes \nthat the dignity of pre-born human beings doesn't depend on their \ngestational age. But it fails to account for the possibility, created \nby altered nuclear transfer and some of the other alternative methods, \nthat an entity may be ``virtually identical'' to an embryo in the sense \nthat it has a similar external appearance--and can seem to be \ndeveloping as it divides--without ever possessing the inherent \norganizational capability to be rightly considered a human being.\n  Because of this, there is a danger that the language of S. 658, which \nwas adequate when we all assumed that any entity capable of creating \nembryonic stem cells must be a human embryo, would outlaw or imperil \nprecisely those alternatives which hold the greatest promise of \nallowing stem cell research while protecting the integrity of human \nlife. I discussed this problem with Doctor Hurlbut and, in a recent \nletter, he expressed concern that S. 658 as drafted might be \nmisinterpreted to\n\n[[Page S1053]]\n\noutlaw ANT. He pointed out that the term `virtually identical' is vague \nand unscientific and, therefore, could be open to misinterpretation \neither more broadly or more narrowly than intended by the proponents of \nthis legislation.\n  The existence of alternatives like ANT actually strengthens the case \nof those of us who oppose the cloning of human embryos, since it \npromises another, ethically untroubling way of getting the same \ngenetically matched stem cells scientists need. But it also shows that \nthere is much about nuclear transfer that we have yet to discover, and \nit cautions against enacting criminal sanctions, like S. 658, that \ncould have unintended consequences because they presume a scientific \nequilibrium that simply doesn't exist. Congress should still move \neffectively to prohibit human cloning but the approach of S. 658 needs \nto change. At minimum, the ``virtually identical'' language in S. 658 \nshould be discarded, and the bill should specifically define when a \ncloned entity has the organizational capability and developmental \npotential to be considered a human being. But, I would prefer to enact \na regulatory ban that could be adjusted over time to reflect changes in \nthe science like ANT, perhaps after consultation with the President's \nCouncil on Bioethics, and I would couple that ban with aggressive \nfunding of ANT and other alternatives, perhaps in the form of the \ncompetitive incentive program I will discuss in a moment.\n  The other main cloning legislation, S. 876, should, in light of \nrecent developments, be equally unsatisfactory to many of its \nsupporters, although for different reasons. S. 876 does not regulate \nthe initial nuclear transfer process at all but simply bans implanting \na cloned embryo. This is good as far as it goes, but S. 876 would \nprovide no protection whatsoever to human life before implantation. \nUnder generally accepted medical protocols today, science can't even \nexperiment on animals if other methods of doing the same research are \navailable, yet S. 876 would permit the cloning of human embryos for any \npurpose and under any circumstances, regardless even of whether the \nresearchers need or intend to use the embryos for stem cell research.\n  The proponents of S. 876 were almost forced into this position to \nprotect the stem cell research they thought necessary, because they \nbelieved, as we all did, that the only way to get genetically matched \nstem cells was through cloning and that any such cloning would \nnecessarily produce a human embryo. But the evidence now suggests that \nthis is not true. I am sure that the supporters of S. 876 are sincere \nin their belief that a human embryo does not acquire full personhood \nuntil some point after it is created. But I respectfully suggest that \nthis view is no longer a reason, given the changing science, to \ncontinue supporting a legal standard that affords no dignity whatsoever \nto human life at its earliest stages.\n  The answer is for both sides to take advantage of scientific changes \nto find proposals which they can mutually support and which offer \nadvantages to each compared to the current stalemate.\n  To that end, I propose a competition, to be managed by the National \nInstitutes of Health, which would create incentives for our great \nresearch institutions to get the genetically matched stem cells we need \nwithout risking cloning an embryo. Simply put, the NIH would take \napplications from research institutions with research plans to \naccomplish the goal. The exact funding and practical details of this \nwould have to be carefully worked out, but let me put forward a \npreliminary proposal. Five institutions would be selected for the \ncompetition and provided $10 million each to conduct their \ncomprehensive plan. The first institution to successfully harvest \ngenetically matched stem cells without cloning a human embryo would \nreceive a prize of $20 million. NIH would develop the boundaries of the \ncompetition with the restriction being that the research could not \nviolate the terms of the Dickey Amendment. Once ANT or one of the other \nalternative methods was successful and we had a proven means to get \ngenetically matched stem cells without cloning a human being, the NIH \ncould issue regulations requiring science to use that technology in its \nresearch.\n  The idea of a competition is not new. They have successfully been \nused for centuries to educate, inspire, and motivate. For example, \nCharles Lindberg won a $25,000 prize for the first nonstop flight \nbetween Paris and New York in 1927. In 2004, a company called Scaled \nComposites won a $10 million prize for the first privately funded \nmanned suborbital flight from the St. Louis-based X Prize Foundation. \nInspired by the success of the X prize--and with the support of \nCongress, the President and his Commission on Implementation of U.S. \nExploration Policy--NASA has begun a federally funded program called \nCentennial Challenges that awards prizes to stimulate innovation in \ntechnical areas of interest to space exploration. In fact, the program \nmanager at NASA, Brant Sponberg, said they expect to spend $80 million \non prizes over the next 5 years.\n\n  A proposal of this kind moves us forward in a way both sides should \nbe able to support. After all, the sole argument for SCNT is that we \nneed it to get certain kinds of stem cells; the argument against it is \nthat it involves the cloning of human embryos. If we can get the stem \ncells without the cloning, we render the current controversy \nscientifically obsolete. Science would have the stem cells it needs in \na morally acceptable way that would allow for full Federal funding of \nstem cell research. The pro-life community would have an effective ban \non human cloning. We would turn a zero sum game into a win-win \nproposition for everyone.\n  We are entering a promising new era in biomedical technology, but as \nour power over human life increases, so does the seriousness of the \nmoral issues. It is important to acknowledge that both sides in this \ndifficult debate are defending something important to all of us. We \nshould all want to advance biomedical science while sustaining \nfundamental principles for the protection of human life.\n  Biomedical science should be a matter of unity in our national \nidentity: no one should enter the hospital resentful that positive \npossibilities for the best therapies were not explored, or with moral \nqualms about the research on which their therapies have been developed.\n  The revelation that the South Koreans have not succeeded in obtaining \npluripotent stem cells from cloned human embryo returns this research \nto square one. This presents to our Nation both a challenge and an \nopportunity: a social challenge to seek a way forward as a unified \nsociety, and an opportunity to set a solid scientific and moral \nfoundation for future generations. The differences within our nation \ncan be a source of strength as we seek to open a way forward for \nbiomedical science. Altered nuclear transfer, and the other alternative \napproaches put forward by the President's Council on Bioethics offer us \njust such a path to progress.\n  We are at a difficult impasse, but we have extraordinary \npossibilities. Our current conflict reflects deep differences in our \npersonal perspectives, but our wider goals are similar. Any purely \npolitical victory will leave our Nation bitterly divided and erode the \nsocial support that is essential for continuing public funding of \nbiomedical science. It is with this recognition that I have put forward \nthis proposal in a spirit of unity. And beneath this spirit of unity \nmust be a spirit of humility: these are difficult issues and no one of \nus has the clarity of understanding or depth of knowledge to answer \nthem alone. But with mutual good will we can transcend the current \nparalysis and find grounds for practical progress in scientific \nresearch. In his presentation on stem cell research last July to the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, Dr. Hurlbut said the goal should be to \nfind ``islands of unity in a sea of controversy.'' We can move from one \nsuch island to another and end up in a world of progress and decency. \nThere is no reason to continue glaring at each other across the \nlegislative barricades, when the means are at hand to embrace the \nfuture of developmental biology without moral qualms or political \ndivision?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is unfair because many \nseriously ill victims of asbestos are completely excluded from \ncompensation under the trust fund, and it is unworkable because the \nbill does not have adequate funding to ensure that all the victims who \nare eligible for compensation under the trust fund will actually \nreceive what the legislation promises them.\n  These are fundamental flaws that cannot be corrected by a few last-\nminute amendments. They go to the heart of the bill. This bill will end \nup hurting the seriously ill victims of asbestos disease whom we are \ntrying to help.\n  S. 852 fails the test of fairness for many of those most in need of \nassistance. Now is the time to take a serious look at how the proposed \ntrust fund would operate--now, before it is too late.\n  Who would be excluded from receiving compensation even though they \nare seriously ill from asbestos exposure? Who would be left in legal \nlimbo, ineligible for the trust fund and unable to pursue their claims \nin court?\n  I have said many times that the real crisis which confronts us is not \nan asbestos litigation crisis, it is an asbestos-induced disease \ncrisis. We cannot allow the tragedy of these workers and their \nfamilies' enduring to become lost in a complex debate about the \neconomic impact of asbestos litigation. The litigation did not create \nthese costs. Exposure to asbestos created them. They are the cost of \nmedical care, the cost of lost wages, incapacitated workers, the cost \nof providing for the families of workers who died years before their \ntime. Those costs are real.\n\n  No legislative proposal can make them disappear. All legislation can \ndo is shift those costs from one party to another. Unfortunately, S. \n852 would shift more of the financial burden onto the backs of injured \nworkers. That is unacceptable.\n  Let's look at what this legislation would really do to victims. It \nwould close the courthouse doors to asbestos victims on the day it \npasses, long before the trust fund will be able to pay their claims. \nTheir cases will be stayed immediately. Seriously ill workers will be \nforced into legal limbo for up to 2 years. Their need for compensation \nto cover medical expenses, basic family necessities, will remain, but \nthey have nowhere to turn for relief.\n  Under this legislation, even the exigent health claims currently \npending in the courts, will be automatically stayed for 9 months as of \nthe date of enactment. These cases all involve people who have less \nthan a year to live due to mesothelioma or some other disease caused by \nasbestos exposure. Nine months is an eternity for someone with less \nthan a year to live. Many of them will die without receiving either \ntheir day in court or compensation from the trust fund.\n  The stay language is written too broadly. It would stop all forward \nmovement of a case in the court system. A trial about to begin would be \nhalted. An appellate ruling about to be issued would be barred. Even \nthe deposition of dying witnesses cannot be taken to preserve their \ntestimony. The stay would deprive victims of their last chance at \njustice. I cannot believe the authors of the bill intended such a harsh \nresult, but that is what the legislation does.\n  I strongly believe, at a minimum, all exigent cases should be \nexempted from the automatic stay in the legislation. Victims with less \nthan a year to live certainly should be allowed to continue their cases \nin court uninterrupted until the trust fund becomes operational. Their \nability to recover compensation in the court should not be halted until \nthe trust fund is open for business and they are able to receive \ncompensation from the fund. It is grossly unfair to leave these dying \nvictims in legal limbo. For them, the old adage is especially true: \nJustice delayed is justice denied.\n  We should not deprive them of their last chance, their only chance to \nreceive some measure of justice before asbestos-induced diseases \nsilence them. They should be allowed to receive compensation in their \nfinal months to ease their suffering. They should be allowed to die \nknowing that their families are financially provided for. S. 852 in its \ncurrent state takes that last chance away from them. I intend to offer \nan amendment that allows these severely ill victims to have their day \nin court.\n  I am particularly upset by the way lung cancer victims are treated in \nthis bill. Under the medical criteria adopted by the Judiciary \nCommittee overwhelmingly 2 years ago, all lung cancer victims who had \nat least 15 years of weighted exposure to asbestos were eligible to \nreceive compensation from the fund. However, that was changed in S. \n852. Under this bill, lung cancer victims who have had very substantial \nexposure to asbestos over long periods of time are denied any \ncompensation unless they can show asbestos scarring on their lungs. The \ncommittee heard expert medical testimony that prolonged asbestos \nexposure dramatically increases the probability that a person will get \nlung cancer even if they do not have scarring on their lungs. Deleting \nthis category will deny compensation to more than 40,000 victims \nsuffering with asbestos-related lung cancers. These victims, many of \nwhom will have their lives cut short because of asbestos-induced \ndisease, will not receive one penny from the fund. They are losing \ntheir right to go to court. They are being denied any right to \ncompensation under the fund. They are, in essence, being told to suffer \nin a legally imposed silence with no recourse whatsoever.\n  One of the arguments we hear most frequently in favor of creating an \nasbestos trust fund is that in the current system too much money goes \nto people who are not really sick and too little goes to those who are \nseriously ill. Lung cancer victims who have had years of exposure to \nasbestos are the ones who are seriously ill. They are the ones this \nlegislation is supposed to be helping. Yet they are, under this \nlegislation--not the previous legislation but under this legislation--\ncompletely excluded. Any person who was exposed to asbestos for 15 or \nmore years and now has lung cancer should be eligible for compensation \nfrom the trust fund. Their cases would be reviewed individually by a \npanel of physicians to determine whether asbestos was a substantial \ncontributing factor to their lung cancer. These 40,000 victims of \nasbestos should not be arbitrarily excluded from receiving \ncompensation.\n  They were included in the original legislation. It was agreed to by \nmedical experts for both business and labor. That provision should be \nrestored to the bill. I will be proposing an amendment to rectify this \nserious injustice.\n  Another major shortcoming of this legislation is its failure to \ncompensate the residents of areas that have experienced large-scale \nasbestos contamination. S. 852 simply pretends this problem does not \nexist. It fails to compensate the victims of all asbestos-induced \ndiseases, other than mesothelioma, whose exposure was not directly tied \nto their work. There is very substantial scientific evidence showing \nthat the men, women, and children who lived in the vicinity of \nasbestos-contaminated sites, such as mining operations and processing \nplants, can and do contract asbestos-induced diseases.\n  The reason this legislation needs a special provision to compensate \nthe residents of Libby, MT, is because it does not compensate victims \nof community contamination generally. The residents of Libby are \ncertainly entitled to compensation, but so are the residents who live \nnear the many processing plants from my State of Massachusetts, in \nwestern Massachusetts, to California, that received the lethal ore from \nthe Libby mine. The deadly dust from Libby, MT, was spread across \nAmerica. W.R. Grace shipped almost 10,000 pounds of ore to processing \nfacilities in the 1960s through the 1990s, including Easthampton, MA, \nin western Massachusetts, where the operations of an expanding \nplant spread the asbestos to the surrounding environment, into the air \nand onto the soil. I intend to discuss this problem in great detail as \nthe debate moves forward.\n\n  I raise it now as a dramatic example of the unfairness caused by the \narbitrary exclusion of a large number of asbestos victims from \ncompensation under the trust fund. These red spots on this map are in \nStates all across the\n\n[[Page S1055]]\n\ncountry with similar problems. Yet every one of them is excluded.\n  Community asbestos contamination can result from many different \nsources. Medical experts, for example, say it may result from exposure \nto asbestos after the collapse of the World Trade Center. Because of \nthe long latency period, we often do not learn about community asbestos \ncontamination until long after it occurs. Certainly these victims of \nasbestos are entitled to fair treatment, as well. They should not be \narbitrarily excluded from compensation, as if somehow their suffering \nis somehow less worthy of recognition than the suffering of asbestos \nvictims. Yet that is what S. 852 does.\n  There are many of those victims. I have talked with the \nextraordinarily brave and courageous workers who came to the sites of \nthe Trade Towers on September 11, working on those areas for days and \nweeks for an intense period of time, and their exposure to asbestos \nfibers during that work will pose an enormous health threat to them in \nthe years to come. We all know there can be a significant period of \nlatency. Are we going to exclude those extraordinary men and women who \nwere out there trying to do an incredible job for the people, not just \nof New York but for our country? This legislation excludes them.\n  The asbestos trust fund is being presented as an alternative source \nof compensation for victims suffering from asbestos-induced disease. If \nthat alternative runs out of money and can no longer compensate those \nvictims in a full and timely manner, their right to seek compensation \nthrough the judicial system should be immediately restored with no \nstrings attached. There is no principle more basic. Yet this bill \nviolates that principle.\n  Our friend and colleague from Delaware intends to offer an amendment \nthat if we run out of money, the provisions will be there for them to \ngo back into the tort system. Just accept the Biden amendment. It makes \nit extremely clear and eliminates the roadblocks for going back into \nthe tort system, as the current legislation does. As I understand it, \nthere is not a willingness to accept the Biden amendment.\n  Another major flaw in this legislation is it lacks adequate funding. \nPutting it bluntly, S. 852 does not provide sufficient money to \ncompensate the victims of asbestos diseases that it promises to cover. \nThat is the essence of the budget debate we are having about the bill. \nThe sponsors claim the budget point of order against the bill is \ntechnical, but the financial inadequacy of the trust fund to meet its \nobligation is very real. Should the trust fund fail, both asbestos \nvictims and the taxpayers will pay a heavy price.\n  A broad range of experts have analyzed S. 852 and concluded that the \nasbestos trust fund created by this legislation is seriously \nunderfunded. Senator Conrad has addressed this in great detail. I \ncertainly hope our colleagues will read his remarks carefully.\n  If S. 852 is enacted, the United States will be paying a commitment \nthat hundreds of thousands of seriously ill asbestos victims will be \ncompensated, but it will not have to ensure that adequate dollars are \navailable to honor its commitment. That will precipitate a genuine \nasbestos crisis and this Congress will bear the responsibility for it.\n  Since the trust fund will be borrowing from the U.S. Treasury in the \nfirst few years of operation, if it becomes insolvent it will have a \ndirect impact on American taxpayers. Let me point out, we do not do \nvery well in setting up these trust funds to compensate individuals. We \ncertainly have not done it with regard to the downwinders in other \ntrust funds. There is little reason to believe we are going to do it or \nwould do it in this circumstance, either.\n  The argument that there are serious inadequacies in the way asbestos \ncases are abjudicated today does not mean that any legislation is \nbetter than the current system. Our first obligation is to do no harm. \nWe should not be supporting legislation that excludes many seriously \nill victims from receiving compensation that fails to provide a \nguarantee of adequate funding to make sure these injured workers \ncovered by the trust fund will actually receive what the bill promises \nthem. This bill will do harm to these asbestos victims. I intend to \nvote no.\n  There is no reason, if we reject this legislation, we cannot come \nback with legislation that builds on a trust fund that is adequate and \nwill do the job. That is what many Members believe is the way we ought \nto go. This is not such a bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/10/senate-section/article/S1055-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1055-S1057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will talk for a few moments about the \nbudget that has been submitted by this administration in the last few \ndays and how it fails to address those needs.\n  Effectively, in the budget the President has set up, we are going to \nsee a very serious and significant decline in supporting some \nenormously needed programs that help to provide opportunities for so \nmany of our people in this country, such as educational programs and \nhealth programs, all in order that we provide a tax break for \nindividual Americans at the cost of $45 billion or $46 billion this \nyear.\n  That is what a budget is about: priorities. When I go back to \nMassachusetts, one of the first orders of business people are talking \nto me about is: What in the world did the Congress ever do in passing \nthat prescription drug program?\n  I take pride in the fact we passed in the Senate a very good \nprescription drug program with Senator Bob Graham from Florida. We \nreceived over 70 votes in the Senate. We built that program using the \nMedicare system, which is tried, tested, and depended upon by millions \nof Americans.\n  Medicare was defeated in 1964 and accepted in 1965 in the Senate. \nRight after that, we accepted the Medicaid Program to look after the \nneediest people in our society--primarily children, women, and disabled \nindividuals--to take care of the poorest of the poor.\n  Those programs were implemented in 11 months--11 months. It has been \nover a year for this program to be implemented. And they did not have a \ncomputer in 1965 to implement it, but it worked on the principle of \nbuilding the Medicare system similar to Social Security. American \npeople had confidence in it, and it worked.\n  Well, we went to conference with the House of Representatives, and \nthat is when the influence of the insurance industry and the drug \nindustry came to play. They basically hijacked what was going to be a \nMedicare prescription drug program for our senior citizens, in a way, \nand drafted that program to serve not the senior citizens--not the \nsenior citizens--but to serve the special interests.\n  I opposed that on the floor of the Senate. Our Republican friends \nforced that on through. And now it is chaos in my State of \nMassachusetts with that prescription drug program. Why, at least, \ndidn't our Republican friends say: All right, let's have some real \ncompetition; let's put the private sector and Medicare--let them \ncompete and let our senior citizens make the choice.\n  Do you think they would do that? No. They would not bring a program \nback here that was built on the Medicare system. They would not permit \nthe seniors in my State to be able to make a choice. But they will say: \nWe trust Medicare. It provides for our doctors' bills. It provides for \nour hospitalization.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In 1964 and 1965, when you passed that, you did not \ninclude prescription drugs because 97 percent of the private sector did \nnot include prescription drugs. Why didn't we do the prescription drug \nprogram just like we did the Medicare Program? Simple, workable, \nunderstandable--finished.\n  No, no, we can't do that. We have to do it a different way. We are \ngoing to have--instead of the Medicare system, which is tried and \ntested and people understand--we are going to give the seniors in \nMassachusetts 45 different programs with different copays, different \nformularies, different deductibles.\n  There is mass confusion with that program. Not only is there mass \nconfusion, but you have the extraordinary circumstance that when a \nsenior says: OK. I like this formulary. I can afford this deductible. I \ncan afford this copay. I think I will go into this because of the cost \nof prescription drugs--and they sign on to it. There is an enormously \ninteresting fact; that is, the company they sign up with can change \ntheir formulary, can change the deductible and copay. Do you think the\n\n[[Page S1056]]\n\nsenior can get out of that program without paying a penalty? Of course, \nthey cannot. What kind of business is it? They feel, if the private \nsector can do it so well, why don't we have the competition?\n  Why did we have to provide a 9-percent inflater cost for all the \nHMOs, when people who are in the HMOs are 18 percent healthier than \nthey are in Medicare? Add that together, my friends, and it is 25 \npercent more if you are in the HMO than if you are in the Medicare \nsystem. Why? Well, if that is the private sector, why isn't the private \nsector able to compete? Because this amounts to about a $40 billion \nsubsidy. Do you hear me? A $40 billion subsidy, just like it is about a \n$170 billion subsidy for the drug industry.\n  People wonder why the copayments are higher. Would people wonder why \nthe doughnut is there? There it is, my friends. And with all the \nreforms we hear talked about, do you think we are going to get a chance \nto support a change in that program by adding a--build it on Medicare. \nLet's do that. Let's add that. Have a real even competition and see \nwhat happens out there.\n  But many of my colleagues feel that way. We are going to press to try \nto do it. The point I am making is, I care deeply about these asbestos \nvictims. It is enormously important we get it right. This bill does not \ndo it. But we are in this Congress, on a Friday, at 10 minutes of 11, \nwith an empty Chamber. Why aren't we dealing with the challenges and \nthe problems of the people back home?\n  I can tell you what they are concerned about. Why aren't we debating \nthis Medicare today, this afternoon? Why are we so busy in what we are \ndoing that we are not dealing with this issue? Why aren't we dealing \nwith their home heating oil and the priorities? We have the President \nin his budget recommending, for this year, $500 million less for home \nheating oil than even last year, with record profits for the oil \nindustry--unconscionable profits for the oil industry. Paid for by \nwhom? Average Americans. Unconscionable.\n\n  Why doesn't this President today, on this Friday, bring in the heads \nof the oil companies all over the country and say: You have drunk at \nthat trough long enough. There are people up in New England and the \nupper Midwest and around this country who cannot afford it--who are on \na fixed income--with the explosions in the cost. Because of the war in \nIraq, oil costs $60 a barrel. They did not have anything to do with it. \nThe oil companies are reaping profits because we have turmoil in the \nMiddle East. And we are doing virtually nothing about that this \nafternoon, except facing a budget that is going to make it even more \ndifficult.\n  In my State, the average home owner uses three tankfuls a year--three \ntankfuls a year--of oil. And the neediest people in our State who \nqualify for this program are going to get, this year, about one \ntankful. And what is the prospect for next year with the home heating \noil price that we have today? They are not even going to get a full \ntank for the next year, unless we are--well, Mr. President, I am going \nto seek recognition in my own right at the present time. My time has \nexpired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized in morning business \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are talking about priorities. We are \ngiving examples of what has been happening in terms of the cost of \nLIHEAP and the fuel assistance programs. Shown on this chart are all \nthe costs going right up through the roof. We have the challenges we \nhave been facing out in the Middle East. Education.\n  Why are people so concerned about a culture of corruption that has \ntaken over in Washington? Why are they so concerned about lobbyists? \nWhy are they so concerned about special interests? We have that debate. \nWe are going to try to get action on this, which I will certainly \nsupport.\n  What we have not talked about is what those lobbyists have been \ndoing, what the impact has been on various programs that affect working \nfamilies in the middle class. I will give you one of them. Higher \neducation. The bill that came out of the Senate had $8 billion in \nstudent assistance. The bill that came out of the House had $3.8 \nbillion in student assistance and provided $12 billion in tax breaks \nfor the wealthy people of this country. I call that a tax on middle \nclass people, my friends, in order to give a tax break to the \nwealthiest individuals.\n  Do you understand what I am saying? The lobbyists were able to make \nthe student loan program work for the banks and the wealthy in this \ncountry at the expense of the middle-income families who are paying \nthose debts now for their children to go on to education.\n  In my State, 67 percent of the children who go to those schools and \ncolleges in my State get student aid and assistance. That does not \ninclude what they earn at summer jobs and what their parents \ncontribute. They need these programs. We have seen an explosion in \nstudent loans over the period of the last 5 or 7 years. Who has been \nworking and who has been profiting? It has been the banks--the banks.\n  Do you think this Senate would stand for a competition for who would \nprovide the lowest rates for students so we could take the total \nstudent loan program and put it out for bid--for bid--similar to \ncompetition, free enterprise? Absolutely not. Absolutely not. There is \nthat cozy relationship that exists now with Sally Mae and the loan \nindustries that pay their executives hundreds of thousands of dollars, \ncontribute millions and millions of dollars. And they are getting it \ntheir way.\n  The American people ought to understand that the lobbying has direct \nresults. President Bush, in his last campaign and his campaign \npreviously, said: We are going to get the Pell grants up to $4,500--\n$4,500. Do you think it is in that budget? Do you think it is even in \nhis budget requesting $4,500? No. I have read the space. Do you think \nthat is in there? No. That is not even in there.\n  So if you are talking about what is bothering people, pick up today's \nnewspapers. Here it is: ``Mining fines among smallest.'' Laws limit \nsize and allow reduction. This is the difference between the mines' \npenalties and the fines that are paid for other consumer product safety \nviolations of the FCC, SEC, EPA, even OSHA. The bottom is on mine \nsafety. That might not have saved all the lives. That might not have \neven saved half of the lives of those miners who have been lost, but \nwhy aren't we debating what is on the minds of the people in West \nVirginia, Pennsylvania, and other States today? Why aren't we dealing \nwith their business?\n  Here we have on the front page of another newspaper: ``White House \nknew of Levee's Failure on Night of Storm.'' This is all about Katrina \nand what has been going on. Sure, we have had some hearings, but why \naren't we talking about some of this that is on the minds of the \npeople? Certainly, it is on the minds of the people of Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama. Why aren't we talking about that this \nafternoon? Why aren't we doing some of that business? And then, if you \nlook in the Washington Post: ``Ex-CIA Official Faults Use of Data on \nIraq.''\n\n       The former CIA official who coordinated U.S. intelligence \n     on the Middle East until last year has accused the Bush \n     administration of ``cherry-picking'' intelligence. . . .\n\n  And this goes all the way through, basically saying:\n\n       ``Our official intelligence on Iraqi weapons programs was \n     flawed, but even with its flaws, it was not what led to the \n     war,'' . . .  Instead, he asserted, the administration ``went \n     to war without requesting--and evidently without being \n     influenced by--any strategic level intelligence assessments \n     on any aspect of Iraq.\n\n  People want to know. American sons and daughters are dying over \nthere. Why aren't we talking about this?\n  My point is, this budget the President has put forward is not what \nthe American people expect. It is not what they deserve, not what they \nare entitled to. Many of us are going to work every possible way. It is \nthe allocation of resources. Money does not solve everything, but it is \nan indication of a nation's priorities--a nation's priorities as to \nlower heating oil costs, a nation's priorities in terms of lower drug \ncosts, a nation's priorities in terms of education costs, a nation's \npriorities in having an increase in the minimum wage.\n  These are the things that are of concern to people. I would hope we \nwould\n\n[[Page S1057]]\n\nget back to the Nation's business and get back to it soon. Americans \nare entitled to it, and we have waited too long to be able to do it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my colleague in the Senate, Senator Barack \nObama of Illinois, is carrying on a grand Illinois tradition. In the \nhistory of the United States of America, only two U.S. Senators have \never won a Grammy award. The first was Senator Everett McKinley Dirksen \nfrom Pekin, IL for his album ``Gallant Men,'' which many of us can \nstill recall, his deep baritone voice intoning those great patriotic \nverses that inspired so many.\n  Now another Senator from Illinois became the second Senator in \nhistory to win a Grammy award in the best spoken word category at \nWednesday's Grammy Awards ceremony. Senator Obama won his Grammy for \nrecording his autobiographical book ``Dreams for My Father.'' The book \nwas first published in 1995. It is an inspirational book, telling the \nstory of not only Barack's life but also of his quest to understand his \nheritage, returning to Kenya to the tribe where his father was raised, \nto meet the people, to learn the stories about his origins and his \nfamily's roots. It is a wonderful book. It has become a best seller. I \nwas given a copy by Barack long before he announced his candidacy to \nthe Senate and value it as a great story about a great American with \nwhom I am honored to serve.\n  There was stiff competition in that category for the spoken word. \nBarack Obama prevailed. But others in the finals included Garrison \nKeillor, Al Franken, Sean Penn, and George Carlin. Who came out on top? \nThe junior Senator from Illinois, Barack Obama.\n  I understand that Senator Hillary Clinton won a Grammy when she was \nFirst Lady. Now, of course, she is a distinguished Senator from New \nYork. But she won one for recording ``It Takes a Village.'' Her \nhusband, former President Bill Clinton, won a Grammy for the reading of \nhis autobiography ``My Life.''\n  So far it is a clean sweep for Illinois Senators at the Grammies. \nWith this distinguished record, many people will want to continue to \nfollow the career of my junior colleague, Senator Barack Obama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/10/senate-section/article/S1057-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1057-S1058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak to an issue important to \nevery American, certainly important to more than 40 million who are on \nSocial Security. Buried deep in the President's 2,349-page budget are \nthree proposals relating to Social Security. Some of them come as a \nsurprise.\n  First, President Bush recommends spending more than $700 billion to \ncreate Social Security private accounts. If we thought this was an \nissue that had gone away, obviously the White House does not want to \nabandon it. They are talking about $700 billion to push for Social \nSecurity privatization. Second, the President wants to reduce benefits \nto future Social Security beneficiaries. And third, he calls for \neliminating the $255 death benefit awarded to families of people who \npassed away.\n  The American people have made it clear to the President they are not \ninterested in this privatization scheme. The more the President \ntraveled across America, the more he spoke about it, fewer people \nsupported it. It is an indication that people have genuine concerns \nabout it and for good reason. First, they know this privatization \nscheme is going to make Social Security's long-term funding problems \nworse, not better. Second, the President's proposal will force deep \ncuts in guaranteed Social Security benefits for future retirees, even \nif they don't choose a private account. Third, partially privatizing \nSocial Security adds trillions of dollars to our national debt by \ntaking money out of the Social Security trust fund. And that debt, \nunder President Bush, has reached historic levels. Finally, partially \nprivatizing Social Security would tie America's retirement security to \nthe uncertainty of financial markets. As there are winners and losers \nin the stock market every day, there would be winners and losers among \nretirees in America. Those who guess wrong in their investments could \neasily end up in a predicament where they don't have the resources they \nneed for a safe and comfortable retirement.\n  The President says he is for the ownership society. We know what that \nmeans. It means we are all in this alone. We know better. When we stand \ntogether as an American family with our seniors and our most vulnerable \nAmericans, we are stronger, stronger because we are appealing to the \nvalues that make this Nation great. Social Security privatization is \nnot consistent with those values.\n  Allowing people to divert 4 percent of their Social Security taxes \ninto private accounts sounds harmless, but it is a pay-as-you-go \nsystem. Money that is diverted is money that isn't there to pay \nbenefits. By the President's estimation, his plan will create a $700 \nbillion hole in the Social Security trust fund. That is what it says in \nthe President's budget. Who is going to make up the difference? \nUnfortunately, some will suggest the way to make up the difference is \nto borrow it. Who will lend us the money? We know who our creditors \nare: Japan, China, Saudi Arabia, the OPEC nations. Many countries \naround the world will loan us money now, but then, of course, they are \nour creditors. They are our mortgageholders. We are beholden to them, \ncreating an even greater debt for future generation, and greater \nvulnerability.\n  The benefit cuts the President has called for as well are not going \nto fly. He calls these benefit cuts progressive price indexing. It \nsounds good, cutting benefits for lower income workers less than for \nhigher income workers, but the practical impact of the President's \nbudget on Social Security benefits would mean that a worker 25 years \nold today, who retires at age 65 with career earnings equivalent to \n$59,000 annually, would see a 24-percent benefit cut by the President's \nproposal. A similar worker, born 5 years from now, retiring at age 65, \naverage career earnings of $36,000, would face a 28-percent benefit \ncut. As people see their pension plans crumbling because of corporate \nmergers, bankruptcies, and sleight of hand, the President is calling \nfor cutting basic Social Security benefits to people who are certainly \nnot wealthy, if their average income is $36,000 a year. These workers \nwould be better off if the President didn't touch Social Security.\n\n  A worker born 5 years from now who retires at age 65 and has career \nearnings that average $59,000 would suffer a 42-percent benefit cut.\n  This goes too far. I hope the Congress will not seriously consider \nthese proposals by the President when it comes to Social Security.\n  It is interesting that this President is calling for cuts in Social \nSecurity at the same time he wants to cut the taxes paid by the \nwealthiest people in America. The cost of the President's tax cuts in \n2001 and 2003, if made permanent, will be $11.1 trillion over the next \n75 years. It is the height of irresponsibility to give tax cuts to the \nmost comfortable and wealthiest people in America and to cut the basic \nsocial safety net on which we count.\n  Finally, the President's budget proposes to cut the $255 death \nbenefit awarded to widows, widowers, and children left behind by the \ndeath of a member of their family who was covered by Social Security. \nThe President would cut the $255 death payment to widows and surviving \nchildren to pay for funeral expenses and then turn around and give a \ntax cut to people making over $1 million a year. How can he possibly \nresolve the injustice that is part of that proposal?\n  If we are supposed to be a caring and compassionate people--and we \nare--wouldn't we care more for a widow who would get a check for $255 \nto pay for funeral expenses than someone making $1 million a year who \nwould receive a $35,000 tax cut under the President's proposal? That is \nwhy the President's priorities are upside down.\n  As Members start looking through this budget more closely, as we \nhave, they are going to be startled by the\n\n[[Page S1058]]\n\nfact that the President still clings tenaciously to the unpopular \nprivatization of Social Security. They will be worried over the idea of \ncutting Social Security benefits when pension plans are disappearing \nand cutting back their payout. They will be absolutely dumbfounded when \nthey read that this President wants to cut that $255 check for the \nwidow to cover funeral expenses in order for us to give tax cuts to \nwealthy people.\n  The President said it is time for us to put aside partisan politics \nwhen it comes to Social Security and work together to get this problem \nsolved. That is what he said in the State of the Union.\n  He proposed we create a commission. I support it. We have said that \nfor a long time. Those of us who were fortunate enough to be here the \nlast time a meaningful, bipartisan, balanced commission was created \nknow that back in 1983 we got the job done. President Reagan had the \nright idea. Tip O'Neill, the Democratic leader in the House of \nRepresentatives, joined with him on a bipartisan basis and we ended up \nbuying almost 50 years of solvency by following those commission \nrecommendations. The same thing is true now.\n  The President has to walk away from privatization, walk away from \ndeep cuts in benefits for people who are not wealthy in retirement. He \ncertainly should not walk away from the widows and widowers across \nAmerica who count on this $255 check to meet some of the expenses of \npeople who have passed away in their families. I urge my colleagues to \nlook carefully at this budget when it comes to Social Security.\n  I close by saying when we return next week, we will take up another \nbill on reconciliation. It is an important bill about taxes and \nspending. It is going to reflect the President's priorities for tax \ncuts for the wealthiest in America and little or no help for the \nworking families in America. These are the families struggling to pay \nfor their kids' college education, trying to make mortgage payments, \npay those property taxes, and trying to make certain they are paying \nthe heating bills that have doubled this year. Why would we not give \nthem a helping hand?\n  Unfortunately, the President's proposal puts the help in those homes \nthat, frankly, are not worried too much about heating bills. They don't \nhave to count pennies every month. We will face that again, and then we \nwill return to the asbestos bill, which we have talked about all week. \nThe first thing we will consider is a budget point of order that was \nraised by Senator John Ensign from Nevada. It goes to the heart of this \nasbestos trust fund, and that is whether we are dealing with honest \nfigures and whether we can say with confidence that this trust fund, \nwhich will close down the courthouses in America for asbestos victims, \ncan truly be solvent for years to come and pay out to those victims and \ntheir families what they truly deserve.\n  Many of us questioned that. We asked the sponsor of the bill to \njustify the $140 billion and tell us how he came up with that figure. \nUnfortunately, he cannot. We have asked him to give us the secret list \nthat has the names of all of the businesses that are supposed to pay \ninto this trust fund. Still no list is produced. Imagine that, a secret \nlist of businesses in the possession of the Committee on the Judiciary \nthat will not be shared with all of the Members of the Senate or, more \nimportantly, with the American public. So we are supposed to have \nconfidence in an approach that is veiled in secrecy and cannot be \nexplained? That is why Senator Ensign's point of order is so important.\n  Even if you believe, as I do, that the asbestos system can be \nimproved and that survivors should receive more compensation, in a more \nefficient way, we have to understand that this approach will not work. \nIt will fail and its failure will be at the great expense of a lot of \nvulnerable Americans.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/10/senate-section/article/S1058-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1058-S1064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to begin my remarks today \nspeaking about a topic that I have been involved with, along with many \nof my colleagues for months now. That is LIHEAP funding.\n  If you look at a weather map, you will see that temperatures across \nmuch of the United States are only expected to be in the thirties and \nforties today. Winter has finally arrived. In Providence, the high is \nonly projected to be 19 degrees. A nor'easter is on its way up the east \ncoast; they forecast snow that will hit here in the DC area tomorrow, \nall the way up to New England, and so winter has arrived.\n  I wanted to mention the weather forecast because we are at the end of \nthe second week of February, and there is no new funding for the Low-\nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program, and as far as I know, there are \nno plans by the majority to bring to the Senate a vote on a $2 billion \nLIHEAP funding proposal. This funding proposal was removed from the \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations bill conference report. It was one \nof a few items that was stripped out, there were many other nondefense \nitems that were included in the Defense Appropriations conference \nreport in December, but for some reason this was dropped. I think a \nreason it is adversely affecting thousands and thousands of Americans \nacross the country, ranging from the Northeast into the mid-Atlantic, \nacross the Midwest, out into the far West. People are struggling with \nrising energy prices, and today, falling temperatures.\n  On Monday, a bipartisan letter signed by 34 Governors urged Congress \nto pass $2 billion in immediate additional LIHEAP assistance. These are \nGovernors from across the country, Governors that are of both party \naffiliations, Governors who are trying to respond to these conditions \nof both weather and extraordinary price increases.\n  The letter states:\n\n       LIHEAP applications are projected to increase by as much as \n     25 percent in some States . . . If Congress does not increase \n     LIHEAP funding in the next few weeks, state programs across \n     the country could run dry and the number of households unable \n     to meet their basic heating needs could skyrocket.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that both of these letters be included in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                 February 6, 2006.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. J. Dennis Hastert,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives.\n       Dear Senator Frist, Senator Reid, Speaker Hastert, and \n     Representative Pelosi: For several months this winter, states \n     have taken steps to help assure that our most vulnerable \n     residents are not overwhelmed by the sharp rise in home \n     heating costs. This has often meant significant state \n     contributions to emergency relief funds or supplementing \n     existing state-federal programs. Despite these actions by the \n     states and the record cost of energy nationwide, federal \n     funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program \n     (LIHEAP) reflects a net decrease from the previous fiscal \n     year's total. We urge Congress to join the, states in meeting \n     the well-documented need for additional home heating \n     assistance by passing $2 billion in immediate additional \n     LIHEAP assistance.\n       Governors supported the progress that was made when LIHEAP \n     was authorized at $5.1 billion in the Energy Policy Act of \n     2005, but were disappointed when Congress appropriated only \n     $2.16 billion for FY 2006. While we appreciate the \n     President's recent release of an additional $100 million of \n     emergency LIHEAP funds and Congress' proposal to add $1 \n     billion for FY 2007, urgent action is needed to address the \n     Energy Information Administration (EIA)'s prediction of a 30 \n     to 70 percent rise in consumer energy costs this winter.\n       Covering dramatic increases in natural gas and heating oil \n     prices presents a potential hardship for our citizens. LIHEAP \n     applications are projected to increase by as much as 25% in \n     some states. As noted above, many states, energy industry \n     leaders, and private citizens have done their part by \n     increasing investments in the program. We are asking\n\n[[Page S1059]]\n\n     you to join us by sending legislation to the President that \n     provides enough funding to meet our low-income citizens' \n     energy needs for 2006. If Congress: does not increase LIHEAP \n     funding in the next few weeks, state programs across the \n     country could run dry, and the number of households unable to \n     meet their basic heating needs could skyrocket.\n       Our states are in the process of documenting the potential \n     shortfalls in LIHEAP funding and the supplemental funding \n     states have already provided. We look forward to sharing that \n     information with you shortly. Thank you for your \n     consideration of this request and your continued commitment \n     to assisting our neediest families. We hope that you will \n     take this opportunity to actively support the LIHEAP program.\n           Sincerely,\n         Governor Frank H. Murkowski, Alaska; Governor Janet \n           Napolitano, Arizona; Governor M.

William H. Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Frist: High energy prices are \n     threatening the health and economic well-being of low-income \n     households across the United States. No family in our nation \n     should be forced to choose between heating their home and \n     putting food on the table for their children. No senior \n     citizen should have to decide between buying life saving \n     prescriptions or paying utility bills. Unfortunately, these \n     stark choices are a reality for too many Americans across the \n     nation. We strongly urge you to take immediate action to help \n     low-income Americans by bringing a measure to the floor that \n     provides an additional $2.92 billion for the Low-Income Home \n     Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), as supported by the \n     majority of the Senate.\n       Since October 5, 2005, the Senate has voted six times to \n     increase LIHEAP funding to $5.1 billion. Bipartisan \n     amendments offered to the Department of Defense \n     Appropriations bill, the Transportation, Treasury and HUD \n     Appropriations bill, the Labor, Health and Human Services and \n     Education Appropriations bill, and the Tax Reconciliation \n     bill received a majority of the Senate's support. \n     Unfortunately, these amendments were not given the \n     opportunity for a straight up-or-down vote. In December, 63 \n     Senators supported a successful motion to instruct, which \n     directed the Budget Reconciliation Conference Committee to \n     provide $2.92 billion in additional funding for LIHEAP in FY \n     2006. Yet, the conference report for the Budget \n     Reconciliation bill includes only $1 billion, with this \n     spending designated for FY 2007. Procedural maneuvers are \n     preventing vital assistance from reaching Americans. These \n     families and seniors deserve help from the federal \n     government.\n       As you know, the Department of Defense (DoD) Appropriations \n     Conference report originally provided an additional $2 \n     billion for LIHEAP. The LIHEAP funding provided by the DoD \n     conferees was designated as emergency funding. The emergency \n     designation funding is warranted given the high cost of \n     energy this winter, and the lack of growth in workers' wages. \n     Unfortunately, other more controversial matters included in \n     the conference report prevented the retention of the LIHEAP \n     money in final action on that bill.\n       The Energy Information Agency forecasts that households \n     heating with natural gas will experience an average increase \n     of 35 percent over last winter. Households heating with oil \n     will see an increase of 23 percent, and households using \n     propane can expect an increase of 17 percent. In addition, \n     wages are not keeping pace with inflation. The Real Earnings \n     report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the \n     average hourly earnings of production and non-supervisory \n     workers on private nonfarm payrolls were lower in December \n     2005 than they were a year ago, after accounting for \n     inflation. Working families are continuing to lose ground, \n     meaning more families also need LlHEAP assistance this \n     year. Paychecks are being stretched thinner as families \n     face higher prices for home heating, health care, and \n     education.\n       We respectfully request that you bring a measure to the \n     Senate floor at the end of this month, or at the latest, \n     early February, that funds LIHEAP at the $5.1 billion level \n     supported by the Senate. We also urge that these resources be \n     allocated in such a way that they will benefit all states and \n     ensure they receive this necessary assistance promptly. \n     American families and seniors have been waiting too long for \n     relief from high energy costs. Thank you for your \n     consideration for this essential request.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jack Reed, Maria Cantwell, Byron L. Dorgan, Paul S. \n           Sarbanes, Charles E. Schumer, Edward Kennedy, Tom \n           Harkin, Jeff Bingaman, Barbara Boxer, Herb Kohl.\n         John F. Kerry, Barack Obama, Hillary Rodham Clinton, \n           Daniel K. Akaka, Max Baucus, Barbara A. Mikulski, \n           Patrick J. Leahy, Debbie Stabenow, Carl Levin, Mark \n           Dayton, Joseph R. Biden, James M. Jeffords, Patty \n           Murray, Dick Durbin, Robert Menendez.\n\n  Mr. REED. According to the National Energy Assistance Directors \nAssociation, the following States have exhausted their LIHEAP funding \nor will do so by the end of the month: Alabama, Arkansas, California, \nGeorgia, Iowa, Maine, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Rhode Island, \nUtah, New Hampshire, Washington, and Ohio. This is a broad-based \nproblem, transcending all regions of the country and, again, a direct \nreflection of high energy prices and falling temperatures.\n  High energy prices are threatening the health and economic well-being \nof low-income families and seniors across the United States and we must \nprovide additional LIHEAP funding this winter.\n  On Tuesday, the Energy Information Administration released its Short-\nTerm Energy Outlook. The data was not encouraging. Despite our \nrelatively mild winter, households heating primarily with natural gas \ncan expect to spend 24 percent more on fuel this winter than last \nwinter. If a household is heating with oil, it can expect to pay 16 \npercent more. Those households depending on propane can expect to pay \n14 percent more this winter than last. And to quote the EIA, the Energy \nInformation Administration:\n\n       Should colder-than-normal weather occur for the remainder \n     of the heating season, expenditures could be significantly \n     higher than currently projected.\n\n  These are costs that are piling up on working families and at the \nsame time they are seeing their wages stagnate, not keeping up with \ninflation and not keeping up, certainly, with energy costs. Working \nfamilies are continuing to lose ground, meaning more families need \nLIHEAP assistance as a result. So the paychecks are being stretched \nthinner and thinner as families face higher prices for home heating, in \naddition to health care, in addition to education. So we have to do \nsomething, and I believe we should do something.\n  At least five times over the last several months, the Senate has, by \nmajority vote, supported an increase in LIHEAP spending at least to the \n$2 billion mark. But, because of the procedural rules, budget \nobjections, we could not prevail, even though we had a majority of \nSenators on both sides of the aisle. I think that sends a strong signal \nthat not only can we act, we should act.\n  Now I will urge the majority leader to take immediate action to help \nthese low-income Americans by bringing a measure to the floor that \nprovides the full $2 billion in additional LIHEAP funding. And, I also \nask the President, and the White House to stand on the side of American \nfamilies to urge this to be done. They should release a public \nstatement supporting additional LIHEAP funding.\n  Also, the White House can act immediately by releasing the remaining \n$100 million in LIHEAP contingency funds provided in the fiscal year \n2006 Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations bill. If you go back to \nthe Governors of our States, who are close to this problem, if you look \nat the States that are exhausting their LIHEAP funds--and it is still \nonly February--we could have 8 more weeks of rather cold temperatures. \nIndeed, if the weather evens out, we should have 8 more weeks of cold \ntemperatures because it has been mild to this point. But these States \nof Alabama, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Oklahoma, \nOregon, South Dakota, Rhode Island, Utah, New Hampshire, Washington, \nand Ohio need this assistance and we should give it to them.\n\n[[Page S1060]]\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  I will make more general comments about the budget. Part of it is, of \ncourse, the inability to respond to the heating crisis. I think there \nis a much greater set of issues confronting us with the budget the \nPresident sent up. I have deep concerns about the President's fiscal \nyear 2007 budget. It neither meets the pressing needs of the American \npeople nor addresses the long-term challenges that lie ahead. Clearly, \nwe are in for another year of policies that do not help the average \nfamily or bring down the deficit. I suspect these are the two major \ncriteria most Americans will judge this budget on: Will it assist \nfamilies, working families, in the country to move forward? Will it \nbegin to tackle some of the long-term problems we face?\n  It is tremendously disappointing that the President's budget has cut \nfunding for programs that are important and vital to the well-being of \nchildren, education, economic success, and the safety of Americans. \nWhile the budget was appropriately invested in national security, it \nunfortunately leaves our citizens behind here at home in many different \ncapacities. In addition, the President's budget seeks to make costly \ntax breaks for the wealthiest Americans permanent, at a time when we \nare facing one of the largest deficits in the history of the country.\n  The administration strains to show progress reducing the deficit, but \nin fact it exaggerates the deficit in the short run and understates it \nin the future by leaving out big-ticket items, such as war costs. We \nwill shortly receive an approximately $100 billion supplemental for \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan. It would be unfortunate not to \nsupport our troops in the field, but we have responsibilities of not \nonly supporting troops in the field but doing it in a responsible \nway. And it is not by accumulating each year billions of dollars in \nsupplemental appropriations; it is in trying to deal with these costs. \nCertainly it is including those costs in any projection of the way \nahead with respect to the budget of the President.\n\n  The President also has not clearly indicated how we are going to \nattempt to fix the alternative minimum tax. This is a tax which is \ngradually encroaching on the middle class of America. It was originally \ndesigned to provide default for those wealthier Americans who could, \nthrough very shrewd but legal tax planning, avoid any significant tax \nliability. Now, because of the design of our tax system, it is reaching \ndown into the middle class. It is a multibillion-dollar problem we have \nto address. Once again, that is not in the budget.\n  We know these large deficits will increasingly hamper our ability to \nsustain the economy in the long run. And no matter how rosy a picture \nthe administration tries to paint, neither the President nor future \nfiscal outlooks look particularly bright given this current deficit \nsituation.\n  This first chart shows what has happened over the last several years. \nWhen President Bush took office, the Congressional Budget Office \nprojected large and growing Federal budget surpluses under existing \nlaws and policies, the so-called baseline. We can see in the year 2000 \nthere was a $236 billion surplus. That was projected to go to $281 \nbillion, $313 billion, $359 billion, all the way to the year 2006 with \na $505 billion surplus. That is the projection.\n  The reality is the surplus has been declining, until 2002 it reached \na minus $158 billion, a deficit of $158 billion, and the numbers go \ndown, go down in 2004 to $413 billion. There was a slight improvement, \nand one can argue about whether that is a one-time phenomenon based on \nsome tax provisions we passed. The forecast of CBO for 2006 is $337 \nbillion. That is a huge swing just at a time when we are approaching \nsignificant challenges with respect to the baby boom generation in \nMedicare, Social Security, and Medicaid.\n  This has been a huge reversal of fortunes. In 2000, CBO was \npredicting a $5.6 trillion 10-year surplus from 2002 to 2011. This has \nturned into a deficit of $2.7 trillion. That is, by my rough \ncalculation, roughly an $8 billion swing from positive to minus. One \ncan just see the difference in 2006: a $505 billion surplus to a $337 \nbillion deficit. That is an $800 billion-plus swing between the \nprojections and the reality, the result of the policies the President \nhas adopted, the result of some costs which could not be avoided--\ncertainly in response to 9/11--but many other costs which were capable \nof being, if not avoided, then properly funded. Certainly the tax cuts \ncontribute significantly each step of the way as we go forward.\n  Instead of sound budget policies preparing for the immediate \nretirement of the baby boom generation, the Bush administration and the \nmajority of Congress have refused to adopt the kind of budget \nenforcement rules which help achieve fiscal discipline in the 1990s.\n  Let me remind you that when I arrived in the Congress in 1990, taking \noffice in the House in 1991, we were looking at continuous deficits \nmany years preceding and projected to go forward. We adopted not only \nbudget rules but budget policies. They were not supported by the \nRepublicans. This was a Democratic initiative of President Clinton \ntogether with a Democratic Congress that actually reversed the \nsituation. So this number, $236 billion, was the result of quite \naggressive and quite responsible actions in the 1990s by Democrats and \na Democratic President to move from deficits to surpluses to begin to \nstore up what we thought would be surpluses so that we could deal \nrealistically and fairly with the oncoming and expected issue of \ndemographic change in the United States of an older population \nincreasingly aging and requiring additional services. All of this was \nreversed through the policies of the Bush administration.\n  We have pursued a policy, as I mentioned before, of trying to \nstabilize and reconstruct Iraq by supplementals, not by including even \na fraction or a significant fraction of the known cost in our \nunderlying budget. Having taken at least seven trips to Iraq and four \nto Afghanistan, I can tell you it is a long-term process to do it \nright, to get it to a point where it is not worse off than it would \nhave been without our intervention. That takes resources.\n  We have also had these tax cuts which continue to sap our strength.\n  If we look at the Bush tax cuts, they are nearly 90 times larger for \nmillionaires than for middle-income households, hugely \ndisproportionate, having adverse macroeconomic effects, having adverse \nfiscal effects in terms of the budget, and not helping the families who \nall of us will stand up here and pledge are at the top of our list to \nhelp: those low- and middle-income families who are struggling with \nincreased costs. This is astronomical. Families are struggling with \nhealth care, retirement issues, loss of jobs, stable employment--one \ndoes not have to go across this country too far to see communities that \nhave been traumatized by closing factories. Every time we listen to a \nnews report, we are hearing another company, another major company, \nsuch as Ford and others, say they are closing factories. That impact is \nsevere and traumatic to families. They are grappling with that and \nretirement funds which seem to be evaporating. People who worked their \nwhole lives and thought they would have adequate retirement and health \ncare from their employers are finding that is becoming almost a mirage, \nin some cases, and at the same time, there are usually disproportionate \ntax advantages through these tax cuts given to the wealthiest \nAmericans.\n  The average amount of the 2001 to 2004 tax cuts for households of \nmore than $1 million of income was $103,000 in 2005. The comparable \nfigure for those households between $50,000 and $75,000 in household \nincome is $1,200, most of which is probably eaten up before they \nreceive it by increases in health costs, increases in energy costs, \nincreases in the cost of simply trying to get by day to day. Middle and \nlower income families are paying a price for these tax cuts, and it is \na price they are finding very difficult to bear each day going forward.\n\n  There are specific areas of concern in this budget which have to be \nmentioned. With respect to health care, the President, during his State \nof the Union Address, said that it is the Government's responsibility \n``to provide health care for the poor and the elderly.'' But his budget \nproposal only serves to undermine the commitment of our Nation to care \nfor those less fortunate.\n  The President spoke about access to care and proposed a modest \nincrease in funding for community health centers. At the same time, \nhowever, his budget eliminates funding to those programs which educate \nand train the medical\n\n[[Page S1061]]\n\npersonnel who are necessary to provide high-quality, culturally \ncompetent care to those who will be served in these facilities. We are \nliterally disinvesting in those long-term assets--in this case, the \nhuman assets of highly trained physicians and physician assistants and \nnurses and technicians we will need to man this health care system \ngoing forward.\n  We can look at the projections. The huge increase in seniors requires \nadditional resources and additional redeployment of these resources. \nThat is not taking place in this budget.\n  I am also disappointed that the budget provides no additional funding \nfor nursing education at a time when my State of Rhode Island and every \nState in the country is seeing a huge demand for nursing care. The \nnurses are a vital component of our health care system. In my State of \nRhode Island, they are reaching out across the globe, spending three or \nfour times what it costs to hire a local American nurse simply to fill \ntheir ward so they can continue to function.\n  This is an irony, too, because we are all looking for those jobs and \nthose skills which will not be shipped overseas, which will not be \ndigitized and sent away. Nursing is one of these high-quality skills. \nSo it is not only for health care benefits, it is also for economic \ndevelopment. Yet we are struggling to try to help the nursing \nprofession provide the resources to train new nurses in America. The \nresult, of course, is we are taking them from overseas. This might \nbenefit us in the short run but not in the long run. We have to ask \nourselves: What is it doing to the health care systems in places such \nas the Philippines and other countries that are struggling to have \nadequately trained professionals in their ranks? We are essentially \nreaching out and taking them away. We have to do better. We can do \nbetter.\n  The budget eliminates funding for primary care and allied health \nprofessional training under title VII and decimates the scholarship \nprogram designed to encourage more disadvantaged and minority students \nto enter the health care workforce. Here again, we are trying to match \nup the talent and skills of Americans with the jobs we need to do, and \nwe know we will need to do them in the future. That does not make sense \nto me.\n  His budget also eliminates the Universal Newborn Screening Program \nand the Emergency Medical Services for Children Program which help \nStates institute effective newborn screening programs and promote \nresearch through improved trauma care for children.\n  There is no one in either body who will come to this floor and not \nspeak about our obligation to the children of America. This is the \nsanctity of protecting them. But here are programs that operate \neffectively and efficiently to do that--screening newborns to detect \nvery early if they have medical problems we must deal with rather than \nwaiting later when these problems have, in some cases, overwhelmed the \nchild and the family. This is a sensible, efficient approach to \ndelivering health care services. It is not being supported in the \nbudget.\n  The National Institutes of Health, the leading source of basic \nbiomedical research, is also facing a reversal in funding. Less than 2 \nmonths ago, President Bush signed into law the first cut to NIH funding \nsince 1970. Now he is proposing to cut funding to 18 of the 19 \ninstitutes, including the institutes conducting research on cancer, \nheart disease, and diabetes.\n  The National Institutes of Health, over the last several years, has \nbeen an example of a bipartisan commitment to raising their funding \nlevel, recognizing, again, that in order to confront health care issues \nin the country, we need the infrastructure of research, and not just to \ndeliver effective treatment, but also we hope to get a bit of a handle \non the explosion of costs in the health care system. When we stop \ninvesting adequately in the National Institutes of Health, we are \nlocking ourselves into a situation where we will not have the new \nbreakthrough drugs, the new breakthrough technologies, and we will not \nbe able to deal with the host of issues confronting us. This is, again, \na reversal of a decade of progress on a bipartisan basis to keep \nfunding robustly the National Institutes of Health.\n  Health care services essential to our elderly population also were \nnot spared. His proposed cuts to Medicare will inflict pain on the \nNation's elderly without solving the growing cost of health care.\n  We all have to recognize, given demographics, given changes in the \ndelivery of medicine, that the cost of health care has to be addressed. \nNot very much of what the President is doing is designed to address \nthat cost. This is an issue which transcends party, transcends reason, \ntranscends all of our individual interests, and it needs leadership by \nthe President.\n  This budget is simply tweaking and cutting adversely benefits to \nseniors and not dealing in a responsible way with the acceleration of \ncosts.\n  Medicare providers have already borne the brunt of several years of \npayment freezes and reductions, and once again, they are going to be \nincluded in this budget proposal.\n  I am also dismayed about the proposal to further cut home health care \nproviders. The President talks about the importance of increasing \naccess to home- and community-based services for the elderly and \ndisabled seeking alternatives to traditional institutional-based care, \nbut by cutting reimbursements to home health care providers, this \nbudget sets in motion the exact opposite policy. Instead of encouraging \npeople to move out of institutional-based care, which is typically more \nexpensive, into home-based care, this policy would reverse that \ntrend. Medicare spending on home health care has already fallen \ndramatically, from 8.7 percent in 1997 to 3.8 percent in 2005. There \nhas been a squeeze on home health care and I think eventually that \nsqueeze will provide a real disincentive for using what is both humane \nand efficient and effective care for seniors.\n\n  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, projects a \ndecline of 2.6 percent of total spending by 2015 in the absence of a \n2006 payment freeze. So what we are seeing is the rhetoric talks about \nthe logic of moving people from expensive institutional care, \nhospitals, and other settings, into their homes. And, frankly, most \npeople I know who are sick, the first thing they want to do is get out \nof that hospital. They recognize the wonderful care they are getting \nbut to be home is just as helpful sometimes as any type of prescription \nin recovery for an individual. Yet we are contradicting that sensible \npolicy in this budget.\n  With respect to education, we also see some of these cuts that are \nimpacting adversely our educational programs at a time when everyone \nstands up and says we are in a global economy and we need to have the \nbest educated students in the world. We have to emphasize programs that \nwill make us competitive because we are in a struggle that is going to \ndefine the future of this country, its prosperity--indeed, its \nsecurity. That struggle rests in large part on providing generation \nafter generation of well-educated Americans.\n  We have new challenges. New Americans coming from around the globe \nwho are coming into our public school systems require language training \nand cultural sensitivity and a host of other challenges that, frankly, \ndidn't exist in the 1950s when I was going to grammar school and high \nschool--grammar school at least. These challenges have to be met, and \nthey cannot be ignored.\n  The President's budget, once again, showed his promise to retain \nAmerica's competitive edge is not a promise that is backed up by the \nresources that are necessary. We understand we have to invest in math \nand science. This is increasingly a more technologically driven world. \nWe are looking at countries around the globe, China and India, that are \ncommitted to bringing up their math and science capabilities. They have \nliterally hundreds of millions of talented, bright people. They are \nbeginning to make their presence on the world scene felt, their \neconomic presence particularly. They are devoted to education. We have \nto be, also. That requires emphasis on math and science. But our \nstudents need more than just that; they need literacy and history and, \nmost of all, qualified teachers in every subject matter.\n  The President's budget proposes a $2.1 billion cut to Federal \neducation funding. This is the largest proposed cut in the 26-year \nhistory of the Department of Education, at a time when the President \nand his Cabinet stand up\n\n[[Page S1062]]\n\nand say this is probably the most important thing we can do to build \nthe economic strength and vitality of America for the next several \ndecades. Once again, the President has proposed eliminating the LEAP \nprogram. This is a Federal-State matching program that allows \nassistance for higher education support for low- and moderate-income \nAmericans. It gives grants to the States. The States have to match the \ngrants with their own money. It is a very valuable program. In total it \nproposes to eliminate 48 federally funded educational programs, \nincluding GEAR UP, Teacher Quality Enhancement, Even Start, TRIO Upward \nBound/Talent Search programs. These TRIO programs are designed to go \ninto minority communities and find students that have the talent but \nnot necessarily the type of support they need to get through high \nschool and commit themselves to go on to higher education. We have to \ndo that.\n  We understand, again, if you look at the demographics, that this \ncountry is becoming significantly less White and more of people who are \nAfrican Americans and Latinos--all of them. If we are not reaching out \ntoday into these communities and finding young people of talent and \ngiving them the support and giving them the idea--which, for affluent \nfamilies is obvious--that they can go to college, they should go to \ncollege, we are going to find ourselves decades from now--perhaps even \nsooner--with a population where we have not utilized their talent and \nwe are not able to compete on a global scale.\n  All of these programs help do that. To eliminate them without any \nability to respond in a meaningful way to these needs, to me, is \nshortsighted and wrong.\n  The Bush budget freezes the maximum Pell grant at $4,050. This is the \nfourth year in a row they proposed freezing this grant, and we know \nwhat is happening to college tuitions, they are going up. In 1975 the \nPell grant covered 80 percent of the cost of a 4-year public college \neducation. Today it covers about 40 percent.\n  Senator Pell was my predecessor in Rhode Island, from whose wisdom we \nall benefit today. He recognized back in the 1960s that if you allow \nyoung people to go on to college, you will reap benefits that are huge \nover many years. I wouldn't hesitate to say that a lot of the leading \nmembers of our community--in business, in politics, in anything you \nname--one of the reasons they are able to participate at this level is \nbecause 30 years ago, in 1967 and 1975, they were able to go to college \nand pay for it because there was a Pell grant that was providing 80 \npercent of the cost of their 4-year public college education.\n  Today, who are we leaving behind because they are saying: I would \nlove to go on to college, but I can't afford it? Who are we leaving \nbehind who will go to a school but not the school they could have gone \nto with this financial assistance and, as a result, whose career and \nwhose contribution might be limited? I do not think this policy makes \nsense.\n  The President's budget also proposes to eliminate the Perkins Loan \nProgram, leaving students with fewer resources to help them meet the \ncost of attending college. Perkins loans are another complement in our \nFederal arsenal of support to education that helps students make their \nway through college.\n  The majority has just pushed through a budget reconciliation bill \nwhich will cut $12.5 billion from higher education. This budget is \nsaying we are going to cut more. We just made $12.5 in reconciliation \ncuts. How can we continue to do that? How can we cut the funds that we \npresumably have committed to spend and now send up a budget that will \ncontinue this very constrained support for higher education? And it is \nnot just higher education.\n\n  If you look at some of the early education initiatives that are so \nnecessary to children who have not yet even reached school, you have \nscientists each day pointing out how important it is for early \nchildhood education to give children the skills and talents and the \nvery idea that education is something they have to pursue vigorously \nall their lives. If you look at this budget you see, again, huge \nshortcomings. The President's budget proposal freezes funding for the \nFederal child care and development block grants for the fifth year. The \nadministration's own budget figures show that 400,000 children will \nlose childcare assistance by the year 2011, and this is on top of the \n250,000 children who have already lost childcare assistance since \nfiscal year 2000. These are huge numbers with huge impacts in every \ncommunity across the country.\n  At the same time, because of the way the economy has been performing, \nthe number of low-income children has been increasing. Poverty is \nincreasing in the United States today as a result of many factors--\nglobalization, the economic policies of the administration. We saw in \nthe 1990s, again, not only a reversal from a deficit to a surplus, we \nsaw poverty levels starting to decline. Along with those descending \npoverty levels we saw a lot of other positive social benefits. The \nnumbers and percentages of abortions dropped because the economic \nsituation for families seemed to be improving. This whole approach is \nincreasing the demands of more low-income people, while at the same \ntime decreasing the resources available. It does not make a great deal \nof sense.\n  Additionally, the budget would provide no additional funding for the \nHead Start and Early Head Start Programs, freezing funding at $6.7 \nbillion. This results in the Head Start Programs in our country having \nto make very tough choices--eliminating almost 19,000 children, \nsqueezing, again, the payments and the benefits they give to their \nworkers, attacking or undermining the quality of the comprehensive \nservices that are the cornerstone of the Head Start Programs. This is \nnot good.\n  The President's budget also eliminates the community services block \ngrant, which is critical to so many communities across the country. \nAgain, this notion of the community service block grant was to give the \nlocal community leaders the resources because they have the sensitivity \nand clearer vision to what their particular community needs. When you \nsqueeze these community service block grants, you put a huge burden on \nproperty tax payers because those individuals, all of us, will support \nlocal government. That is not as efficient or fair a mechanism for \nraising revenues as income tax or anything else, but that is the \nreality because local communities will have to put more burden on their \nlocal property tax payers or eliminate these services. That is an area \nof great concern, also.\n  It is not just health care and education, there are many other areas. \nOne is energy. The President said in a frank admission, which we all \nappreciated, that the United States is addicted to oil. But like many \npeople with addictive problems, I don't think the administration is \nseeking meaningful treatment. Gasoline consumption in the \ntransportation sector represents about 44 percent of total oil \nconsumption in the United States each year. If you include diesel fuel, \nthat number jumps to 57 percent. To bring about any serious reduction \nin our dependence on foreign oil we have to increase the fuel \nefficiency of our cars and light trucks. So we need an increase in our \nCAFE standards. That is the first place we need to go that yields the \nbiggest bang for the buck that will put us on a path to reduce \nsignificantly our energy consumption.\n  But that is not what the President is talking about. He is talking \nabout renewing the fight for drilling in ANWR, a fight that culminated \non this floor just a few weeks ago in a rejection of that proposal.\n  He is not pressing for the immediate technological fix of moving up \nCAFE standards. Once again, I believe this approach plays to our \nstrength as a nation. We continually point to our technological \ninnovation, our ability to use technology to solve problems. Here is a \nhuge problem. Why don't we apply technology? I am always disconcerted \nwhen you look around the globe and see companies such as Toyota, for \nexample, who have launched very successful hybrid automobiles. Where \nare the hybrids in significant numbers, and sufficiently sophisticated, \nby our own manufacturers? Ford has the Escape hybrid vehicle. This \ntechnology is not something beyond our capacity and capability, but the \nnation needs a budget and policy that will support technology \ndevelopment. You need action in Congress that will increase CAFE \nstandards and increase gasoline mileage.\n\n[[Page S1063]]\n\n  If we are talking about tax policy to help us avoid dependency on \nforeign oil, it is not cuts to dividends and capital gains and huge \nbenefits to the wealthiest, it is perhaps providing tax support for \nthose people and those companies that will put vehicles that get 45 or \n55 miles per gallon on the road. We can build it. That might give us an \nadvantage or another opportunity to reassert ourselves as the premier \nleaders in automobile technology in the world and the premier \nmanufacturers, a position that we are losing.\n  In December, Senator Snowe and I wrote a bipartisan letter, signed by \n30 Senators, asking the President to fully fund energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy programs authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. \nWhen we passed the Energy Policy Act, we increased funding for energy \nefficiency provisions and renewable energy programs. Our letter must \nhave been lost somehow because the budget cuts key energy efficiency \nprograms such as building code programs, Energy Star, weatherization \nprograms, and industrial energy efficiency.\n  I had a visit yesterday from architects from the American Institute \nof Architects. These are local Rhode Islanders. They pointed out that a \nhuge amount of our energy is wasted because buildings are not properly \ndesigned and properly built to contain energy and use it efficiently.\n  We could have significant savings with improved building technology. \nIt begins with some of these rather everyday programs such as building \ncodes, weatherization, industrial energy efficiency--these programs are \nbeing cut.\n  I agree with the President. We need to end our addiction to oil. But \nto do that, our budget needs to support programs, initiatives, that \nreduce our dependency in the short and long term, and funding for \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy programs will reduce our demand \nfor fossil fuels such as natural gas and petroleum. Supporting energy \nefficiency and renewable energy is the best approach we can take to \ndeal with the issue of energy dependency in the United States.\n  I have already spoken about the LIHEAP program. We must support \nLIHEAP funding because we have low-income families struggling and \nliterally suffering today because they are caught in this vise of cold \nweather and high energy costs, and we have to give them relief.\n  The President also speaks, as we all do, about the need for good \nhousing in this country. But again, this budget does great harm to the \nHousing and Urban Development Department. Overall, the Bush HUD budget \nproposes $33.6 billion in discretionary spending authority, as compared \nto $34.3 billion last year. That is a 2-percent cut--$622 million off \nthe top.\n  I don't know anybody in this Chamber or our colleagues in the other \nbody who will come to us and say we have solved the affordable housing \nproblem. In fact, I think they would say this is perhaps one of the \nmost persistent and difficult problems we have to face in every \ncommunity in this country, the ability to rent affordable, decent \nhousing, or the ability of a young family to buy a starter home. It is \nexcruciatingly difficult.\n  Yesterday, we had representatives from our disabled community in our \noffice, who are down here talking about the issues confronting them. \nThe No. 1 problem they have is finding affordable, adequate housing for \ndisabled Americans.\n  We talk about our commitment to people with disabilities, but when we \nhave put resources to the rhetoric, too often the resources aren't \nthere.\n  At a time when people need better housing, this budget is not \nresponding. The President proposes to cut funding for programs to \nassist at-risk people with their housing needs, including a $190 \nmillion cut in programs to assist the elderly with housing costs, and a \n$118 million cut in programs to assist persons with disabilities with \nhousing costs--that is the No. 1 concern of many families--and a $35 \nmillion cut in programs to support lead hazard reduction in public \nhousing.\n  The section 8 voucher program is also underfunded, threatening \nfamilies with the loss of their vouchers, threatening families who are \nnow being helped to afford their housing and seeing that help \ndisappear.\n  The President's budget will also cut the Community Development Block \nGrant Program by $736 million. We all know, because we have mayors \ncoming into our offices constantly, that CDBG funds are a key element \nin allowing local leaders to help develop their communities. That is \nthe kind of money that can be used very adroitly to leverage other \nfunds to help economic development, to help renewable housing--all of \nthese things which are so important. That cut will be devastating to \nthe mayors in every community across this country.\n  The administration also proposes zero funding for the Brownfields \nEconomic Development Initiative, which is a very smart way to redevelop \nformerly contaminated lands in our urban areas. These are areas of \nformer industrial production that can be renewed, if we can \nenvironmentally restore or remediate the property.\n  There are also cuts to the Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Communities \nProgram. All of these things go right to the ability of municipalities \nand counties to provide viable economic development which supports jobs \nand families in communities across the Nation.\n  Public housing programs, which serve more than 1 million children and \nmore than one 1 million families with seniors in residence, would \nexperience deep cuts.\n  The HOPE VI Program, which pays for the rehabilitation or replacement \nof dilapidated and rundown housing, takes public housing and transforms \nit into mixed-income housing.\n  We have seen one example in Rhode Island--a project in Newport, RI--\nwhich is transforming the whole neighborhood.\n  This HOPE VI program is going to be eliminated in the President's \nbudget. It is the only significant source of Federal money for new \nhousing and new opportunities.\n  The President also proposes to cut the public housing capital fund, \nwhich is the capital investment for public housing agencies. He \nproposes a $260 million cut there. Finally, the public housing \noperating fund is level funded.\n  Again, how do you level fund operating for residents and public \nhousing at a time when costs all are going up, particularly energy \ncosts?\n  I don't think there is any expert sitting around suggesting that the \nspike to $60 per barrel is a temporary phenomenon. Once OPEC realized \nthey can get away with charging $60 a barrel and not provoke an \neconomic meltdown yet in the world economy, that will be their target \nfor the next several years, if not for the foreseeable far future. We \nare stuck with huge energy expenses, and those expenses will hit public \nhousing and community-based activities heavily. If we don't respond by \nat least helping a bit, it is going to be an excruciating burden on \nmunicipalities and counties all across our country.\n  Let me finally also comment about the Defense budget. As I mentioned, \nthis budget is highly invested in defense, and at this moment in \nhistory that approach seems to be unavoidable. I believe we should be \nresponsible and pay for it rather than continuing to borrow these \nfunds. But you can't avoid the obvious. We are still threatened by \nimplacable, ruthless enemies. We are still engaged in a very difficult \nchallenge in Iraq and Afghanistan. As a result, we have to continue to \nspend on our own protection and our national security.\n  But the administration again refuses to recognize that this is not a \npassive phenomenon. They talk about a long war, they talk about a \ngenerational struggle, but each year they come to us and say this is \nemergency funding for Afghanistan, for Iraq, for many provisions on the \nwar on terror.\n  Since September 11, this administration has requested $440 billion in \nsupplemental funding. A significant part of that, I believe, has to be \ninternalized in the regular budget process. It is tough. It will \nrequire very tough, difficult choices, but it is the truth; it is \nreality.\n  The other thing I think we have to do, and the President has to lead \nus in, is we have to ask the American public to make sacrifices. There \nare people sacrificing today. Soldiers, marines, airmen, sailors, and \ntheir families are sacrificing dramatically. But that is a rather small \nspectrum of Americans.\n  I challenge anyone here to say what the President has asked of the \naverage\n\n[[Page S1064]]\n\nAmerican in terms of sacrifices necessary to support this war on \nterror. He certainly hasn't asked them to put their hands in their \npockets and pay for it. He hasn't challenged them to stand up and do \nmany other things.\n  This is reaching a level that takes on a moral proportion. We cannot \ncontinue this struggle without at least some commitment as a whole \nnation, not just those men and women in uniform and their families but \nthe whole Nation to become engaged and involved in this effort.\n  As I said, many of the provisions in the budget of the Defense \nDepartment, the supplemental budget, I believe should be included in \nthe regular budget process.\n  The President's budget has requested authorization for 482,400 \nactive-duty soldiers and 175,000 active-duty marines since 9/11. Yet \nthe Army has maintained an active-duty force of over 500,000, and the \nMarines have ranged from 178,000 to 180,000 personnel.\n  In a sense, the President is sending up a budget which has a \nsignificantly less number of personnel that are on active duty.\n  Again, that is not something that we know is going to go away. We \nhave come a long way in the sense in March of 2003 or May of 2003 that \nwe would have very few people in Iraq and Afghanistan, that it would be \nresolving itself.\n  We are in the midst of a very difficult insurgency, and these troops \nwill be needed on duty and in uniform for at least the next years, or \nseveral years. I believe that should be included in the budget.\n  The Army and the Marine Corps have a huge pricetag for rehabilitation \nof the equipment they have been using--$68 billion. Many of my \ncolleagues who have gone to Iraq and Afghanistan understand that. They \nare operating in the summertime at 120 degree temperatures in a sandy \nclimate. That eats up the equipment. We have helicopters operating at \n15,000 feet in thin air, and that chews up the engines in very \ndifficult conditions. We know that. We know we have a price tag of $68 \nbillion, and, yet a small fraction of that is being, I think, \ninadequately included in the budget. When it comes to defense and \nnational security, we have to provide the money to do it reasonably and \nresponsibly.\n  We are looking at a deficit as far as the eye can see. As we look at \nthe huge commitment by our fighting men and women in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, I would think you would see a shift in the administration \napproach; I would think you would see the President stand up and say we \nhave to pay for these things. It is a long-term effort, and we can't \nlet this devastate and overwhelm us because we know eventually, as we \nhave seen in the past, there is no free lunch.\n  We can borrow the money today--billions and billions of dollars--but \neventually interest rates will start creeping up, start shutting off \neconomic productivity here in this country, and we will see inflation \nbegin to bump up. We will see all of the dangers and all of the \ndifficulties that we thought in the mid-90s we had turned the corner \non, at least because our policies were taking hold in terms of dealing \nwith the deficit, funding reasonably and responsibly, and actually \nseeing that result in not only economic growth but growth that was \nlifting up all of our citizens. We are looking at increases in income \nand wages, not just at the top level but at the middle- and low-income \nlevels of our economy.\n  The reverse is true today--huge increases in upper income \ncompensation and benefits--spectacular. If you were in such a position, \nyou would be quite wealthy. But if you look at the bottom wages, they \nare stagnant and falling. That is not going to produce the kind of \ncountry that will support families, support individuals, and make us \nmore productive in the future.\n  I hope we will look carefully and closely at this budget and make \nappropriate changes.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, this morning about 8:30 the administration \nreleased the information with respect to the 2005 trade deficit that \nour country has experienced. The trade deficit for all of 2005 was \ndescribed this morning as $728 billion. That means about $2 billion a \nday every day, 7 days a week. That is $2 billion a day more in imports \nfrom other countries into our country's marketplace than we are \nexporting to them, and it relates to the lost jobs that are such a \nproblem in our country. When you import products from abroad, twice as \nmuch as you are able to export to other countries, you are in effect \nexporting America's jobs.\n  The chart I show now shows the number with China alone. Almost one-\nthird of the trade deficit is with China. We can see what has happened \nwith China from 1996 to 2005. The trade deficit has gone up, up, way up \nevery single year. It is out of control. This trade deficit is \nreflective of, once again, a massive number of American jobs being \nshipped to China. Then they produce products and ship the products back \nto our country. It weakens our country. It means we lose jobs. We lose \neconomic strength, especially in the middle class. It is a crisis we \nmust address.\n  There is no social program as important as a good job that pays well \nin this country. We will debate social programs now for weeks and weeks \nbecause the President this past Monday sent us his budget for the next \nyear. We will debate about the need for social programs. But as I said, \nthere is no social program, in my judgment, as important as a good job \nthat pays well. That makes everything else possible for an American \nfamily.\n  Let me talk a minute about these good jobs. The good jobs are \nleaving. Ford Motor says 30,000 people will be laid off. At General \nMotors, 30,000 people will be laid off. It goes on and on. \nIncreasingly, companies are moving their jobs from the United States to \nChina, to India, to Bangladesh, to Indonesia. So the jobs that remain \nare jobs that have a downward pressure on wages, more and more pressure \nto get rid of retirement programs, more pressure to strip health care \nbenefits. In my judgment, that is going to head this country toward \nserious trouble.\n  This economy works because we built a broad middle class and people \ngo into their jobs often with job security for nearly a lifetime. At \nFord Motor Company and General Motors, when people went to work there \n40 years ago, they often stayed there for a lifetime. Now, of course, \nthat is not the case.\n  General Motors called its 300 top parts suppliers to a meeting in \nDetroit recently and said, by the way, we think you need to be moving \nyour jobs to China to cut costs. So General Motors says it. The parts \nsupplier which split off from General Motors, called Delphi, which is \nnow in bankruptcy, says it. They want to pay $8 to $10 an hour.\n  What is going to happen to this economy if we continue to see \ndownward pressure, fewer jobs, fewer good jobs that pay well, downward \npressure on wages, and we see more and more of these jobs being \nexported to other countries? I think I know the answer. The answer to \nthat is we will have less and less opportunity in our country, less \neconomic growth, and we will have fewer good jobs left.\n  My colleague Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and I yesterday \nannounced a piece of legislation we have introduced that would change \nwhat is now called PNTR with China. PNTR is permanent normal trade \nrelations. That means China now has normal trade relations with our \ncountry. It is permanent. It did not used to be that way. We used to \nhave to vote every year on whether to extend what was then called \n``most favored nation status,'' now called ``normal trade relations.'' \nWe used to vote on that every year. But it became permanent in 2000 and \nwe no longer vote on it.\n  My colleague Lindsey Graham and I decided we wanted to revoke \npermanent NTR and restore again an annual debate in this country about \nChina and about trade with China. I don't mean to say China is the only \nissue because it is not. Obviously, with this chart we can see the \nsingle largest trade deficit is with the country of China. It is\n\n[[Page S1065]]\n\ngrowing, it is significant, and it is dangerous.\n  By the way, most of this Congress and the White House will simply \nsleep through all of this. They are not awake for these issues; no one \nthinks this is a problem; no one cares much about it. So what if it is \n$2 billion a day more than we import than export? Who cares? Another \n30,000, million or 2 million jobs shipped overseas. Who cares? It is \nnot anybody at the White House who loses their job, so we do not hear \nabout this. But for a lot of the American families, it is a very \nserious problem.\n  We believe a significant part of the problem rests with China. Almost \na third of that trade deficit is with China. China's markets are still \ntoo closed to our products. They say they are open, but they are not. \nChina is awash in counterfeit goods and piracy. Two-thirds of the goods \nthat come into our country that are counterfeit goods come from the \ncountry of China. And China does nothing about that.\n  China, as we know, is an attractive place for American companies to \nmove their workers. I will not do it today, but I have given plenty of \nexamples--Huffy bicycles, Radio Flyer, Little Red Wagons, Etch-a-\nSketch--I could go on for a long period of time. Those jobs go to China \nbecause you can hire people for 30 cents an hour in China. You can work \nthem for 7 days a week and you do not have to give them a day off for \nmonths. And the Chinese Government looks the other way. You can do that \nin China. You cannot do that here.\n\n  So that is why these companies are moving their jobs to China. \nAmerican companies move their jobs to China. They produce the product, \nship it to the United States to sell it in the U.S. marketplace, and \nthen they run their income through the Cayman Islands, in a tax-haven \ncountry, so they do not have to pay taxes or at least avoid as much as \nthey can of their tax burden. It is a very serious problem.\n  In discussing this issue of normal trade relations, we have to \nremember who we are dealing with. Yesterday, my colleague from South \nCarolina, Lindsey Graham--described the case of a man named Shi Tao. \nNot many Americans, perhaps, know Shi Tao. But Shi Tao was sentenced, \nin April of last year, to 10 years in prison. He happens to be a \njournalist. He was ``divulging state secrets,'' which is the reason he \nwas sent to prison in China. He is a former staffer at the Contemporary \nBusiness News agency. He was convicted of sending to foreign Web sites \nthe text of a message from authorities in China warning journalists of \nthe dangers of ``social destabilization'' from the return of certain \ndissidents on the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.\n  So he sent this to some foreign sites, and, as a result, he was \ncharged with ``divulging state secrets'' and sent to prison. Much of \nthe evidence against him came from a company called Yahoo!, an American \ncompany. The Chinese Government traced the e-mails sent by Mr. Shi \nTao--a journalist--they traced those e-mails with the cooperation of \nYahoo! They asked Yahoo! to provide the information. Yahoo! did. And \nnow this fellow is in jail for 10 years for passing on an e-mail by the \nChinese Government that said they worried about the dangers of ``social \ndestabilization'' from the return of dissidents on the 15th anniversary \nof the Tiananmen Square massacre.\n  Reporters Without Borders, an organization that we hear about these \ndays, has complained that Yahoo! has disregarded ethical concerns in an \neffort to maintain a good business relationship with the Chinese \nGovernment.\n  There are other cases that are similar to this.\n  Last month, Google, an American company--a great American success \nstory, I might add--agreed to censor its search engine results in \nChina, agreeing to free-speech restrictions in exchange for better \naccess to the fast-growing Internet market in China.\n  This shows you the power of money and profits over ethics and \nmorality when it comes to doing these kinds of things.\n  Google, last month, rolled out a new version of its search engine \nthat is easier, specifically for use in China. What has happened is, \npreviously Government barriers that were set up to suppress information \nhad prevented the Chinese users from using Google at all. So in order \nto obtain a Chinese license, Google has agreed to omit Web content that \nthe country's Government officials find objectionable. That includes \ninformation about Taiwan's independence and the Tiananmen Square \nmassacre, and so on.\n  It is particularly concerning, I think to me and to a lot of others, \nthat we have American companies helping the Chinese authorities track \ndown a journalist who did nothing wrong, was engaged in some free \nspeech, and now sits in prison for 10 years.\n  But I digress. My main point is that we have a pretty serious trade \nproblem.\n  It is a trade problem that is significant in a lot of ways, and is by \nno means limited to China. We run very large trade deficits with \neveryone with whom we have had a trade agreement. We run big trade \ndeficits with Mexico. We run big trade deficits with Canada, with \nEurope, with Japan, and yes, with China. A part of it, of course, is \nthe basic incompetence of our trade negotiators. And the other part is \na trade strategy that has been embraced by this and previous \nadministrations and this Congress that chants about ``free trade''--not \ncaring, of course, whether trade is fair--and has allowed American \ncorporations to decide to structure trade in its own image. And that \nimage is to decide it wants to produce where it is cheap; that is, take \nHuffy bicycles away from Ohio and fire 900 workers. Move it to China, \npay them 33 cents an hour, work them 7 days a week, 12 to 14 hours a \nday, and then send the Huffy bicycles to America to be sold in Sears, \nWal-Mart, and Kmart and believe that is good for our country. It is \nnot.\n  It might be good in the short run for some consumers in this country, \nbut, after all, America is not going to be measured in the long term by \nwhat it consumes. It will be measured by what it produces. Economic \nhealth is about what you produce, not what you consume.\n  I believe this morning's announcement will produce one more large \nyawn at the White House, one more large yawn in the Congress. I do not \nknow exactly what it is that is going to provide a tipping point that \nwill finally convince policymakers we are headed toward very serious \ntrouble. It is unsustainable to have a fiscal policy that increases the \ndebt in this year from our budget policies of $704 billion and a trade \npolicy that increases the trade debt in this year of $720 billion. That \nis $1.4 trillion in combined debt. That will choke this country.\n  We know better than that. We know what to do. We know better than to \nsit around on our hands and gnash our teeth and wipe our brow. We need \nto get busy and solve these problems. But first they have to be \nrecognized. There is this blissful ignorance these days about a fiscal \npolicy that is wildly offtrack and a trade policy that has not worked \nfor some years, that is shipping America's jobs overseas and weakening \nthis country.\n  This Congress and this President have a responsibility to address \nthis head on. My colleague, Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and I \njoined on the legislation I described yesterday, and I hope my \ncolleagues will support it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to share some thoughts on the \nasbestos litigation legislation that is before us. We have a point of \norder raised. I believe that point of order is a technical point of \norder. I believe it is not a point of order that has the potential to \navoid a large amount of Federal expenditures. In fact, as we all know, \nthe asbestos bill is funded by those companies and defendants who are \nbeing sued as an alternative to paying out money from aberrational, \ndisjointed, inconsistent lawsuit verdicts, with 60 percent of that \nmoney going to lawyers both for the defendant companies and for the \nplaintiffs. They propose to pay\n\n[[Page S1066]]\n\nthis money into a fund, allowing it to be distributed, with 5 percent \nor less attorney's fees cost, directly to those who are determined to \nbe sick from asbestos.\n  Surely, we can make this happen. Surely, we cannot allow the spasm \nthat now exists, that is an embarrassment to the legal system, \nembarrassment to the profession of law, and an embarrassment to \nCongress for failing to fix it, when the Supreme Court and other judges \nhave, on numerous occasions, called on us to fix it. That is what I \nwould point out.\n  I was hoping that this afternoon we would be able to discuss votes \nthroughout the day, amendments. Senator Cornyn has offered an \namendment, and we have had votes. There are others out there.\n  I will point out amendments that I have offered and plan to offer \nwhich deal with the subrogation issue, particularly involving longshore \nshipping companies, where they are self-insured, and those companies \nare entitled to subrogate to some of this money that would come out, \nunder normal circumstances, to money that is paid to the victims. And \nfor a lot of reasons, I think they are in a specific special place that \nneeds some relief. The silica claims, we need to consider that more \ncarefully. I have proposed legislation that if this bill were to fail, \nthe 5-percent cap on attorney's fees would apply, or the court would \napply standards of comparable attorney's fees instead of allowing such \na large chunk of money to be taken from the victims and their recovery \nto pay attorneys, as is the case today.\n  We have some medical criteria in the bill; that is, if you are going \nto be sick, how do you know it was caused by asbestos; what do you have \nto show before you can make a claim so that we can pay those who are \nsick but not pay those who are not sick; or if those who are sick have \na sickness unconnected to asbestos, they should not recover from the \nasbestos fund; otherwise, we would have a fund that can't survive. That \nneeds to be tightened.\n  Those are some of the amendments I would like to offer. We will get \non that presumably next week after we vote on this point of order.\n  I urge my colleagues not to allow this budget point of order to \nderail the opportunity we have today--it may be the last, best \nopportunity--to fix an asbestos system that is out of control. It is \njust not working right. Under the present system, we are going to \nhave--and we have today--thousands of people who have been injured by \nasbestos. Many of them are veterans--thousands of people who are \ninjured, some severely, some dying as a result of their exposure, who \nwill not be able to recover any money because the company against which \nthey have a lawsuit, the company which was responsible for exposing \nthem to asbestos, no longer exists. They are bankrupt, and there is no \none to sue.\n  Secondly, we have a large number of companies--77--that have gone \ninto bankruptcy, and many are in bankruptcy now. If we allow this \nuncontrolled rush to take every dime out of those companies as quickly \nas possible, as the lawyers for the individuals who are sick are trying \nto do, those companies, too, will go out of existence.\n  There are other reasons certain people are not going to be able to \nrecover who are sick from asbestos. This bill would give everybody a \nchance to have a fair recovery, so I believe it has a big humanitarian \nbenefit.\n  Also, if we leave these cases in the litigation system, a jury might \nbecome inflamed or become sympathetic for a victim and may render a \n$100 million verdict. Another jury may render a $100,000 verdict. \nAnother jury may render nothing. So we have really aberrational \nallocations of scarce resources to people who are sick. We need to have \na comprehensive system by which those who are sick are compensated \nfairly, promptly, and without attorney's fees.\n  There is no doubt, as we know, that the attorney's fees, according to \nthe Rand Corporation, total 58 percent of the amount of money paid out \nby the defendants. So defendant companies hire their own lawyers, and \nthey are being sued for huge amounts of money, and they hire the best \nlawyers they can get. They defend those cases. One study shows they get \na little more than plaintiffs' attorneys. Then the plaintiffs' \nattorneys sue, and they take their fee out of the recovery. If you look \nat it in an economic sense, all of the money paid out by the defendant \ncompanies should go to the victims, as much as possible. They should \nnot have to pay a chunk to their own lawyers or a chunk of it to the \nplaintiffs' lawyers.\n  We have 60 percent at stake. This bill caps the attorney's fees at 5 \npercent. So we are talking about 53, 55 percent of the money being paid \nout by the defendant companies, and it is not getting to the victims. \nSo we have a lot of ability here to do the right thing. We can get more \nmoney promptly to victims. We can get victims compensation who \notherwise would not get it because the companies they might sue are no \nlonger in existence or there are other legal impediments to it, and we \ncan treat people fairly, and people similarly situated would get \nsimilar amounts.\n  For example, mesothelioma, the deadly cancer that has been connected \nto asbestos exposure, would result in a prompt payment of $1.1 million \nto anybody who has contracted that disease due to asbestos exposure. If \nthe doctor diagnoses that and it is not a diagnosis of any real \ndispute, you simply go in to the claim administration, make your claim, \nand 50 percent of that $1.1 million is to be paid within 30 days and \nthe additional 50 percent paid in 6 months.\n  That kind of process is quite different from what is happening today. \nThere are 300,000 lawsuits pending in America. Some dockets have tens \nof thousands of lawsuits and only a handful of judges. These cases are \nnot going to trial immediately. People are not getting paid promptly. \nIt is an embarrassment to all of us. Some people are getting paid \naberrationally and without consistency or fairness. Some are getting a \nlot, some are getting nothing. Some people are getting paid little \nchecks over a period of 10 years, and there from different companies \nthat settle up. That is not a way to handle a mass tort, where a lot of \npeople are ill, in which the defendant companies are prepared to pay.\n  All of that is not working right. We ought to take those companies' \nmoney--$140 billion of it--and set it aside in a fund and create a fund \nfrom which we can pay people whenever they are sick. That can be done, \nand that can make the system better.\n  It was interesting to note that we don't often see a lot of agreement \nbetween the Washington Post and the Washington Times. But the \nWashington Post had an editorial today in which they say:\n\n       Some amendments may be reasonable at the margin, but the \n     bill's central idea to replace litigation with a $140 billion \n     compensation fund, to be financed by defendant companies and \n     their insurers, must be preserved.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       The fact that the bill is being attacked from both \n     directions suggests that its authors, Senator Arlen Specter, \n     Republican of Pennsylvania, and Senator Patrick \nLeahy, Democrat of Vermont, have balanced competing interests in a \nreasonable manner.\n\n  I am not sure that is totally correct, but there is some truth to \nthat. It says:\n\n       But the truth is that the bill's main opponents are the \n     trial lawyers who profit mightily from asbestos lawsuits and \n     who constitute a powerful lobby in their own right. Mr. \n     Specter and Mr. Leahy are, in fact, model resisters of \n     special interests who have spent more than two years crafting \n     legislation that serves the public interest. For Mr. Reid to \n     demean this effort in order to fire off campaign sound bites \n     is reprehensible.\n\n  That is the Washington Post. I certainly agree with that. The special \ninterests here are those who have lost sight of the victims, who have \nlost sight of trying to create a justice system that works; the special \ninterest of those people engaged in the system who are enriching \nthemselves in it every single day and do not desire to see it end.\n  But I will note that Dicky Scruggs, one of America's most prominent, \nperhaps the most accomplished trial plaintiff lawyer in America, who \nlives in the Mississippi gulf coast area, where asbestos was such a bad \nproblem at the shipyards, commenced this litigation many years ago--\nmaybe 30 years ago. He just appeared with Chairman Specter and said \nthat enough is enough. We don't need this in the courts anymore. Not \nenough money is getting to the victims. The system is not working. We \nneed change. He supports this bill. He believes there is sufficient \nmoney in it to take care of\n\n[[Page S1067]]\n\nthose who are sick, and he supports this bill that has my amendment in \nit that limits lawyer's fees to 5 percent, unless it goes on appeal.\n  If the lawyer comes in with a client with mesothelioma, gets a \ndoctor's report, spends a few hours on that, talks with the client, \nfiles a claim with the board and they give him a date, and they walk \ndown there and have the doctor's report and the physician says this \nperson has mesothelioma, he is entitled to $1.1 million, and a 5-\npercent fee is $55,000. That ought to be enough. Yet we have people \nsaying that we cannot have these fees. We cannot cut these fees. This \nis too much.\n  We are creating a trust fund. If you file a claim for a person under \nthe Social Security Act, the Federal law limits your attorney's fees. \nIf you make claims in workman's compensation cases in most States, \nattorney's fees are limited. It is perfectly proper to do so. I believe \n5 percent is adequate.\n  The Washington Times said this. It is a conservative newspaper here:\n\n       This bill should pass; Senator Arlen Specter, Pennsylvania \n     Republican, and Patrick Leahy, Vermont Democrat, are due \n     accolades for getting this far on a longstanding problem that \n     has befuddled everyone for decades. Many asbestos victims \n     have suffered or died of mesothelioma or other illnesses \n     while the courts and Washington struggle with a resolution. \n     The victims and their families deserve to be made whole.\n\n  I believe those were strong and appropriate words.\n  Then they comment on Senator Reid, the Democratic leader. They say:\n\n       Mr. Reid said the bill benefited ``a few large companies'' \n     while supposedly leaving the little guy in the lurch. Really? \n     Why, then, do insurance giants AllState and AIG oppose the \n     bill? Why are many plaintiffs anxious to see it pass? In \n     reality, the big guys speak through Mr. Reid--in this case, \n     unscrupulous lawyers who stand to profit greatly from keeping \n     asbestos cases in the courts.\n\n  That is who the big guys are who are making the big money. They say:\n\n       . . . the FAIR Act offers what nothing else previously has: \n     A light at the end of the tunnel for claimants.\n\n  I think one estimate I have seen has been that $70 billion has been \npaid out to date to victims of asbestos. Somebody said the figure is \nmore than that. Think about this: think about the fees. Let's say 25 \npercent of that is a legal fee. Some make more than that. Some of the \nnumbers show 25 percent as an average total when all is said and done. \nBut most fees are normally one-third. What is 25 percent of $70 \nbillion? What, $18 billion? That is going to lawyers. These are not \nthousands and thousands of lawyers. Really, I would say there are \nprobably no more than a few hundred plaintiff lawyers who are handling \nwell over 50 percent of the cases. So it is an incredible amount of \nmoney. We could create a system where you can walk in with a medical \nreport, basically, and have your compensation delivered to you \npromptly, without all these fees being taken from it.\n  Why can we not do this? That is why independent groups such as the \nliberal Washington Post and the conservative Washington Times have both \nendorsed the bill. I am hopeful that we will, over the weekend, take a \ngood look at the budget point of order that has been raised here. When \nmy colleagues look at it, I hope they will conclude that this is not \nthe kind of budget point of order which was contemplated when this rule \nwas passed. This budget point of order arose from Chairman Gregg's \nbrilliant understanding that many of our entitlement programs are \ndrafted in such a way that when they score that bill, they score it \nover a maximum of 10 years. People write the bill so it will cost more \nthe next 10 years than it does the first 10 years.\n  If the Government is starting an entitlement program, you can object \nif you can show it goes up too much in the outyears, which I think is a \ngood reform. But this bill is not Federal taxpayers' money. This bill \nrepresents money that will be paid into the fund by the people who are \npaying out money now to victims in a willy-nilly, random fashion that \nis unprincipled and unjustified. They will put the money in voluntarily \nin exchange for not having to hire a bunch of lawyers to defend \nthemselves in courts in every jurisdiction, virtually, in this country. \nThat is what they are trying to do.\n  The legislation does not impose any cost on the American taxpayers, \nand if the fund was to collapse and not have enough money in it, then \nthe taxpayers do not pick up the tab. They do not pick up the tab. The \ncases go back in the courts, and any companies that still exist would \nhave to pay, just like they would before this reform passed.\n  I think this budget point of order, for reasons I am not clear about, \nlies apparently in a technicality. It does not lie in the classical \nunderstanding of its purpose to protect the Federal taxpayers because \nthis is not taxpayers' money; it is the defendant companies' money.\n  When we vote on this budget point of order early next week--I am a \nmember of the Budget Committee. I know Senator Cornyn is and others are \nwho care about the budget. We meet every day and we take heat every day \nfor trying to constrain the growth of spending and entitlements in this \ncountry in a rational way to meet the needs of our people. But to stop \nthe abusive growth in these programs, we support a balanced budget. We \nsupport containing spending.\n  Many of the people who are supporting this objection, however, have \nnot demonstrated, in my view, any important interest over the years in \ncontaining spending. A lot of them are big spenders.\n  That objection, while technically is legitimate, does not in any \nsubstantive way have an impact on the debt of the United States in the \nnext 30 years as this act would be enforced.\n  I urge my colleagues to look into this point. Do not allow this \nsupermajority vote. To keep the bill on track, 60 Senators will have to \nvote to waive this point of order. It would be a tragedy, indeed. When \nwe see Senator Leahy, Senator Specter, and Senator Sessions supporting \na piece of legislation, when we see the Washington Times and the \nWashington Post supporting a piece of legislation, when we see the \nveterans groups incredibly anxious to see this legislation passed, and \nwhen we see overwhelmingly the businesses that are involved in this \nprocess and are paying out this money that want to see it passed, why \ncan't we get it passed?\n  Let's not allow it to fall on a supermajority vote of 60 instead of \nthe normal 50 required to pass legislation. I hope everyone will study \nit, and when they do, I think they will feel comfortable in voting to \nwaive the budget point of order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/10/senate-section/article/S1067-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1067-S1070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NSA WIRETAPPING\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

He believes this is legal and \nproper and has articulated those views very ably.\n  I shared some thoughts the other day about why it is so important, \nwhy there is much political goings-on here instead of substance, and \nwhy we need to continue with the program. I would like to share a few \nmore thoughts today about the care the administration took to be \nrespectful of Congress, to not overreach their legal authority, and how \nthey worked to keep Congress briefed on what the program was about.\n  The administration officials briefed congressional leaders more than \na dozen times on the terrorist surveillance program. More than a dozen \ntimes they went before the proper senior officials of the U.S. \nCongress--in the House and Senate, both Republican and Democrat--to \nadvise them about what this program was about and what they were doing. \nThat includes the majority leader of the Senate, who is Republican, the \nDemocratic leader, Mr. Reid, and before him, Mr. Daschle. In the House, \nit includes the Speaker of the House and the Democratic leader. It \nincludes the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and the \nranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee; the Senate \nIntelligence Committee chairman and the ranking Democrat on the Senate \nIntelligence Committee. Those are what they call the big 8--or The 8. \nThe Intelligence Committees deal with these highly classified programs \ninvolving national security.\n\n[[Page S1068]]\n\n  We have always understood that you cannot tell 100 Senators and 435 \nCongressmen a bunch of secrets because if you do, they will leak. As a \nmatter of fact, I am sometimes even amazed the eight can keep a secret, \nbut apparently they have done well, at least until the recent leak, and \nwe don't know where it came from. It may well have come from another \nsource.\n  These eight are briefed on the program. These are the top people in \nCongress. They are not children. They are not people who can be pushed \naround. They are grownups holding particularly high offices. If they \nhave a problem with the program, they are not children; they know when \nit is time for them to speak up, if they have an objection, to raise \nit, and they did not object. There were no objections made, no call to \nstop this program by any of those eight people who, over a period of \nyears, were informed.\n  It actually is more than eight. As I noted, we have had two \nDemocratic leaders, Senator Daschle and Senator Reid. We had Senator \nTrent Lott, as well as Senator Bill Frist. We had Senator Richard \nShelby, as well as Senator Pat Roberts. So there are 15 members who \nhave been briefed on it and had an opportunity to object and have not \nobjected.\n  Then all this stuff hits the fan in the newspapers and everybody gets \nexcited about it. We have some Democrats saying it is illegal and that \nit ought to be stopped. They are saying it is illegal. But if you \nnoticed one word they didn't utilize, it was ``stop.''\n\n  They caused all this fuss revealing to the world many of the \ncapabilities of the system, making the system less effective than it \ncould be. In fact, Porter Goss, the head of the CIA, has said it has \nrendered severe damage to our intelligence capability. They did not say \nstop. Nobody is saying stop. Nobody has submitted a resolution in the \nSenate to say stop. Nobody has introduced legislation, which they have \nevery right to do, and which we in Congress have a right to do, to cut \noff funds for this program.\n  We could end this program tomorrow. All we would have to do is come \ntogether as a Congress and say there shall be no Federal dollars \nexpended to carry out a program of surveillance such as this. They \nwould end it just like that.\n  That has not been proposed. Why has it not been proposed? Because it \nis idiotic to stop a program such as this. How stupid can we be if we \neliminate a program such as this?\n  There is an article in the Washington Post--it is breathtaking \nreally--in which Senator Biden said:\n\n       I don't understand why you would limit your eavesdropping \n     to only foreign conversations,'' said Senator Biden to \n     Attorney General Gonzales.\n\n  The article seems to suggest, after complaining about the program, \nthey should have wiretapped more people when both ends of the \nconversation were in the United States.\n  Perhaps we should consider that. I think there is a realistic basis \nto conclude that the President has that power if it is relevant to the \nsecurity of the United States of America. You just have to read through \nthe lines. I was not in the meetings. I am on the Armed Services \nCommittee and I am on the Judiciary Committee where we had a lot of \nthese discussions and hearings. The President and his team at one point \nsaid: What about legislation, can we pass legislation?\n  All the people who apparently discussed this matter were in uniform \nagreement that if we brought a bill up to specifically authorize this \nkind of wiretapping, it would cause a lot of discussion in the Senate, \nand it would reveal to the world the program. So the President \nbasically said: I believe under the authorization of force you gave me \nto act against al-Qaida, who has declared a war on us and we have \ndeclared a war on them, I have the power to do that on international \ncalls; I am confident in that.\n  His lawyers have written opinions and briefs. They researched the \nhistory, and he concluded that he did, and that is what he basically \ntold the eight Members of Congress, and they did not object. They could \nhave said: No, you have to introduce legislation. That is a reasonable \nstatement for any Member of Congress to make to the executive branch: \nMr. President, if you think we can write legislation that would allow \ntechnology like this to be legal, explicitly by statute, we will have \nto write it in such a way that it will obviously reveal to those we are \ntrying to surveil what we are doing and what our capabilities are, and \nit will undermine the program.\n  President Bush told us straight up in more than one speech: It is my \nresponsibility to defend the people of the United States of America. \nThat is what he said his responsibility was, and I believed it and the \nAmerican people believed it and we said yes.\n  He said: I am going to use every tool I have to defend this country. \nWe said yes, and this is one of the tools he has, and he decided to use \nit. I think he did so in a very appropriate way. Congress has been \nadvised of that.\n  Some have said it broke the FISA law; it did not comply with FISA. \nAttorney General Gonzales made a very nice point, a very important \npoint. FISA claims to be the exclusive means of electronic \nsurveillance, and people have cited that principle, but it actually \ncontains numerous exceptions, such as a 15-day exception after a \ndeclaration of war in section 111 of FISA, a 72-hour exception for \nemergency surveillance under section 105, and finally there is an \nexception for surveillance authorized by statute in section 109.\n  The idea clearly is that there would be further statutes passed that \nwould expand the FISA law as circumstances develop.\n  Then Congress, after 9/11, passed the authorization for use of \nmilitary force against those whom the President finds are responsible \nfor attacking us on 9/11. He has defined that narrowly as al-Qaida. We \nauthorized the President to use all necessary and appropriate powers to \nsurveil or to attack al-Qaida, to go after al-Qaida.\n  As the U.S. Supreme Court in Hamdi declared, they said the U.S. \nmilitary can capture, detain, lock up, put in jail as a prisoner of war \nan American citizen who has associated himself with al-Qaida in the war \nagainst the United States without a trial. We have authorized our \nmilitary under the authorization to use force, to go out and kill the \nal-Qaida people wherever they are in the world as they are deemed to be \nat war against us. So it stretches a bit to say you can't intercept \ntheir telephone calls. You can lock them up without trial, put them in \njail and restrain their freedom--even an American citizen, you can kill \nthem on the battlefield without a trial or a Miranda warning, but you \ncannot surveil their phone calls.\n\n  What the Supreme Court said in Hamdi was that although the \nauthorization to use force did not specifically authorize locking up \npeople and holding them as prisoners of war, it is a natural incident \nto the power given to the President to conduct war. The power to \nconduct war is also the power to detain and restrain people who are at \nwar against you.\n  Attorney General Gonzales has made a very compelling argument. How \nmuch less of an invasion of a person's liberty is it to listen to their \nphone conversation than it is to lock them up in jail? So a natural \nincident to the conduct of a military operation, since the beginning of \nwarfare--certainly in modern times--has been surveillance and \nintelligence-gathering operations. We worked tirelessly to break the \nGerman code. We worked tirelessly and broke the Japanese code. We were \nable to listen in on their conversations. That is what you do against \nan enemy; you try to find out what they are doing and how they are \nplanning it so you can stop them.\n  I am confident a rational interpretation of the authorization to use \nforce to go after somebody militarily includes the power to detain \nprisoners, as the Supreme Court has said, and also would include the \npower to intercept the communications of the enemy.\n  This is consistent. Maybe ``amendment'' is not the right word to \nFISA, but it is a statute passed in harmony with the concept of FISA \nwhen it was passed. It is a subsequent statute that would take priority \nover the past statute.\n  Another argument is the past statute was more explicit about these \nintelligence matters and said this was the sole way to do it. But I \ndon't think you can interpret an authorization to go to war in any way \nthat would prohibit intelligence-gathering operations. Indeed, the \nHamdi case held that previous statutes that said you could not\n\n[[Page S1069]]\n\nlock people up under these circumstances were overridden by the \nauthorization to use force because a necessary incident to utilizing \nmilitary action against the enemy is to lock up people you capture.\n  There is also, I believe, a good argument to be made that the \nPresident has inherent authority as Commander in Chief and a duty \nconsistent with that authority and responsibility to protect the people \nof the United States. Every Federal court to have decided the issue has \nheld--including the Third Circuit, Fourth Circuit, Fifth Circuit Courts \nof Appeals--that this is so. These cases involve surveillance that \noccurred before the FISA was passed, true; but in 2002 a FISA court of \nreview relied on those cases. The FISA Court, created by FISA, relied \non those previous cases to make this ruling:\n\n       FISA could not encroach on the President's constitutional \n     power.\n\n  That is In Re Sealed Case, in 2002.\n  Former Attorney General Griffin Bell, himself a long-time Federal \njudge who was called in to be President Jimmy Carter's Attorney General \nwhen FISA was being considered, was asked about this and the \nPresident's inherent power. Judge Bell, if you have known him, in that \ninimitable way he has, said, ``We can't change the Constitution by \nagreement.''\n  I would add, a statute can't amend the Constitution. FISA cannot \neliminate the powers of the President, those inherent powers to defend \nAmerica or to authorize electronic surveillance of an enemy with whom \nwe are in combat, al-Qaida, in a time of war. Authorization for force, \nthe President's inherent power--these are clear, I believe, \nauthorizations of force.\n  We will have a lot of debate about it. We will have a lot of \ndiscussion about it. But as you look at it more and more, I think \npeople are becoming confident that these powers exist. Now we have a \nrecent article saying, Why don't you do even more, if you have this \npower?\n  Should we pass legislation? Let's talk about it. I think one thing we \nneed to take out of the FISA law is the pretension that it represents \nthe only authority the President has in these areas; that every act has \nto be done within the FISA. To that extent I believe it is clearly \nunconstitutional. Those words are not legitimate. They need to come \nout. We should not pretend to say we have the exclusive power in the \nlegislative branch to override the President's responsibility to defend \nthis country.\n  Then if there are other ways we can write the statute, I will discuss \nit. But I frankly am not sure it is going to be a successful \nenterprise. It is going to be difficult to write a statute that would \ndraw the line on where the President's authority exists and where it \ndoes not. Tell you what, I get nervous, I get a little worried when we \nat a given point in history start writing a statute to define the \nultimate power of the President and propose to contain that power \nbecause you never know when we will have a problem with it.\n  The Church Committee came out with this wall, a wall of separation \nbetween the CIA and the FBI, and many believed that wall was \nresponsible for the lack of sharing of information between the FBI and \nCIA. They thought they were doing it for constitutional reasons. They \nthought they were doing a good thing. But we realized that was a \ndisaster and we tore that wall down many years later, 20 years later, \nas a result of the experience we had with 9/11. So I would express my \nconcern about statutes dealing with treatment of prisoners or \nsurveillance, that we need to be careful about how we do that. I think \nthe American people believe there should be some flexibility for the \nPresident in matters that could relate to our national security and the \nlives of our own citizens. We need to be careful as we go forward with \nthat.\n  But to date, we can say a couple of things with certainty: that the \nleaders of the House and the Senate were informed fully of what the \nPresident was doing. They did not object. And the Attorney General has \nmade a compelling case, I believe, that he was authorized to do these \nnational security intercepts, both by the authorization to use force \nand by the inherent powers given to the President. I would note, also, \nthat the President's narrow use of a power is something that should be \nappreciated by the critics. He said it can only involve a phone call \nthat is international and a phone call from al-Qaida, in which one \nmember of the call was al-Qaida.\n  If we do those two things, the average American can be sure they are \nnot getting caught up in it. To hear the news articles, of course, it \nwas domestic spying. That is far from the reality of this situation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the recent editorials of the Washington \nTimes and the Washington Post be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Feb. 10, 2006]\n\n                          The Asbestos Debate\n\n       There are three questions the Senate should focus on as it \n     considers the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act: \n     Will the proposed $140 billion asbestos trust fund actually \n     cost $140 billion, or will its fine print eventually require \n     it to payout much more? Can the medical criteria be tightened \n     to ensure that only people who have genuinely suffered harm \n     from asbestos are compensated? And how can one minimize the \n     chances of some future Congress putting taxpayers on the hook \n     for likely overruns?\n       This bill should pass; Sen. Arlen Specter, Pennsylvania \n     Republican, and Patrick Leahy, Vermont Democrat, are due \n     accolades for getting this far on a longstanding problem that \n     has befuddled everyone for decades. Many asbestos victims \n     have suffered or died of mesothelioma or other illnesses \n     while the courts and Washington struggled with a resolution. \n     The victims and their families deserve to be made whole.\n       One good sign is the 98-1 Senate vote Tuesday to move \n     forward, indicating broad agreement that the FAIR Act is \n     acceptable as a starting point for the full Senate's debate. \n     The other is trepidation from Senate Minority Leader Harry \n     Reid: After making noises about a filibuster, Mr. Reid said \n     the bill benefited ``a few large companies'' while supposedly \n     leaving the little guy in the lurch. Really? Why, then, do \n     insurance giants AllState and AIG oppose the bill? Why are \n     many plaintiffs anxious to see it pass? In reality the big \n     guys speak through Mr. Reid--in this case, unscrupulous \n     lawyers who stand to profit greatly from keeping asbestos \n     cases in the courts. Under the FAIR Act, fees for lawyers top \n     out at five percent of the award--far less than they get in \n     court.\n       Of course, there are good reasons to worry about the \n     ``little guy''--just not the ones Mr. Reid suggests. If \n     previous federal ``trust fund'' schemes are any indication, \n     this fund could bleed billions of dollars only a few years \n     from now and demand either a federal bailout or a return to \n     the courts. The first is bad for the average taxpayer; the \n     other is bad for most claimants. As for the first, the \n     nonpartisan National Taxpayers Union opposes the trust fund \n     on the grounds that a bust is likely. It calls the fund ``a \n     fiscal time bomb.'' The second would land claimants back in \n     limbo in courts (to the great pleasure of asbestos lawyers, \n     of course, who clog up the system with questionable cases).\n       The precedents show how daunting this month's debate will \n     be. As we've reported previously, only one of the many \n     smaller trust funds created over the years has been able to \n     meet its obligations, according to Francine Rabinovitz, a \n     trust-fund expert at the University of Southern California. \n     Last year she told Sens. Jon Kyl, Arizona Republican, and Tom \n     Coburn, Oklahoma Republican, that ``none of the bankruptcy \n     trusts created prior to 2002 have been able to pay over the \n     life anywhere close to 50 percent of the liquidated value of \n     qualifying claims.'' Claims against the Johns Manville \n     bankruptcy fund--one flawed effort to solve asbestos-injury \n     claims--outstripped resources by a factor of 20.\n       That begs some questions. Will this $140 billion fund \n     ``sunset'' in three years like its conservative critics say \n     it will? Even the Congressional Budget Office predicts it \n     will bleed $6.5 billion a year by 2015.\n       What about the medical criteria? A group of conservative \n     senators on the Judiciary Committee worried about the fund's \n     solvency cited this among concerns when they sent the bill to \n     the Senate floor last year. Sens. Jon Kyl, Arizona \n     Republican, and Tom Coburn, Oklahoma Republican, said that \n     they were ``deeply concerned that this fund will run out of \n     money and prove unable to pay all qualifying claimants.''\n       This debate will play out fully in the Senate over the \n     coming days. In the meantime, it's worth pointing out what \n     the FAIR Act offers what nothing previously has: A light at \n     the end of the tunnel for claimants. Under FAIR, compensation \n     ranges from $25,000 for people who suffer breathing \n     difficulties to as much as $1.1 million for victims of the \n     deadly cancer mesothelioma. It has taken long enough to get \n     this far. The Senate is close to leading the way out.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From washingtonpost.com, Feb. 10, 2006]\n\n                          Forward on Asbestos\n\n       In a triumph of good sense and bipartisan cooperation, the \n     Senate voted on Tuesday to go forward with a bill that would \n     fix the broken asbestos litigation system. Hundreds of \n     thousands of asbestos injury claims have already landed in \n     the courts, contributing to the bankruptcy of more than 70 \n     companies.\n\n[[Page S1070]]\n\n     Without reform, this process will drag on, triggering the \n     bankruptcy of yet more firms, many of which have only tenuous \n     asbestos connections, because the main firms responsible have \n     already gone under. Meanwhile, many who are ill from \n     asbestos-related diseases won't be able to get timely \n     compensation or, in some cases, any compensation. Unless the \n     bill passes, Navy veterans, for example, will go \n     uncompensated for diseases caused by asbestos on ships. \n     Veterans are not allowed to sue the government, and many of \n     the shipbuilders are long since bankrupt.\n       The bill will be debated and amended, and it may face a \n     second attempted filibuster before it gets a vote. Some \n     amendment may be reasonable at the margins, but the bill's \n     central idea--to replace litigation with a $140 billion \n     compensation fund to be financed by defendant companies and \n     their insurers--must be preserved. Democrats complain that \n     the fund won't have enough money to compensate asbestos \n     victims; Republicans complain that the fund will have too \n     much money, the raising of which will constitute a burden on \n     small and medium-size firms. The fact that the bill is being \n     attacked from both directions suggests that its authors, \n     Sens. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) and Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt), have \n     balanced competing interests in a reasonable manner.\n       Unfortunately, the bill's critics are not always so \n     reasonable. Sen. Harry M. Reid of Nevada, the Democratic \n     minority leader, has complained, ``One would have to search \n     long and hard to find a bill in my opinion as bad as this.'' \n     He has even described the legislation as the work of \n     lobbyists hired by corporations to limit asbestos exposure. \n     But the truth is that the bill's main opponents are trial \n     lawyers, who profit mightily from asbestos lawsuits and who \n     constitute a powerful lobby in their own right Mr. Specter \n     and Mr. Leahy are in fact model resisters of special \n     interests who have spent more than two years crafting \n     legislation that serves the public interest For Mr. Reid to \n     demean this effort in order to fire off campaign sound bites \n     is reprehensible.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, it was 80 years ago when we first \nrecognized February as Black History Month. Today, I am pleased to rise \nto add my voice to those honoring African Americans.\n  African Americans have both a tragic and vibrant history in the \nUnited States. This month is an opportunity to reflect upon their \nstruggles, perseverance, and triumphs. African Americans have \ncontributed to every segment of our community, ranging from politics \nand sports to medicine and business--and have greatly impacted the \nmusic industry. Our society continues to benefit from their service as \nnational leaders, role models, athletes, scholars, and much more.\n  As you know, we cannot reflect on the achievements of our friends \nwithout remembering the civil rights movement. I vividly remember the \nmovement's powerful call for nonviolent change. In 1963, my brother, \nRev. Abraham Akaka, joined Dr. King for the famous March on Washington \nto help show Hawaii's support for the movement. Since 1926, Americans \nhave dedicated the month to honoring the African American legacy. As a \nstaunch supporter of civil rights, I am proud of the many ways that our \ncountry has evolved into a more fair and just nation since the \nmovement.\n  Earlier this week, we bid a fond farewell to Coretta Scott King, who, \nalong with her husband Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., carried the torch \nagainst discrimination and bigotry everywhere. As a nation, we are \nindebted to the Kings and their life's work, and the work of countless \nother civil rights leaders. However, it is an unfortunate reality that, \ndespite all of this progress, inequities remain. To properly pay \ntribute to their legacy, I believe that it is important that we use \nthis month not just as a time for reflection, but also as a springboard \nfor action.\n  In looking back at the progress of African Americans throughout the \nyears and how it has changed the face of our Nation, it is clear that \nBlack history is American history. As a nation, we must work together \nto close the gap on these important issues. Where possible, we must \nwork in our communities on a local level, to ensure that all members of \nour society have equal opportunities to thrive and succeed.\n  This is also a national problem that requires a refocusing of \nnational legislative priorities. Earlier this week, President Bush \nreleased his budget for fiscal year 2007, and I was disappointed that \nhe did not devote the proper resources to these fundamental issues. \nPresident Bush's budget once again underfunds important health care and \neducation priorities. It saddens me that so many people will be \nnegatively affected by the President's proposals. Unfortunately, the \nadministration has again demonstrated a disregard for domestic programs \nto improve the lives of working people at the expense of tax cuts for \nthe wealthiest.\n  The administration needs to refocus its priorities. There are a \nvariety of legislative initiatives that have been introduced this \nCongress which will address the shortcomings in education and health \ncare for minorities, including African Americans. Earlier this year, I \nintroduced S. 1580--the Healthcare Equality and Accountability Act--\nwhich establishes programs designed to improve the quality of and \naccess to health care for minorities, while also improving health \nworkforce accountability. My bill also includes a comprehensive \ndiabetes education program. Diabetes is a disease that \ndisproportionately impacts African Americans and other minorities such \nas native Hawaiians.\n  As a former teacher, I have seen the ways that education can open \ndoors for people from all walks of life. For that reason, I also \nintroduced S. 1521, the Teacher Acculturation Act of 2005. This bill \nrecognizes that cultural incongruence along racial, socioeconomic, and \nethnic vectors impedes learning in our classrooms. Too often, this \nmakes it difficult for knowledge that needs to be transmitted between \nstudents aiming to learn and teachers seeking to teach. My bill helps \nteachers implement strategies to create a healthy learning environment \nfor all students.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues will join me in support of my bills, \nwhich address significant gaps in services for minorities and African \nAmericans.

Mr. President, last month was declared ``Guns Aside \nMonth'' by the DC City Council in honor of the grassroots campaign \nknown by the same name. The Guns Aside campaign is run by a DC \ncommunity organization named Reaching Out to Others Together, or ROOT.\n  Washington, DC, resident Kenneth Barnes established ROOT after his \nson was shot to death in 2001. According to its Web site, ROOT is \n``committed to advocacy, education, and intervention on behalf of \nindividuals and families who have been victimized by homicides. Its \nmission is to bring visibility and focus community and organizational \nresources on these homicides on behalf of families, while addressing \nthe root causes of the systemic apathy that fosters a culture of \nviolence in our communities today.''\n  Among other things, Kenneth Barnes and other ROOT members work with \nthe DC police and local and national organizations to help address the \nneeds of families who have been affected by gun violence and homicide. \nROOT also works with community organizations to develop violence \nprevention strategies and better coordinate their efforts.\n  ROOT's Guns Aside campaign began in September 2004 as a multimedia \noutreach program targeted at young people. As part of the campaign, \nROOT members have visited schools and held\n\n[[Page S1071]]\n\nworkshops and mentoring programs while working to build cooperative \nrelationships with law enforcement personnel, businesses, and local \ngovernment officials. Kenneth Barnes and ROOT recently announced plans \nto expand the Guns Aside program to the top 15 cities affected by gun \nviolence around the country.\n  Ironically, September 29, 2004 marked not only the start of the Guns \nAside campaign, but also the passage of the misnamed ``District of \nColumbia Personal Protection Act'' by the House of Representatives. \nAmong other things, that legislation would repeal local laws in \nWashington, D.C. that ban the sale and possession of unregistered \nfirearms, require firearm registration, impose common sense safe \nstorage requirements, and ban semiautomatic weapons.\n  The Senate did not make the mistake of passing that legislation \nduring the 108th Congress. However, the bill was reintroduced last year \nand the National Rifle Association has labeled it a ``top legislative \npriority'' for this year.\n  I hope that the House and Senate Republican Congressional leadership \nwill reward the work of organizations like ROOT and reject the efforts \nof NRA lobbyists. We should respect the will of the people of \nWashington, DC, with regard to local gun safety laws and work to \nsupport the efforts of antigun violence organizations around the \ncountry by passing commonsense gun safety legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/10/senate-section/article/S1071-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DAVE SERFLING\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate Dave \nSerfling, a Minnesota farmer, father, friend, and activist who died \ntragically on January 8 while driving home from church. My thoughts and \nprayers go out to Dave's family, especially his wife Diane, his \ndaughter Hannah, and his son Ethan. Along with Dave's immediate family, \nthe family farming and sustainable agriculture community in Minnesota \nalso experienced a great loss on that Sunday morning.\n  Dave raised hogs, beef cattle, sheep, and crops on 350 acres in \nsoutheast Minnesota's Fillmore County. During his 46 years, he made \nextraordinary contributions to sustainable agriculture. As a key member \nof the Land Stewardship Project's Federal Farm Policy Committee, Dave \nSerfling put his farming experience and analytical skills to work in \ndeveloping a new farm program that would reward farmers for their \nenvironmental improvements to their farmlands. His ideas were \nchampioned by the great Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, who was then \nchairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry. They became the genesis of Senator Harkin's Conservation \nSecurity Act, which is now a lasting legacy to Dave as an important \nnationwide agriculture program.\n  Dave testified before the Senate for policies helping family farmers \nin Minnesota and across the Nation. His statement to the Senate \nAgriculture Committee on July 31, 2001, typified his philosophy on farm \npolicy and farming itself: ``I am a big believer in farm ingenuity. . . \n. Please don't tell the farmers how to farm. Just tell us what results \nyou want to see on working land, give us meaningful financial \nincentives, and we American farmers will not let you down.''\n  Dave's involvement with the 2002 farm bill was just one example of \nhis contributions to sustainable agriculture and family farming. In \n1987, he and his wife Diane were one of the original farm families to \nbe involved in the Land Stewardship Project's Stewardship Farming \nProgram, an on-farm research and information exchange initiative, which \nbecame a national model for farmer-to-farmer education. The Serflings \ncontinued to be involved in on-farm research and education during the \npast two decades.\n  Throughout the years, Dave wrote extensively for various \npublications, including the Minneapolis-based Star Tribune and \nAgriNews. His writings and speeches combined Dave's razor-sharp \nanalytical abilities with his own family's experiences as stewards of \ntheir Fillmore County farm. The Serfling farm had also been featured in \nthe Christian Science Monitor, the Des Moines Register, the Chicago \nTribune, and on National Public Radio.\n  In recent years, Dave and Diane's farm has been recognized for \nprotecting the environment and raising animals humanely, while also \nmaking a profit. In 2005, Dave and Diane were given an Outstanding \nConservationist award by the Minnesota Association of Soil and Water \nConservation Districts. That same year, their farm was recognized by \nthe national company, Niman Ranch, as a top producer of high-quality \npork.\n  Dave was also a role model for his children when it came to the idea \nof lifelong learning. In December 2005, he received a master's degree \nin professional agriculture from Iowa State University after taking \nclasses, one at a time, for 16 years.\n  At the time of his death, Dave was working on new ideas for the 2007 \nfarm bill. He was helping develop a new farm initiative for \nconservation, commodity program reform, and rural development based on \nlocal food and farming systems.\n  Dave had his priorities right. He loved his family, he cared for his \nfarm, and he worked for the betterment of his community and society. He \nlived his faith. Dave Serfling's absence from farming, farm policy, and \nMinnesota will be felt for a long time to come. However, he has left a \nlegacy of stewardship of the land and a practical vision for family \nfarming that will benefit today's farmers and future generations. Thank \nyou, Dave. Rest in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/10/senate-section/article/S1071-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/10/senate-section/article/S1071-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/10/senate-section/article/S1071-4", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bills were read the first time:\n\n       S. 2271.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease the deduction for host families of foreign exchange and other \nstudents from $50 per month to $200 per month; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce \nlegislation with my colleague from South Dakota, Senator Johnson, that \nwill help ease the financial burden for American families who open \ntheir homes to foreign exchange students from around the world, and \noffer an incentive to additional families to get involved in \ninternational exchanges.\n  Every year, approximately 30,000 American families host exchange \nstudents from all over the world. This exchange experience provides the \nfamilies, their communities, the students and their schools with a \nunique educational opportunity to increase cultural awareness and \nunderstanding. And it often produces lifelong friendship as well.\n  Exchange programs are vital in today's interconnected world to build \nbridges of understanding. Youth exchange is particularly critical as it \nallows young people the opportunity to gain exposure to American \nfamilies, culture and values early in their lives. Participants take \nhome an understanding and often an appreciation for America's people, \nsociety and values.\n  At her confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee early last year, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice \ndeclared, ``I am a big proponent of student exchanges. It is the best \npolicy we can have.'' She explained that, ``the presence of foreign \nstudents'' is ``one of the best things'' for American students; the \nexperience ``changes the way we think about people, and the way they \nthink about us'', and she called student exchange ``invaluable.''\n  We could not agree with her more. The legislation we introduce today \nwill encourage more American families to participate in exchanges by \nincreasing the monthly tax deduction for host families from $50 to $200 \nper month. The current $50 tax deduction has been in place since it was \nfirst introduced in the 1960s. It has never been increased to allow for \ninflation or to reflect the increasing costs associated with hosting a \nstudent. Our legislation will increase the monthly deduction with an \nannual adjustment for inflation.\n  While the increase is certainly not enough cover the expenses \ninvolved in feeding and housing a teenager, it will offer needed cost \nrelief to American families, and most importantly, it will send a \nstrong message to these families that our Nation values their \ncontribution to increasing international understanding.\n  I hope that my Senate colleagues will join Senator Johnson and me in \nsupporting this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2272\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a language arts facility for Homeland \nSecurity personnel and law enforcement officers; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Foreign \nLanguage Training Act of 2006, a bill that I believe is necessary for \nthe success of our Department of Homeland Security personnel and other \nFederal agents.\n  As you may know, our Department of Defense employees receive foreign \nlanguage education and training at the Defense Language Institute \nForeign Language Center. This school has provided training for American \nforces involved in arms control treaty verification, the war on drugs, \nand Operation Desert Storm.\n  I believe the Department of Defense's success can provide guidance \nfor Department of Homeland Security personnel and Federal law \nenforcement agents who need foreign language skills. The Foreign \nLanguage Training Act of 2006 provides for such guidance by creating a \nfacility similar to the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language \nCenter for these Federal employees.\n  My bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security and other Federal \nagency leaders to identify employees who need foreign language \neducation and plan for the provision of such education. To fully \nutilize existing Federal assets, the Foreign Language Training Act \nrequires this training to take place at the Federal Law Enforcement \nTraining Center in Artesia, New Mexico. FLETC is already planning to \nincrease its language training capabilities and construct new language \narts facilities in Artesia to accommodate the increased number of \nborder patrol trainees being sent there, so it makes sense for other \nDHS employees and Federal agents to utilize this facility as well.\n\n[[Page S1073]]\n\n  Mr. President, the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center \nhas prepared our soldiers for World War II, the Cold War, the Korean \nWar, and the Vietman conflict. It continues to provide such training \ntoday. I believe that similar training is necessary for the men and \nwomen securing our homeland, and the Foreign Language Training Act of \n2006 provides for such education.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2274\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Foreign Language Training \n     Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act--\n       (1) the term ``executive agency'' has the same meaning as \n     in section 105 of title 5, United States Code, except that \n     the term does not include the Department of Defense;\n       (2) the term ``law enforcement officer'' has the same \n     meaning as in section 8331 of title 5, United States Code; \n     and\n       (3) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for fairness for the Federal judiciary; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Fairness in \nJudicial Salaries Act.\n  This legislation is needed to prevent a continuing decline in the pay \nof our Federal judges and prevent damage to the quality of our \njudiciary.\n  Impartial, dedicated, and wise judges are critical to our justice \nsystem. Nevertheless, in the past three decades, our Federal judges \nhave been neglected.\n  Since 1969, the salaries of Federal judges have declined by nearly 24 \npercent in inflation adjusted dollars. By comparison, in the same time \nperiod the salary of the average American worker has increased over 15 \npercent.\n  Since 1993, when Congress last passed a comprehensive revision of \nFederal salaries, real judicial pay has declined about 10 percent.\n  The drop in judicial pay is even more stark when compared to judges' \npeers in the legal community.\n  In 1969, the salary of a Federal district court judge was about 20 \npercent higher than the salary of a top law school dean and about 30 \npercent higher than that of a senior law professor at a top law school. \nIn contrast, today, top law school deans make twice as much as district \ncourt judges, and senior law professors at those schools make nearly 50 \npercent more.\n  Today, partners at major law firms routinely make three, four or five \ntimes what Federal judges make. Furthermore, first year law school \ngraduates at these law firms make more than experienced Federal judges.\n  While judges are making less, they are also working more. In the same \ntime period that judges pay has declined by nearly 24 percent, the \ncaseload for district court judges has climbed by 58.4 percent and the \ncaseload of Circuit Court judges has jumped 211.4 percent.\n  While fairness alone would require a reasonable salary for judges, \nthe growing pay disparity between judges and other members of the legal \nprofession poses a real threat to the quality of our judiciary.\n  In order to ensure that our judiciary can continue to attract--and--\nkeep top attorneys, it is imperative that judges' salaries be increased \nto at least make up for some of the loss in real pay that has taken \nplace in the last 30 years.\n  In 2003, the National Commission on the Public Service, also known as \nthe Volcker Commission, concluded that ``the lag in judicial salaries \nhas gone on too long, and the potential for the diminished quality in \nAmerican jurisprudence is now too large.''\n  In a July 15, 2002 statement to the National Commission on the Public \nService, the late Chief Justice Rehnquist said inadequate compensation \nseriously compromises the judicial independence fostered by life \ntenure. The prospect that low salaries might force judges to return to \nthe private sector rather than stay on the bench risks affecting \njudicial performance.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist's views were echoed by new Chief Justice \nRoberts in his State of the Judiciary Address from earlier this year. \nChief Justice Roberts said the following:\n\n       If judges' salaries are too low, judges effectively serve \n     for a term dictated by their financial position rather than \n     for life. Figures gathered by the Administrative Office show \n     that judges are leaving the bench in greater numbers now than \n     ever before. In the 1960s, only a handful of district and \n     appellate court judges retired or resigned; since 1990, 92 \n     judges have left the bench. Of those, 21 left before reaching \n     retirement age. Fifty-nine of them stepped down to enter the \n     private practice of law. In the past five years alone, 37 \n     judges have left the federal bench--nine of them in the last \n     year.\n       There will always be a substantial difference in pay \n     between successful government and private sector lawyers. But \n     if that difference remains too large, as it is today, the \n     judiciary will over time cease to be made up of a diverse \n     group of the Nation's very best lawyers. Instead, it will \n     come to be staffed by a combination of the independently \n     wealthy and those following a career path before becoming a \n     judge different from the practicing bar at large. Such a \n     development would dramatically alter the nature of the \n     federal judiciary.\n\n  Many of the judges that have left the bench in recent years cited \nfinancial considerations as a major factor in their decisions to leave \nthe bench.\n  In my home State of California, several Federal judges have gone on \nthe record to say that they left the Federal bench because of financial \npressures. Some of these judges have even taken jobs in the California \nState judiciary, since the State courts offer better salaries than the \nFederal bench.\n  As a result of the linkage of judicial salaries with the salaries of \nMembers of Congress, when Congress has voted to deny itself a cost-of-\nliving adjustment, as it has in 5 of the last 12 years, it has \nsimultaneously denied all Federal judges cost-of-living adjustments, as \nwell. Consequently, the real pay of judges has declined.\n  I am not suggesting that judges be paid as much as partners at law \nfirms; however, they should receive a fair salary. The legislation that \nI introduce today, the Federal Judicial Fairness Act, provides a \nstraightforward solution.\n  First, the act terminates the linkage of congressional pay increase \nto judicial pay increases, so that Congress's decision to deny itself \npay raises will not also place that burden on Federal judges.\n  Second, the act increases the salaries of all Federal judges by 16.5 \npercent, in order to at least partially make up for the decline in real \npay for judges over the last three decades. In 2003, both President \nBush and Chief Justice Rehnquist agreed that a pay adjustment of at \nleast 16.5 percent was needed.\n  Finally, the act would provide Federal judges with annual cost-of-\nliving adjustments based on the employee cost Index, an index already \nused by the Federal Government to help Federal salaries keep up with \ninflation.\n  The cost of this salary increase would be only $41.3 million, a \nrelatively small sum to safeguard the quality and independence of our \njudiciary.\n\n[[Page S1074]]\n\n  Our Federal judges make many sacrifices in serving our Nation and a \ncut in pay is one of these sacrifices. However, the disparity between \njudicial salaries and salaries in the rest of the legal profession has \ngrown so wide that the quality of our judicial system may be \nendangered. It is time to provide these critical public servants with a \nfair salary that will guarantee the future health of the judiciary.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2276\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The appropriate date under this sentence is the \n     first day of the fiscal year that begins in the preceding \n     calendar year.\n       ``(2) In no event shall the percentage adjustment taking \n     effect under paragraph (1) in any calendar year (before \n     rounding), in any salary rate, exceed the percentage \n     adjustment taking effect in such calendar year under section \n     5303 of title 5 in the rates of pay under the General \n     Schedule.''.\n       (c) Judicial Salary Increases.--Effective on the first day \n     of the first applicable pay period that begins on or after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, the rate of basic pay \n     for the Chief Justice of the United States, an Associate \n     Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, a judge of \n     a United States circuit court, a judge of a district court of \n     the United States, a judge of the United States Court of \n     International Trade, a bankruptcy judge, and a full-time \n     magistrate judge shall be increased in the amount of 16.5 \n     percent of their respective rates (as last in effect before \n     the increase), rounded to the nearest multiple of $100 (or, \n     if midway between multiples of $100, to the next higher \n     multiple of $100).\n\n     SEC. 3. COORDINATION RULE.\n\n       If a pay adjustment under section 2 is to be made for an \n     office or position as of the same date as any other pay \n     adjustment affecting such office or position, the adjustment \n     under section 2 shall be made first.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/10/senate-section/article/S1074-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2759.

Mr. President, on Monday, the Senate will consider H.R. \n4297, the Tax Relief Act of 2005 for the third time. Unfortunately, \nthere will be multiple motions to instruct the conferees from the other \nside of the aisle before we send this bill to conference. Those motions \nwill be offered on Monday. Senators can therefore expect multiple votes \non Monday. There are 10 hours available by statute for consideration of \nthese motions. Therefore, these votes will occur later on Monday. I \nanticipate those votes to begin sometime after 8 p.m.\n  We will then resume consideration of the asbestos bill next week. \nPending is the motion to waive the point of order. We have Senators who \nwould like additional debate. We will be talking to Senators on both \nsides of the aisle to determine the best time to schedule that vote \nfollowing their statements. Needless to say, there is much work to be \ndone before our next recess, the Presidents Day recess, at the end of \nnext week. Therefore, I expect we will be voting Monday, Tuesday, \nWednesday, Thursday, and Friday in order to complete our work.\n  In addition to the asbestos bill and the Tax Relief Act, we need to \naddress the PATRIOT Act before adjourning. It is going to be a long, \narduous week. I thank Members for their patience in advance as we move \nthese vital priorities along.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/10/senate-section/article/S1076-4", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 2006\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
