Mr. President, it is my understanding we have basically \n3\\1/2\\ amendments remaining. We have one on which debate is nearing \ncompletion, and then we have three other amendments. We have an hour \nequally divided on each of those three amendments. On the amendment \nthat is before the Senate dealing with the habeas corpus aspect of this \nlegislation, we have a number of people--and we have conveyed this to \nthe majority--who wish to speak. It takes up about an hour of extra \ntime.\n  I say to everyone within the sound of my voice--namely, 44 Democrats, \nespecially those who have indicated to the cloakroom they want to speak \non this issue--we had time lined up yesterday, and because of quorum \ncalls time was lost. Unless we get more time from the majority, there \nwill be no time to speak, other than the time that is in the unanimous \nconsent agreement that is the order before the Senate on the three \namendments, and whatever time is remaining on the amendment being led \nby Senator Specter and Senator Leahy.\n  Again, if somebody wants time, they can't always have it so when they \nget here, they can walk on. Senators might have to wait around for a \nlittle while because yesterday we lost a significant amount of \nDemocratic time as a result of Senators not being available to speak.\n  We have a couple more days. Hopefully, we can finish this tomorrow or \nSaturday, but we have a lot to do. We will need cooperation from all \nSenators if, in fact, they want to cooperate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n\n[[Page S10350]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, to expand a little bit on the Democratic \nleader's comments, we entered into a unanimous consent agreement to \naddress this bill with a reasonable amount of time. We are going to \nneed to stick to that in large part because we have, as I outlined, the \nHamdan legislation, we have the other three amendments, we have the \nfence border legislation, which has been pending for several days, DOD \nappropriations, the Child Custody Act, Homeland Security \nappropriations, and possibly the port security bill. We have an \nimportant Cabinet nomination, the Peters nomination, and then we have \nan adjournment resolution. That list is big.\n  As the Democratic leader and I have repeatedly said, we are going to \nfinish this week, and it is already Thursday morning. Once we set a \nplan, we need to stick with a unanimous consent agreement set out. As \nwe go through these issues, it is going to take a lot of cooperation to \naccomplish what has been laid out.\n  With that, I think we will begin a period for morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/28/senate-section/article/S10350-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to take note of the \nreal progress this Congress has made and is on the verge of making in \nstrengthening our homeland security.\n  This progress--reform of FEMA, protection of our chemical facilities \nand improved security for our seaports--should not be overlooked as we \nconclude a hectic month.\n  In the midst of all the charges that Congress has failed to \naccomplish all that we should, I want to call attention to the many \ntimes when, in fact, Members have cooperated among committees, between \nChambers, and across party lines to make real progress to benefit the \nAmerican people.\n  The 109th Congress has had many such accomplishments that belie the \nstereotype of a rancorous debating society that is unable to enact and \nimprove the security of our country.\n  Let me focus on three major accomplishments by Congress in the area \nof homeland security. I note that these accomplishments should become \nlaw shortly as we complete work on the Homeland Security appropriations \nbill.\n  The first accomplishment was reaching agreement on a broad array of \nreforms to improve the Department of Homeland Security, including \nurgently needed reform and reinforcement of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency.\n  The recommendations for improvements the result of the Senate \nCommittee on Homeland Security's 7-month investigation into the failed \npreparations and response to Hurricane Katrina. This investigation, \nwhich was completely bipartisan, included 23 hearings, testimony and \ninterviews of some 400 people, and a review of more than 838,000 pages \nof documents.\n  The committee's recommendations will make FEMA a distinct entity \nwithin DHS. Why does that matter? It matters because it gives FEMA the \nsame kinds of protections enjoyed by the Coast Guard and the Secret \nService. It protects FEMA from arbitrary budget cuts or departmental \nreorganizations that are implemented without congressional review.\n  FEMA's Administrator, under the reforms included in the \nappropriations bill, will become the President's principal adviser for \nall-hazards emergency management.\n  Another important reform is that the legislation reunites \npreparedness and response and makes FEMA responsible and empowered for \nall phases of emergency management--preparation, mitigation, response, \nand recovery.\n  A very important reform will be the creation of response strike teams \nto ensure a more effective response to disasters.\n  What we will do is create in the 10 regions of the United States \nmulti-agency task forces comprising representatives from every Federal \nagency that is involved in responding to or preparing for disaster. \nThey will train and exercise with their State and local counterparts, \nwith NGOs, such as the Red Cross, and with the key for-profit \nbusinesses, such as utility companies. That will ensure that they won't \nneed to be exchanging business cards in the midst of the next disaster.\n  I was struck during our investigation of Hurricane Katrina that so \nmany people from FEMA Region I--the region the Presiding Officer and I \nare from, New England--were sent down to Louisiana to help with the \nresponse to Hurricane Katrina. The problem, of course, is they didn't \nknow the people, they didn't know the geography, they didn't know the \nculture, they didn't have knowledge of what assets could be mobilized \nin the response. These regional teams will ensure that does not happen \nagain.\n  We also addressed issues such as chronic staffing shortages at FEMA, \nthe need for better pre-positioning of emergency supplies and tracking \nof shipments, better grant-making authority to improve coordination \nregionally and with local responders, and the need to provide \nsurvivable and interoperable communications.\n  We also revised the Stafford Act to bring it up to date and make it \nmore flexible and responsive.\n  The second major homeland security accomplishment of this Congress is \nstill a work in progress, but I am very optimistic that it will, in \nfact, become law, and that is the port-security bill which this Chamber \nrecently passed unanimously. Senator Murray and I have led a bipartisan \neffort to enact this legislation. There have been many other Members on \nboth sides of the aisle involved, including on my committee Senator \nColeman and Senator Lieberman.\n  With 361 ports in this country and some 11 million shipping \ncontainers arriving each year, we desperately need better assurances \nthat our seaports and these containers are not going to be used to \nbring weapons, explosives, bio-terror compounds, or even a squad of \nterrorists into our country.\n  The vulnerability of our seaports is perhaps best underscored by an \nincident that occurred in Seattle in April, when 22 Chinese nationals \nwere successful in coming all the way from China to Seattle in a \nshipping container. If 22 illegal Chinese nationals can come to our \ncountry via a shipping container, it shows we still have a lot of work \nto do to ensure better security at our seaports.\n  The legislation this Chamber passed is balanced legislation that \nstrengthens our security while recognizing the importance of trade and \nnot bringing the shipment of containers to a halt. The port-security \npackage fills a dangerous gap in our defenses. I hope we will enact it \nbefore leaving here this week.\n  The third area of accomplishment involves the security of chemical \nplants, plants that either use, store, or manufacture large quantities \nof hazardous chemicals.\n  Last January, I held a hearing in which I asked several experts: What \nare your greatest concerns? What gaps do we have in our homeland \nsecurity? The lack of regulation of our chemical plants came up time \nand again. Our existing protections are a patchwork of different \nauthorities--State, Coast Guard, and voluntary industry standards. They \nare inadequate, given the threats we face.\n  Now, this has been a very difficult debate, but I think it is so \nimportant to remember that right now, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity lacks the authority to set risk- and performance-based \nstandards for security at our chemical facilities despite the fact that \nterrorism experts tell us al-Qaida is focused on chemical plants and \nchemical explosions.\n  We have some 15,000 chemical facilities around the country, including \nmore than 3,000 sites where a terrorist\n\n[[Page S10351]]\n\nattack could cause considerable casualties among nearby populations. \nLanguage in the DHS appropriations bill would, for the first time, \nempower DHS to set performance-based security standards for high-risk \nchemical facilities. That is approximately 3,400 facilities across this \ncountry.\n  Very importantly, this legislation will allow the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to shut down a noncompliant plant. I fought very hard \nfor this authority to be included in the appropriations bill. It does \nno good to empower the Secretary to set these risk-based, performance-\nbased standards but then provide the tools to enforce them.\n  I recognize there are many chemical plants and chemical companies \nacross this country which have voluntarily taken strong steps to \nimprove their security in the wake of the attacks on our country on 9/\n11. Unfortunately, the Department of Homeland Security has told us \nthere are many plants which have not improved their security at all or \nwhich have taken insufficient measures. We can no longer rely on just \nvoluntary compliance with industry standards.\n  So this legislation is landmark legislation. It closes a dangerous \ngap in our homeland security, and it has been included in the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill.\n  I would note that the language includes a three-year sunset. The \nreason for that is we will want to evaluate the effectiveness of this \napproach, the effectiveness of the regulations, and also consider other \nmeasures that were not included in this bill. The committee I am \nprivileged to chair unanimously reported chemical-security legislation \nthat was more comprehensive than the measures included in the \nappropriations bill. This will give us a chance to evaluate the efforts \nthat have been taken, that will be taken, and then to go back and look \nat some of the issues that were not included.\n  I want to be very clear. This is a major step forward. It will help \nclose a dangerous gap in our homeland security, and it is significant \nprogress in eliminating or at least lessening a significant risk to our \ncountry.\n  These are three significant steps forward: the reform of FEMA, the \nport security bill, and the new authority for DHS to set security \nmeasures for chemical facilities. Each of them was made possible \nbecause of bipartisan cooperation. At times in this Chamber, we berate \nourselves for failing to achieve consensus on legislation that is so \nimportant to the American people, but we did it in these three cases--\nor we are on the verge of doing it--and it is because we did have good \ncooperation and strong leadership. It was not easy. But the legislation \nwe are passing will advance our ability to protect the American people.\n  I compliment all of the Members of the Senate, our partners on the \nHouse side, as well as members of the administration who have stepped \nforward and worked so hard to make these reforms a reality. Our success \nin advancing these achievements in strengthening our homeland security \nshould be a source of justifiable pride to the Members of this body.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, could you describe the circumstances of \nthe Senate? Are we in morning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, because the truncated time on the \namendments to the underlying bill includes a very short amount of time \nfor the Specter amendment, I am going to use only 5 minutes now to talk \nabout my support of the Specter amendment.\n  The Specter amendment is about habeas corpus. That is a big term, a \nkind of complicated term. Let me describe it by describing this \npicture. This is a young woman. She is a young woman named Mitsuye \nEndo. Mitsuye Endo looked out from behind barbed-wire fences where she \nwas incarcerated in this country some decades ago during the Second \nWorld War. Let me tell you about her. She was a 22-year-old clerical \nworker in California's Department of Motor Vehicles in Sacramento, CA. \nShe had never been to Japan. She didn't speak Japanese. She had been \nborn and raised in this country. She was a Methodist. She had a brother \nin the U.S. Army, unquestioned loyalty to the United States of America, \nbut she was incarcerated--picked up, taken from her home, her job, her \ncommunity, and put behind barbed-wire fences.\n  Now, she eventually got out of that incarceration, and her plea to \nthe courts was what really led to the unlocking of those camps, and let \nthose tens of thousands of Japanese Americans out of those camps. They \nhad been unjustly viewed as enemies of our country and incarcerated. \nAnd with one young woman's writ of habeas corpus, an awful chapter in \nour country's history soon came to an end. Her question to the courts \nwas a simple but powerful one: Why am I being detained?\n  What is habeas corpus? Well, it answers the question, by giving \naccess to the courts, of whether you can hold someone indefinitely \nwithout charges, without a trial, and without a right for anyone to \nhave a review of their circumstances. When someone has the right to \nfile a habeas corpus petition, it is the right of someone to go to the \ncourt system in this country to say to that court system: There has \nbeen a mistake. I am innocent; I didn't do it; I shouldn't be here.\n  The court then asks the question: Why are these people locked up? \nShould they be locked up? Is there a basis for it? Is it a mistake? Is \nit wrong?\n  Everyone in this Chamber will have read the story in the Washington \nPost about a week ago, and after I read that story, I just hung my head \na bit. A Canadian in this country was apprehended at an American \nairport, at a U.S. airport in New York City. That Canadian citizen, \napprehended in New York City by our authorities, was then sent to \nSyria, where he was tortured for some 8 or 9 months. He was put in a \ncoffin-like structure, a cement coffin-like structure, in isolation, \nand tortured. It turns out, at the end of nearly a year of his \nincarceration, it was all a big mistake. He wasn't a terrorist. He \nwasn't involved with terrorists. But he was apprehended and held \nincommunicado, in fact, rendered to another country where torture \noccurred. A big mistake. His wife didn't know where he was. He has a \nyoung 2- or 3-year-old child.\n  What does all this say? Why is this country a country that is \ndifferent from others? We have been different from others because it is \nin this country where you can't be picked up off of a street and held \nindefinitely, held without charges, held without a trial, held without \na right to go to a court. It is this country in which that exists.\n  Let me make another point. Why should we care about how the United \nStates treats noncitizens and taking away the right of habeas corpus \nfor noncitizens? Because every U.S. citizen is a noncitizen in every \nother country of the world. There are 193 countries in this world. We \nare citizens of only one. And when an American travels--any American, \nanywhere--we are noncitizens in those countries.\n  What would our reaction be? What will our reaction be as Americans \nif--as an example, recently, a journalist who was detained and arrested \nand put in jail, I believe in Sudan, who then asked his captors to be \nable to see the American consulate: I need the ability to contact the \nAmerican consulate.\n  His captors said: You have no such rights.\n  He complained: But I do have that right.\n  His captors said: No. Those you have detained in the United States \nare not given those rights, and you are not given those rights, either.\n  This is why this issue is so important, and that is why I support the \nSpecter amendment. I hope very much the Senate will not make a profound \nmistake by turning down that amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Her question to the courts \nwas a simple but powerful one: Why am I being detained?\n  What is habeas corpus? Well, it answers the question, by giving \naccess to the courts, of whether you can hold someone indefinitely \nwithout charges, without a trial, and without a right for anyone to \nhave a review of their circumstances. When someone has the right to \nfile a habeas corpus petition, it is the right of someone to go to the \ncourt system in this country to say to that court system: There has \nbeen a mistake. I am innocent; I didn't do it; I shouldn't be here.\n  The court then asks the question: Why are these people locked up? \nShould they be locked up? Is there a basis for it? Is it a mistake? Is \nit wrong?\n  Everyone in this Chamber will have read the story in the Washington \nPost about a week ago, and after I read that story, I just hung my head \na bit. A Canadian in this country was apprehended at an American \nairport, at a U.S. airport in New York City. That Canadian citizen, \napprehended in New York City by our authorities, was then sent to \nSyria, where he was tortured for some 8 or 9 months. He was put in a \ncoffin-like structure, a cement coffin-like structure, in isolation, \nand tortured. It turns out, at the end of nearly a year of his \nincarceration, it was all a big mistake. He wasn't a terrorist. He \nwasn't involved with terrorists. But he was apprehended and held \nincommunicado, in fact, rendered to another country where torture \noccurred. A big mistake. His wife didn't know where he was. He has a \nyoung 2- or 3-year-old child.\n  What does all this say? Why is this country a country that is \ndifferent from others? We have been different from others because it is \nin this country where you can't be picked up off of a street and held \nindefinitely, held without charges, held without a trial, held without \na right to go to a court. It is this country in which that exists.\n  Let me make another point. Why should we care about how the United \nStates treats noncitizens and taking away the right of habeas corpus \nfor noncitizens? Because every U.S. citizen is a noncitizen in every \nother country of the world. There are 193 countries in this world. We \nare citizens of only one. And when an American travels--any American, \nanywhere--we are noncitizens in those countries.\n  What would our reaction be? What will our reaction be as Americans \nif--as an example, recently, a journalist who was detained and arrested \nand put in jail, I believe in Sudan, who then asked his captors to be \nable to see the American consulate: I need the ability to contact the \nAmerican consulate.\n  His captors said: You have no such rights.\n  He complained: But I do have that right.\n  His captors said: No. Those you have detained in the United States \nare not given those rights, and you are not given those rights, either.\n  This is why this issue is so important, and that is why I support the \nSpecter amendment. I hope very much the Senate will not make a profound \nmistake by turning down that amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n\n[[Page S10352]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/28/senate-section/article/S10352-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10352-S10354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          MILITARY COMMISSIONS\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, America was attacked on September 11, 2001, \nby a ruthless enemy of our Nation. It is my strong belief, as I believe \nit is the belief of all of us in this Chamber, that those who are \nresponsible for orchestrating this plot and anyone else who seeks to do \nharm to our country and citizens should be brought to the bar of \njustice and punished severely. On that I presume there is no debate \nwhatsoever.\n  These are extraordinary times, and we must act in a way that fully \nsafeguards America's national security. That is why I support the \nconcept of military commissions: to protect U.S. intelligence and \nexpedite judicial proceedings vital to military action under the \nUniform Code of Military Justice. As we develop such means, we must \nalso ensure our actions are not counterproductive to our overall effort \nto protect America at all levels.\n  The administration and the Republican leadership on this issue would \nhave the American people believe--and this is the unfortunate point--\nthat the war on terror requires us to make a choice, both here in this \nChamber and across the country, between protecting America from \nterrorism and the choice of upholding the basic tenets upon which our \nNation was founded--but not both. This canard, in my view, has been \nshowcased far too often.\n  I fully reject that reasoning. Americans throughout the previous 200 \nyears have as well. We can and must balance our responsibilities to \nbring terrorists to justice while at the same time protecting what it \nmeans to be an American. To choose the rule of law over the passion of \nthe moment takes courage, but it is the right thing to do if we are to \nuphold the values of equal justice and due process that are codified in \nour Constitution.\n  Our Founding Fathers established the legal framework of our country \non the premise that those in government are not infallible. America's \nleaders knew this 60 years ago when they determined how to deal with \nNazi leaders guilty of horrendous crimes. There were strong and \npersuasive voices at that time crying out for the summary execution of \nthose men who had commanded with ruthless efficiency the slaughter of 6 \nmillion innocent Jews and 5 million other innocent men and women. After \nWorld War Two, our country was forced to decide whether the accused \ncriminals deserved trial or execution.\n\n  There was an article written recently by Professor Luban, a professor \nat Georgetown University, titled ``Forget Nuremberg--How Bush's new \ntorture bill eviscerates the promise of Nuremberg.'' I ask unanimous \nconsent that the entire article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Forget Nuremberg: How Bush's New Torture Bill Eviscerates the Promise \n                              of Nuremberg\n\n                          (By David J. Luban)\n\n       The burning question is: What did the Bush administration \n     do to break John McCain when a North Vietnamese prison camp \n     couldn't do it?\n       Could it have been ``ego up''? I'm told ego up is not \n     possible with a U.S. senator. That probably also rules out \n     ego down. Fear up harsh? McCain doesn't have the reputation \n     of someone who scares easily. False flag? Did he think they \n     were sending him to the vice president's office? No, he \n     already knew he was in the vice president's office. Wait, I \n     think I know the answer: futility--which the Army's old field \n     manual on interrogation defined as explaining rationally to \n     the prisoner why holding out is hopeless. Yes, the \n     explanation must be that the Bush lawyers would have \n     successfully loopholed any law McCain might write, so why \n     bother? Futility might have done the trick.\n       How else can we explain McCain's surrender this week on the \n     torture issue, one on which he has been as passionate in the \n     past as Lindsey Graham was on secret evidence?\n       Marty Lederman at Balkinization explains here and here some \n     of the worst bits of the proposed ``compromise legislation'' \n     on detainee treatment. But the fact is, virtually every word \n     of the proposed bill is a capitulation, including ``and'' and \n     ``the.'' And yesterday's draft is even worse than last \n     week's. It unexpectedly broadens the already broad definition \n     of ``unlawful enemy combatant'' to include those who fight \n     against the United States as well as those who give them \n     ``material support''--a legal term that appears to include \n     anyone who has ever provided lodging or given a cell phone to \n     a Taliban foot soldier out of sympathy with his cause. Now, \n     not only the foot soldier but also his mom can be detained \n     indefinitely at Guantanamo.\n       But the real tragedy of the so-called compromise is what it \n     does to the legacy of Nuremberg--a legacy we would have been \n     celebrating next week at the 60th anniversary of the \n     judgment.\n       What does the bill do to Nuremberg? Section 8(a)(2) holds \n     that when it comes to applying the War Crimes Act, ``No \n     foreign or international sources of law shall supply a basis \n     for a rule of decision in the courts of the United States in \n     interpreting the prohibitions enumerated in subsection \n     2441(d).'' That means the customary international law of war \n     is henceforth expelled from U.S. war-crime law--ironic, to \n     say the least, because it was the U.S. Army's Lieber Code \n     that formed the basis for the Law of Armed Conflict and that \n     launched the entire worldwide enterprise of codifying \n     genuinely international humanitarian law.\n       Ironic also because our own military takes customary LOAC \n     as its guide and uses it to train officers and interrogators. \n     Apparently there is no need to do that anymore, at least when \n     it comes to war crimes. That means goodbye, International \n     Committee of the Red Cross; the Swiss can go back to their \n     fondue and cuckoo clocks. It also means goodbye, \n     jurisprudence of the Yugoslav tribunal, which the United \n     States was instrumental in forming.\n       And also goodbye, Nuremberg.\n       Sept. 30 and Oct. 1 mark the 60th anniversary of the \n     tribunal's judgment. If the opening chapters of Telford \n     Taylor's superb The Anatomy of the Nuremberg Trials make one \n     thing crystal clear, it's the burning desire of the United \n     States to create international law using those trials. \n     Great Britain initially opposed the Nuremberg trials and \n     urged simply shooting top Nazis, out of fear they would \n     use the trials for propaganda. Stalin favored conducting \n     trials, but only to establish punishments, not guilt. Like \n     Great Britain, he thought punishing the top Nazis should \n     be a political, and not a legal, decision. The trials \n     happened as they did only because the United States \n     insisted on them for purposes of establishing future law--\n     a task that summary justice at executive say-so could \n     never have done.\n       At the London conference that wrote the Nuremberg Charter, \n     France and Russia both objected to criminalizing aggressive \n     war for anybody but the Axis countries. But Supreme Court \n     Justice Robert Jackson, the American representative, insisted \n     that creating universally binding international law was the \n     prime purpose of the tribunal.\n       A compromise left the international status of Nuremberg law \n     ambiguous--the tribunal's jurisdiction covered only the Axis \n     countries, but nowhere does the charter suggest that the \n     crimes it was trying were only crimes if committed by the \n     Axis powers. Because of this ambiguity, the status of the \n     Nuremberg principles as international law was not established \n     until 1950, when the U.N. General Assembly proclaimed seven \n     Nuremberg Principles to be international law. The American \n     agenda had finally prevailed.\n       Well, forget all that as well. The Nuremberg Principles, \n     like the entire body of international humanitarian law, will \n     now have no purchase in the war-crimes law of the United \n     States. Who cares whether they were our idea in the first \n     place? Principle VI of the Nuremberg seven defines war crimes \n     as ``violations of the laws or customs of war, which include, \n     but are not limited to . . . ill-treatment of prisoners of \n     war.'' Forget ``customs of war''--that sounds like customary \n     international law, which has no place in our courts anymore. \n     Forget ``ill-treatment''--it's too vague. Take this one: \n     Principle II, ``The fact that internal law does not impose a \n     penalty for an act which constitutes a crime under \n     international law does not relieve the person who committed \n     the act from responsibility under international law.'' \n     Section 8(a)(2) sneers at responsibility under international \n     law. Or Principle IV: ``The fact that a person acted pursuant \n     to order of his Government or of a superior does not relieve \n     him from responsibility under international law , provided a \n     moral choice was in fact possible to him.'' Moral, shmoral. \n     The question is, do you want the program or don't you?\n       The Nuremberg trials presupposed something about the human \n     conscience: that moral choice doesn't take its cues solely \n     from narrow legalisms and technicalities. The new detainee \n     bill takes precisely the opposite stance: Technicality now \n     triumphs over conscience, and even over common sense. The \n     bill introduces the possibility for a new cottage industry: \n     the jurisprudence of pain. It systematically distinguishes \n     ``severe pain''--the hallmark of torture--from (mere) \n     ``serious'' pain--the hallmark of cruel and degrading \n     treatment, usually thought to denote mistreatment short of \n     torture. But then it defines serious physical pain as \n     ``bodily injury that involves . . . extreme physical pain.'' \n     To untutored ears, ``extreme'' sounds very similar to \n     ``severe''; indeed, it sounds even worse than ``severe.'' But \n     in any case, it certainly sounds worse than ``serious.'' \n     Administration lawyers can have a field day rating painful \n     interrogation tactics on the Three Adjective Scale, leaving \n     the rest of us to shake our heads at the essential lunacy of \n     the enterprise.\n       And then there is section 8(3), which says that ``the \n     President has the authority for the United States to \n     interpret the meaning and application of the Geneva \n     Conventions.'' Section (B) makes it clear that his \n     interpretation ``shall be authoritative (as to non-grave \n     breach provisions).''\n\n[[Page S10353]]\n\n       On Aug. 1, 2006, The Onion ran a story headlined ``Bush \n     Grants Self Permission To Grant More Power to Self.'' It \n     began: ``In a decisive 1-0 decision Monday, President Bush \n     voted to grant the president the constitutional power to \n     grant himself additional powers.'' It ended thusly: \n     ``Republicans fearful that the president's new power \n     undermines their ability to grant him power have proposed a \n     new law that would allow senators to permit him to grant \n     himself power.'' How life imitates art! In the end, the three \n     courageous Republican holdouts didn't want the president \n     unilaterally trashing Geneva. Now it turns out that the \n     principle they were fighting for was simply Congress' \n     prerogative to grant him the unreviewable power to do so.\n\n  Mr. DODD. He pointed out something that needs to be made clear. He \nsaid:\n\n       Make one thing crystal clear, it's the burning desire of \n     the United States to create international law using those \n     trials. Great Britain initially opposed the Nuremberg trials \n     and urged simply shooting top Nazis out of fear, they would \n     use the trials for propaganda. Stalin favored conducting \n     trials only to establish punishments, not guilt. Like Great \n     Britain, he thought punishing the top Nazis should be a \n     political, and not a legal, decision. The trials happened as \n     they did only because the United States insisted on them for \n     purposes of establishing future law--a task that summary \n     justice at executive say-so could never have done.\n       At the London conference that wrote the Nuremberg Charter, \n     France and Russia both objected to criminalizing aggressive \n     war for anybody but the Axis countries. But Supreme Court \n     Justice Robert Jackson, the American representative insisted \n     that creating universally binding international law was the \n     prime purpose of the tribunal.\n\n  And he prevailed in that argument.\n  The history is particularly poignant to me because my father, who \nserved in this body, from whose desk I speak this morning, served as \nRobert Jackson's No. 2, as the executive trial counsel at Nuremberg. \nMr. President, the Nuremberg trials rendered their first judgment 60 \nyears ago. What an irony indeed that 60 years ago this Saturday, one of \nthe great, if not the greatest, trials of the 20th century was taking \nus to a point where we are now codifying and moving to international \nlaw. The enemies of the United States were not given the opportunity to \nwalk away from their crimes. Rather, they were given the right to face \ntheir accusers, the right to confront evidence against them, the right \nto a fair trial. Underlying that decision was the conviction that this \nNation must not tailor its most fundamental principles to the conflict \nof the moment and the recognition that if we did, we would be walking \nin the very footsteps of the enemies we despised.\n  As we approach this 60th anniversary, I think it is important to \nreflect on the implications of the past as we face new challenges, new \nenemies, and new decisions. Much as our actions in the postwar period \naffected our Nation's standing in the world, so, too, do our actions in \nthe post- 9/11 era.\n  The Armed Services Committee, and I have great respect for my friend, \nJohn Warner, decided not to rubberstamp the administration's \nlegislation. Instead they worked in a bipartisan way to craft a more \nnarrowly tailored approach. Unfortunately, the bill we are discussing \ntoday is not the one that passed out of that committee. The bill before \nus today was worked out between several of our Republican colleagues \nand the White House and does not contain the improvements over the Bush \nadministration's original proposal. I remain concerned about several \nprovisions in the pending legislation.\n  The bill would strip detainees of their habeas corpus rights. The \neloquent remarks of Arlen Specter yesterday should be read by everyone. \nThis longstanding tradition of our country that is about to be \nabandoned here will be one of the great mistakes I think history will \nrecord. There are strong beliefs among Senators on both sides that this \nprovision is not only inadvisable but flatly unconstitutional as well. \nWe must do everything in our power to protect our country from threats \nto our national security, but it is also incumbent upon every one of us \nto protect the very foundation upon which our Nation was established. \nThis legislation will not achieve those aims.\n  I support the efforts, certainly of those who are trying to improve \nthis bill, but I wish to conclude these remarks by quoting Justice \nJackson. Justice Jackson said at the conclusion of the Nuremberg \ntrials:\n\n       We must never forget that the record on which we judge \n     these defendants today--is the record on which history will \n     judge us tomorrow. To pass these defendants a poisoned \n     chalice is to put it to our lips as well.\n\n  To rubberstamp the administration's bill, in my view, would poison \none of the most fundamental principles of American democracy. I urge my \ncolleagues not to move in that direction.\n  Also, if I can, I wish to read from this article which was written by \nMr. Luban, talking about the Nuremberg trials, because it is an \nimportant moment in our history. He said:\n\n       The Nuremberg trials presupposed something about the human \n     conscience: that moral choice doesn't take its cues solely \n     from narrow legalisms and technicalities. The new detainee \n     bill takes precisely the opposite stance: technicality now \n     triumphs over conscience, and even over common sense. The \n     bill introduces the possibility for a new cottage industry: \n     the jurisprudence of pain. It systematically distinguished \n     ``severe pain''--the hallmark of torture--from mere \n     ``serious'' pain--the hallmark of cruel and degrading \n     treatment, usually thought to denote mistreatment short of \n     torture. But then it defines serious pain as ``bodily injury \n     that involves . . . extreme physical pain.'' To untutored \n     ears, ``extreme'' sounds very similar to ``severe''; indeed, \n     it sounds even worse than ``severe.'' But in any case, it \n     certainly sounds worse than ``serious.''\n\n  Administration lawyers can have a field day in the coming years \nreading painful interrogation tactics on the Three Adjective Scale, \nleaving the rest of us to shake our heads at the essential lunacy of \nthe enterprise.\n  It is about conscience. It is the fundamental principle which we \nenshrined and fought for. It was the United States of America that \nstood and insisted that our allies try to do something to avoid future \nconflicts, 60 years ago this Saturday. To watch the Senate, on the \nanniversary of the Nuremberg trials, step away from that great \ntradition, those great principles enshrined at that time, I think is \none of the saddest days I have ever seen in this Senate in my almost 30 \nyears serving in this body.\n  I hope my colleagues, with a few days to go before the election, put \nthis aside. Let's come back afterward and think more clearly. Too much \nof politics is written into these decisions. This is the United States \nof America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, will the distinguished leader allow me \nto say a few words?\n  I listened very intently. The Senator from Connecticut and I have, \nover many years, formed a very close personal and professional working \nrelationship. I know the deep, abiding respect you have for your father \nand his work, particularly at that historic moment in the history of \nworld jurisprudence, the Nuremberg trials. I regret that you perceive \nthat this bill on the floor falls short of your idea of the goals. But \nI assure you the group with which I worked did everything we could--and \nI think we have succeeded, I say in all respects--certainly with regard \nto the 1949 treaty, which, as you know, was in four parts, and the \nCommon Article 3 to all four of those treaties, preserving this \nNation's obligations under that treaty.\n  So while we have our differences, I just wish to conclude that I \nrespect you greatly for the admiration you have for your father, as do \nI have for my father, who was a doctor during that period. I thank you \nfor the opportunity to listen to you.\n  Mr. DODD. If I may respond to my colleague from Virginia, for whom I \nhave the greatest respect, it is not only my love and affection for my \nfather; more importantly, it is my love and affection for what he and a \ngroup of Americans did at a time when others said abandon the rule of \nlaw: They stood up at a time when it was tempting not to do so. World \nopinion certainly was against them in many ways. These were dreadful \nhuman beings. These people murdered millions, incinerated millions of \npeople. Yet people such as my father and Robert Jackson and others \nstood up and said: No, we are going to be different than they are. The \nrule of law is so critically important to us that we want to show the \ncivility of this great country of ours and how the last part of the \n20th century can be conducted differently. It is not just my affection \nfor my father; it is more the affection for what they did in\n\n[[Page S10354]]\n\na moment, against public opinion, to set the gold standard and set us \napart.\n  We have been known as the nation of Nuremberg. My fear is now we will \nbe known as the nation of Guantanamo, and I worry about that.\n  Mr. WARNER. We have our differences, if I may say, but that was a war \nof state-sponsored nations and aggressions, men wearing uniforms, men \nacting at the direction of recognized governments. Today's war is a \ndisparate bunch of terrorists, coming overnight, no uniforms, no \nprinciples, guided by nothing. We are doing the best we can as a \nnation, under the direction of our President, to defend ourselves.\n  Mr. DODD. If our colleague would yield, I do not disagree, but I \ndon't think there is a choice between upholding the principles of \nAmerica and fighting terrorism. Every generation of Americans will face \ntheir own threats. This is ours. Every previous generation faced \nserious threats, and they did not abandon the principles upon which \nthis country is founded. I am fearful we are going to do that today.\n  Mr. WARNER. I disagree with my friend, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. For this little conclusion, I will use leader time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that 5 minutes from Senator Rockefeller and \nSenator Kennedy--they both have a half hour on their respective \namendments--be transferred to Senators Clinton and John Kerry. They \nwill each have 5 minutes to speak. And that I have 12 minutes under my \ncontrol remaining on the bill and that time be equally divided between \nSenators Feinstein and Feingold. They will each have 6 minutes to speak \non the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill not object, but I listened carefully. You courteously advised me \nthat this request works within the confines of the standing unanimous \nconsent, is my understanding, in terms of the allocation of time.\n  Mr. REID. This adds no time to the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. I wanted to make that clear to my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object. I shall not, of course. As \na matter of clarification, there is still some specific time reserved \nto the Senator from Vermont; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 23 minutes on the bill.\n  Mr. REID. That is 23 minutes, plus the good offices of Senator \nSpecter may give the Senator additional time.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nConnecticut for one of the most passionate statements I have ever heard \non this floor--heartfelt, right on target. The distinctions made in \nthis bill which will allow statements to be admitted into evidence that \nwere produced by cruel treatment is unconscionable. It is said that, \nwell, statements made after December 30 of 2005 won't be allowed, but \nthose that are produced by cruel and inhuman treatment prior to \nDecember 30 of 2005 are OK. It is unconscionable. It is unheard of. It \nis untenable, and the Senator from Connecticut has pointed it out very \naccurately, brilliantly. I thank him for his statement.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, we will proceed on Specter's amendment. \nIn due course, I will find the time to comment on my colleague's 30 \nseconds. I want to keep this thing in an orderly progression. I would \nlike to add the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, in the unanimous \nconsent agreement to be recognized as one of the wrap-up speakers on \nthose in opposition to the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, yesterday Senator Specter argued that one \nsentence in the Hamdi opinion that refers to habeas corpus rights as \napplying to all ``individuals'' inside the United States indicates that \nalien enemy combatants have constitutional habeas rights when they are \nheld inside this country. I believe that Senator Specter is incorrect, \nfor the following reasons: (1) The Hamdi plurality repeatedly makes \nclear that ``the threshold question before us is whether the Executive \nhas the authority to detain citizens who qualify as `enemy \ncombatants.''' The plurality expressly frames the issue before it in \nterms of the rights of citizens no fewer than eight times. It is clear \nthat it is only the rights of citizens that the Hamdi plurality studied \nand ruled on. (2) Elsewhere the Hamdi plurality criticized a rule that \nwould make the government's right to hold someone as an enemy combatant \nturn on whether they are held inside or outside of the United States. \nThe plurality characterized such a rule as creating ``perverse \nincentives,'' noted that it would simply encourage the military to hold \ndetainees abroad, and concluded that it should not create a \n``determinative constitutional difference.'' The same effect would, of \ncourse, be felt if enemy soldiers' habeas rights were made turn on \nwhether they were held inside or outside of the United States. The fact \nthat the Hamdi plurality rejected this type of geographical \ngamesmanship in one context casts doubt on the theory that it endorsed \nit in a closely related context. (3) Had Hamdi extended habeas rights \nto alien enemy combatants held inside the United States, that would \nhave been a major ruling of tremendous consequence. Because courts \ntypically do not hide elephants in mouseholes, cf. Whitman v. ATA, it \nis fair to conclude that no such groundbreaking ruling is squirreled \naway in one ambiguous sentence in the Hamdi plurality opinion on the \nfloor Wednesday evening, I presented the argument that the \nconstitutional writ of habeas corpus does not extend to alien enemy \nsoldiers held during wartime. Senator Specter responded by quoting from \na passage in Justice O'Connor's plurality opinion in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, \n542 U.S. 507 (2004), that he believes establishes that alien combatants \nare entitled to habeas rights if they are held within the United \nStates. That statement, towards the beginning of section III.A of the \ncourt's opinion, is a part of a statement of general principles noting \nthat ``[a]ll agree'' that, absent suspension, habeas corpus remains \navailable to every ``individual'' within the United States. Senator\n\n[[Page S10355]]\n\nSpecter reads this statement, unadorned by any qualification as to \nwhether the individual in question is a U.S. citizen, an illegal \nimmigrant, or an alien enemy combatant, to stand for the proposition \nthat even the latter has a constitutional right to habeas corpus when \nheld within the United States.\n\n  I would suggest that this single, ambiguous statement cannot be \nconstrued to bear that much weight, for three reasons.\n  Elsewhere in its opinion, the Hamdi plurality repeatedly makes clear \nthat the only issue it is actually considering is whether a U.S. \ncitizen has habeas and due process rights as an enemy combatant. The \nplurality's emphasis on citizenship is repeatedly made clear throughout \nJustice O'Connor's opinion. For example, on page 509, in its first \nsentence, the plurality opinion says: ``we are called upon to consider \nthe legality of the detention of a United States citizen on United \nStates soil as an `enemy combatant' and to address the process that is \nconstitutionally owed to one who seeks to challenge his detention as \nsuch.'' On page 516, the plurality again notes: ``The threshold \nquestion before us is whether the Executive has the authority to detain \ncitizens who qualify as `enemy combatants.' '' On page 524, the \nplurality once again emphasizes: ``there remains the question of what \nprocess is constitutionally due to a citizen who disputes his enemy-\ncombatant status.'' On page 531: ``We reaffirm today the fundamental \nnature of a citizen's right to be free from involuntary confinement by \nhis own government without due process of law.'' On page 532: ``neither \nthe process proposed by the Government nor the process apparently \nenvisioned by the District Court below strikes the proper \nconstitutional balance when a United States citizen is detained in the \nUnited States as an enemy combatant.'' On page 533: ``We therefore hold \nthat a citizen-detainee seeking to challenge his classification as an \nenemy combatant must receive notice of the factual basis for his \nclassification, and a fair opportunity to rebut the Government's \nfactual assertion before a neutral decisionmaker.'' On page 535: \nmilitary needs ``are not so weighty as to trump a citizen's core rights \nto challenge meaningfully the Government's case and to be heard by an \nimpartial adjudicator.'' And on page 536-37: ``it would turn our system \nof checks and balances on its head to suggest that a citizen could not \nmake his way to court with a challenge to the factual basis for his \ndetention by his government.''\n  Whatever loose language may have been used in the plurality's \nstatement of general principles at the outset of its analysis, it is \napparent that the only issue that the plurality actually studied and \nintended to address is the constitutional rights of the U.S. citizen.\n  Another thing that augurs against interpreting the Hamdi plurality \nopinion to extend constitutional habeas rights to alien enemy \ncombatants whenever they are held inside the United States is that, \nelsewhere in its opinion, the plurality is quite critical of a \ngeographically-based approach to enemy combatant's rights. At page 524, \nthe plurality responds to a passage in Justice Scalia's dissent that it \nreads as arguing that the government's ability to hold someone as an \nenemy combatant turns on whether they are held inside or outside of the \nUnited States. The plurality opinion states that making the ability to \nhold someone as an enemy combatant turn on whether they are held in or \nout of the United States:\n\n     creates a perverse incentive. Military authorities faced with \n     the stark choice of submitting to the full-blown criminal \n     process or releasing a suspected enemy combatant captured on \n     the battlefield will simply keep citizen-detainees abroad. \n     Indeed, the Government transferred Hamdi from Guantanamo Bay \n     to the United States naval brig only after it learned that he \n     might be an American citizen. It is not at all clear why that \n     should make a determinative constitutional difference.\n\n  It is doubtful that this same plurality--one that sees ``perverse'' \neffects in rules that would encourage the government to hold enemy \ncombatants outside of the United States in order to avoid burdensome \nlitigation--also intended to rule that full constitutional habeas \nrights attach to alien enemy combatants as soon as they enter U.S. \nairspace.\n  Finally, Senator Specter's argument that the ambiguous reference to \n``individuals'' on page 525 of Hamdi extends habeas rights to foreign \nenemy combatants held inside U.S. territory is inconsistent with the \ncommon sense interpretive rule that one does not ``hide elephants in \nmouseholes.'' Whitman v. American Trucking Association, 531 U.S. 457, \n468 (2001). Although this rule of construction typically is applied by \nthe court to our enactments, I see no reason why its logic would not \noperate when applied in reverse, by members of this body to the court's \nopinions.\n  For the Hamdi court to have extended constitutional habeas rights to \nalien enemy soldiers held inside the United States would have been a \nmajor decision of enormous consequence to our nation's warmaking \nability. As the Hamdi plurality itself noted, ``detention to prevent a \ncombatant's return to the battlefield is a fundamental incident of \nwaging war.'' As I noted yesterday, during World War II the United \nStates detained over 425,000 enemy war prisoners inside the United \nStates. Yet as Rear Admiral Hutson--no supporter of section 7 of the \nMCA--noted in his testimony at Monday's Judiciary Committee hearing, \naside from one petition filed by an American of Italian descent, no \nhabeas petitions challenging detention were filed by any of these World \nWar II enemy combatants. It is simply inconceivable that all of the \n425,000 enemy combatants held inside the United States during this \nperiod could have been allowed to sue our government in our courts to \nchallenge their detention. And were their right to do so made to turn \non whether they were held inside or outside of the United States, our \nArmed Forces inevitably would have been forced to find some \naccommodations for them in foreign territory. And since holding enemy \ncombatants near the war zone is neither practical nor safe, our \nnation's whole ability to fight a war would be made to turn on whether \nwe could find some third country where we could hold enemy war \nprisoners. I would submit that this elephant of a result simply will \nnot fit in the small space for it created by the one ambiguous passage \nin the Hamdi plurality opinion.\n  For these three reasons, I believe that Senator Specter is incorrect \nto interpret the Hamdi plurality opinion to extend constitutional \nhabeas corpus rights to alien enemy combatants held inside the United \nStates.\n  Just to conclude by summarizing the point as follows: On eight \nseparate times, the plurality opinion in Hamdi refers to the rights of \ncitizens. That is the question before the court. This is what it rules \non. This is our holding. At no point does it extend it to citizens. \nThere is one sentence rather loosely framed that refers to individuals. \nHad the courts in that decision intended to apply the habeas right to \nall individuals in the United States rather than citizens, it would \nmost assuredly have said so.\n  I don't think, with all due respect to my great friend, the chairman \nof the committee, that relying on that one loose word in one sentence \nof the opinion overrides all of the other reasoning, all of the other \nclear statements, and the obvious intent of the opinion to relate it to \ncitizens only. With all due respect, I disagree with the reading of the \ncase and conclude that there is nothing wrong with this legislation \nbefore us limiting the rights of habeas to those who are citizens and \nnot extending it to alien enemy combatants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, by way of brief reply to the comments \nof the Senator from Arizona, he argues that the Hamdi decision does not \napply to aliens but only to citizens, trying to draw some inferences. \nBut that does not stand up in the face of explicit language by Justice \nO'Connor to this effect:\n\n       All agree that absent suspension the writ of habeas corpus \n     remains available to every individual detained in the United \n     States.\n\n  The Senator from Arizona can argue all he wants about inferences, but \nthat hardly stands up to an explicit statement on individuals. And \nJustice O'Connor knows the difference between referring to an \nindividual or referring to a citizen or referring to an alien. And \n``individuals'' covers both citizens and aliens.\n  Following the reference to individuals is the citation of the \nconstitutional provision that you can't suspend\n\n[[Page S10356]]\n\nhabeas corpus except in time of rebellion or invasion.\n  Buttressing my argument is the Rasul v. Bush case where it applied \nspecifically to aliens; and it is true that the consideration was under \nthe statute section 2241. There the Court says that section 2241 \n``draws no distinction between Americans and aliens held in Federal \ncustody.''\n  That again buttresses the argument I have made in two respects. \nFirst, Rasul specifically grants habeas corpus, albeit statutory, to \naliens and says there is no distinction. So on the face of the explicit \nlanguage of the Supreme Court of the United States there is a \nconstitutional requirement, and it is fundamental that Congress cannot \nlegislate in contradiction to a constitutional interpretation of the \nSupreme Court. That requires a constitutional amendment--not \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, how much time remains under my control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Thank you, Madam President. If I require further time \nbeyond 10 minutes I will take time from that reserved to the Senator \nfrom Vermont.\n  Let's understand exactly what we are talking about here. There are \napproximately 12 million lawful permanent residents in the United \nStates today. Some came here initially the way my grandparents did or \nmy wife's parents did. These are people who work for American firms, \nthey raise American kids, they pay American taxes.\n  Section 7 of the bill before us represents a choice about how to \ntreat them. This bill could have been restricted to traditional notions \nof enemy combatants--foreign fighters captured on the battlefield--but \nthe drafters of this bill chose not to do so.\n  Let's be very clear. Once we get past all of the sloganeering, all \nthe fundraising letters, all the sound bites, all the short headlines \nin the paper, let's be clear about the choice the bill makes. Let's be \nabsolutely clear about what it says to lawful permanent residents of \nthe United States. Then let's decide if it is the right message to send \nthem and if it is really the face of America that we want to show.\n  Take an example. Imagine you are a law-abiding, lawful, permanent \nresident, and in your spare time you do charitable fundraising for \ninternational relief agencies to lend a helping hand in disasters. You \nsend money abroad to those in need. You are selective in the charities \nyou support, but you do not discriminate on the grounds of religion. \nThen one day there is a knock on your door. The Government thinks that \nthe Muslim charity you sent money to may be funneling money to \nterrorists and thinks you may be involved. And perhaps an overzealous \nneighbor who saw a group of Muslims come to your House has reported \n``suspicious behavior.'' You are brought in for questioning.\n  Initially, you are not very worried. After all, this is America. You \nare innocent, and you have faith in American justice. You know your \nrights, and you say: I would like to talk to a lawyer. But no lawyer \ncomes. Once again, since you know your rights, you refuse to answer any \nfurther questions. Then the interrogators get angry. Then comes \nsolitary confinement, then fierce dogs, then freezing cold that induces \nhypothermia, then waterboarding, then threats of being sent to a \ncountry where you know you will be tortured, then Guantanamo. And then \nnothing, for years, for decades, for the rest of your life.\n  That may sound like an experience from some oppressive and \nauthoritarian regime, something that may have happened under the \nTaliban, something that Saddam Hussein might have ordered or something \nout of Kafka. There is a reason why that does not and cannot happen in \nAmerica. It is because we have a protection called habeas corpus, or if \nyou do not like the Latin phrase by which it has been known throughout \nour history, call it access to the independent Federal courts to review \nthe authority and the legality by which the Government has taken and is \nholding someone in custody. It is a fundamental protection. It is woven \ninto the fabric of our Nation.\n  Habeas corpus provides a remedy against arbitrary detentions and \nconstitutional violations. It guarantees an opportunity to go to court, \nwith the aid of a lawyer, to prove that, yes, you are innocent.\n  As Justice Scalia stated in the Hamdi case:\n\n       The very core of liberty secured by the Anglo-Saxon system \n     of separated powers has been freedom from indefinite \n     imprisonment at the will of the Executive.\n\n  Of course, the remedy that secures that most basic freedom is habeas \ncorpus.\n  Habeas corpus does not give you any new rights, it just guarantees \nyou have a chance to ask for your basic freedom.\n  If we pass this bill today, that will be gone for the 12 million \nlawful, permanent residents who live and work among us, to say nothing \nof the millions of other legal immigrants and visitors who we welcome \nto our shores each year. That will be gone for another estimated 11 \nmillion immigrants the Senate has been working to bring out of the \nshadows with comprehensive immigration reform.\n\n  The bill before the Senate would not merely suspend the great writ, \nthe great writ of habeas corpus, it would eliminate it permanently. We \ndo not have to worry about nuances, such as how long it will be \nsuspended. It is gone. Gone.\n  Over 200 years of jurisprudence in this country, and following an \nhour of debate, we get rid of it. My God, have any Members of this \nSenate gone back and read their oath of office upholding the \nConstitution? This cuts off all habeas petitions, not just those \nfounded on relatively technical claims but those founded on claims of \ncomplete innocence.\n  We hundred Members in the Senate, we privileged men and women, are \nsupposed to be the conscience of the Nation. We are about to put the \ndarkest blot possible on this Nation's conscience. It would not be \nlimited to enemy combatants in the traditional sense of foreign \nfighters captured in the battlefield, but it would apply to any alien \npicked up anywhere in the world and suspected of possibly supporting \nenemies of the United States.\n  We do not need this bill for those truly captured on the battlefield \nwho have taken up arms against the United States. That is why the \ndefinition of enemy combatant has been so expansively redefined behind \nclosed doors in the dark of night.\n  This bill is designed instead to sweep others into the net. It would \nnot even require an administrative determination that the Government's \nsuspicions have a reasonable basis in fact. By its plain language, it \nwould deny all access to the courts to any alien awaiting--what a \nbureaucratic term, to determine your basic human rights, ``any alien \nawaiting''--a Government determination as to whether the alien is an \nenemy combatant. The Government would be free to delay as long as it \nliked--for years, for decades, for the length of the conflict which is \nso undefined and may last for generations.\n  One need only look at Guantanamo. Even our own Government says a \nnumber of people are in there by mistake, but we will not get around to \nmaking that determination. Maybe in 5 years, maybe 10, maybe 20, maybe \n30. And we wonder why some of our closest allies ask us, what in \nheaven's name has happened to the conscience and moral compass of this \ngreat Nation? Are we so terrified of some terrorists around this \ncountry that we will run scared and hide? Is that what we will do, tear \ndown all the structures of liberty in this country because we are so \nfrightened?\n  It brings to mind that famous passage in ``A Man for All Seasons.'' \nThomas More is talking to his protege, William Roper, and says \nsomething to the effect that England is planted thick like a forest \nwith laws. He said, Would you cut down those laws to get after the \ndevil? And Roper said, of course I would cut down all the laws in \nEngland to get the devil. And then More said, Oh, and when the last law \nwas down and the devil turned on you, what will protect you?\n\n[[Page S10357]]\n\n  This legislation is cutting down laws that protect all 100 of us, and \nnow almost 300 million Americans. It is amazing the Senate would be \ntalking about doing something such as this, especially after the \nexample of Guantanamo. We can pick up people intentionally or by \nmistake and hold them forever.\n  How many speeches have I heard in my 32 years in the Senate during \nthe cold war and after, criticizing totalitarian governments that do \nthings such as that? And we can stand here proudly and say it would \nnever happen in America; this would never happen in America because we \nhave rights, we have habeas corpus, and people are protected.\n  I am not here speculating about what the bill says. This is not a \ncritic's characterization of the bill. It is what the bill plainly \nsays, on its face. It is what the Bush-Cheney administration is \ndemanding. It is what any Member who votes against the Specter-Leahy \namendment and for the bill today is going to be endorsing.\n\n  The habeas stripping provisions in the bill go far beyond what \nCongress did in the Detainee Treatment Act in three respects. First, as \nthe Supreme Court pointed out in Hamdan, the DTA removed habeas \njurisdiction only prospectively, for future cases. This new bill strips \nhabeas jurisdiction retroactively, even for pending cases. This is an \nextraordinary action that runs counter to long-held U.S. policies \ndisfavoring retroactive legislation.\n  Second, the DTA applied only to detainees at Guantanamo. This new \nlegislation goes far beyond Guantanamo and strips the right to habeas \nof any alien living in the United States if the alien has been \ndetermined an enemy combatant, or even if he is awaiting a \ndetermination--and that wait can take years and years and years. Then, \n20 years later, you can say: We made a mistake. Tough. It allows \nholding an alien, any alien, forever, without the right of habeas \ncorpus, while the Government makes up its mind as to whether he is an \nenemy combatant.\n  And third, the impact of those provisions is extended by the new \ndefinition of enemy combatant proposed in the current bill. The bill \nextends the definition to include persons who supported hostilities \nagainst the United States, even if they did not engage in armed \nconflict against the United States or its allies. That, again, is an \nextraordinary extension of existing laws.\n  If we vote today to abolish rights of access to the justice system to \nany alien detainee who is suspected--not determined, not even charged; \nthese people are not even charged, just suspected--of assisting \nterrorists, that will do by the back door what cannot be done up front. \nThat will remove the checks in our legal system that provide against \narbitrarily detaining people for life without charge. It will remove \nthe mechanism the Constitution provides to stop the Government from \noverreaching and lawlessness.\n  This is so wrong. It grieves me, after three decades in this Senate, \nto stand here knowing we are thinking of doing this. It is so wrong. It \nis unconstitutional. It is un-American. It is designed to ensure the \nBush-Cheney administration will never again be embarrassed by a U.S. \nSupreme Court decision reviewing its unlawful abuses of power. The \nSupreme Court said, you abused your power. And they said, we will fix \nthat. We have a rubberstamp Congress that will set that aside and give \nus power that nobody--no king or anyone else setting foot in this \nland--had ever thought of having.\n  In fact, the irony is this conservative Supreme Court--seven out of \nnine members are Republicans--has been the only check on the Bush-\nCheney administration because Congress has not had the courage to do \nthat. Congress has not had the courage to uphold its own oath of \noffice.\n  With this bill, the Congress will have completed the job of \neviscerating its role as a check and balance on the administration. The \nSenate has turned its back on the Warner-Levin bill, a bipartisan bill \nreported by the Committee on Armed Services, so it can jam through the \nBush-Cheney bill. This bill gives up the ghost. It is not a check on \nthe administration but a voucher for future wrongdoing.\n  Abolishing habeas corpus for anyone the Government thinks might have \nassisted enemies of the United States is unnecessary and morally wrong, \na betrayal of the most basic values of freedom for which America \nstands. It makes a mockery of the Bush-Cheney administration's lofty \nrhetoric about exporting freedom across the globe. We can export \nfreedom across the globe, but we will cut it out in our own country. \nWhat hypocrisy.\n  I read yesterday from former Secretary of State Colin Powell's letter \nin which he voiced concern about our moral authority in the war against \nterrorism. The general and former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and \nformer Secretary of State was right.\n  Admiral John Hutson testified before the Judiciary Committee that \nstripping the courts of habeas corpus jurisdiction was inconsistent \nwith our history and our tradition. The admiral concluded:\n\n       We don't need to do this. America is too strong.\n\n  When we do this, America will not be a stronger nation. America will \nbe a weaker nation. We will be weaker because we turned our back on our \nConstitution. We turned our back on our rights. We turned our back on \nour history.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nmore than 60 law school deans and professors who state that the \nCongress would gravely disserve our global reputation by doing this.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           September 27, 2006.\n\n     To United States Senators and Members of Congress.\n       Dear Senators and Representatives: We, the undersigned law \n     deans and professors, write in our individual capacity to \n     express our deep concern about two bills that are rapidly \n     moving through Congress. These bills, the Military \n     Commissions Act and the National Security Surveillance Act, \n     would make the indefinite detention of those labeled enemy \n     combatants and the executive's program of domestic \n     surveillance effectively unreviewable by any independent \n     judge sitting in public session. While different in \n     character, both bills unwisely contract the jurisdiction of \n     courts and deprive them of the ability to decide critical \n     issues that must be subject to judicial review in any free \n     and democratic society.\n       Although the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (S. 3929/S. \n     3930) was drafted to improve and codify military commission \n     procedures following the Supreme Court's June 2006 decision \n     in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, it summarily eliminates the right of \n     habeas corpus for those detained by the U.S. government who \n     have been or may be deemed to be enemy combatants: Detainees \n     will have no ability to challenge the conditions of their \n     detention in court unless and until the administration \n     decides to try them before a military commission. Those who \n     are not tried will have no recourse to any independent court \n     at any time. Enacting this provision into law would be a \n     grievous error. As several witnesses testified before the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday, Article I, Section 9 of \n     the Constitution specifies that ``[t]he Privilege of the Writ \n     of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases \n     of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it,'' \n     conditions that are plainly not satisfied here.\n       Similarly, the National Security Surveillance Act of 2006 \n     (S. 3876) would strip courts of jurisdiction over pending \n     cases challenging the legality of the administration's \n     domestic spying program and would transfer these cases to the \n     court established by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Act of 1978 (FISA). The transfer of these cases to a secret \n     court that issues secret decisions would shield the \n     administration's electronic surveillance program from \n     effective and transparent judicial scrutiny.\n       These bills exhibit a profound and unwarranted distrust of \n     the judiciary. The historic role of the courts is to ensure \n     that the legislature promulgates and the executive faithfully \n     executes the law of the land with due respect for the rights \n     of even the most despised. Any protections embodied in these \n     bills would be rendered worthless unless the courts can hold \n     the executive accountable to enacted law. Moreover, the bills \n     ignore a central teaching of the Supreme Court's decision in \n     Hamdan v. Rumsfeld: the importance of shared institutional \n     powers and checks and balances in crafting lawful and \n     sustainable responses to the war on terror. Absent effective \n     judicial review, there will be no way to enforce any of the \n     limitations in either bill that Congress is currently seeking \n     to place upon the executive's claimed power.\n       We recognize the need to prevent and punish crimes of \n     terrorism and to investigate and prosecute such crimes. But \n     depriving our courts of jurisdiction to determine whether the \n     executive has acted properly when it detains individuals in \n     this effort would endanger the rights of our own soldiers and \n     nationals abroad, by limiting our ability to demand\n\n[[Page S10358]]\n\n     that they be provided the protections that we deny to others. \n     Eliminating effective judicial review of executive acts as \n     significant as detention and domestic surveillance cannot be \n     squared with the principles of transparency and rule of law \n     on which our constitutional democracy rests.\n       The Congress would gravely disserve our global reputation \n     as a law-abiding country by enacting bills that seek to \n     combat terrorism by stripping judicial review. We \n     respectfully urge you to amend the judicial review provisions \n     of the Military Commissions Act and the National Security \n     Surveillance Act to ensure that the rights granted by those \n     bills will be enforceable and reviewable in a court of law.\n           Sincerely,\n       James J. Alfini, President and Dean, South Texas College of \n     Law.\n       Michelle J. Anderson, Dean, CUNY School of Law.\n       Katharine T. Bartlett, Dean and A.

Kenneth Starr, the former independent counsel and \nSolicitor General for the first President Bush, wrote that the \nConstitution's conditions for suspending habeas corpus have not been \nmet and that doing it would be problematic.\n  The post-9/11 world requires us to make adjustments. In the original \nPATRIOT Act five years ago, we made adjustments to accommodate the \nneeds of the Executive, and more recently, we sought to fine-tune those \nadjustments. I think some of those adjustments sacrificed civil \nliberties unnecessarily, but I also believe that many provisions in the \nPATRIOT Act were appropriate. I wrote many of the provisions of the \nPATRIOT Act, and I voted for it.\n  This bill is of an entirely different nature. The PATRIOT Act took a \ncautious approach to civil liberties and while it may have gone too far \nin some areas, this bill goes so much further than that. It takes an \nentirely dismissive and cavalier approach to basic human rights and to \nour Constitution.\n  In the aftermath of 9/11, Congress provided in section 412 of the \nPATRIOT Act that an alien may be held without charge if, and only if, \nthe Attorney General certifies that he is a terrorist or that he is \nengaged in activity that endangers the national security. He may be \nheld for seven days, after which he must be placed in removal \nproceedings, charged with a crime, or released. There is judicial \nreview through habeas corpus proceedings, with appeal to the D.C. \nCircuit.\n  Compare that to section 7 of the current bill. The current bill does \nnot provide for judicial review. It would preclude it. It does not \nrequire a certification by the Attorney General that the alien is a \nterrorist. It would apply if the alien was ``awaiting'' a Government \ndetermination whether the alien is an ``enemy combatant.'' And it is \nnot limited to seven days. It would enable the Government to detain an \nalien for life without any recourse whatsoever to justice.\n  What has changed in the past 5 years that justifies not merely \nsuspending but abolishing the writ of habeas corpus for a broad \ncategory of people who have not been found guilty, who have not even \nbeen charged with any crime? What has turned us? What has made us so \nfrightened as a nation that now the United States will say, we can pick \nup somebody on suspicion, hold them forever, they have no right to even \nask why they are being held, and besides that, we will not even charge \nthem with anything, we will just hold them? What has changed in the \nlast 5 years?\n  Is our Government is so weak or so inept and our people so terrified \nthat we have to do what no bomb or attack could ever do, and that is \ntake away\n\n[[Page S10359]]\n\nthe very freedoms that define America? We fought two world wars, we \nfought a civil war, we fought a revolutionary war, all these wars to \nprotect those rights.\n  And now, think of those people who have given their lives, who fought \nso hard to protect those rights. What do we do? We sit here, privileged \npeople of the Senate, and we turn our backs on that. We throw away \nthose rights.\n  Why would we allow the terrorists to win by doing to ourselves what \nthey could never do and abandoning the principles for which so many \nAmericans today and throughout our history have fought and sacrificed? \nWhat has happened that the Senate is willing to turn America from a \nbastion of freedom into a cauldron of suspicion, ruled by a government \nof unchecked power?\n  Under the Constitution, a suspension of the writ may only be \njustified during an invasion or a rebellion, when the public safety \ndemands it. Six weeks after the deadliest attack on American soil in \nour history, the Congress that passed the PATRIOT Act rightly concluded \nthat a suspension of the writ would not be justified.\n  But now, 6 weeks before a midterm election, as the fundraising \nletters are running around, the Bush-Cheney administration and its \nsupplicants in Congress deem a complete abolition of the writ the \nhighest priority, a priority so urgent that we are allowed no time to \nproperly review, debate, and amend a bill we first saw in its current \nbill less than 72 hours ago. There must be a lot of fundraising letters \ngoing out.\n  Notwithstanding the harm the administration has done to national \nsecurity--first by missing their chance to stop September 11 and then \nwith their mismanaged misadventures in Iraq--there is no new national \nsecurity crisis. Apparently, there is only a Republican political \ncrisis. And that, as we know, is why this un-American, unconstitutional \nlegislation is before us today.\n  We have a profoundly important and dangerous choice to make today. \nThe danger is not that we adopt a pre-9/11 mentality. We adopted a \npost-9/11 mentality in the PATRIOT Act when we declined to suspend the \nwrit, and we can do so again today.\n\n  The danger, as Senator Feingold has stated in a different context, is \nthat we adopt a pre-1776 mentality, one that dismisses the Constitution \non which our American freedoms are founded.\n  Actually, it is worse than that. Habeas corpus was the most basic \nprotection of freedom that Englishmen secured from their King in the \nMagna Carta. The mentality adopted by this bill, in abolishing habeas \ncorpus for a broad swath of people, is not a pre-9/11 mentality, it is \na pre-1215--that is the year, 1215--mentality, a mentality we did away \nwith in the Magna Carta and our own Constitution.\n  Every one of us has sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution. In \norder to uphold that oath, I believe we have a duty to vote for this \namendment--\nthe Specter-Leahy amendment--and against this irresponsible and \nflagrantly unconstitutional bill. That is what I will do.\n  The Senator from Vermont answers to the Constitution and to his \nconscience. I do not answer to political pressure.\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, we have colleagues on this side who are \nready to proceed. Now, there is a great deal of time left on the other \nside, but in order of preference, I say to Senator Sessions, if you are \nready to proceed.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I will be pleased to do so.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, might I inquire of the amount of time \nunder my control for those in opposition to the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Warner controls 11 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Eleven minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Specter controls 20 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, if the chairman would approve, I would \nask for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. And following that, Senator Cornyn for such time as \nhe may need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, habeas corpus--the right to have your \ncomplaints heard while in custody--is a part of our Constitution. But \nwe have to remember habeas corpus did not mean everything in the whole \nworld when it was adopted. So what did ``habeas'' mean? What does it \nmean today and at the time it was adopted? It was never, ever, ever, \never intended or imagined that during the War of 1812, if British \nsoldiers were captured burning the Capitol of the United States--as \nthey did--that they would have been given habeas corpus rights. It was \nnever thought to be. Habeas corpus was applied to citizens, really, at \nthat time. I believe that is so plain as to be without dispute.\n  So to say: Habeas corpus, what does it mean? What did those words \nmean when the people ratified it? They did not intend to provide it to \nthose who were attacking the United States of America. We provide \nspecial protections for prisoners of war who lawfully conduct a war \nthat might be against the United States. We give them great \nprotections. But unlawful combatants, the kind we are dealing with \ntoday, have never been given the full protections of the Geneva \nConventions.\n  Second, my time is limited, and I have been so impressed with the \ndebate that has gone on with Senators Kyl and Cornyn and Graham, and I \nassociate myself generally with those remarks, but I want to recall \nthat in a spate of an effort to appease critics and those who had \n``vague concerns,'' not too many years ago, this Congress passed \nlegislation that said that CIA-gathered information could not be shared \nwith the FBI. We passed a law in this Congress to appease the left in \nAmerica, the critics of our efforts against communism, primarily. And \nwe have put a wall between the CIA and FBI.\n  So that was politically good. Everybody must have been happy about \nthat. I was not in the Senate then. Then they complained that the CIA \nwas out talking with people who had criminal records who may have been \ninvolved in violence, and this was somehow making our CIA complicitous \nin dealing with dangerous people, and we banned that. We passed a \nstatute that eliminated that. And everybody felt real good that we had \ndone something special.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. After 9/11, we realized both of those were errors of \nthe heart perhaps, but of the brain. And so what happened? We reversed \nboth of them. We reversed them both. And we need to be sure that the \nlegislation we are dealing with today does not create a long-term \nbattle with the courts over everybody who is being detained. That is a \nfunction of the military and the executive branch to conduct a war.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I understand I have 6 minutes on the \nbill in general.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I oppose the Military Commissions Act.\n  Let me be clear: I welcomed efforts to bring terrorists to justice. \nActually, it is about time. This administration has too long been \ndistracted by the war in Iraq from the fight against al-Qaida. We need \na renewed focus on the terrorist networks that present the greatest \nthreat to this country.\n  We would not be where we are today, 5 years after September 11, with \nnot a single Guantanamo Bay detainee having been brought to trial, if \nthe President had come to Congress in the first place, rather than \nunilaterally creating military commissions that did not comply with the \nlaw. The Hamdan decision was a historic rebuke to an administration \nthat has acted for years as if it is above the law.\n  I have hoped that we would take this opportunity to pass legislation \nthat allows us to proceed in accordance with our laws and our values. \nThat is what separates America from our enemies. These trials, \nconducted appropriately, have the potential to demonstrate to\n\n[[Page S10360]]\n\nthe world that our democratic constitutional system of government is \nour greatest strength in fighting those who attack us.\n  That is why I am saddened I must oppose this legislation because the \ntrials conducted under this legislation may send a very different \nsignal to the world, one that I fear will put our troops and personnel \nin jeopardy both now and in future conflicts. To take just a few \nexamples, this legislation would permit an individual to be convicted \non the basis of coerced testimony and hearsay, would not allow full \njudicial review of the conviction, and yet would allow someone \nconvicted under these rules to be put to death. That is just simply \nunacceptable.\n  Not only that, this legislation would deny detainees at Guantanamo \nBay and elsewhere--people who have been held for years but have not \nbeen tried or even charged with any crime--the ability to challenge \ntheir detention in court. The legislation before us is better than that \noriginally proposed by the President, which would have largely codified \nthe procedures the Supreme Court has already rejected. And that is \nthanks to the efforts of some of my Republican colleagues, for whom I \nhave great respect and admiration. But this bill remains deeply flawed, \nand I cannot support it.\n  One of the most disturbing provisions of this bill eliminates the \nright of habeas corpus for those detained as enemy combatants. I \nsupport an amendment by Senator Specter to strike that provision from \nthe bill.\n  Habeas corpus is a fundamental recognition that in America the \nGovernment does not have the power to detain people indefinitely and \narbitrarily. And in America, the courts must have the power to review \nthe legality of executive detention decisions.\n  This bill would fundamentally alter that historical equation. Faced \nwith an executive branch that has detained hundreds of people without \ntrial for years now, it would eliminate the right of habeas corpus.\n  Under this legislation, some individuals, at the designation of the \nexecutive branch alone, could be picked up, even in the United States, \nand held indefinitely without trial and without any access whatsoever \nto the courts. They would not be able to call upon the laws of our \ngreat Nation to challenge their detention because they would have been \nput outside the reach of the law.\n  Some have suggested that terrorists who take up arms against this \ncountry should not be allowed to challenge their detention in court. \nBut that argument is circular. The writ of habeas allows those who \nmight be mistakenly detained to challenge their detention in court \nbefore a neutral decisionmaker. The alternative is to allow people to \nbe detained indefinitely with no ability to argue that they are not, in \nfact--that they are not, in fact--enemy combatants.\n  There is another reason we must not deprive detainees of habeas \ncorpus, and that is the fact that the American system of government is \nsupposed to set an example for the world as a beacon of democracy.\n  A group of retired diplomats sent a very moving letter to explain \ntheir concerns about this habeas-stripping provision. Here is what they \nsaid:\n\n       To proclaim democratic government to the rest of the world \n     as the supreme form of government at the very moment we \n     eliminate the most important avenue of relief from arbitrary \n     governmental detention will not serve our interests in the \n     larger world.\n\n  Many dedicated patriotic Americans share these grave reservations \nabout this particular provision of this bill. Unfortunately, the \nsuspension of the Great Writ is not the only problem with this \nlegislation. Unfortunately, I do not have time to discuss them all.\n  But the bill also appears to permit individuals to be convicted, and \neven sentenced to death, on the basis of coerced testimony. According \nto the legislation, statements obtained through cruel, inhuman, or \ndegrading treatment, as long as it was obtained prior to December 2005, \nwhen the McCain amendment became law, would apparently be admissible in \nmany instances in these military commissions.\n  Now, it is true that the bill would require the commission to find \nthese statements have sufficient and probative value. But why would we \ngo down this road of trying to convict people based on statements \nobtained through cruel, inhuman, or degrading interrogation techniques? \nEither we are a nation that stands against this type of cruelty and for \nthe rule of law or we are not. We cannot have it both ways.\n  In closing, let me do something I do not do very often, and that is \nquote my former colleague, John Ashcroft. According to the New York \nTimes, in a private meeting of high-level officials in 2003 about the \nmilitary commission structure, then-Attorney General Ashcroft \nreportedly said:\n\n       Timothy McVeigh was one of the worst killers in U.S. \n     history. But at least we had fair procedures for him.\n\n  How sad that this Congress would seek to pass legislation about which \nthe same cannot be said.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Specter's amendment to \nstrike the habeas provision from this bill.\n  At its most fundamental, the writ of habeas corpus protects against \nabuse of government power. It ensures that individuals detained by the \ngovernment without trial have a method to challenge their detention. \nHabeas corpus is a fundamental recognition that in America, the \ngovernment does not have the power to detain people indefinitely and \narbitrarily. And that in America, the courts must have the power to \nreview the legality of executive detention decisions.\n  It goes without saying that this is not a new concept. Habeas corpus \nis a longstanding vital part of our American tradition, and is \nenshrined in the U.S. Constitution, article 1, section 9, where it \nstates:\n\n       The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be \n     suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the \n     public Safety may require it.\n\n  The Founders recognized the importance of this right. Alexander \nHamilton in Federalist Paper No. 84 explained the importance of habeas \ncorpus, and its centrality to the American system of government and the \nconcept of personal liberty. He quoted William Blackstone, who warned \nagainst the ``dangerous engine of arbitrary government'' that could \nresult from unchallengeable confinement, and the ``bulwark'' of habeas \ncorpus against this abuse of government power.\n  As a group of retired judges wrote to Congress, habeas corpus \n``safeguards the most hallowed judicial role in our constitutional \ndemocracy--ensuring that no man is imprisoned unlawfully.''\n  This bill would fundamentally alter that historical equation. Faced \nwith an administration that has detained hundreds of people without \ntrial for years now, it would eliminate the right of habeas corpus for \nanyone the executive branch labels an alien ``enemy combatant.''\n  That's right. It would eliminate the right of habeas corpus for any \nalien detained by the United States, anywhere in the world, and \ndesignated by the government as an enemy combatant. And it would do so \nin the face of years of abuses of power that--thus far--have been \nreined in primarily through habeas corpus challenges in our Federal \ncourts.\n  Let me be clear about what it does. Under this legislation, some \nindividuals, at the designation of the executive branch alone, could be \npicked up, even in the United States, and held indefinitely without \ntrial and without any access whatsoever to the courts. They would not \nbe able to call upon the laws of our great Nation to challenge their \ndetention because they would have been put outside the reach of the \nlaw.\n  That is unacceptable, and it almost surely violates our Constitution. \nThe rule of law is something deeper and more profound than the \ncollection of laws that we have on paper. It is a principle that \nundergirds our entire society, and that has been central to our nation \nsince its very founding. As Thomas Paine explained at the time of our \ncountry's birth in 1776, the rule of law is that principle, that \nparamount commitment, ``that in America, the law is king. . . . and \nthere ought to be no other.'' The rule of law tells us that no man is \nabove the law--and as an extension of that principle--that no executive \nwill be able to act unchecked by our legal system.\n  Yet by stripping the habeas corpus rights of any individual who the \nexecutive branch decides to designate as an enemy combatant, that is \nprecisely\n\n[[Page S10361]]\n\nwhere we end up--with an executive branch subject to no external check \nwhatsoever. With an executive branch that is king.\n  Now, it may well be that this provision will be found \nunconstitutional as an illegal suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. \nBut that determination will take years of protracted litigation. And \nfor what? The President has been urging Congress to pass legislation so \nthat Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of 9-11, and other \n``high value'' al-Qaida detainees can be tried. This bill is supposed \nto create a framework for prosecuting unlawful enemy combatants for war \ncrimes that the Supreme Court can accept following the decision this \nsummer in the Hamdan case. There is absolutely no reason why we need to \nrestrict judicial review of the detention of individuals who have not \nbeen charged with any crime.\n  That raises another point. People who are actually subject to trial \nby military commission will at least be able to argue their innocence \nbefore some tribunal, even if I have grave concerns about how those \nmilitary commissions would proceed under this legislation. But people \nwho have not been charged with any crime will have no guaranteed venue \nin which to proclaim and prove their innocence. As three retired \ngenerals and admirals explained in a letter to Congress:\n\n       The effect would be to give greater protections to the \n     likes of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed than to the vast majority of \n     the Guantanamo detainees.\n\n  How does this make any sense? Why would we turn our back on hundreds \nof years of history and our Nation's commitment to liberty?\n  We have already, in the Detainee Treatment Act, said that no new \nhabeas challenges can be brought by detainees at Guantanamo Bay. The \nSupreme Court found in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld that the Detainee Treatment \nAct did not apply to Hamdan's pending habeas petition, and went forward \nwith considering his argument that the President's military commission \nstructure was illegal. And I would think that we should all be pleased \nthat it did so, because otherwise we would have had to wait for several \nmore years for Hamdan's trial to be completed before he would have had \nany chance to challenge the President's military commission system in \ncourt. The Supreme Court's decision striking down those commissions \nwould have occurred several years later. And we would be right back \nwhere we are now, but with several more years of delay.\n  There is another reason why we must not deprive detainees of habeas \ncorpus, and that is the fact that the American system of government is \nsupposed to set an example for the world, as a beacon of democracy. And \nthis provision will only serve to harm others' perception of our system \nof government.\n  A group of retired diplomats sent a very moving letter explaining \ntheir concerns about this habeas-stripping provision. Here is what they \nsaid:\n\n       To proclaim democratic government to the rest of the world \n     as the supreme form of government at the very moment we \n     eliminate the most important avenue of relief from arbitrary \n     governmental detention will not serve our interests in the \n     larger world.\n\n  They went on to explain further:\n\n       The perception of hypocrisy on our part--a sense that we \n     demand of others a behavioral ethic we ourselves may advocate \n     but fail to observe--is an acid which can overwhelm our \n     diplomacy, no matter how well intended and generous.\n\n  That is a direct quote.\n  Let's not go down this road. Let's remove this provision from the \nbill.\n  As is already clear, I'm not the only one who has serious concerns \nabout this provision. There is bipartisan support for this amendment. \nAnd Congress has received numerous letters objecting to the habeas \nprovision, including from Kenneth Starr; a group of former diplomats; \ntwo different groups of law professors; a group of retired judges; and \na group of retired generals. Many, many dedicated patriotic Americans \nhave grave reservations about this particular provision of the bill.\n  They have reservations not because they sympathize with suspected \nterrorists. Not because they are soft on national security. Not because \nthey don't understand the threat we face. No. They, and we in the \nSenate who support this amendment, are concerned about this provision \nbecause we care about the Constitution, because we care about the image \nthat America presents to the world as we fight the terrorists. Because \nwe know that the writ of habeas corpus provides one of the most \nsignificant protections of human freedom against arbitrary government \naction ever created. If we sacrifice it here, we will head down a road \nthat history will judge harshly and our descendants will regret.\n  Let me close with something that this group of retired judges said.\n\n       For two hundred years, the federal judiciary has maintained \n     Chief Justice Marshall's solemn admonition that ours is a \n     government of laws, and not of men. The proposed legislation \n     imperils this proud history by abandoning the Great Writ. . . \n     .\n\n  Mr. President, we must not imperil our proud history. We must not \nabandon the Great Writ. We must not jeopardize our Nation's proud \ntraditions and principles by suspending the writ of habeas corpus, and \npermitting our government to pick people up off the street, even in \nU.S. cities, and detain them indefinitely without court review. That is \nnot what America is about.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 minutes \nfrom our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. First of all, Madam President, I would like to point out \nthere are many myths about this legislation. We need to get to the \nfacts and get to the truth so people can understand what the choices \nare.\n  Our distinguished colleague from Wisconsin, in my view, also \nperpetrated another myth by saying this war is all about Iraq, when, in \nfact, the new leader of al-Qaida in Iraq, succeeding al-Zarqawi, just \nreported in an Associated Press story that 4,000 al-Qaida foreign \nfighters have been killed in Iraq due to the war effort there. But this \nis a global war, and it requires a uniformed treatment of the \nterrorists in a way that reflects our values but also the fact that we \nare at war.\n  I think our colleagues need to be reminded of legislation which we \npassed in December of 2005, known as the Detainee Treatment Act. When \npeople come here and suggest that we are stripping all legal rights \nfrom terrorists who are detained at Guantanamo Bay, they are simply \nflying in the face of the Detainee Treatment Act that we passed in \nDecember 2005, which provides not only a review through a combatant \nstatus review tribunal, with elaborate procedures to make sure there is \na fair hearing, but then a right to appeal to the District of Columbia \nCircuit Court of Appeals, not only to make sure that the right \nstandards were applied--that is, whether the military applied the right \nrules to the facts--but also to attack the constitutionality of the \nsystem should they choose to do so. So those who claim we are simply \nstripping habeas corpus rights are simply flying in the face of the \nfacts as laid out in the Detainee Treatment Act.\n  Now, the question may be: Are we going to provide what the law \nrequires? Are we going to provide additional rights and privileges that \nsome would like to confer upon these high-value detainees located at \nGuantanamo Bay? But the fact is, to do what the proponents of this \namendment propose would be to divert our soldiers from the battlefield \nand to tie their hands in ways with frivolous litigation and appeals. \nAnd the last thing that I would think any of us would want to do would \nbe to provide an easy means for terrorists to sue U.S. troops in U.S. \ncourts, particularly when it is not required by the Constitution, laws \nof the United States, not mandated by the Supreme Court, and we have \nprovided an adequate substitute remedy, which I believe is entirely \nconsistent with the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions in this area.\n  We have provided an avenue or a process by which these detainees can \nhave their rights protected, such rights as they have being unlawful \ncombatants attacking innocent civilians. America is conferring rights \nupon them that we do not have to confer, but we are conferring them \nbecause we believe there ought to be a fair process and we ought to be \nconsistent with our Constitution and with the decisions of the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n\n[[Page S10362]]\n\n  The last thing I would think any of us would want to do would be to \ntie the hands of our soldiers to permit terrorists to sue U.S. troops \nin Federal court at will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 10 minutes from \nSenator Warner's side on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to talk \ngenerally about the bill. I have already spoken about the importance of \nnot affording habeas corpus to the unlawful combatants when they have \nmore protections than international law requires, or than any other \ncountry provides.\n  Speaking on the bill, for the last 5 years, our most important job \nhas been to protect our families from another terrorist attack.\n  Our children, our mothers, fathers, grandparents, and grandchildren--\nnone of them deserved to die in the 9/11 attacks; none deserve to die \nin another terrorist attack. That is why we are doing everything we can \nto protect our families by stopping terrorists, capturing them, \nlearning their secrets, foiling their plots, and bringing the \nterrorists to justice.\n  Through our hard work, there has not been another direct attack on \nU.S. soil since 9/11. We have worked hard to prevent and stop attacks \nin the last 5 years and must continue to prevent future attacks. We \ndramatically boosted airport and airline security. We hired new airport \nscreeners, implemented new checks, and even put armed agents on flights \nwhere necessary.\n  We added thousands of new FBI agents, thousands of new intelligence \nofficers, and increased their budgets by billions to provide new armies \nagainst terrorism.\n  We passed the PATRIOT Act to provide the tools needed to discover \nterrorist plots and stop them. We reorganized our intelligence agencies \nto bring a single focus and purpose against terrorism.\n  We tore down the walls between law enforcement and intelligence to \nget terror planning and plot information to authorities as quick as \npossible.\n  All of this is going on as I speak, as we sleep at night, as our \nchildren go to school, we are fighting the war on terrorism.\n  The President recently highlighted some of the successes we have had \nbecause of our terror fighting tools and efforts. He recounted how we \nhave captured terrorists, used new tools to learn their secrets, \ncaptured additional terrorists, connected the dots of their \nconspiracies, and foiled their terror attack plans.\n  But now some want to tie the hands of our terror fighters, they want \nto take away the tools we use to fight terror--handcuff us, hamper us--\nin our fight to protect our families.\n\n  It's not new, really. Partisans have slowed our efforts to fight \nterror every step of the way.\n  Many on the other side voted against the PATRIOT Act.\n  Many blocked reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act for months. The \nDemocrat Leader actually boasted, ``We killed the PATRIOT Act.''\n  Thank Heavens that wasn't true. Now, I know that they all love our \ncountry. They are not unpatriotic. They just don't understand the \nterrorist enemies we face.\n  These critics are not willing to do what is necessary to protect \nfully our families from terrorists.\n  You don't have to take my word for it, just look at their record over \nthe last 5 years. Whether or not you would say terror war critics have \na weak record on terror, they have certainly tried to block, slow down, \nand take away our terror fighting tools.\n  Some congressional Democrats voted to cut and run from Iraq. Nothing \nwould embolden terrorists more than to see the U.S. turn tail and run \nhome.\n  Osama bin Laden cited America quitting Somalia, and failing to \nrespond to the U.S.S. Cole bombing, as signs of U.S. weakness and \nvulnerability. We all know what happened later.\n  Democrats in the Senate have blocked the appointment of senior anti-\nterror officials. The 9/11 commission report recommended better \ncoordination between law enforcement and intelligence officials. Only \nlast week did Democrats stop blocking the appointment of the senior \nJustice Department official for National Security.\n  Partisans readily spread classified information leaked to the public \nor the media. They call news conferences to highlight cherry-picked \nintelligence information, or quote newspaper articles betraying our \nNation's secret terror fighting programs. Don't they think this \nencourages the enemy or demoralizes our troops or allies?\n  Some propose to handcuff our ability to discover terrorist plots. \nThey propose to make it hard to listen in on a potential terrorist \ncalling from a foreign country, or to a foreign country to discuss \nterror plans.\n  If al-Qaida calls in, we ought to be listening. That is authorized \nunder the Constitution. The Constitution clearly gives the President \nthe power to intercept phone calls under the foreign intelligence \nexception in the amendment.\n  In my meetings with intelligence officials both abroad and here at \nhome I have heard repeatedly how the disclosure, not only of classified \ninformation, but also of our interrogation techniques, are extremely \ndamaging.\n  Our personnel have encountered enemy combatants trained to resist \ndisclosed interrogation techniques thanks to leakers in our media.\n  If we lay out precisely the techniques that will be used and we print \nthem in the Federal Register, they will be in an al-Qaida training \nmanual within 48 hours.\n  I'm pleased that with the current Military Commissions legislation \nmoving forward, we have clarified our strict adherence to standards \nthat forbid torture in any way, shape or form and we are allowing our \nCIA to move forward with a humane interrogation program whose \ntechniques will not be published in the Federal Register, or even \nworse, in another newspaper disclosure.\n  Critics support trial procedures that would give terrorists secret \nintelligence information.\n  Why on Earth would we hand over classified evidence and information \nto terrorists so that information could be used against us in the \nfuture?\n  Remember the 1993 World Trade Center bombing? The prosecution of \nterror suspects there involved giving over 200 names of terror suspects \nto the attorneys representing the terrorists. They gave them that in a \ntrial, and some months later, after an investigation of the bombings in \nAfrica, we captured the al-Qaida documents which had all of that \ninformation that had been given to the attorneys. So once you give it \nto a detainee or the detainee's attorney, you can count on it getting \nout.\n  One other thing is important. Some would propose exposing our terror \nfighters to legal liability. They oppose giving our terror fighters \ncertainty and clarity in how to go about their jobs. They leave them \nvulnerable to prosecution and handcuff their efforts and leave the rest \nof us vulnerable to terror plots that went undiscovered.\n  Right now, these people are worried and they are buying insurance. \nPeople who are trying to carry out the very important intelligence \nmissions of the United States, if they ask any questions, or if they \ndon't give them four square meals a day and keep them in a comfortable \nmotel, they are afraid they are going to get sued. We need to give \nprotection to the people who are operating within the law as we are \nlaying it out to make sure they don't cross over the line.\n  The problem we have is that if the critics take away the valuable \ntools we have in breaking apart terror plots, we are going to be \nsignificantly less safe. As the President said, the CIA interrogation \nprogram has already succeeded in breaking apart terror conspiracies and \npreventing several terror attacks. Critics within the program are \npreventing us from punishing terrorists and gaining valuable \ninformation that could prevent future attacks.\n  One thing I, along with the President and my Republican colleagues, \nshare with the war critics is a strong opposition to torture. It is \nabhorrent, evil, and has no place in the world. What I oppose is how \nterror war critics would go soft on terror suspects, allowing them \ncomforts they surely don't deserve.\n  Critics are being tough on targets. Terrorists argue that we should \ntreat them like prisoners of war under the\n\n[[Page S10363]]\n\nGeneva Conventions. Article 72 of the Geneva Conventions on treatment \nof prisoners of war says POWs shall be allowed to receive parcels \ncontaining foodstuffs. Is that what critics think the 9/11 Commission \nconspirators deserve? Cookie care packages?\n  Article 71 says POWs shall be allowed to send and receive letters and \ncards. Is that what opponents of the bill believe people who conspire \nto cut off our heads deserve--letters from home? ``Mail call Ramzi bin \nal-Shibh.''\n  Article 60 requires us to grant all POWs monthly advances of pay. It \neven says how much: below sergeant, 8 Swiss francs; officers, 50 Swiss \nfrancs; generals, 75 Swiss francs.\n  Do the critics think Khalid Sheik Mohammed deserves 50 Swiss francs \nor 75?\n  Critics of being tough on terrorists say that we should adhere to \ninternational standards of decency. Where was the decency when \ninternational troops withdrew without a fight from Srebenica, Bosnia \nallowing the genocide of its men and boys?\n  Where was the decency when the U.N. allowed Sudan, guilty of genocide \nin Darfur, to serve on the Human Rights Commission, and allowed Cuba to \nhelp monitor international human rights? This was neither moral nor \ndecent.\n  Some say that the tough treatment we are debating will lead to bad \ntreatment of America's soldiers in the future. That is a close cousin \nto the argument that if we leave the terrorists alone they will stop \nattacking us, or that America made them do it.\n  Do we need a reminder of how badly they are already treating us? The \nWall Street Journal reporter kidnapped by terrorists, Daniel Pearl, had \nhis head cut off long before the criminal acts of Abu Grahib or news of \nthe CIA prisons.\n  The charred bodies of our Special Forces dragged through the streets \nof Mogadishu tell us what the vague standards of the Geneva Convention \ngot us.\n  As I said before, I support a torture ban. I also support provisions \nthat clearly ban cruel, inhuman treatment or intentionally causing \ngreat suffering or serious injury. These are serious felonies, as they \nshould be. But what we cannot do is give up tough treatment short of \nthis that protects our families from attack.\n  What do critics think would happen if we went soft on terrorists? \nWould they be satisfied with only name, rank and serial number? Would \nthey have us say to our terror suspects, ``Oh gosh darn, I was so \nhoping you would willingly tell us your terror plots. Oh well, here's \nyour 50 Swiss franc advance pay, don't eat too much from your cookie \ncare package, we've scheduled a dentist appointment for you for \nTuesday.''\n  Of course not, that would be absurd to think that terrorists will \nwillingly tell us their plots. Terror war critics have been watching \ntoo many Law and Order TV shows if they think some hokey good cop--bad \ncop law enforcement approach will work on al-Qaida.\n  These people flew airplanes into buildings for heaven's sake, or \nshould I say for hell's sake.\n  America must fight with honor. We must fight from the moral high \nground.\n  But do not tell me we lack a moral basis for our fight against \nterror. Show me someone who doubts America's moral basis in this fight \nagainst terror and I will show you someone who has lost their own moral \ncompass.\n  The compass of America's future points to this bill. We live in an \nage where we must fight terror. To win, we must fight tough in that \nfight against terror. We must give our terror fighters the tools they \nneed and the protections they require to protect our families from \nterror.\n  We cannot fall into the traps our terror war critics suggest: \nhandcuffing our law enforcement and intelligence agents, blocking our \nterror fighting leadership, releasing and spreading our terror war \nsecrets, giving terror suspects our terror fighting methods and \ntechniques, granting terrorists overly-comfortable protections, going \nsoft on terrorists who hold the secrets of their plots, their attacks.\n  Our agents deserve better, our soldiers deserve better, our families \ndeserve better.\n  To start where I began, this is what all our efforts are about. \nProtecting our vulnerable families. Protecting our children, protecting \nour mothers and fathers, protecting grandparents and grandchildren. \nNone of the vulnerable it protects deserved to die in the 9/11 attacks, \nand none deserve to die again in another terrorist attack.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are anxious to move to a vote on the \nSpecter amendment to accommodate a number of colleagues. Therefore, I \nurge that the remaining time on the Specter amendment under the control \nof Senator Specter, and the time in opposition under my control, be now \nutilized by colleagues, such that we can move to that vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is not a unanimous consent request, is it?\n  Mr. WARNER. No.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We have three Senators who have been allocated time \nspecifically, and that time may be used relative to the amendment or in \ngeneral debate on the bill. I will not agree to any restriction on the \nuse of time that the Senator has been allocated.\n  Mr. WARNER. I recognize that. It is in our mutual interests to the \nmove ahead on the bill. There will be time after the vote for Senators \nto speak. You have 18 minutes on the bill. I have 47 under my control \non general debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the time for the Senator from California \nis under which category?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. General debate time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I strongly believe the true test of a \nnation comes when we face hard decisions and hard times. It is really \nnot the easy decisions that test our character and our commitment to \nfundamental principles and values. It is when the easy answer is not \nthe right answer, but is politically expedient.\n  We face one of those times right now. The war against terror has \nchallenged our country to fight a nontraditional enemy--one that is not \npart of any State or military. The enemy does not wear a uniform, it \nhas no code of ethics, and it relishes in the killing of innocents. It \nstrikes in cowardly ways. They have also challenged us as to whether we \ncan continue during this period in fighting this enemy to abide by the \nbedrock of our justice system, the Constitution.\n  Before us on the floor of the Senate is a bill to address how our \ncountry will interpret the Geneva Conventions, and how we will treat \nthose we apprehend and detain in this nontraditional, asymmetric war.\n  I truly believe that how we answer these challenges will not only \ntest our commitment to our Constitution, but it will also test our very \nfoundation of justice. It sends a message, also, to other countries--a \nmessage that will ultimately dictate how our soldiers and personnel are \ntreated should they be captured by others.\n  Earlier this month, a bipartisan group of Senators worked together to \ndevelop a solution to these complex issues, and the Armed Services \nCommittee reported a compromise military commissions bill to the Senate \nby a vote of 15 to 9.\n\n  Unfortunately, that is not the bill that is before this body today. \nInstead, House and Senate Republicans met with the White House and made \nchanges that significantly altered the impact of this legislation and \nchanged the bill in such a manner that I cannot at present support its \npassage without substantial amendment.\n  I do not believe the bill before us is constitutional. It is being \nrushed through a month before a major election in which the leadership \nof this very body is challenged.\n  The first of my concerns is the issue of habeas corpus. I very much \nsupport the amendment offered by the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. The bill before us eliminates a basic right of the American \njustice system, and that is the right of habeas corpus review. It is \nconstitutionally provided to ensure that innocent people are not held \ncaptive or held indefinitely.\n  Habeas corpus has been a cornerstone of our legal system. It goes \nback, as it has been said, to the days of the Magna Carta. Our Founding \nFathers enshrined this right in the Constitution because they \nunderstood mistakes happen and there is need for someone to appeal a \nmistake or a wrong conviction.\n  Just a few weeks ago, a man named Abu Bakker-Qassim, who was held at\n\n[[Page S10364]]\n\nGuantanamo, described how he was held for years, even though he had \nnever been a terrorist or a soldier. He was never even on a \nbattlefield. He had been sold by Pakistani bounty hunters to the United \nStates military for $5,000. Qassim said it was only because of the \navailability of habeas corpus that this mistake was able to be \ncorrected. That is why Senator Specter's amendment is right.\n  If innocent people are at Guantanamo--and they presumably are and \nhave been--or if abuses are taking place--and its likely some have--\nthere must be an avenue to address these problems. Eliminating habeas \ncorpus rights is a serious mistake and it will open the door to other \nefforts to remove habeas corpus.\n  Next, I am very concerned about the ability to use coerced testimony. \nThis will be the first time in modern history that United States \nmilitary tribunals will be free to admit evidence that was obtained \nthrough abusive tactics so long as the judge determines it is reliable \nand relevant or so long as it was obtained before December 30, 2005.\n  We have heard from countless witnesses that coerced testimony is \ninherently unreliable. We don't want to send the message that coercion \nis an acceptable tactic to use on Americans as well.\n  The fact is we had testimony in the Judiciary Committee from the head \nof all of the Judge Advocate Corps who said they did not believe \ntorture worked.\n  I am very concerned about the definition of torture and the lack of \nclarity on cruel and inhumane treatment--especially combined with \ngiving the President discretion to decide what he believes \ninterrogation methods are permissible.\n  We have already seen through press reports that this administration \npushes the boundaries on allowable interrogation techniques and these \nabuses cannot continue.\n  Finally, I am concerned about the rules for what evidence may be used \nto convict someone and then their limited ability to have a court \nreview their case.\n  If one is not allowed to know what the basis of conviction was and \nthen is only given limited judicial review of their conviction, how can \nwe be confident that we are not holding innocent people who were caught \nin the wrong place at the wrong time--such an outcome severely harms \nour standing in the global community.\n  I believe these issues are too important for us to rush through a \nbill of this magnitude.\n  These are difficult times and difficult issues. However, I do not \nbelieve the expediency of the moment or the political winds of an \nimpending election should lead us to abandon our core values as a \nNation.\n  The Founding Fathers created specific constitutional limitations. And \nsince that time the United States has been at the forefront of \ndemanding humane treatment of all people. We must not turn our back on \nthese fundamental principles.\n  I am disappointed to be voting against this bill. I had hoped a real \nbipartisan compromise could be reached.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, this is a most difficult issue we are \nengaged in. We are arguing about what I believe is a cornerstone \nprinciple of the rule of law, and that is the issue of habeas corpus.\n  I know this is an unusual war, and I don't know its duration. No one \nfully does. But I do know if we are going to be true to our \nConstitution and to the rule of law, we have to be true to that law.\n  I have traveled as a Senator all over this globe and have spoken with \ngreat pride about our rule of law and the superiority of democracy to \nother means of government. While I support this bill in providing due \nprocess for these detainees, I rise because I am concerned about the \nprovisions relating to habeas corpus.\n  I am reminded of the words of Thomas Jefferson who once said:\n\n       The habeas corpus secures every man here, alien or citizen, \n     against everything which is not law, whatever shape it may \n     assume.\n\n  On another occasion he said:\n\n       I would rather be exposed to the inconveniences attending \n     too much liberty than to those attending too small a degree \n     of it.\n\n  What we are talking about is section 7 of this bill, which will \nfurther strip the Federal courts of jurisdiction to hear pending Gitmo \ncases as it applies to all pending and future cases. Had this proposal \nbeen law earlier this year, the Supreme Court may not have had \njurisdiction to hear the Hamdan case, which is what brings us here \ntoday.\n  At the heart of the habeas issue is whether the President should have \nthe sole authority to indefinitely detain unlawful enemy combatants \nwithout any judicial restraints. Congress will provide the President \nwith this unilateral authority by enacting legal restrictions aimed at \nstripping courts of jurisdiction to hear habeas claims. In doing so, \nthe President does not have to show any cause for detaining an \nindividual labeled an ``unlawful enemy combatant.''\n  Stripped of jurisdiction by recent legislation, U.S. courts will not \nhave the ability to hear an individual's request to learn why he is \neven being detained. Providing detainees with the right to ask a court \nto evaluate the legality of their detention I believe would not cost \nU.S. lives. However, it will test American laws.\n  Claims have been made that providing detainees the right to hear why \nthey are being detained necessitates providing them with classified \ninformation. I do not believe this to be true. Similar to the military \ncommission legislation, it would only allow a judge or an attorney with \nsecurity clearance to see the evidence against the defendant to \nevaluate its reliability and probative value.\n  Permanent detention of foreigners without reason damages our moral \nintegrity regarding international rule of law issues. To quote: \n``History shows that in the wrong hands, the power to jail people \nwithout showing cause is a tool of despotism.'' A responsibility this \nNation has always assumed is to ensure that no one is held prisoner \nunjustly.\n  Stripping courts of their authority to hear habeas claims is a \nfrontal attack on our judiciary and its institutions, as well as our \ncivil rights laws. Habeas corpus is a cornerstone of our constitutional \norder, and a suspension of that right, whether for U.S. citizens or \nforeigners under U.S. control, ought to trouble us all. It certainly \ngives me pause.\n  The right to judicial appeal is enshrined in our Constitution. It is \npart and parcel of the rule of law. The Supreme Court has described the \nwrit of habeas corpus as ``the fundamental instrument for safeguarding \nindividual freedom against arbitrary and lawless State action.''\n  Some of the darkest hours in our Nation's history have resulted from \nthe suspension of habeas corpus, notably the internment of Japanese \nAmericans during World War II.\n  Obviously, I am not here to question the wisdom of Abraham Lincoln. \nWe have had no wiser President. But one of the most controversial \ndecisions of his administration was the suspension of habeas corpus for \nall military-related cases, ignoring the ruling of a U.S. circuit court \nagainst this order. He, in fact, I believe, if my memory of history \nserves me, imprisoned the entire Maryland Legislature because of their \nattempts to secede from the Union. He did it. It happened. It is not \nnecessarily the proudest moment of his administration. But it is \nsomething that has been raging with controversy ever since.\n  Habeas petitions are not clogging the courts and are not frivolous. \nThe administration claims that the approximately 200 pending habeas \nclaims are clogging our courts and are for the most part frivolous. \nThese petitions are not an undue administrative burden. Judges always \nhave the discretion to dismiss frivolous claims, and indefinite \ndetainment of a foreigner without showing cause, Mr. President, is not \nfrivolous.\n  I suppose what brings me to the floor today is my memory of my study \nof the law. While I was in law school, I was particularly taken with \nthe study of the Nuremberg trials. The words of\n\n[[Page S10365]]\n\nJustice Robert H. Jackson inspired me then and inspire me still. He was \nour chief counsel for the allied powers. What he said on that occasion \nin his closing address to the international military tribunal is an \ninspiration. Said he:\n\n       That four great nations, flushed with victory and stung \n     with injury stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily submit \n     their captive enemies to the judgment of the law is one of \n     the most significant tributes that Power has ever paid to \n     Reason.\n\n  On the fairness of the Nuremberg proceedings, he said in his closing \nstatement:\n\n       Of one thing we may be sure. The future will never have to \n     ask with misgiving, what could the Nazis have said in their \n     favor. History will know that whatever could be said, they \n     were allowed to say. They have been given the kind of a Trial \n     which they, in the days of their pomp and power, never gave \n     to any man. But fairness is not weakness. The extraordinary \n     fairness of these hearings is an attribute to our strength.\n\n  I simply feel this particular provision in this bill ought to be \ntaken out. We ought not to suspend the writ of habeas corpus. We should \ngo the extra mile, not as a sign of weakness, but as evidence of our \nstrength.\n  I intend to vote for the underlying bill and ultimately will leave \nthe judgment of its constitutionality without habeas to the judgment of \nthe judiciary, but I believe we are called upon to go the extra mile to \nshow our strength and not our weakness, and ultimately our Nation will \nbe stronger if we stand by the rule of law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nOregon for those very cogent remarks, especially in the context of \nadditional Republican support, stated bluntly, and in light of more \nmoderate Republican support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Democratic leader has yielded 2 minutes \nof his leadership time to me. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed on that basis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the Specter-Leahy amendment on \nthe writ of habeas corpus. The habeas corpus language in this bill is \nas legally abusive of the rights guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution as \nthe actions at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, and the CIA's secret prisons \nwere physically abusive of the detainees themselves.\n  The Supreme Court has long held that all persons inside the United \nStates, including lawful permanent residents and other aliens, have a \nconstitutional right to the writ of habeas corpus. Yet, this provision \npurports to apply even to aliens who are detained inside the United \nStates, including lawful permanent residents.\n  Unlike the provision that was included in the Detainee Treatment Act \nlast year, this court-stripping provision would apply on a world-wide \nbasis, not just at Guantanamo. It would apply to detainees of all \nFederal agencies, not just the Department of Defense. It would attempt \nto expressly strip the courts of jurisdiction over all pending cases.\n  This provision goes beyond stripping the courts of habeas corpus \njurisdiction. It also prohibits the U.S. courts from hearing or \nconsidering ``any other action against the United States or its agents \nrelating to any aspect of the detention, treatment, or trial'' of an \nalien detainee. As a result, this provision would leave many detainees \nwithout any alternative legal remedy at all, even after released, even \nif there is every reason to believe that the detention was in error, \nand even if the detainee was tortured or abused while in U.S. custody.\n  For example, the Canadian Government recently concluded, after a \ncomprehensive review, that one of its citizens had been handed over by \nU.S. authorities to a foreign country which subjected him to torture \nand cruel and inhuman treatment, without any evidence that he was an \nenemy combatant or that he supported any terrorist group. Under this \nhabeas corpus court-stripping provision, this individual would have no \nlegal remedy in the U.S. courts even after he was finally released from \nillegal detention, unless the United States acknowledges that it made a \nmistake when it determined that he was an enemy combatant.\n  The fundamental premise of last year's Detainee Treatment Act, DTA, \nwas that we could restrict future habeas corpus suits, because we were \nproviding an alternative course of access to the courts.\n  The language in the bill before us would deprive many detainees of \nthe right to file a writ of habeas corpus without providing any \nalternative form of relief. For example: The provision applies on a \nworldwide basis, not just at Guantanamo. DOD detainees outside \nGuantanamo do not have access to Combatant Status Review Tribunals--\nCSRTs--so they can't get to court to review CSRTs. Because this bill \nwould deprive them of the writ of habeas corpus or any other legal \nremedy, they would have no access to the courts at all.\n  The provision applies to detainees of all Federal agencies, not just \nDOD. Detainees of other Federal agencies do not get CSRTs, so they \ncan't get to court to review CSRTs. Because this bill would deprive \nthem of the writ of habeas corpus or any other legal remedy, they would \nhave no access to the courts at all.\n  The provision even applies to lawful resident aliens who are detained \nand held inside the United States. Because this bill would deprive them \nof the writ of habeas corpus or any other legal remedy, they would have \nno access to the courts at all.\n  Even in cases where DOD regulations provide detainees a right to \nCombatant Status Review Tribunals--CSRTs--such tribunals may not be an \nadequate substitute for judicial review under a writ of habeas corpus. \nCSRTs are permitted to use coerced testimony, hearsay evidence, and \nevidence that is never disclosed to the accused. Detainees before those \nstatus review tribunals are denied access to witnesses and documents \nneeded to rebut allegations made by the government. Courts reviewing \nCSRT determinations are not authorized to make an independent \ndetermination whether there is a lawful basis for the detention.\n\n  The court stripping provision in the bill does more than just \neliminate habeas corpus rights for detainees. It also prohibits the \nU.S. courts from hearing or considering ``any other action against the \nUnited States or its agents relating to any aspect of the detention, \ntreatment, or trial'' of an alien detainee.\n  A separate provision in the bill adds that no person--whether \nproperly held as an alien detainee or not--may invoke the Geneva \nConventions as a source of rights in any court of the United States. \nOther provisions establish new defenses for individuals who may be \naccused of violating standards for the treatment of detainees under \nU.S. and international law.\n  Taken together, these provisions do not just deprive detainees of the \nability to challenge the basis on which they have been detained--they \nare an effort to insulate the United States from any judicial review of \nour treatment detainees, an effort to ensure that there will be no \naccountability for actions that violate the laws and the standards of \nthe United States.\n  Last year, this Congress took an important stand for the rule of law \nby enacting the Detainee Treatment Act, which prohibits the cruel, \ninhuman or degrading treatment of detainees in the custody of any U.S. \nagency anywhere in the world. That landmark provision is at risk of \nbeing rendered meaningless, if we establish rules ensuring that it can \nnever be enforced.\n  Earlier this month, we received a letter from three retired Judge \nAdvocates General, who urged us not to strip the courts of habeas \ncorpus jurisdiction. That letter, signed by Admiral Hutson, Admiral \nGuter, and General Brahms, stated:\n\n       We urge you to oppose any further erosion of the proper \n     authority of our courts and to reject any provision that \n     would strip the courts of habeas jurisdiction.\n       As Alexander Hamilton and James Madison emphasized in the \n     Federalist Papers, the writ of habeas corpus embodies \n     principles fundamental to our nation. It is the essence of \n     the rule of law, ensuring that neither king nor executive may \n     deprive a person of liberty without some independent review \n     to ensure that the detention has a reasonable basis in law \n     and fact. That right must be preserved. Fair hearings do not \n     jeopardize our security. They are what our country stands \n     for.\n\n  We have received similar letters from nine distinguished retired \nFederal\n\n[[Page S10366]]\n\njudges, from hundreds of law professors from around the United States, \nand from many others.\n  If we don't strike this court-stripping language in the bill before \nus, if instead of Congress being a check on excessive executive power, \nCongress attempts to write a blank check to the executive branch, our \nexpectation is that the courts will find this provision to be a \nlegislative excess and strike it down as unconstitutional. We have a \nchance to do the right thing and not just to rely on the courts. This \nbody is the body of last resort legislatively when it comes to \nprotecting that great writ of habeas corpus which is in the \nConstitution. I hope we live up to that responsibility today.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the military commissions bill before us \nwould strip from the U.S. Constitution of one of its most precious \nprotections: the writ of habeas corpus. The Great Writ. The bill would \ndeny those who are detained indefinitely--even those who may be \ninnocent--the opportunity to challenge their detention in court.\n  Habeas corpus is a procedure whereby a Federal court may review \nwhether an individual is being improperly detained. The concept of \nhabeas corpus is deeply rooted in the English common law and was \nspecifically referenced in the Magna Carta of 1215, which stated:\n\n       No Freeman shall be taken, or imprisoned, or be disseised \n     of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, or be \n     outlawed, or exiled, or any otherwise destroyed; nor will we \n     pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful Judgment of his \n     Peers, or by the Law of the Land.\n\n  The legal procedure for issuing writs of habeas corpus was codified \nby the English Parliament in response to concerns by the British people \nthat no monarch should be permitted to hold innocent people against \ntheir will without due process of law.\n  It is precisely because the Founders of the United States feared \nelimination of the writ that, when they enumerated the powers of the \nCongress in the very first article of the U.S. Constitution, they \nincluded specific reference to the writ of habeas corpus and sought to \nprotect it. The language they included in article I, section 9, clause \n2 of the Constitution, also known as the ``Suspension Clause,'' reads \nas follows. It states:\n\n       The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be \n     suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the \n     public Safety may require it.\n\n  I wonder whether those who drafted the provision in this bill to \neliminate habeas corpus have read this clause of the Constitution. \nInconceivably, the U.S. Senate is being asked to abolish a fundamental \nright that has been central to democratic societies, including our own, \nfor centuries. The outrageous provision we debate today could imprison \nindefinitely, without access to the courts, not just suspects picked up \noverseas but even those taken into custody on U.S. soil.\n  Some persons detained at Guantanamo may be terrorists guilty of \nplotting against the people and the Government of these United States. \nOf course terrorists must be properly detained and prosecuted for their \nevil deeds. But some detainees may be innocent. Some may be persons \nsimply swept up because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. \nHow can we know which truly deserve to be held and tried as enemy \ncombatants if we abolish the legal right of the incarcerated to fairly \nchallenge their detention in court?\n\n  The provision in the bill before us deprives Federal courts of \njurisdiction over matters of law that are clearly entrusted to them by \nthe Constitution of the United States. The Constitution is clear on \nthis point: The only two instances in which habeas corpus may be \nsuspended are in the case of a rebellion or an invasion. We are not in \nthe midst of a rebellion, and there is no invasion. It is notable that \nthose who drafted the Constitution deliberately used the word \n``suspended.'' They did not say that habeas corpus could be forever \ndenied, abolished, revoked, or eliminated. They said that, in only two \ninstances, it could be ``suspended,'' meaning temporarily. Not forever. \nNot like in this bill.\n  How can we, the U.S. Senate, in this bill abolish habeas corpus by \napproving a provision that so clearly contravenes the text of the \nConstitution? Where is our respect for the checks and balances that \nwere built into our system by the Framers? They included an explicit \nprohibition against blanket suspension of the writ of habeas corpus \nprecisely to protect innocent persons from being subject to arbitrary \nand unfair action by the state.\n  This flagrant attempt to deny a fundamental right protected by the \nConstitution reveals how White House and Pentagon advisers continue to \nchip away at the separation of powers. They relentlessly pursue their \ndangerous goal of consolidating power in the hands of the Executive at \nthe expense of the Congress, the judiciary, and, sadly, the People. How \ncan we even contemplate such an irresponsible and dangerous course as \nthis de facto canceling of the writ of habeas corpus.\n  The Constitution of the United States is a time-tested contract \nbetween our people and their Government, for which thousands of \nAmerican military men and women have died. Why would we seek to violate \nits terms? Aren't we fighting the terrorists precisely to preserve \nindividual liberties and the rule of law? If we as a people jettison \nthe very democratic ideals that have made our Nation great and we \nbecome, instead, exactly like those whom we seek to imprison--standing \nfor nothing and capable of anything--then what are we fighting for? And \nif we indefinitely and illegally detain innocent parties of other \nnations, with what credibility can we request that they release our \nown?\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in support of the \namendment that has been offered to preserve the writ of habeas corpus.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have received a letter from over 100 law \nprofessors and other distinguished citizens expressing their opposition \nto the habeas corpus provisions in the military tribunal bill. They \nurge support for the Specter-Leahy amendment to remedy that flaw. I ask \nunanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Dennis Hastert,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist, Senator Reid, Speaker Hastert and Rep. \n     Pelosi: We agree with the views set forth in the undated \n     letter sent this month to Members of Congress from Judge John \n     J. Gibbons, Judge Shirley M. Hufstedler, Judge Nathaniel R. \n     Jones, Judge Timothy K. Lewis, Judge William A. Norris, Judge \n     George C. Pratt, Judge H. Lee Sarokin, Judge William S. \n     Sessions, and Judge Patricia M. Wald.\n       These nine distinguished, retired federal judges expressed \n     deep concern about the lawfulness of a provision in the \n     Military Commissions Act of 2006 stripping the courts of \n     jurisdiction to test the lawfulness of Executive detention \n     outside the United States.\n       This matter is even more urgent now. The provision would \n     eliminate habeas for all alleged alien enemy combatants, \n     whether lawful or unlawful, even if they are detained in the \n     United States.\n       We concur with the request made by the judges that Congress \n     remove the provision stripping habeas jurisdiction from the \n     proposed Military Commissions Act.\n       Respectfully, (100 Signatures)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On which side?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. On the Warner side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Warner has 4 minutes in opposition to \nthe Specter amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield that to the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this has been a very spirited debate and I \nam going to give you a spirited answer to what I am proposing with my \nvote. No. 1, my moral compass is very much intact, and when people \nmention moral compasses and the conscience of the Senate, I am going to \nsleep very good casting my vote. I think I have a decent moral compass \nabout what we should be doing to people: What is humane, what is not; \nwhat is right, what is wrong. I have tried to balance the interests of \nour troops and the interests\n\n[[Page S10367]]\n\nof our country when it comes to dealing with people who find themselves \nin our capture.\n  Why not habeas for noncitizen, enemy combatant terrorists housed at \nGitmo? No. 1, the whole Congress has agreed prospectively habeas is not \navailable; the Detainee Treatment Act will be available. The only \nreason we are here is because of the Hamdan decision. The Hamdan \ndecision did not apply to the Detainee Treatment Act retroactively, so \nwe have about 200 and some habeas cases left unattended and we are \ngoing to attend to them now.\n  Why do we--I and others--want to take habeas off the table and \nreplace it with something else? I don't believe judges should be making \nmilitary decisions in a time of war. There is a reason the Germans and \nthe Japanese and every other prisoner held by America have never gone \nto Federal court and asked the judge to determine their status. That is \nnot a role the judiciary should be playing. They are not trained to \nmake those decisions.\n  Under the Geneva Conventions article 5, the combatant tribunal \nrequirement is a military decision. So I believe very vehemently that \nthe military of our country is better qualified to determine who an \nenemy combatant is over a Federal judge. That is the way it has been, \nthat is the way it should be and, with my vote, that is the way it is \ngoing to be.\n  What is the problem? Why am I worried about having Federal judges \nturning every enemy combatant decision into a trial? In 1950 the \nSupreme Court, denying habeas rights to German and Japanese prisoners, \nsaid:\n\n       Such trials would hamper the war effort and bring aid and \n     comfort to the enemy.\n\n  I agree with that.\n\n       They would diminish the prestige of our commanders not only \n     with enemies, but wavering neutrals.\n\n  I agree with that.\n\n       It would be difficult to devise a more effective fettering \n     of a field commander than to allow the very enemies he has \n     ordered to reduce to submission to call him to account in his \n     own civil courts and divert his efforts and attention from \n     the military offensive abroad to the legal defensive at home.\n\n  I agree with that. That is why we shouldn't be doing habeas cases in \na time of war. Nor is it unlikely that the result of such enemy \nlitigiousness would be conflict between judicial and military opinion--\nhighly comforting to the enemies of the United States.\n  These trials impede the war effort. It allows a judge to take what \nhas historically been a military function.\n  What I am proposing for this body and our country is to allow the \nmilitary to do what they are best at doing: controlling the \nbattlefield. Let them define who an enemy combatant is under the Geneva \nConventions requirements, under the Combatant Status Review Tribunal \nsystem, which is Geneva Conventions compliant, in my opinion, and let \nthe Federal courts come in after they made their decision to see if the \nmilitary applied the correct law, the procedures were followed, and the \nevidence justifies the decision of the military.\n  To substitute a judge for the military in a time of war to determine \nsomething as basic as who our enemy is is not only not necessary under \nour Constitution, it impedes the war effort, it is irresponsible, it \nneeds to stop, and it should never have happened. I am confident \nCongress has the ability, if we choose to redefine the rights of an \nenemy combatant, noncitizen--what rights they have in a time of war and \nwhat has happened.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record, if I may, examples of the habeas petitions filed \non behalf of detainees against our troops.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Examples of Habeas Petitions Filed of Behalf of Detainees\n\n       1. Canadian detainee who threw a grenade that killed an \n     Army medic in firefight and who comes from family with \n     longstanding al Qaeda ties moves for preliminary injunction \n     forbidding interrogation of him or engaging in ``cruel, \n     inhuman, or degrading'' treatment of him (n.b. this motion \n     was denied by Judge Bates).\n       2. ``Al Odah motion for dictionary internet security \n     forms''--Kuwaiti detainees seek court orders that they be \n     provided dictionaries in contravention of GTMO's force \n     protection policy and that their counsel be given high-speed \n     internet access at their lodging on the base and be allowed \n     to use classified DoD telecommunications facilities, all on \n     the theory that otherwise their ``right to counsel'' is \n     unduly burdened.\n       3. ``Alladeen--Motion for TRO re transfer''--Egyptian \n     detainee who Combatant Status Review Tribunal adjudicated as \n     no longer an enemy combatant, and who was therefore due to be \n     released by the United States, files motion to block his \n     repatriation to Egypt.\n       4. ``Paracha--Motion for PI re Conditions''--Motion by high \n     level al Qaeda detainee complaining about base security \n     procedures, speed of mail delivery, and medical treatment; \n     seeking an order that he be transferred to the ``least \n     onerous conditions'' at GTMO and asking the court to order \n     that GTMO allow him to keep any books and reading materials \n     sent to him and to ``report to the Court'' on ``his \n     opportunities for exercise, communication, recreation, \n     worship, etc.''\n       5. ``Motion for PI re Medical Records''--Motion by detainee \n     accusing military's health professionals of ``gross and \n     intentional medical malpractice'' in alleged violation of the \n     4th, 5th, 8th, and 14th Amendments, 42 USC 1981, and \n     unspecified international agreements.\n       6. ``Abdah--Emergency Motion re DVDs''--``emergency'' \n     motion seeking court order requiring GTMO to set aside its \n     normal security policies and show detainees DVDs that are \n     purported to be family videos.\n       7. ``Petitioners' Supp. Opposition''--Filing by detainee \n     requesting that, as a condition of a stay of litigation \n     pending related appeals, the Court involve itself in his \n     medical situation and set the stage for them to second-guess \n     the provision of medical care and other conditions of \n     confinement.\n       8. ``Al Odah Supplement to PI Motion''--Motion by Kuwaiti \n     detainees unsatisfied with the Koran they are provided as \n     standard issue by GTMO, seeking court order that they be \n     allowed to keep various other supplementary religious \n     materials, such as a ``tafsir'' or 4-volume Koran with \n     commentary, in their cells.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 12 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think it would be appropriate, if I may \nhave Senator Warner's concurrence, to tell our colleagues that this \nwill be the end of the time allocated for this amendment and we could \nexpect to vote at about 11:45 or 11:50?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, very definitely. As soon as all time on \nthis amendment is allocated or yielded back, my intention is to move to \na vote.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. President, I fully realize it is unpopular to speak for aliens, \nunpopular to speak on what might be interpreted to be in favor of enemy \ncombatants, but that is not what this Senator is doing. What I am \ntrying to establish is a course of judicial procedure to determine \nwhether they are enemy combatants.\n  I submit that the materials produced on this floor and in the \nhearings of the Judiciary Committee show conclusively that the \nCombatant Status Review Tribunals do not have an adequate way of \ndetermining whether these individuals are enemy combatants. What we are \ndoing is defending the jurisdiction of the Federal courts to maintain \nthe rule of law. If the Federal courts are not open, if the Federal \ncourts do not have jurisdiction to determine constitutionality, then \nhow are we to determine what is constitutional?\n  My own background is one of a reverence for the law, a reverence for \nthe independence of the judiciary, and a reverence for the rule of law \nas interpreted by our Constitution. If it hadn't been for the Federal \ncourts, the Supreme Court of the United States, we would not have seen \nthe decision in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. The legislative \nbranches were too mired in politics, the executive was too mired in \npolitics, and it was only the Supreme Court which could recognize the \ninjustice of segregation and it led to that decision.\n  Similarly, it was the Federal courts which changed the criminal \nprocedure in this country as a matter of basic fairness. Prior to the \ndecision of the case of Brown v. Mississippi in 1936, the Federal \ncourts did not establish standards for State criminal courts. It was \ndetermined as a matter of States rights that States could establish \ntheir own determinations. But in that case, the evidence was \noverwhelming about a brutal, coerced confession and, for the first \ntime, the Supreme Court of the United States stepped in and said: \nStates may not take an individual,\n\n[[Page S10368]]\n\ntake him across State lines, have a feigned hanging, extract a \nconfession, and use that to convict him. That was done by the Federal \ncourts.\n  I had the occasion when I was in the Philadelphia district attorney's \noffice to witness firsthand on a daily basis a revolution in \nconstitutional criminal procedure. I was litigating the issues in the \ncriminal courts when Mapp v. Ohio came down, imposing the rule of \nexclusion of evidence in State courts if obtained in violation of the \nfourth amendment and, when Escobedo came down, limiting admissions and \nconfessions if not in conformity with rules. Then Miranda v. Ohio came \ndown. I found those decisions as a prosecutor very limiting and \nimpeding. But the course of time has demonstrated that those decisions \nhave improved the quality of justice in America. Chief Justice \nRehnquist, a recognized conservative, sought to eliminate or limit \nMiranda when he came to the Supreme Court of the United States. Later \nin his career, he said in Miranda that the protections of those \nwarnings were appropriate and were helpful in our society.\n  There are four fundamental, undeniable principles and facts involved \nin the issue we are debating today. The first undeniable principle is \nthat a statute cannot overrule a Supreme Court decision on \nconstitutional grounds, and a statute cannot contradict an explicit \nconstitutional provision. That is point No. 1.\n  Point No. 2, the Constitution is explicit in the statement that \nhabeas corpus may be suspended only with rebellion or invasion.\n  Fact No. 3, uncontested. We do not have a rebellion or an invasion.\n  Fact and principle No. 4, the Supreme Court says that aliens are \ncovered by habeas corpus.\n  We have already had considerable exposition of the opinion by Justice \nO'Connor that the constitutional right of habeas corpus applies to \nindividuals, which means citizens and aliens. The case of Rasul v. \nBush, which explicitly involved an alien, says this in the opinion of \nJustice Stevens speaking for the Court:\n\n       Habeas corpus received explicit recognition in the \n     Constitution, which forbids the suspension of--\n\nThen Justice Stevens cites the constitutional provision.\n  The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus cannot be suspended unless \nin the cases of rebellion or invasion, and neither is present here. So \nyou have the express holding of the Supreme Court in Rasul v. Bush that \nhabeas corpus applies to aliens.\n  Justice Stevens went on to say that:\n\n       Executive imprisonment has been considered oppressive and \n     lawless since John, at Runnymede.\n\n  What this bill would do in striking habeas corpus would take our \ncivilized society back some 900 years to King John at Runnymede which \nled to the adoption of the Magna Charta in 1215, which is the \nantecedent for habeas corpus and was the basis for including in the \nConstitution of the United States the principle that habeas corpus may \nnot be suspended.\n  I believe it is unthinkable, out of the question, to enact Federal \nlegislation today which denies the habeas corpus right which would take \nus back some 900 years and deny the fundamental principle of the Magna \nCharta imposed on King John at Runnymede.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the argument has been made that there is \nan alternative procedure which passes constitutional muster. But the \nprovisions of the statute which set up the Combatant Status Review \nTribunal are conclusively insufficient on their face. The statute \nprovides that the Combatant Status Review Tribunal may be reviewed by \nthe Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia only to the extent \nthat the ruling was consistent with the standards and procedures \nspecified by the Secretary of Defense.\n  Now, to comply with the standards of procedures determined by the \nSecretary of Defense does not mean exclude on its face a factual \ndetermination as to what happens to the detainees.\n  When the Senator from South Carolina argues that judges should not \nmake military decisions, I agree with him totally. But the converse of \nthat is that judges should make judicial decisions, to decide whether \ndue process is decided. The converse, that judges should not make \nmilitary decisions, is the principle that the Secretary of Defense \nought not to decide what the constitutional standards are. The \nSecretary of Defense should not decide what the constitutional \nstandards are. That is up to the Supreme Court of the United States, \nand the Supreme Court of the United States has decided that aliens are \nentitled to the explicit constitutional protection of habeas corpus.\n  The argument is made that the Swain case allows for alternative \nprocedures. The Swain case involved a District of Columbia habeas \ncorpus proceeding which was virtually identical with habeas corpus \nprovided under Federal statute 2241, so of course it was satisfactory.\n  A number of straw men have been set up: One, that we could not apply \nthese principles to the 18,000 detainees in Iraq--nobody seeks to do \nthat; the straw man that we should not give search and seizure \nprotections of the fourth amendment--no one seeks to do that; or the \nfifth amendment protection against the privilege of self-incrimination.\n  In essence and in conclusion, what this entire controversy boils down \nto is whether Congress is going to legislate to deny a constitutional \nright which is explicit in the document of the Constitution itself and \nwhich has been applied to aliens by the Supreme Court of the United \nStates.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee has said \nthat he does not want to have this matter come back to Congress. But \nsurely as we are standing here, if this bill is passed and habeas \ncorpus is stricken, we will be on this floor again rewriting the law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. All time \nhas expired.\n  Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I inquire, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan seeks a little additional time on leader time, is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have already accomplished that. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. WARNER. At this time I would like to yield to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina 3 minutes off of the time under my control on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. What I am trying to stress to the body is that this is a \nwar we are fighting, not crime, and habeas corpus rights have not been \ngiven to any other prisoners under U.S. control in the past, for very \ngood reason. It impedes the war effort.\n  Let me give you a flavor of what is coming out of Guantanamo Bay. \nThis is what is happening to the troops defending America by the people \nwho are incarcerated, determined by our military to be an enemy \ncombatant. A Canadian detainee, who threw a grenade that killed an Army \nmedic in a firefight and who comes from a family with longstanding al-\nQaida ties, moved for a preliminary injunction forbidding interrogation \nof him or engaging in cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. In other \nwords, he was going to ask the judge to take over running the jail and \nhis interrogation.\n  A Kuwaiti detainee sought a court order that would provide \ndictionaries in contravention of Gitmo force protection policy and that \ntheir counsel have high-speed Internet access.\n  Another one applied for a motion that would allow them to change the \nbase security procedures to allow speedy mail delivery medical \ntreatment. He sought an order transferring him to the least onerous \ncondition at Gitmo. He asked the court to allow him to keep any books \nand reading materials sent to him and report to the court over his \nopportunities for exercise, communication, recreation and worship.\n  We are not going to turn this war over to a series of court cases, \nwhere our troops are having to account for a bunch of junk by people \ntrying to kill Americans. They will have their day in court, but they \nare not going to turn this whole war into a mockery with my vote.\n  I yield back.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I believe there is no time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining.\n\n[[Page S10369]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.

Mr. President, for 4 years the Central Intelligence \nAgency's program was kept from the full membership of the Senate and \nHouse Intelligence Committees.\n  For 4 years the CIA imprisoned and interrogated suspected terrorists \nat secret black sites under a policy that prevented Congress from not \nonly knowing about the program but from acting on it and regulating it.\n  For 4 years, the White House refused to brief Intelligence Committee \nmembers about the program's legal business and operations, as is \nrequired by law.\n  For 4 years, the members of the Senate and the House Intelligence \nCommittees, whose duty it is to authorize the funding of every CIA \nprogram, were kept in the dark by an administration which ignored the \nlegal requirement to keep the Congress fully and currently informed on \nall intelligence activities.\n  The amendment I have offered reverses the executive branch's 4-year \npolicy of indifference toward Congress.\n  My amendment corrects a serious omission in the pending bill: the \nneed for Congress to reassert its fundamental right to understand the \nintelligence activities it authorizes and funds.\n  My amendment would subject the CIA's detention and interrogation to \nmeaningful congressional oversight for the first time in 4 years by \nrequiring a series of reviews and reports that will enable the Congress \nto evaluate the program's scope and legality, as well as its \neffectiveness.\n  The amendment establishes this absent congressional oversight in four \nways. First, my amendment requires the Director of the CIA to provide a \nquarterly report to all members of the Intelligence Committees in both \nthe House and the Senate detailing the detention facilities, how they \nare operated, and how they are used by the CIA.\n  It requires that the detainees held at these facilities be listed by \nname as well as the basis for their detention and the description of \ninterrogation techniques used on them and the accompanying legal \nrationale.\n  This quarterly report also requires the recording of any violation or \nabuse under the CIA program as well as an assessment of the \neffectiveness of the detention and interrogation program.\n  This issue of the effectiveness of interrogation techniques is \nincredibly important and often overlooked as an aspect of the debate \nover the CIA program. Interrogations that coerce information can \nproduce bad intelligence--not necessarily, but they can produce \nmisleading intelligence--fabricated intelligence to get out of the \ntreatment, information that can harm, not help, our efforts to locate \nand capture terrorists.\n  Second, my amendment would require the Director of the CIA to provide \na quarterly report to all members of the Intelligence Committees on the \ndisposition of each detainee transferred out of the CIA prisons, \nwhether the detainee was transferred to the Department of Defense for \nprosecution before a military commissioner for further detention, \nwhether the detainee was transferred to the custody of the Attorney \nGeneral to stand trial in civilian court, or whether the detainee was \nrendered or otherwise transferred to the custody of another nation.\n  There needs to be a comprehensive and accurate accounting of \ndetainees held by the CIA. Congress has a responsibility to know who is \nheld by the CIA, why they are held and for how long they are held.\n  The CIA detention and interrogation program cannot function as a \nblack hole into which people disappear for years on end.\n  We have been told by CIA leaders that the agency does not want to \nbe--they say this constantly to us--they do not want to be the prison \nwarden for the United States Government. The goal of the CIA program \nshould be to obtain, through lawful means, intelligence information \nthat can identify other terror suspects to prevent further terrorist \nattacks and then to bring to justice those who we believe to be \ncriminals. This is the so-called endgame that everyone talks about.\n  If the CIA detention program is allowed to function as some sort of \nprisoner purgatory, we have then failed.\n  Also of concern to me is the lack of existing oversight in how the \nUnited States transports or renders detainees to other countries for \nimprisonment and interrogation.\n  The limited information the administration has shared with the Senate \nIntelligence Committee on the CIA's rendition program does not by any \nmeans assure, at least this Senator, that the intelligence community \nhas a program in place, so to speak, to assert what happens to these \nindividuals when they are transferred to foreign custody, such as how \nthey are treated, how they are interrogated, whether they divulge \nintelligence information of value, and whether this information is then \nprovided to the CIA.\n  The CIA's rendition program deserves far greater scrutiny and \ncongressional oversight than it has been given to date.\n  The third way in which this amendment establishes a meaningful \noversight of the CIA detention and interrogation program is to require \nthe CIA Inspector General and the CIA general counsel each separately \nreview the program on an annual basis to report their findings to the \nIntelligence Committees. These independent Agency reviews would assess \nthe CIA's compliance with any applicable law or regulation and the \nconduct of detention, interrogation and rendition activities as well as \nto report to Congress any violations of law or other abuse on the part \nof personnel involved in the program.\n\n[[Page S10371]]\n\n  The annual reviews of the Inspector General and the general counsel \nalso would evaluate the effectiveness of the detention and \ninterrogation program; effectiveness at obtaining valuable and reliable \nintelligence.\n  Finally, my amendment requires the Attorney General to submit to \nCongress an unclassified certification whether or not each \ninterrogation technique approved for use by the CIA complies with the \nUnited States Constitution and all applicable treaties, statutes and \nregulations. I believe this is a very important certification.\n\n  All Americans, not just the Congress, need an ironclad assurance from \nour Nation's top enforcement officer that the CIA program and the \ninterrogation techniques it employs are lawful in all respects. The CIA \nofficers in the field, I might say, above all, need this assurance.\n  I do not believe there is anything particularly controversial about \nthis amendment, and I hope that Democrats and Republicans alike can \nembrace the need for restoring respect for the oversight role of the \nIntelligence Committees of the Congress over intelligence.\n  Only through reports that will be provided under this amendment will \nthe Congress have the information it lawfully deserves to understand \nthe CIA's detention and interrogation program and determine whether the \nprogram is producing the unique intelligence mission that justifies its \ncontinued operation.\n  Only when the President works with the Congress are we able to craft \nintelligence programs that are legally sound and operationally \neffective. Only when the President works with the Congress can America \nstand strong in its fight against terrorism.\n  Intelligence gathering through interrogation is one of the most \nimportant tools we have in the war on terrorism. My amendment would \nprovide the congressional oversight necessary to assure that our \nintelligence officers in the field have clear guidelines for effective \nand legal interrogation.\n  Before yielding the floor, I will address two other matters very \nbriefly.\n  Those who have taken the time to read through the bill we are \ndebating will find the word ``coercion'' repeatedly in the text of the \nlegislation. Coercion is a fitting word when considering how the Senate \nfinds itself rushed into voting on a bill with far-reaching legal and \nnational security implications.\n  The final text of the underlying bill was negotiated by a handful of \nRepublican Senators, many of whom I respect, and the White House. \nDemocrats were not consulted. I was not consulted. This Senator was not \nconsulted. Senator Levin was not consulted. We were kept out of these \nclosed-door sessions.\n  I say that because the Senate Intelligence Committee is the only \nSenate committee responsible for authorizing CIA activities and the \nonly committee briefed on classified details of the CIA's detention and \ninterrogation program. We were denied an opportunity to consider this \nbill, in fact, on sequential referral, which is our due.\n  In the mad dash to pass this bill before the Senate recesses, \nSenators are being given only five opportunities, I believe, to amend \nthe bill, effectively preventing the Senate from trying to produce the \nbest bill possible on the most important subject possible with respect \nto the gathering of intelligence. It does not have to be this way.\n  Finally, I am troubled by what I view as misleading statements about \nthe current state of the CIA detention and interrogation program made \nby President Bush and senior administration officials. I say this for \nthe record, and strongly.\n  The President and others have stated in recent weeks that the CIA \nprogram was halted as a result of the Supreme Court's Hamdan decision \non June 29, 2006. This assertion is false.\n  Significant aspects of this program were halted following the passage \nof the Detainee Treatment Act in 2005, prohibiting cruel, inhuman, or \ndegrading treatment of detainees, well before the Supreme Court \ndecision.\n  The President has also been very forceful in his public statements \nasserting that the post-Hamdan application of Geneva Conventions Common \nArticle 3 has created legal uncertainties about the CIA interrogation \nprocedures that the Congress must resolve through legislation--only \nus--in order for the CIA program to continue. This assertion is \nmisleading, and it is false as well.\n  Concerns over the legal exposure of CIA officers have existed since \nthe program's inception and did not begin with the Supreme Court's \nHamdan decision. These mischaracterizations illustrate to me why it is \nimportant for Congress to understand all facts about the CIA program.\n  Congress cannot and should not sit on the sidelines blithely ignorant \nabout the details of a critical intelligence program that has been \noperating without meaningful congressional scrutiny for years.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Massachusetts yield \nfor a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. KERRY. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as \na cosponsor to the Rockefeller amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the last week before we leave for a long \nrecess has always been extraordinarily busy--particularly when an \nelection is only 42 days away. But, sadly, this has become too much the \nway the Senate does business and often its most important business.\n  Today, the leadership of the Senate has decided that legislation that \nwill directly impact America's moral authority in the world merits only \na few hours of debate. What is at stake is the authority that is \nessential to winning and to waging a legitimate and effective war on \nterror, and also one that is critical to the safety of American troops \nwho may be captured.\n  If, in a few hours, we squander that moral authority, blur lines that \nfor decades have been absolute, then no speech, no rhetoric, and no \npromise can restore it.\n  Four years ago, we were in a similar situation. An Iraq war \nresolution was rushed through the Senate because of election-year \npolitics--a political calendar, not a statesman's calendar. And 4 years \nlater, the price we are paying is clear for saying to a President and \nan administration that we would trust them.\n  Today, we face a different choice--to prevent an irreversible \nmistake, not to correct one. It is to stand and be counted so that \nelection-year politics do not further compromise our moral authority \nand the safety of our troops.\n  Every Senator must ask him or herself: Does the bill before us treat \nAmerica's authority as a precious national asset that does not limit \nour power but magnifies our influence in the world? Does it make clear \nthat the U.S. Government recognizes beyond any doubt that the \nprotections of the Geneva Conventions have to be applied to prisoners \nin order to comply with the law, restore our moral authority, and best \nprotect American troops? Does it make clear that the United States of \nAmerica does not engage in torture, period?\n  Despite protests to the contrary, I believe the answer is clearly no. \nI wish it were not so. I wish this compromise actually protected the \nintegrity and letter and spirit of the Geneva Conventions. But it does \nnot. In fact, I regret to say, despite the words and the protests to \nthe contrary, this bill permits torture. This bill gives the President \nthe discretion to interpret the meaning and application of the Geneva \nConventions. It gives confusing definitions of ``torture'' and ``cruel \nand inhuman treatment'' that are inconsistent with the Detainee \nTreatment Act, which we passed 1 year ago, and inconsistent with the \nArmy Field Manual. It provides exceptions for pain and suffering \n``incidental to lawful sanctions,'' but it does not tell us what the \nlawful sanctions are.\n  So what are we voting for with this bill? We are voting to give the \nPresident the power to interpret the Geneva Conventions. We are voting \nto allow pain and suffering incident to some undefined lawful \nsanctions.\n  This bill gives an administration that lobbied for torture exactly \nwhat it wanted. And the administration has\n\n[[Page S10372]]\n\nbeen telling people it gives them what they wanted. The only guarantee \nwe have that these provisions will prohibit torture is the word of the \nPresident. Well, I wish I could say the word of the President were \nenough on an issue as fundamental as torture. But we have been down \nthis road.\n  The administration said there were weapons of mass destruction in \nIraq, that Saddam Hussein had ties to al-Qaida, that they would exhaust \ndiplomacy before they went to war, that the insurgency was in its last \nthroes. None of these statements were true.\n  The President said he agreed with Senator McCain's antitorture \nprovisions in the Detainee Treatment Act. Yet he issued a signing \nstatement reserving the right to ignore them. Are we supposed to trust \nthat word?\n  He says flatly that ``The United States does not torture,'' but then \nhe tries to push the Congress into allowing him to do exactly that. And \neven here he has promised to submit his interpretations of the Geneva \nConventions to the Federal Register. Yet his Press Secretary announced \nthat the administration may not need to comply with that requirement. \nAnd we are supposed to trust that?\n  Obviously, another significant problem with this bill is the \nunconstitutional limitation of the writ of habeas corpus. It is \nextraordinary to me that in 2 hours, and a few minutes of a vote, the \nSenate has done away with something as specific as habeas corpus, of \nwhich the Constitution says: ``[t]he Privilege of the Writ of Habeas \nCorpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or \nInvasion the public Safety may require it.''\n  Well, we are not in a rebellion, nor are we being invaded. Thus, we \ndo not have the constitutional power to suspend the writ. And I believe \nthe Court will ultimately find it unconstitutional.\n  The United States needs to retain its moral authority to win the war \non terror. We all want to win it. We all want to stop terrorist \nattacks. But we need to do it keeping faith with our values and the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  Mr. President, a veteran of the Iraq War whom I know, Paul Rieckhoff, \nwrote something the other day that every Senator ought to think about \nas they wrestle with this bill. He wrote that he was taught at Fort \nBenning, GA, about the importance of the Geneva Conventions. He didn't \nknow what it meant until he arrived in Baghdad. Paul wrote:\n\n       America's moral integrity was the single most important \n     weapon my platoon had on the streets of Iraq. It saved \n     innumerable lives, encouraged cooperation with our allies and \n     deterred Iraqis from joining the growing insurgency. But \n     those days are over. America's moral standing has eroded, \n     thanks to its flawed rationale for war and scandals like Abu \n     Ghraib, Guantanamo and Haditha. The last thing we can afford \n     now is to leave Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions open to \n     reinterpretation, as President Bush proposed to do and can \n     still do under the compromise bill that emerged last week.\n\n  We each need to ask ourselves, in the rush to find a ``compromise'' \nwe can all embrace, are we strengthening America's moral authority or \neroding it? Are we on the sides of the thousands of Paul Rieckhoffs in \nuniform today, or are we making their mission harder and even worse, \nputting them in greater danger if they are captured?\n  Paul writes eloquently:\n\n       If America continues to erode the meaning of the Geneva \n     Conventions, we will cede the ground upon which to prosecute \n     dictators and warlords. We will also become unable to protect \n     our troops if they are perceived as being no more bound by \n     the rule of law than dictators and warlords themselves. The \n     question facing America is not whether to continue fighting \n     our enemies in Iraq and beyond but how to do it best. My \n     soldiers and I learned the hard way that policy at the point \n     of a gun cannot, by itself, create democracy. The success of \n     America's fight against terrorism depends more on the \n     strength of its moral integrity than on troop numbers in Iraq \n     or the flexibility of interrogation options.\n\n  I wish I could say this compromise serves America's moral mission and \nprotects our troops, but it doesn't. No eloquence we can bring to this \ndebate can change what this bill fails to do.\n  We have been told in press reports that it is a great compromise \nbetween the White House and my good friends, Senator McCain, Senator \nWarner, and Senator Graham. We have been told that it protects the \n``integrity and letter and spirit of the Geneva Conventions.''\n  I wish that what we are being told is true. It is not. Nothing in the \nlanguage of the bill supports these claims. Let me be clear about \nsomething--something that it seems few people are willing to say. This \nbill permits torture. This bill gives the President the discretion to \ninterpret the meaning and application of the Geneva Conventions. This \nbill gives an administration that lobbied for torture exactly what it \nwanted.\n  We are supposed to believe that there is an effective check on this \nexpanse of Presidential power with the requirement that the President's \ninterpretations be published in the Federal Register.\n  We shouldn't kid ourselves. Let's assume the President publishes his \ninterpretation of permissible acts under the Geneva Convention. The \ninterpretation, like the language in this bill, is vague and \ninconclusive. A concerned Senator or Congresswoman calls for oversight. \nUnless he or she is in the majority at the time, there won't be a \nhearing. Let's assume they are in the majority and get a hearing. Do we \nreally think a bill will get through both houses of Congress? A bill \nthat directly contradicts a Presidential interpretation of a matter of \nnational security? My guess is that it won't happen, but maybe it will. \nAssume it does. The bill has no effect until the President actually \nsigns it. So, unless the President chooses to reverse himself, all the \npower remains in the President's hands. And all the while, America's \nmoral authority is in tatters, American troops are in greater jeopardy, \nand the war on terror is set back.\n\n  Could the President's power grab be controlled by the courts? After \nall, it was the Supreme Court's decision in Hamdan that invalidated the \nPresident's last attempt to consolidate power and establish his own \nmilitary tribunal system. The problem now is that the bill strips the \ncourts the power to hear such a case when it says ``no person may \ninvoke the Geneva Conventions . . . in any habeas or civil action.''\n  What are we left with? Unfettered Presidential power to interpret \nwhat--other than the statutorily proscribed ``grave violations''--\nviolates the Geneva Conventions. No wonder the President was so \nconfident that his CIA program could continue as is. He gets to keep \nsetting the rules--rules his administration have spent years now trying \nto blur.\n  Presidential discretion is not the only problem. The definitions of \nwhat constitute ``grave breaches'' of Article 3 are murky. Even worse, \nthey are not consistent with either the Detainee Treatment Act or the \nrecently revised Army Field Manual. These documents prohibit ``cruel, \ninhumane, or degrading treatment'' defined as ``the cruel, unusual, and \ninhumane treatment or punishment prohibited by the Fifth, Eighth, and \nFourteenth Amendments.'' The definition is supported by an extensive \nbody of case law evaluating what treatment is required by our \nconstitutional standards of ``dignity, civilization, humanity, decency, \nand fundamental fairness.'' And, I think quite tellingly, it is \nsubstantially similar to the definition that my good friend, Senator \nMcCain, chose to include in his bill. And there is simply no reason why \nthe standard adopted by the Army Field Manual and the Detainee \nTreatment Act, which this Congress has already approved, should not \napply for all interrogations in all circumstances.\n  In the bill before us, however, there is no reference to any \nconstitutional standards. The prohibition of degrading conduct has been \ndropped. And, there are caveats allowing pain and suffering \n``incidental to lawful sanctions.'' Nowhere does it tell us what \n``lawful sanctions'' are.\n  So, what are we voting for with this bill? We are voting to give the \nPresident the power to interpret the Geneva Conventions. We are voting \nto allow pain and suffering incident to some undefined lawful \nsanctions. The only guarantee we have that these provisions really will \nprohibit torture is the word of the President.\n  The word of the President. I wish I could say the words of the \nPresident were enough on an issue as fundamental as torture. Fifty \nyears ago, President Kennedy sent his Secretary of State abroad on a \ncrisis mission--to\n\n[[Page S10373]]\n\nprove to our allies that Soviet missiles were being held in Cuba. The \nSecretary of State brought photos of the missiles. As he prepared to \ntake them from his briefcase, our ally, a foreign head of state said, \nsimply, ``put them away. The word of the President of the United States \nis good enough for me.''\n  We each wish we lived in times like those--perilous times, but times \nwhen America's moral authority, our credibility, were unquestioned, \nunchallenged.\n  But the word of the President today is questioned. This \nadministration said there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, \nthat Saddam Hussein had ties to Al Qaeda, that they would exhaust \ndiplomacy before we went to war, that the insurgency was in its last \nthroes. None of these statements were true, and now we find our troops \nin the crossfire of civil war in Iraq with no end in sight. They keep \nsaying the war in Iraq is making us safer, but our own intelligence \nagencies say it is actually fanning the flames of jihad, creating a \nwhole new generation of terrorists and putting our country at greater \nrisk of terrorist attack. It is no wonder then that we are hesitant to \nblindly accept the word of the President on this question today.\n  The President said he agreed with Senator McCain's antitorture \nprovisions in the Detainee Treatment Act. Yet, he issued a signing \nstatement reserving the right to ignore them. He says flatly that ``The \nUnited States does not torture''--and then tries to bully Congress into \nallowing him to do exactly that. And even here, he has promised to \nsubmit his interpretations of the Geneva Convention to the Federal \nRegister--yet his Press Secretary announced that the administration may \nnot need to comply with that requirement.\n\n  We have seen the consequences of simply accepting the word of this \nadministration. No, the Senate cannot just accept the word of this \nadministration that they will not engage in torture given the way in \nwhich everything they have already done and said on this most basic \nquestion has already put our troops at greater risk and undermined the \nvery moral authority needed to win the war on terror. When the \nPresident says the United States doesn't torture, there has to be no \ndoubt about it. And when his words are unclear, Congress must step in \nto hold him accountable.\n  The administration will use fear to try and bludgeon anyone who \ndisagrees with them.\n  Just as they pretended Iraq is the central front in the war on terror \neven as their intelligence agencies told them their policy made \nterrorism worse, they will pretend America needs to squander its moral \nauthority to win the war on terror.\n  They are wrong, profoundly wrong. The President's experts have told \nhim that not only does torture put our troops at risk and undermine our \nmoral authority, but torture does not work. As LTG John Kimmons, the \nArmy's deputy chief of staff for intelligence, put it:\n\n       No good intelligence is going to come from abusive \n     practices. I think history tells us that. I think the \n     empirical evidence of the last five years, hard years, tell \n     us that. Any piece of intelligence which is obtained under \n     duress, through the use of abusive techniques, would be of \n     questionable credibility. And additionally, it would do more \n     harm than good when it inevitably became known that abusive \n     practices were used. We can't afford to go there.\n\n  Neither justice nor good intelligence comes at the hands of torture. \nIn fact, both depend on the rule of law. It would be wrong--tragically \nwrong--to authorize the President to require our sons and daughters to \nuse torture for something that won't even work.\n  Another significant problem with this bill is the unconstitutional \nelimination of the writ of habeas corpus. No less a conservative than \nKen Starr got it right:\n\n       Congress should act cautiously to strike a balance between \n     the need to detain enemy combatants during the present \n     conflict and the need to honor the historic privilege of the \n     writ of habeas corpus.\n\n  Ken Starr says, ``Congress should act cautiously.'' How cautiously \nare we acting when we eliminate any right to challenge an enemy \ncombatant's indefinite detention? When we eliminate habeas corpus \nrights for aliens detained inside or outside the United States so long \nas the Government believes they are enemy combatants? When we not only \ndo this for future cases but apply it to hundreds of cases currently \nmaking their way through our court system?\n  The Constitution is very specific when it comes to habeas corpus. It \nsays, ``[t]he Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be \nsuspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public \nSafety may require it.'' We are not in a case of rebellion, nor are we \nbeing invaded. Thus, we really don't have the constitutional power to \nsuspend the Great Writ. And, even if we did, the Constitution allows \nonly for the writ to be suspended. It does not allow the writ to be \npermanently taken away. Yet, this is exactly what the bill does. It \ntakes the writ away--forever--from anyone the administration determines \nis an ``enemy combatant,'' even if they are lawfully on U.S. soil and \notherwise entitled to full constitutional protections, and even if they \nhave absolutely no other recourse.\n  Think of what this means. This bill is giving the administration the \npower to pick up any non-U.S. citizen inside or outside of the United \nStates, determine in their sole and unreviewable discretion that he is \nan unlawful combatant, and hold him in jail--be it Guantanamo Bay or a \nsecret CIA prison--indefinitely. Once the Combatant Status Review \nTribunal determines that person is an enemy combatant, that is the end \nof the story--even if the determination is based on evidence that even \na military commission would not be allowed to consider because it is so \nunreliable. That person would never get the chance to challenge his \ndetention; to prove that he is not, in fact, an enemy combatant.\n  We are not talking about whether detainees can file a habeas suit \nbecause they don't have access to the Internet or cable television. We \nare talking about something much more fundamental: whether people can \nbe locked up forever without even getting the chance to prove that the \nGovernment was wrong in detaining them. Allow this to become the policy \nof the United States and just imagine the difficulty our law \nenforcement and our Government will have arranging the release of an \nAmerican citizen the next time our citizens are detained in other \ncountries.\n  Mr. President, we all want to stop terrorist attacks. We all want to \neffectively gather as much intelligence as humanly possible. We all \nwant to bring those who do attack us to justice. But, we weaken--not \nstrengthen--our ability to do that when we undermine our own \nConstitution; when we throw away our system of checks and balances; \nwhen we hold detainees indefinitely without trial by destroying the \nwrit of habeas corpus; and when we permit torture. We endanger our \nmoral authority at our great peril. I oppose this legislation because \nit will make us less safe and less secure. I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to our colleague from \nMissouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill for yielding \nme 5 minutes.\n  There is no question that this bill, this military commissions bill, \nis absolutely essential if we are going to continue to have good \nintelligence and move forward with the program of interrogating and \ncontaining detainees in an appropriate manner that will maintain our \nstanding, our honor, and puts tighter control on the United States than \nother countries do on their unlawful combatants.\n  I respectfully suggest that the Rockefeller amendment is not only \nunnecessary, but the simple fact is, the unintended effect is it would \ncomplicate the passage of this important military commissions bill. It \nwould either delay or perhaps even derail this bill, which is \nabsolutely essential if we are to get our CIA agents back in the field \ndoing appropriately limited interrogation techniques to find out what \nattacks are planned against the United States.\n  The President has pointed out, the interrogation is the thing that \nhas uncovered plots that could have been very serious. We need to have \nour CIA professionals under carefully controlled\n\n[[Page S10374]]\n\ncircumstances doing the interrogation that gets the information.\n  As to the question about whether this is about oversight, well, our \ncommittee should be all about oversight. We need to be looking at these \nthings. We need to be looking every day at what the agencies are doing, \nwhat the intelligence community is doing. But as I have said here on \nthe floor before, unfortunately, for the last 4 years, we have been \nlooking in the rearview mirror. It has been our fault, not the fault of \nthe agencies, that we have not done enough oversight because when we \nspent 2 years in the Phase I investigation, we found out the \nintelligence was flawed, the intelligence was inadequate because our \nintelligence assets were cut 20 percent in the 1990s. We had no human \nintel on the ground.\n  But, most of all, there was no pressure, no coercion by \nadministration officials of the intelligence agencies, and there was no \nmisrepresentation of the findings of the intelligence community--same \nintelligence that we in the Congress relied upon in supporting the \ndecision to go to war against the hotbed of terrorism, Iraq.\n  Now, I do not take issue with that first phase. But Phase II has cost \nus another 2 years, and we have not learned anything more than we \nlearned in the first phase and with the WMD and the 9/11 Commission.\n  If we would get back to looking out the front windshield, instead of \nlooking in the rearview mirror, we should be doing precisely this kind \nof interrogation in the oversight committee. And I take no issue with \nmany of the questions the Senator from West Virginia raises. As a \nmatter of fact, I probably would have some of my own. But I do question \nthe need for a very lengthy, detailed report every 3 months. If you \nread all of the requirements, this is a paperwork nightmare. They are \ngoing to have to comply and tell us how they are going to comply, and \nwe are going to oversee them.\n\n  I believe putting out this lengthy report gets us nowhere. Frankly, \nif our past experience is any guide, we will probably see those reports \nleaked to the press because reports have a way, regrettably, of being \nleaked and being disclosed.\n  I think there is one big problem with the Rockefeller amendment. In \nthe amendment, he requires every 3 months the Attorney General--any \ntime there are any new interrogation techniques, the Attorney General \nshall submit an unclassified certification whether or not each approved \ninterrogation technique complies with the Constitution of the United \nStates, applicable treaty statutes, Executive orders, relations, and an \nexplanation of why it complies.\n  Mr. President, what we would just order in this amendment is to \nspread out for the world--and especially for al-Qaida and its related \norganizations--precisely what interrogation techniques are going to be \nused. Let me tell you something. I visited with intelligence agents \naround the world, some of whom have been in on the most sensitive \ninterrogations we have had. I have asked them about that, and they have \nexplained to me how they interrogate people. These interrogations I \nhave learned about comply--even though they were before the passage of \nthis law--with the detainee treatment law. They do comply, and I think \nthey are appropriate. The important thing, they say, is that what the \nterrorists don't know is most important. They don't know how they are \ngoing to be questioned or what is going to happen to them. The \nuncertainty is the thing that gets them to talk. If we lay out, in an \nunclassified version, a description of the techniques by the Attorney \nGeneral, that description will be in al-Qaida and Hezbollah and all of \nthe other terrorist organizations' playbook. They will train their \nassets that: This is what you must be expected to do, and Allah wants \nyou to resist these techniques.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, I am happy to.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Is the Senator aware, when he talks about delaying \nimplementation of this program, that there are no CIA detainees? What \nare we holding up?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are passing this bill so that we can \ndetain people. If we catch someone like Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, we have \nno way to hold him, no way to ask him the questions and get the \ninformation we need, because the uncertainty has brought the program to \na close. It is vitally important to our security, and unfortunately the \nRockefeller amendment would imperil it.\n  General Hayden promised to come before the committee, and I look \nforward, in our oversight responsibilities, to hearing how they are \nimplementing this act.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. That is simply not true.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this juncture, I ask unanimous consent \nthat we step off of this amendment and allow the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico to speak for up to 10 minutes regarding the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will speak on this vital subject. I \nrise to speak in support of the Military Commission Act of 2006.\n  First off, we must all ask ourselves a very simple question: Do we \nbelieve the United States must have a terrorist attack prevention \nprogram?\n  I submit that the answer is a clear and resounding yes. I believe the \nAmerican people expect us to have a strong terrorist attack prevention \nprogram and that they believe if we don't, we are derelict in our duty. \nThey know that we are at risk, that this is a war, and that there are \nmany people out there who are waiting to do damage and harm to our \npeople. To have anything less than a terrorist prevention program, \nwhich is the best we can put together, is shameful. I cannot support \nany legislation that would prevent the CIA from protecting America and \nits citizens.\n  The legislation before us allows the Federal Government to continue \nusing one of the most valuable tools we have in our war on terror--the \nCIA terrorist interrogation program.\n  The global war on terror is a new type of war against a new type of \nenemy, and we must use every tool at our disposal to fight that war--\nnot just some tools, but all of them. These tools include interrogation \nprograms that help us prevent new terrorist attacks.\n  The CIA interrogation program is such a program. It is helping us \ndeny terrorists the opportunity to attack America. It has allowed us to \nfoil at least eight terrorist plots, including plans to attack west \ncoast targets with airplanes, blow up tall buildings across our Nation, \nuse commercial airliners to attack Heathrow Airport and bomb our U.S. \nMarine base in Africa.\n  Mr. President, clearly, this program is valuable. Clearly, this \nprogram is necessary in the global war on terror. We must take \nlegislative action that will allow the program to continue. The CIA \nmust be allowed to continue going after those who have information \nabout planned terrorist attacks against our Nation and our friends. The \nCIA must be allowed to go after those who are in combat with us.\n\n  I applaud the White House, the Senate leadership, and the Armed \nServices Committee for working together to craft a bill that, No. 1, \nauthorizes military tribunals and establishes the trial and evidentiary \nrules for such tribunals; and No. 2, clarifies the standards the CIA \nmust comply with in conducting terrorist interrogations. We must keep \nthe bill in its current form, fending off amendments that would put the \nCIA's program in jeopardy.\n  Regarding the Byrd sunset amendment, we don't know when the global \nwar on terror will end, so we cannot arbitrarily tie one hand behind \nthe CIA's back by suddenly terminating the interrogation program with a \nsunset provision.\n  We have already voted on the habeas corpus amendment, and I am glad \nwe did not add habeas provisions to this bill. We cannot give \nterrorists the right to bring a habeas corpus petition that seeks \nrelease from prison on the grounds of unlawful imprisonment, as the \nSpecter amendment would. Such legislation will clog our already \noverburdened courts.\n  Additionally, such petitions are often frivolous and disrupt \noperations at Guantanamo Bay. Examples of the frivolous petitions that \nhave been filed include an al-Qaida terrorist complaining\n\n[[Page S10375]]\n\nabout base security procedures, speed of mail delivery, and medical \ntreatment; as well as a detainee asking that normal security policies \nbe set aside so that he could be shown DVDs that are alleged to be \nfamily videos. Such petitions are not necessary.\n  The underlying bill allows appeals of judgments rendered by military \ncommissions to the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals--a \nvery significant court. These are appeals of judgments rendered by the \nmilitary commissions. That is a totally appropriate way to do it. When \nI finally understood that, I could not believe that some would come to \nthe floor and argue as they did. My colleagues have said we are \nabandoning habeas corpus; we have never done anything like this before. \nThey act as if we have decided to be totally unjust and unfair when, as \na matter of fact, this is about as fair a treatment as you could give \nterrorist suspects and still have an orderly process. I think we have \ndone the right thing. Giving terrorist suspects access to the court \nknown as the second highest court in America provides an adequate \nopportunity for review of detainees' cases.\n  I laud the occupant of the chair for explaining this matter early on \nto many of us who did not understand the issue, and it has become clear \nto many of us that we have done the right thing in terms of the habeas \ncorpus rule that we have adopted. It will be upheld, in my opinion, \nafter I have read some other cases, by the courts.\n  Mr. President, my primary standard in determining whether to support \nthis legislation is whether the legislation will allow the CIA \ninterrogation program to continue. The answer to that question must be \nyes. If the answer to that question is no, then we are foolhardy, at a \nminimum, and totally stupid at a maximum, if we decide that the kinds \nof enemies we have will not be subject to the CIA terrorist \ninterrogation program we have now. The program must continue.\n  The administration has informed me that this bill, in its current \nform, will allow the CIA terrorist interrogation program to continue. I \nsought that information as a critical piece of information before I \nstarted looking at all of the amendments to see where we were. \nTherefore, this bill must pass, and it must pass in its current form.\n  We must remember that we are dealing with terrorists, not white-\ncollar criminals. We are not even dealing with the types of prisoners \nof war there were in the Second World War, some of whom, from the \nGerman area, might have been severely abusing the rights of prisoners-\nof-war. But we still did not in any way have the situation we have now \nwith reference to prisoners of war in the Second World War.\n  We must remember that we are dealing with terrorists who know no \nlimits, follow no rules, have no orderliness about them. They are just \ngoing to do what we let them do. We must give our best--the CIA--the \ntools they need to do their job to fight this war on terror against \nthese terrorists.\n  It is my privilege to be on the side of this bill. I believe the \nAmerican people will be on the side of this bill. Some thought early \nthat it was the wrong thing to do. Just as it happens with many bills, \nwe got off on the wrong foot. But we are back straight, with both feet \non the right path, and we must pass the bill as is.\n  I wonder if those who want to destroy this bill or make it \nineffective would really ask the American people in honesty and \nsincerity, do they want the CIA program to continue or are they really \ntrying to say we should not allow the program? If my colleagues are on \nthe side of the latter, they ought to tell us and tell the American \npeople. Then we would understand whom they are for and there would be \nno question in the American people's minds.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield to the chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, the Senator from Kansas, such time as he needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, who is an ex officio member of the Intelligence \nCommittee and does extremely valuable work as we try to work in a \ncommensurate fashion on national security.\n  I rise in opposition to the amendment being offered by my good friend \nfrom West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, who is vice chairman of our \ncommittee. The amendment calls for yet another unnecessary and \nrepetitious requirement of reporting.\n  Now, I do not take issue with some of the numerous questions the \nSenator from West Virginia seeks. Some of these questions should be \nanswered in the context of our regular committee oversight.\n  The issue is not if reasonable questions are answered, but how and \nhow often. I really question the need for a formal quarterly report--\nfour times a year--unreasonable in scope and length that will be a very \nunnecessary burden on the hard-working men and women at the CIA.\n  The simple fact is that the vice chairman and other members of the \ncommittee have been fully briefed in the past, present, and prospective \nfuture about CIA's detention and interrogation operations and will \ncontinue to be briefed. The vice chairman and other members of the \nIntelligence Committee can get answers to their questions and more \nthrough the course of the committee's normal oversight activities. They \nonly need to ask.\n  I just mentioned the prospective future of the CIA's interrogation \nprogram. That is because without this legislation, there will be no CIA \nprogram. Let's be clear. If we adopt what I believe is an unnecessary \namendment, contrary with the House, this bill will end up in conference \nwith the House. If that happens, I fear the bill will languish \nthroughout the fall while Members are out campaigning. Meanwhile, the \nCIA will be unable to interrogate captured unlawful alien combatants.\n  Forgive me, Mr. President, but I think the American people deserve \nbetter than to have this Nation's efforts against al-Qaida bog down \nbecause some in this body--and I don't question their intent--are \ninsisting on an unnecessary symbolic and redundant series of reporting \nrequirements that could and will be answered through the regular \ncommittee oversight. All we have to do is ask and then to listen and \nthen to respond. Where are our priorities? Where should they be?\n  As I have listened to the debate on this bill in the relative safety \nand comfort of Capitol Hill, I cannot help but wonder whether some of \nus have lost our perspective. While we must do our duty as elected \nofficials--and we will do that--we cannot forget that we are a nation \nat war. Consequently, our first and foremost duty should be to support \nour troops and intelligence officers at home and abroad, not to mandate \nfour times a year reporting requirements that are unprecedented in \nscope and detail. The CIA will not be detecting and interdicting \nunlawful alien combatants; it will be writing one report after another.\n  I am on the side of our hard-working intelligence officers and \nagainst the terrorists. I think that is an obvious choice. I think most \nMembers would think they would be in that position. But I do not \nbelieve in making their job more difficult by legislating additional \nreporting requirements which are needless and burdensome and which will \nlikely delay enactment of this vital national security legislation.\n  If this were to pass, we can be reasonably certain that it will have \na chilling effect on interrogation operations. We are sending a signal \nto our intelligence officers to be risk averse, the very thing we don't \nwant to do. In fact, the very implication of this amendment is they are \nunable to carry out their duties with honor and respect for the law, \nand that, my colleagues, is just not true.\n  So let us do our duty, as we should, and get this bill done and to \nthe President.\n  Mr. President, I oppose the amendment and I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if I may engage my distinguished \nchairman in a colloquy. I am privileged to serve on his committee. Some \nyears ago I served on the committee and at one time was vice chairman \nof the committee. So I draw on, if I may say\n\n[[Page S10376]]\n\nwith some modesty, a long experience of working with the Intelligence \nCommittee, and, as the chairman knows, the chairman and ranking member \nof the Armed Services Committee have always had a role of participation \nin his committee. I guess if I can add up all the years as chairman and \nranking, it is about 12 or 15, I think, of my 28 years on the Armed \nServices Committee. I have watched this committee and have been a \nparticipant for many years.\n  As I read through the amendment offered by our distinguished \ncolleague from West Virginia--he has the title of vice chairman. That \ncame about because the chairman and the vice chairman traditionally on \nthis committee work to achieve the highest degree--I guess the word is \nthe committee working together as an entity.\n  I say to the chairman, it is my judgment that this amendment is \nreally in the nature of a substitute for the oversight responsibilities \nof the committee.\n  As we both know, the world environment changes overnight. This \nbusiness of trying to operate on the basis of reports is simply, in my \njudgment, not an effective way for the committee to function. The \nSenator from Kansas, as chairman, in consultation with the vice \nchairman, has to call hearings and meetings and briefings in a matter \nof hours in order to keep the committee currently informed about world \nsituations.\n  I say with all due respect to my colleagues here and to our vice \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee, this amendment is a substitute \nfor the committee's responsibilities, the basic responsibilities to be \nperformed by this committee. It is for that reason I oppose the \namendment. But I would like to have the chairman's views.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, if the chairman will yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Let me repeat what I said in my statement--and I share \nthe distinguished Senator's views, more especially from his experience \non both committees, the Intelligence Committee and the Armed Services \nCommittee. We both face the same kind of responsibilities, our \noversight responsibilities. We take them very seriously. We may have \ndifferences of opinion on the Intelligence Committee or on the Armed \nServices Committee, but we do our oversight.\n  The simple fact is that the vice chairman, myself, and other members \nof the committee--and let me stress now full membership of the \ncommittee; we worked very hard to get that access--have been fully \nbriefed in the past and the present and also prospectively of the CIA's \ndetention and interrogation operations.\n  The vice chairman and other members of the Intelligence Committee, if \npeople have problems, if people have questions, if people need to get \nmore briefs, if people want to basically get into some--I say ``some'' \nbecause I think some of the questions are not reasonable--say they have \nquestions about this, all they have to do is ask. I can guarantee as \nchairman that those in charge of this particular program at the CIA \nwill be there and have been there.\n\n  The inspector general of the CIA has briefed the committee--I am not \ngoing to get into the details of that briefing--both the vice chair and \nmyself in regards to any question on what has happened, with what has \ngone wrong allegedly or otherwise with the interrogation and detention \nprogram, and we get an update as to where are those cases. If there was \negregious behavior, what is happening to those people? Are they being \nprosecuted? And the answer to that is yes.\n  All we have to do is ask. As I look at this, I must say in scope, it \nis unprecedented. They ask questions that I think, quite frankly, if I \nwere an interrogator working within the confines of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, would have a very chilling effect on me to know \nthat four times a year I would be held responsible for all of these \nquestions which I think those in charge at the Agency can certainly \nrespond to any committee request in terms of a briefing. I would be a \nlittle nervous.\n  And that is not the case because, as I said in my remarks, the CIA \nwill not be detecting and interdicting unlawful alien combatants; it \nwill be writing one report after another, four times a year. If we look \nat the length, breadth, and depth, it is not whether we get this \ninformation, it is how we get the information. All we have to do is \nask.\n  This is a tremendous burden. I must tell my colleagues that I don't \nknow where we are going to get enough staff on the committee to respond \nto these four mandated reports. It is going to be a rather unique \nsituation when we have a lot of work to do. We have briefings, as the \nSenator from Virginia indicated, every week. We have one this \nafternoon--it is terribly important--requested by members. Yet I think \nwe are going to have to hire more people to do this if, in fact, we do \nthis, and I think the CIA will as well.\n  I am not too sure, again, if I were an individual interrogator that I \nwould want to stay in the business.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. Another observation \nof all of us who have had the responsibility of being a chairman and \nranking member of committees, I know it is sometimes difficult to get \nwitnesses to appear, but I found thus far, certainly with General \nHayden--and I have known him for a number of years--I have a high \ndegree of confidence in his ability to administer this Agency, the CIA. \nIt is of great importance to this Senator because it is in Virginia, if \nI may say. I view the agency and each and every one of its employees as \nsomeone for whom I have an obligation to speak on their behalf when \nnecessary.\n  I find that General Hayden is very forthcoming, very responsive. When \nthe Chair and ranking member desire to see him, my understanding is he \nmakes himself available. It is not as if we have to wait until a report \ncomes, read it, and then decide to bring him down. The Chair, in \nconsultation with the ranking member--he and his team are quite \nresponsive; am I not correct in that?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I am happy to respond to the distinguished chairman. \nWhat he has described is accurate. It may be the situation with General \nHayden, the Inspector General, or anybody else we request to appear \nbefore the committee that they may be in a situation where there would \nbe sensitive intelligence information that at that particular time \nwould not be provided, but there certainly would be the promise that it \nwill be provided if at all possible.\n  So I am not saying that it is a carte blanche kind of situation. That \nis to be expected. But the great preponderance of requests we make of \nthe General and of the Inspector General have been very prompt and very \nfull, and, again, all we have to do is ask.\n  It is just that--I don't want to call it a book report, but that is \nabout where we are. It is on some very important matters. I know \nmembers of the committee feel very strongly about this. I can't recall \na time when members on the committee have asked me for help to get \ninformation from the executive or from the CIA or from any of our \nintelligence agencies where I haven't worked overtime to get that job \ndone.\n  I thank the chairman for his question.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. I \nthink we have framed for the full Senate the parameters of what I \nregard are the points to be considered at such time we vote on this \namendment.\n  On that matter, I see the distinguished vice chairman and my \ncolleague. How much time remains under the control of the Senator from \nVirginia?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 8\\1/2\\ minutes remaining under the \ncontrol of the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, if I might speak for 2 or 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President I have a one-page summary. Some of the \narguments I have heard are absolutely incredible. The fact of the \nmatter is there isn't any reporting done. For 4 years this has gone on. \nPeople say: Just call them in; call in the head of the CIA, whoever it \nis, before the committee. That doesn't yield information. We have so \nmany requests for information from the CIA that have not been responded \nto. They are not responsive to the committee because they don't want to \nbe responsive to the committee, because they are directed not\n\n[[Page S10377]]\n\nto be responsive to the committee, I am assuming, by the Director of \nthe National Intelligence Office.\n\n  We don't have oversight on these programs we are talking about. \nAnybody who suggests otherwise is wrong. I heard the opposition to the \namendment say it is going to slow down the passage of the bill. Now, \nthat is brilliant. We could have started this in a timely fashion, and \nall the House has to do is accept the Senate amendment, if one were to \npass. In a heartbeat, it is done. So what is in that argument?\n  The Senator from Missouri has stated--and this is very important for \nmy colleagues to hear--that the amendment would require public \ndisclosure of the CIA's interrogation techniques. That is categorically \nfalse--wrong. It is a dangerous thing to say. It is an irresponsible \nthing to say on the floor of the Senate. The reports on the CIA program \nwould be classified and they would be sent to the congressional \nIntelligence Committees and them alone. So we need to get that straight \nright now.\n  The information that is provided in the reports is made to sound like \nwe are rewriting the Constitution 17 times in a hot summer's several \nmonths. This is information which has not been provided to us for 4 \nyears, what these reports would be asked to do, and then they could \ntaper off if we found a responsive intelligence community. But we have \nnot been provided these in 4 years. Am I meant to be worried about \nthat? Is it the job of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the House \nto do oversight? Yes, it is, and we can't because they won't give us \nthe information. The chairman can say that he and I are briefed, but \nthat is seldom and on very discrete matters that don't cover this bill.\n  So the Senator from Virginia, whom I obviously greatly respect, \nsuggests this amendment is a substitute for oversight. This amendment, \nto the contrary, is going to allow us to do oversight, and that is my \npoint. It is our responsibility under the law to do it. We cannot do \nit. We are not allowed to do it. We are systematically prevented from \ngetting information from the people who are required by law to give it \nto us. That is called not being transparent, and that is called us not \nknowing what is going on and thus not being able to help with the war \non terror.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. President, this amendment just simply requires regular reports on \ndetention and interrogation programs. It will give us access to legal \nopinions. It is essential that this amendment be adopted.\n  I just want to ask my good friend from West Virginia if he heard the \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee say that all we have to do is \nask for reports and we will get them. Did I hear that right?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senator from Michigan heard that correctly.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Well, Mr. President, just one example here. I have been \ntrying to get a memo called the second Bybee memo now for 2\\1/2\\ years. \nI haven't asked once, I haven't asked twice, I have probably asked a \ndozen times for the Bybee memo, and my good friend, the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, has asked for the Bybee memo, without any \nluck. So the idea that all we have to do is ask is just simply wrong.\n  Chairman Warner asked on May 13, 2004--2004--that all legal reviews \nand related documentation concerning approval of interrogation \ntechniques be provided to the committee. It has never been provided.\n  On April 12, 2005, I submitted questions to John Negroponte, who was \nthe nominee for the Director of National Intelligence, requesting to \nsee if the intelligence community has copies of the so-called Bybee \nmemo.\n  In April of 2005, I asked General Hayden, on his nomination to be \nDeputy National Intelligence Director, to see if he could determine if \nthe intelligence community has a copy of the second Bybee memo and to \nprovide it to the committee.\n  Then on the intelligence budget hearing, April 28, 2005, I asked \nSecretary Cambone: Can you get us a copy of the second Bybee memo? This \nhas to do with what interrogation techniques are legal. This is written \nby the Office of Legal Counsel, this memo. He says he will get a reply \nto me. That was April 2005.\n  In May of 2005, I wrote the Director of Central Intelligence, Porter \nGoss, requesting the second Bybee memo. Then I get a letter from the \nDirector of Congressional Affairs, Joe Whipple, saying the memorandum \ncan only be released by the Department of Justice. So in July, I write \nthe Department of Justice, the Attorney General: Can we get a copy of \nthe second Bybee memo? Letter after letter after letter.\n  Then there is a hearing by the Senate Intelligence Committee, July \n2005. This is a hearing on Benjamin Powell's nomination to be general \ncounsel in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. I asked \nMr. Powell: Can you provide us for the record a copy of that second \nBybee memo? That decision, we are told a week later, is not a decision \nhe can make; that is within the Department of Justice's purview, and on \nit goes.\n  Another year of stonewalling, of denial, of coverup by the Department \nof Justice of a memo which is so critically important, according to \npress reports and according now also to the acknowledgment by the \nDepartment of Justice. It sets a legal framework for the interrogation \nof detainees, and the Senate can't get a copy.\n  Apparently, two Members of the Senate, the chairman and vice chairman \nof the Intelligence Committee, have seen this memo. That is it. Members \nof the Intelligence Committee can't get it. Members of the Armed \nServices Committee can't get it. All we have to do is ask? How many \ntimes do we have to ask before we get documents?\n  There are 70 documents we still can't get from the Department of \nDefense relative to the operation of the Feith shop. All we have to do \nis ask? There are documents we have asked of the Intelligence Committee \nfor years beyond the Bybee amendment without any response.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 4 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair, and I thank my good friend from West \nVirginia for trying to get some institutional support behind these \nrequests that are made by Senators and committees frequently for \ndocuments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in consultation with my distinguished \nranking member, I would like to inquire if there is further debate \ndesired on this amendment. If not, my understanding is the leadership \nwill select a time--joint leadership--for votes on this amendment and \nothers at some point this afternoon and with the full expectation that \nthis matter will be voted on final passage.\n  So at this time, could I inquire as to the time for the Senator from \nVirginia and the Senator from Michigan?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is 18 minutes for the Senator from \nVirginia and 5 minutes 10 seconds for the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, may I inquire of the Senator from West \nVirginia as to whether, if he has completed debate on this amendment, \nhe would be willing to yield the balance of his time to the Senator \nfrom Michigan for use on the bill?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I would, with the exception of 1 minute to summarize \njust before we vote on it, so you can have the balance of the time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the balance of \nthe time of the Senator from West Virginia minus that 1 minute be \nassigned to the Senator from Michigan for use or allocation on the bill \nitself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would make a similar request that the \nbalance of my time be allocated to me for use on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Therefore, I believe all time has been yielded back on \nboth sides, and we can prepare the floor now for the receiving of an \namendment\n\n[[Page S10378]]\n\nfrom the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5088\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I believe my amendment No. 5088 is at the \ndesk, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5088.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 5088\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the protection of United States persons in the \n                 implementation of treaty obligations)\n\n       On page 83, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n       (2) Protection of united states persons.--The Secretary of \n     State shall notify other parties to the Geneva Conventions \n     that--\n       (A) the United States has historically interpreted the law \n     of war and the Geneva Conventions, including in particular \n     common Article 3, to prohibit a wide variety of cruel, \n     inhuman, and degrading treatment of members of the United \n     States Armed Forces and United States citizens;\n       (B) during and following previous armed conflicts, the \n     United States Government has prosecuted persons for engaging \n     in cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment, including the use \n     of waterboarding techniques, stress positions, including \n     prolonged standing, the use of extreme temperatures, \n     beatings, sleep deprivation, and other similar acts;\n       (C) this Act and the amendments made by this Act preserve \n     the capacity of the United States to prosecute nationals of \n     enemy powers for engaging in acts against members of the \n     United States Armed Forces and United States citizens that \n     have been prosecuted by the United States as war crimes in \n     the past; and\n       (D) should any United States person to whom the Geneva \n     Conventions apply be subjected to any of the following acts, \n     the United States would consider such act to constitute a \n     punishable offense under common Article 3 and would act \n     accordingly. Such acts, each of which is prohibited by the \n     Army Field Manual include forcing the person to be naked, \n     perform sexual acts, or pose in a sexual manner; applying \n     beatings, electric shocks, burns, or other forms of physical \n     pain to the person; waterboarding the person; using dogs on \n     the person; inducing hypothermia or heat injury in the \n     person; conducting a mock execution of the person; and \n     depriving the person of necessary food, water, or medical \n     care.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand we have an hour evenly \ndivided on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the agreement, the Senator has 25 \nminutes under his control.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have here before me the Department of \nArmy regulations and rules for interrogating prisoners. In the document \nI have here, which is the official military document to define \npermissible interrogation techniques, it outlines certain \ninterrogations which are prohibited and it lists these: forcing the \nperson to be naked, perform sexual acts, or pose in a sexual manner; \napplying beatings, electric shock, burns, or other forms of physical \npain; waterboarding; using dogs; inducing hypothermia or heat injury; \nconducting mock executions; depriving the person of necessary food, \nwater, and medical care.\n  Those techniques are prohibited by the Department of Defense. Those \ntechniques are prohibited from being used against adversaries in any \nkind of a conflict, blatant violations the requirement for humane \ntreatment, and what I would consider to be torture. Certainly the Army \nand Department of Defense have effectively found that out that these \ntechniques do not work. They have banned them and there has not been \nany objection to it.\n  What does our amendment say? Well, it says we in the United States \nare not going to tolerate those techniques if any of our military \npersonnel are captured. But not all of the people who are representing \nthe United States in the war on terror are wearing a uniform. For \nexample, we have SEALs, we have some special operations, special \nforces, we have CIA agents. We have contractors and aid workers. We \nhave more people around the world looking out after our security \ninterests than any other country in the world.\n  What does this amendment say? Well, if our military personnel are not \ngoing to do this those we capture, we are saying to countries around \nthe world: You cannot do this against any American personnel you are \ngoing to capture in this war on terror, or in any other conflict. This \namendment is about protecting American personnel who are involved in \nthe war on terror. It is saying to foreign countries: If you use any of \nthese techniques, the United States will say this is a war crime and \nyou will be held accountable. How can anybody be against that? This \nadministration has sown confusion about our commitments to the Geneva \nConventions, so that protection does not exist now. That protection \ndoes not exist now. Restoring that protection is basically what this \namendment is all about.\n  I am not going to take much time, but I just want to remind our \ncolleagues about how we viewed some of these techniques in our \nconflicts in previous wars.\n  On the issue of waterboarding, the United States charged Yukio Asano, \na Japanese officer on May 1 to 28, 1947, with war crimes. The offenses \nwere recounted by John Henry Burton, a civilian victim:\n\n       After taking me down into the hallway they laid me out on a \n     stretcher and strapped me on. The stretcher was then stood on \n     end with my head almost touching the floor and my feet in the \n     air. They then began pouring water over my face and at times \n     it was impossible for me to breathe without sucking in water. \n     The torture continued and continued. Yukio Asano was \n     sentenced to fifteen years of hard labor. We punished people \n     with fifteen years of hard labor when waterboarding was used \n     against Americans in World War II.\n\n  What about the case of Matsukichi Muta, another Japanese officer, \ntried on April 15 to 25, 1947, for, among other charges, causing a \nprisoner to receive shocks of electricity and beating prisoners. Shocks \nof electricity. He was sentenced to death by hanging. Death by hanging. \nWe could go on.\n  In another case prosecuted from March 3 to April 30, 1948--the \nJapanese officer was sentenced for exposing prisoners to extreme cold \ntemperatures, forcing them to spend long periods of time in the nude, \nmaking the prisoner stand in the cold for long periods of time, hour \nafter hour, throwing water on him and inducing hypothermia. This \nofficer received 15 years of hard labor. Fifteen years.\n  We didn't tolerate those abuses, and we should not tolerate those \nabuses inflicted on any Americans who are going to be taken in the war \non terror. That is what this amendment is all about. It will tell the \nSecretary of State to notify every signatory from 194 nations, that if \nany of their governments are going to use any of these techniques on \nany Americans that are taken in this war on terror, that we will \nconsider this a violation of the Geneva Conventions and that they will \nbe accountable.\n  This is to protect our servicemen and servicewomen, those who are in \nthe intelligence agencies, those performing dangerous duties, those who \nare not wearing the uniform in their battle against terror. We are \nputting everyone on notice.\n  We did not make up this list. All these techniques are taken right \nout of the Defense Department's code of conduct for interrogations.\n  I would take more time and review for my colleagues, where we tried \nindividuals in World War II and sentenced individuals who performed \nthese kinds of abuses on Americans to long periods of incarceration and \neven to death.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this moment I suggest the absence of a \nquorum, with the time not chargeable to either side.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. I beg your pardon. I thought my colleague yielded the \nfloor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I did. If you want to yield your time, I wouldn't object \nto it, but I object if you are calling for equal time.\n  Mr. WARNER. No, I said charged to neither side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S10379]]\n\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, do I have additional time? How much time \nhave I used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 18 minutes 20 seconds remaining on \nthe time of the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to yield myself 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it will be quite surprising to me if the \nSenate is not prepared to accept this amendment. I look back at the \ntime that we actually passed the War Crimes Act of 1996. At that time \nit was offered by Walter B. Jones, a Republican Congressman. It was \noffered in response to our Vietnam experience, where American \nservicemen--including one of our own colleagues and dear friends, \nSenator McCain--had been subject to torture during that period of time.\n  When this matter came up, both in the House of Representatives and \nthe Senate of the United States, it passed in the Senate of the United \nStates without a single objection. It passed the House by voice vote. \nThis is what it says, under War Crimes, chapter 118:\n\n       Whoever, whether inside or outside the United States, \n     commits a war crime . . .\n\n  And it talks about the circumstances--\n\n     . . . as a member of the armed forces of the United States or \n     a national United States. It is in Title 18 so those out of \n     uniform are subject to the code.\n\n  So that is the CIA. Those are the SEALS. Those are the people \ninvolved now in our war on terror. Then it continues along to define a \nwar crime as a violation of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. \nThat provision protects against cruel treatment and torture. It \nprevents the taking of hostages. It prohibits outrages upon personal \ndignity. Those are effectively the kinds of protections that act \naffords.\n  We heard a great deal from the administration, from the President, \nthat he wanted specificity in the War Crimes Act and the Geneva \nConventions in terms of what is permitted and what is not permitted. He \nfelt those terms are too vague. Well, on that he is right. There is \nconfusion in the world. There is confusion in the world about our \ncommitment to the Geneva Conventions and what we think it means. There \nis a good deal of confusion in the world in the wake of what happened \nat Abu Ghraib. There we found out that these harsh interrogation \ntechniques had been used. Sure, we have had 10 different reviews of \nwhat happened over there. What we always find out is it is the lower \nlights, the corporals and the sergeants who are the ones being tried \nand convicted. Those in the higher ranks are not. No one has stood up \nand said clearly, those are violations of the Geneva Conventions. So we \nhave Abu Ghraib, which all of us remember. And it has caused confusion.\n  We have the circumstances in Guantanamo--the conduct of General \nMiller, who brought these harsh interrogation techniques to Guantanamo \nat Secretary Rumsfeld's direction. When the Armed Services Committee \nquestioned his whole standard of conduct, he moved toward early \nretirement to avoid coming up and facing the music. This caused \nconfusion about our commitments to the Geneva Conventions.\n  Then you had the Bybee memorandum, which was effectively the rule of \nlaw for some 2 years, which permitted torture, any kind of torture, and \nit said that any individual who is going to be involved in torturing \nwould be absolved from any kind of criminality if the purpose of their \nabusing any individual was to get information and there was no specific \nintent to have bodily harm for that individual. This caused confusion \nabout our commitments to the Geneva Conventions.\n  That was the Bybee amendment. Finally, Attorney General Gonzales had \nto repudiate that or he never would have been approved as the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States. That is the record in the Judiciary \nCommittee. I sat through those hearings. I heard the Attorney General \nsay they were repudiating the Bybee memorandum on that.\n  This is against a considerable background of where we have seen some \nextraordinary abuses.\n  Then we have tried to clarify our commitment. We have the action in \nthe Senate of the United States, by a vote of 90 to 9, accepting \nSenator McCain's Amendment to prohibit cruel, inhumane, and degrading \ntreatment; to make the Army Field Manual the law of the land; to say we \nare not interested in torture. Senator McCain understands. He believes \nthat waterboarding is torture. He believes using dogs is torture. This \nis not complicated. We don't have to cause confusion. We have it \nwritten down on this list of prohibited techniques. It is not my list \nof prohibited techniques, but it is written down by the Department of \nDefense. This amendment says if a foreign country is going to practice \nthese kinds of behavior against an American national who is out there \nin the war on terror and is being picked up, we are going to consider \nthis to be a war crime. This is about protecting Americans.\n  I don't understand the hesitancy on the other side, not being willing \nto accept this amendment. Let's go on the record about what we say is \nabsolutely prohibited and what we know has been favored techniques that \nhave been used by our adversaries at other times. Let's go on the \nrecord for clarity.\n  Looking back in history, at the end of World War II and otherwise, we \nare all familiar with the different examples where these techniques--\nfrighteningly familiar to the series of techniques used in Iraq and \nGuantanamo--and are often frequently used against Americans.\n  I am reminded--I gave illustrations: electric shocks, waterboarding, \nhypothermia, heat injury. We all remember the 52 American hostages who \nwere held in the U.S. Embassy in Iran. They were subjected to the mock \nexecutions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I hope we could accept this amendment. I \nyield myself 1 more minute.\n  It basically incorporates what the Senate did several years ago with \nwar crimes. It is trying to respond to what the President says. He \nwants specificity about what is going to be prohibited and what will \nnot be.\n  The Department of Defense has found these areas to be off limits for \nthe military. All we are saying is if other countries are going to do \nthat to Americans, they are going to be held accountable.\n  This is about protecting Americans. That is the least we ought to be \nable to do for those who are risking their lives in very difficult \ncircumstances.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time not be charged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, the Senate is currently debating a bill \non how we treat detainees in our custody, and, more broadly, on how we \ntreat the principles on which our Nation was founded.\n\n  The implications are far reaching for our national security interests \nabroad; the rights of Americans at home, our reputation in the world; \nand the safety of our troops.\n  The threat posed by the evil and nihilistic movement that has spawned \nterrorist networks is real and gravely serious. We must do all we can \nto defeat the enemy with all the tools in our arsenal and every \nresource at our disposal. All of us are dedicated to defeating this \nenemy.\n  The challenge before us on this bill, in the final days of session \nbefore the November election, is to rise above partisanship and find a \nsolution that serves our national security interests. I fear that there \nare those who place a strategy for winning elections ahead of a smart \nstrategy for winning the war on terrorism.\n  Democrats and Republicans alike believe that terrorists must be \ncaught,\n\n[[Page S10380]]\n\ncaptured, and sentenced. I believe that there can be no mercy for those \nwho perpetrated 9/11 and other crimes against humanity. But in the \nprocess of accomplishing that I believe we must hold on to our values \nand set an example we can point to with pride, not shame. Those \ncaptured are going nowhere--they are in jail now--so we should follow \nthe duty given us by the Supreme Court and carefully craft the right \npiece of legislation to try them. The President acted without authority \nand it is our duty now to be careful in handing this President just the \nright amount of authority to get the job done and no more.\n  During the Revolutionary War, between the signing of the Declaration \nof Independence, which set our founding ideals to paper, and the \nwriting of our Constitution, which fortified those ideals under the \nrule of law, our values--our beliefs as Americans--were already being \ntested.\n  We were at war and victory was hardly assured, in fact the situation \nwas closer to the opposite. New York City and Long Island had been \ncaptured. General George Washington and the Continental Army retreated \nacross New Jersey to Pennsylvania, suffering tremendous casualties and \na body blow to the cause of American independence.\n  It was at this time, among these soldiers at this moment of defeat \nand despair, that Thomas Paine would write, ``These are the times that \ntry men's souls.'' Soon afterward, Washington lead his soldiers across \nthe Delaware River and onto victory in the Battle of Trenton. There he \ncaptured nearly 1,000 foreign mercenaries and he faced a crucial \nchoice.\n  How would General Washington treat these men? The British had already \ncommitted atrocities against Americans, including torture. As David \nHackett Fischer describes in his Pulitzer Prize winning book, \n``Washington's Crossing,'' thousands of American prisoners of war were \n``treated with extreme cruelty by British captors.'' There are accounts \nof injured soldiers who surrendered being murdered instead of \nquartered, countless Americans dying in prison hulks in New York \nharbor, starvation and other acts of inhumanity perpetrated against \nAmericans confined to churches in New York City.\n  Can you imagine.\n  The light of our ideals shone dimly in those early dark days, years \nfrom an end to the conflict, years before our improbable triumph and \nthe birth of our democracy.\n  General Washington wasn't that far from where the Continental \nCongress had met and signed the Declaration of Independence. But it is \neasy to imagine how far that must have seemed. General Washington \nannounced a decision unique in human history, sending the following \norder for handling prisoners: ``Treat them with humanity, and let them \nhave no reason to complain of our Copying the brutal example of the \nBritish Army in their treatment of our unfortunate brethren.''\n  Therefore, George Washington, our commander-in-chief before he was \nour President, laid down the indelible marker of our Nation's values \neven as we were struggling as a Nation--and his courageous act reminds \nus that America was born out of faith in certain basic principles. In \nfact, it is these principles that made and still make our \ncountry exceptional and allow us to serve as an example. We are not \nbound together as a nation by bloodlines. We are not bound by ancient \nhistory; our Nation is a new nation. Above all, we are bound by our \nvalues.\n\n  George Washington understood that how you treat enemy combatants can \nreverberate around the world. We must convict and punish the guilty in \na way that reinforces their guilt before the world and does not \nundermine our constitutional values.\n  There is another element to this. I can't go back in history and read \nGeneral Washington's mind, of course, but one purpose of the rule of \nlaw is to organize a society's response to violence. Allowing coercion, \ncoercive treatment, and torturous actions toward prisoners not only \nviolates the fundamental rule of law and the institutionalization of \njustice, but it helps to radicalize those who are tortured.\n  Zawahiri, bin Laden's second in command, the architect of many of the \nattacks on our country, throughout Europe and the world, has said \nrepeatedly that it is his experience that torture of innocents is \ncentral to radicalization. Zawahiri has said over and over again that \nbeing tortured is at the root of jihad; the experience of being \ntortured has a long history of serving radicalized populations; abusing \nprisoners is a prime cause of radicalization.\n  For the safety of our soldiers and the reputation of our Nation, it \nis far more important to take the time to do this job right than to do \nit quickly and badly. There is no reason we need to rush to judgment. \nThis broken process and the blatant politics behind it will cost our \nNation dearly. I fear also that it will cost our men and women in \nuniform. The Supreme Court laid out what it expected from us.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters and \nstatements from former military leaders, from 9/11 families, from the \nreligious community, retired judges, legal scholars, and law \nprofessors. All of them have registered their concerns with this bill \nand the possible impact on our effort to win the war against terrorism.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 12, 2006.\n     Hon. John Warner, Chairman,\n     Hon. Carl Levin, Ranking Member,\n     Senate Armed Services Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Warner and Senator Levin: As retired military \n     leaders of the U.S. Armed Forces and former officials of the \n     Department of Defense, we write to express our profound \n     concern about a key provision of S. 3861, the Military \n     Commissions Act of 2006, introduced last week at the behest \n     of the President. We believe that the language that would \n     redefine Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions as \n     equivalent to the standards contained in the Detainee \n     Treatment Act violates the core principles of the Geneva \n     Conventions and poses a grave threat to American service-\n     members, now and in future wars.\n       We supported your efforts last year to clarify that all \n     detainees in U.S. custody must be treated humanely. That was \n     particularly important, because the Administration determined \n     that it was not bound by the basic humane treatment standards \n     contained in Geneva Common Article 3. Now that the Supreme \n     Court has made clear that treatment of al Qaeda prisoners is \n     governed by the Geneva Convention standards, the \n     Administration is seeking to redefine Common Article 3, so as \n     to downgrade those standards. We urge you to reject this \n     effort.\n       Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions provides the \n     minimum standards for humane treatment and fair justice that \n     apply to anyone captured in armed conflict. These standards \n     were specifically designed to ensure that those who fall \n     outside the other, more extensive, protections of the \n     Conventions are treated in accordance with the values of \n     civilized nations. The framers of the Conventions, \n     including the American representatives, in particular \n     wanted to ensure that Common Article 3 would apply in \n     situations where a state party to the treaty, like the \n     United States, fights an adversary that is not a party, \n     including irregular forces like al Qaeda. The United \n     States military has abided by the basic requirements of \n     Common Article 3 in every conflict since the Conventions \n     were adopted. In each case, we applied the Geneva \n     Conventions--including, at a minimum, Common Article 3--\n     even to enemies that systematically violated the \n     Conventions themselves.\n       We have abided by this standard in our own conduct for a \n     simple reason: the same standard serves to protect American \n     servicemen and women when they engage in conflicts covered by \n     Common Article 3. Preserving the integrity of this standard \n     has become increasingly important in recent years when our \n     adversaries often are not nation-states. Congress acted in \n     1997 to further this goal by criminalizing violations of \n     Common Article 3 in the War Crimes Act, enabling us to hold \n     accountable those who abuse our captured personnel, no matter \n     the nature of the armed conflict.\n       If any agency of the U.S. government is excused from \n     compliance with these standards, or if we seek to redefine \n     what Common Article 3 requires, we should not imagine that \n     our enemies will take notice of the technical distinctions \n     when they hold U.S. prisoners captive. If degradation, \n     humiliation, physical and mental brutalization of prisoners \n     is decriminalized or considered permissible under a \n     restrictive interpretation of Common Article 3, we will \n     forfeit all credible objections should such barbaric \n     practices be inflicted upon American prisoners.\n       This is not just a theoretical concern. We have people \n     deployed right now in theaters where Common Article 3 is the \n     only source of legal protection should they be captured. If \n     we allow that standard to be eroded, we put their safety at \n     greater risk.\n       Last week, the Department of Defense issued a Directive \n     reaffirming that the military will uphold the requirements of \n     Common Article 3 with respect to all prisoners in its \n     custody. We welcome this new policy. Our servicemen and women \n     have operated for too\n\n[[Page S10381]]\n\n     long with unclear and unlawful guidance on detainee \n     treatment, and some have been left to take the blame when \n     things went wrong. The guidance is now clear.\n       But that clarity will be short-lived if the approach taken \n     by Administration's bill prevails. In contrast to the \n     Pentagon's new rules on detainee treatment, the bill would \n     limit our definition of Common Article 3's terms by \n     introducing a flexible, sliding scale that might allow \n     certain coercive interrogation techniques under some \n     circumstances, while forbidding them under others. This would \n     replace an absolute standard--Common Article 3--with a \n     relative one. To do so will only create further confusion.\n       Moreover, were we to take this step, we would be viewed by \n     the rest of the world as having formally renounced the clear \n     strictures of the Geneva Conventions. Our enemies would be \n     encouraged to interpret the Conventions in their own way as \n     well, placing our troops in jeopardy in future conflicts. And \n     American moral authority in the war would be further damaged.\n       All of this is unnecessary. As the senior serving Judge \n     Advocates General recently testified, our armed forces have \n     trained to Common Article 3 and can live within its \n     requirements while waging the war on terror effectively.\n       As the United States has greater exposure militarily than \n     any other nation, we have long emphasized the reciprocal \n     nature of the Geneva Conventions. That is why we believe--and \n     the United States has always asserted--that a broad \n     interpretation of Common Article 3 is vital to the safety of \n     U.S. personnel. But the Administration's bill would put us on \n     the opposite side of that argument. We urge you to consider \n     the impact that redefining Common Article 3 would have on \n     Americans who put their lives at risk in defense of our \n     Nation. We believe their interests, and their safety and \n     protection should they become prisoners, should be your \n     highest priority as you address this issue.\n           With respect,\n         General John Shalikashvili, USA (Ret.); General Joseph \n           Hoar, USMC (Ret.); Admiral Gregory G.

Nevertheless, S. 3930 is unacceptable in its \n     present form for the following reasons:\n       The bill arguably opens the door to the use of \n     interrogation techniques prohibited by the Geneva \n     Conventions.\n       It opens the door to the admission of evidence in military \n     commissions obtained by coercive techniques in contravention \n     of constitutional standards and international treaty.\n       It permits the prosecution to introduce evidence that has \n     not been provided to a defendant in a form sufficient to \n     allow him or her to participate in the preparation of his or \n     her defense.\n       It unduly restricts defendants' access to exculpatory \n     evidence available to the government.\n       It unduly restricts access to the courts by habeas corpus \n     and appeal.\n       It interprets the definition of Common Article 3 violations \n     to exclude sexual assaults such as those that occurred at Abu \n     Ghraib.\n       There is no doubt that the authorities entrusted with our \n     defense must be afforded the resources and tools necessary to \n     protect us from the serious threat that terrorists continue \n     to pose to all Americans, and, indeed, the civilized world. \n     But the homeland can be secured in a fashion consistent with \n     the values of due process and fair treatment for which \n     Americans have fought and for which they continue to fight. \n     We urge you to revisit and revise this legislation so that it \n     accords with our highest principles.\n           Respectfully,\n     E. Robert Goodkind,\n       President.\n     Richard T. Poltin,\n       Legislative Director and Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        The Association of the Bar\n\n\n                                      of the City of New York,\n\n                                 New York, NY, September 27, 2006.\n     Re Military Commission Act of 2006.\n\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     U.S. Senate Majority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Frist: I am writing on behalf of the \n     New York City Bar Association to urge you to oppose the \n     Administration's proposed Military Commissions Act of 2006 \n     (the ``Act''). The Association is an independent non-\n     governmental organization of more than 22,000 lawyers, \n     judges, law professors and government officials. Founded in \n     1870, the Association has a long history of dedication to \n     human rights and the rule of law, and a particularly deep \n     historical engagement with the law of armed conflict and \n     military justice.\n       The Association has now reviewed the amended version of \n     this legislation introduced on September 22, 2006, following \n     the compromise agreement between Senators Warner, McCain and \n     Graham, on one side, and the Administration on the other. The \n     compromise addresses two distinct aspects of the \n     Administration's proposal: first, the operation of the \n     military commissions which have been envisioned, and second, \n     aspects of United States enforcement of its treaty \n     obligations under the Geneva Conventions. We will address our \n     concerns in this order, keeping in mind particularly the \n     position of our members who may be called upon to serve as \n     defense counsel, prosecutors and judges in the commissions \n     process, and the interests of our members who presently or \n     may in the future serve their nation in the uniformed \n     services or in the intelligence services.\n       The compromise clarifies many of the most important \n     failings of the prior draft by bringing the military \n     commissions process far closer to the standards established \n     by the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Manual on \n     Courts-Martial. The Association shares the view presented by \n     the service judge advocates general that the existing court-\n     martial system, which in many respects is exemplary, provides \n     an appropriate process for trial of traditional battlefield \n     detainees as well as the command and control structures of \n     terrorist organizations engaged in combat with the United \n     States, and that the commissions should closely follow that \n     model. The changes produced here in that regard are therefore \n     welcome.\n       However, the bill gives the military judge discretion to \n     admit coerced testimony if, as will presumably be the case, \n     the coercion occurred before the enactment of the Detainee \n     Treatment Act on December 31, 2005. Hearsay can also be \n     admitted into evidence unless the accused carries a burden \n     (traditionally accorded to the party offering the evidence, \n     i.e., the prosecution) to show that the hearsay is not \n     probative or reliable. This shift of burden is inconsistent \n     with historical practice and would probably taint the \n     proceedings themselves, particularly if the accused is not \n     given access to the facts underlying the evidence. Admission \n     of evidence in this circumstance would discredit the \n     proceedings, undermine the appearance of fairness, and might, \n     if it was critical to a conviction, constitute a grave breach \n     of Common Article 3. These provisions do not serve the \n     interests of the United States in demonstrating the heinous \n     nature of terrorist acts, if such can be established in the \n     military commissions.\n       The enforcement provisions raise far more troubling issues. \n     In particular, we are concerned by the definition of ``cruel \n     treatment'' which does not correspond to the existing law \n     interpreting and enforcing Common Article 3's notion of \n     ``cruel treatment.'' The definition incorporates a category \n     of ``serious physical pain or suffering,'' but defines that \n     category in a way that does not encompass many types of \n     serious physical suffering that can be and are commonly the \n     result of ``cruel treatment'' prohibited by Common Article 3. \n     The Common Article 3 offense of ``cruel treatment'' will \n     remain prohibited, even if not specifically criminalized by \n     this provision. There is really no basis to doubt that Common \n     Article 3 prohibits techniques such as waterboarding, long-\n     time\n\n[[Page S10382]]\n\n     standing, and hypothermia or cold cell if indeed they are not \n     precluded as outright torture. However, the language of \n     the current draft would create a crime defined in terms \n     different from the accepted Geneva meanings, thereby \n     introducing ambiguity where none previously existed.\n       This ambiguity produces risks for United States personnel \n     since it suggests that those who employ techniques such as \n     waterboarding, long-time standing and hypothermia on \n     Americans cannot be charged for war crimes. Moreover, Common \n     Article 3 contains important protections for United States \n     personnel who do not qualify for prisoner of war treatment \n     under the Third Geneva Convention. This may include \n     reconnaissance personnel, special forces operatives, private \n     military contractors and intelligence service paramilitary \n     professionals. Erosion of Common Article 3 standards thus \n     directly imperils the safety of United States personnel in \n     future conflicts. We strongly share the perspective of five \n     former chairs of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in their appeal to \n     Congress to avoid any erosion of these protections.\n       The draft also seeks to strike the ability of hundreds of \n     detainees held as ``enemy combatants'' to seek review of \n     their cases through petitions of habeas corpus. The Great \n     Writ has long been viewed as one of the most fundamental \n     rights under our legal system. It is an essential guarantor \n     of justice in difficult cases, particularly in a conflict \n     which the Administration suggests is of indefinite duration, \n     possibly for generations. Holding individuals without \n     according them any right to seek review of their status or \n     conditions of detention raises fundamental questions of \n     justice. This concern is compounded by the draft's provision \n     that the Geneva Convention is unenforceable, thus leaving \n     detainees with no recourse should they receive cruel and \n     inhuman treatment.\n       On July 19, 2006, Michael Mernin, the chair of our \n     Committee on Military Affairs and Justice, testified before \n     the Senate Armed Services Committee concerning this \n     legislative initiative. He appealed at that time for caution \n     and proper deliberation in the legislative process and urged \n     that a commission of military law experts be convened to \n     advise Congress on the weighty issues presented. The current \n     legislative project continues to show severe flaws which are \n     likely to prove embarrassing to the United States if it is \n     enacted. We therefore strongly urge that the matter receive \n     further careful consideration before it is acted upon and \n     that the advice of prominent military justice and \n     international humanitarian law experts be secured and \n     followed in the bill's finalization.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                     Barry Kamins,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 14, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: As members of families who lost loved ones in \n     the 9/11 attacks, we are writing to express our deep concern \n     over the provisions of the Administration's proposed Military \n     Commissions Act of 2006.\n       There are those who would like to portray the legislation \n     as a choice between supporting the rights of terrorists and \n     keeping the United States safe. We reject this argument. We \n     believe that adopting policies against terrorism which honor \n     our values and our international commitments makes us safer \n     and is the smarter strategy.\n       We do not believe that the United States should \n     decriminalize cruel and inhuman interrogations. The Geneva \n     Convention rules against brutal interrogations have long had \n     the strong support of the U.S. because they protect our \n     citizens. We should not be sending a message to the world \n     that we now believe that torture and cruel treatment is \n     sometimes acceptable. Moreover, the Administration's own \n     representatives at the Pentagon have strongly affirmed in \n     just the last few days that torture and abuse do not produce \n     reliable information. No legislation should have your support \n     if it is at all ambiguous on this issue.\n       Nor do we believe that it is in the interest of the United \n     States to create a system of military courts that violate \n     basic notions of due process and lack truly independent \n     judicial oversight. Not only does this violate our most \n     cherished values and send the wrong message to the world, it \n     also runs the risk that the system will again be struck down \n     resulting in even more delay.\n       We believe that we must have policies that reflect what is \n     best in the United States rather than compromising our values \n     out of fear. As John McCain has said, ``This is not-about who \n     the terrorists are, this is about who we are.'' We urge you \n     to reject the Administration's ill-conceived proposals which \n     will make us both less safe and less proud as a nation.\n           Sincerely,\n         Marilynn Rosenthal, Nicholas H.

We are writing to express \n     our strong support for the approach taken on this issue by \n     Senators McCain, Warner and Graham and a strong, bipartisan \n     majority of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n       We read credible reports--some from FBI agents--that \n     prisoners have been stripped naked, sexually humiliated, \n     chained to the floor, and left to defecate on themselves. \n     These and other practices like ``waterboarding'' (in which a \n     detainee is made to feel as if he is being drowned) may or \n     may not meet the technical definition of torture, but no one \n     denies that these practices are cruel, inhuman, and \n     degrading.\n       Today, the question before the Congress is whether it will \n     support Sen. McCain's efforts to make it clear to the world \n     that the U.S. has outlawed such abuse or support an \n     Administration proposal which creates grave ambiguity about \n     whether prisoners can legally be abused in secret prisons \n     without Red Cross access.\n       Evangelicals have often supported the Administration on \n     public policy questions because they believe that no \n     practical expediency, however compelling, should determine \n     fundamental moral issues of marriage, abortion, or bioethics. \n     Instead, these questions should be resolved with principles \n     of revealed moral absolutes, granted by a righteous and \n     loving Creator.\n       As applied to issues of cruel, inhuman and degrading \n     treatment, the practical application of this moral outlook is \n     clear: even if it is expedient to inflict cruelty and \n     degradation on a prisoner during interrogation (and experts \n     seem very much divided on this question), the moral teachings \n     of Christ, the Torah and the Prophets do not permit it for \n     those who bear the Imago Dei.\n       It will not do to say that the President's policy on the \n     treatment of detainees already rules out torture because \n     serious ambiguities still remain--ambiguities that carry \n     heavy moral implications and that are intended to preserve \n     options that some would rather not publicly defend.\n       The terrorist attacks of September 11 were one of the most \n     heinous acts ever visited upon this nation. The Commander in \n     Chief must provide U.S. authorities with the practical tools \n     and policies to fight a committed, well-resourced, and \n     immoral terrorist threat. At the same time, the President \n     must also defend the deepest and best values of our moral \n     tradition.\n       As Christians from the evangelical tradition, we support \n     Senator McCain and his colleagues in their effort to defend \n     the perennial moral values of this nation which are embodied \n     in international law and our domestic statutes. The United \n     States Congress must send an unequivocal message that cruel, \n     inhuman and degrading treatment has no place in our society \n     and violates our most cherished moral convictions.\n           Sincerely,\n       Rev. Dr. David Gushee, Union University, Jackson, TN.\n       Gary Haugen, president, International Justice Mission.\n       Rev. Dr. Roberta Hestenes, teaching pastor, Community \n     Presbyterian Church, Danville, CA.\n       Frederica Mathewes-Green, author and commentator.\n       Dr. Brian D. McLaren, founder, Cedar Ridge Community \n     Church, Spencerville, MD.\n       Rev. Dr. Richard Mouw, president, Fuller Theological \n     Seminary.\n       Dr. Glen Stassen, professor of Christian Ethics, Fuller \n     Theological Seminary.\n       Dr. Nicholas Wolterstorff, professor of Philosophical \n     Theology, Yale University.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Now these values--George Washington's values, the \nvalues of our founding--are at stake. We are debating far-reaching \nlegislation that would fundamentally alter our Nation's conduct in the \nworld and the rights of Americans here at home. And we are debating it \ntoo hastily in a debate too steeped in electoral politics.\n  The Senate, under the authority of the Republican majority and with \nthe blessing and encouragement of the Bush-Cheney administration, is \ndoing a great disservice to our history, our principles, our citizens, \nand our soldiers.\n  The deliberative process is being broken under the pressure of \npartisanship and the policy that results is a travesty.\n  Fellow Senators, the process for drafting this legislation to correct \nthe administration's missteps has not befitted the ``world's greatest \ndeliberative body.'' Legitimate, serious concerns raised by our senior \nmilitary and intelligence community have been marginalized, difficult \nissues glossed over, and debates we should have had have been shut off \nin order to pass a misconceived bill before Senators return home to \ncampaign for reelection.\n\n[[Page S10383]]\n\n  For the safety of our soldiers and the reputation of our Nation, it \nis far more important to take the time to do the job right than to do \nit quickly and badly. There is no reason other than partisanship for \nnot continuing deliberation to find a solution that works to achieve a \ntrue consensus based on American values.\n  In the last several days, the bill has undergone countless changes--\nall for the worse--and differs significantly from the compromise \nbrokered between the Bush administration and a few Senate Republicans \nlast week.\n  We cannot have a serious debate over a bill that has been hastily \nwritten with little opportunity for serious review. To vote on a \nproposal that evolved by the hour, on an issue that is so important, is \nan insult to the American people, to the Senate, to our troops, and to \nour Nation.\n  Fellow Senators, we all know we are holding this hugely important \ndebate in the backdrop of November's elections. There are some in this \nbody more focused on holding on to their jobs than doing their jobs \nright. Some in this chamber plan to use our honest and serious concerns \nfor protecting our country and our troops as a political wedge issue to \ndivide us for electoral gain.\n  How can we in the Senate find a proper answer and reach a consensus \nwhen any matter that does not serve the majority's partisan advantage \nis mocked as weakness, and any true concern for our troops and values \ndismissed demagogically as coddling the enemy?\n  This broken process and its blatant politics will cost our Nation \ndearly. It allows a discredited policy ruled by the Supreme Court to be \nunconstitutional to largely continue and to be made worse. This \nspectacle ill-serves our national security interests.\n  The rule of law cannot be compromised. We must stand for the rule of \nlaw before the world, especially when we are under stress and under \nthreat. We must show that we uphold our most profound values.\n  We need a set of rules that will stand up to judicial scrutiny. We in \nthis Chamber know that a hastily written bill driven by partisanship \nwill not withstand the scrutiny of judicial oversight.\n  We need a set of rules that will protect our values, protect our \nsecurity, and protect our troops. We need a set of rules that \nrecognizes how serious and dangerous the threat is, and enhances, not \nundermines, our chances to deter and defeat our enemies.\n  Our Supreme Court in its Hamdan v. Rumsfeld decision ruled that the \nBush administration's previous military commission system had failed to \nfollow the Constitution and the law in its treatment of detainees.\n\n  As the Supreme Court noted, the Bush administration has been \noperating under a system that undermines our Nation's commitment to the \nrule of law.\n  The question before us is whether this Congress will follow the \ndecision of the Supreme Court and create a better system that \nwithstands judicial examination--or attempt to confound that decision, \na strategy destined to fail again.\n  The bill before us allows the admission into evidence of statements \nderived through cruel, inhuman and degrading interrogation. That sets a \ndangerous precedent that will endanger our own men and women in uniform \noverseas. Will our enemies be less likely to surrender? Will informants \nbe less likely to come forward? Will our soldiers be more likely to \nface torture if captured? Will the information we obtain be less \nreliable? These are the questions we should be asking. And based on \nwhat we know about warfare from listening to those who have fought for \nour country, the answers do not support this bill. As Lieutenant John \nF. Kimmons, the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence said, \n``No good intelligence is going to come from abusive interrogation \npractices.''\n  The bill also makes significant changes to the War Crimes Act. As it \nis now written, the War Crimes Act makes it a federal crime for any \nsoldier or national of the U.S. to violate, among other things, Common \nArticle 3 of the Geneva Conventions in an armed conflict not of an \ninternational character. The administration has voiced concern that \nCommon Article--which prohibits ``cruel treatment or torture,'' \n``outrages against human dignity,'' and ``humiliating and degrading \ntreatment''--sets out an intolerably vague standard on which to base \ncriminal liability, and may expose CIA agents to jail sentences for \nrough interrogation tactics used in questioning detainees.\n\n  But the current bill's changes to the War Crimes Act haven't done \nmuch to clarify the rules for our interrogators. What we are doing with \nthis bill is passing on an opportunity to clearly state what it is we \nstand for and what we will not permit.\n  This bill undermines the Geneva Conventions by allowing the President \nto issue Executive orders to redefine what permissible interrogation \ntechniques happen to be. Have we fallen so low as to debate how much \ntorture we are willing to stomach? By allowing this administration to \nfurther stretch the definition of what is and is not torture, we lower \nour moral standards to those whom we despise, undermine the values of \nour flag wherever it flies, put our troops in danger, and jeopardize \nour moral strength in a conflict that cannot be won simply with \nmilitary might.\n  Once again, there are those who are willing to stay a course that is \nnot working, giving the Bush-Cheney administration a blank check--a \nblank check to torture, to create secret courts using secret evidence, \nto detain people, including Americans, to be free of judicial oversight \nand accountability, to put our troops in greater danger.\n  The bill has several other flaws as well.\n  This bill would not only deny detainees habeas corpus rights--a \nprocess that would allow them to challenge the very validity of their \nconfinement--it would also deny these rights to lawful immigrants \nliving in the United States. If enacted, this law would give license to \nthis Administration to pick people up off the streets of the United \nStates and hold them indefinitely without charges and without legal \nrecourse.\n  Americans believe strongly that defendants, no matter who they are, \nshould be able to hear the evidence against them. The bill we are \nconsidering does away with this right, instead providing the accused \nwith only the right to respond to the evidence admitted against him. \nHow can someone respond to evidence they have not seen?\n  At the very least, this is worth a debate on the merits, not on the \npolitics. This is worth putting aside our differences--it is too \nimportant.\n  Our values are central. Our national security interests in the world \nare vital. And nothing should be of greater concern to those of us in \nthis chamber than the young men and women who are, right now, wearing \nour Nation's uniform, serving in dangerous territory.\n  After all, our standing, our morality, our beliefs are tested in this \nChamber and their impact and their consequences are tested under fire, \nthey are tested when American lives are on the line, they are tested \nwhen our strength and ideals are questioned by our friends and by our \nenemies.\n  When our soldiers face an enemy, when our soldiers are in danger, \nthat is when our decisions in this Chamber will be felt. Will that \nenemy surrender? Or will he continue to fight, with fear for how he \nmight be treated and with hate directed not at us, but at the patriot \nwearing our uniform whose life is on the line?\n  When our Nation seeks to lead the world in service to our interests \nand our values, will we still be able to lead by example?\n  Our values, our history, our interests, and our military and \nintelligence experts all point to one answer. Vladimir Bukovsky, who \nspent nearly 12 years in Soviet prisons, labor camps, and psychiatric \nhospitals for nonviolent human rights activities had this to say. ``If \nVice President Cheney is right, that some `cruel, inhumane, or \ndegrading' treatment of captives is a necessary tool for winning the \nwar on terrorism, then the war is lost already.''\n  Let's pass a bill that's been honestly and openly debated, not \nhastily cobbled together.\n  Let's pass a bill that unites us, not divides us.\n  Let's pass a bill that strengthens our moral standing in the world, \nthat declares clearly that we will not retreat from our values before \nthe terrorists.\n\n[[Page S10384]]\n\nWe will not give up who we are. We will not be shaken by fear and \nintimidation. We will not give one inch to the evil and nihilistic \nextremists who have set their sights on our way of life.\n  I say with confidence and without fear that we are the United States \nof America, and that we stand now and forever for our enduring values \nto people around the world, to our friends, to our enemies, to anyone \nand everyone.\n  Before George Washington crossed the Delaware, before he could \nachieve that long-needed victory, before the tide would turn, before he \nordered that prisoners be treated humanely, he ordered that his \nsoldiers read Thomas Paine's writing. He ordered that they read about \nthe ideals for which they would fight, the principles at stake, the \nimportance of this American project.\n  Now we find ourselves at a moment when we feel threatened, when the \nworld seems to have grown more dangerous, when our Nation needs to \nready itself for a long and difficult struggle against a new and \ndangerous enemy that means us great harm.\n  Just as Washington faced a hard choice, so do we. It's up to us to \ndecide how we wage this struggle and not up to the fear fostered by \nterrorists. We decide.\n  This is a moment where we need to remind ourselves of the confidence, \nfearlessness, and bravery of George Washington--then we will know that \nwe cannot, we must not, subvert our ideals--we can and must use them to \nwin.\n  Finally, we have a choice before us. I hope we make the right choice. \nI fear that we will not; that we will be once again back in the Supreme \nCourt, and we will be once again held up to the world as failing our \nown high standards.\n  When our soldiers face an enemy, when our soldiers are in danger, \nwill that enemy surrender if he thinks he will be tortured? Will he \ncontinue to fight? How will our men and women be treated?\n  I hope we both pass the right kind of legislation and understand that \nit may very well determine whether we win this war against terror and \nprotect or troops who are valiantly fighting for us.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that it not be charged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Kennedy amendment would require the \nSecretary of State to notify other countries around the world that \nseven specific categories of actions, each of which is specifically \nprohibited by the Army Field Manual, are punishable offenses under \ncommon Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions that would be prosecuted as \nwar crimes if applied to any United States person. Those seven \ncategories of actions are: (1) Forcing the detainee to be naked, \nperform sexual acts, or pose in a sexual manner; (2) applying beatings, \nelectric shock, burns, or other forms of physical pain; (3) \n``waterboarding''; (4) using military working dogs; (5) inducing \nhypothermia or heat injury; (6) conducting mock executions; and (7) \ndepriving the detainee of necessary food, water, or medical care.\n  I listened very carefully to what my colleague from Virginia, the \nChairman of the Armed Services Committee, had to say about this \namendment. He stated:\n\n       Now Senator Kennedy's amendment, depending on how the votes \n     come, and I'm of the opinion that this chamber will reject \n     it, I don't want that rejection to be misconstrued by the \n     world in any way as asserting that the techniques mentioned \n     in the amendment are consistent with the Geneva Convention or \n     that they could legitimately be employed against our troops \n     or anyone else. . . . We must not leave that impression as a \n     consequence of the decisions soon to be made by way of vote \n     on the Kennedy amendment. The types of conduct described in \n     this amendment, in my opinion, are in the category of grave \n     breaches of Common Article Three of the Geneva Convention. \n     These are clearly prohibited by the bill.\n\n  I am in complete agreement with Senator Warner that each of these \npractices is a grave breach of Common Article 3. I agree that these \npractices are unlawful today and that they will continue to be unlawful \nif this bill is enacted into law.\n  However, I am concerned that the administration may have muddied the \nrecord on these issues through its unwillingness to clearly state what \npractices are permitted, and what practices are prohibited, under \nCommon Article 3. While I reach the same conclusion as Senator Warner \nas to the lawfulness of the practices listed in the Kennedy amendment, \nI am afraid that others around the world may not.\n  We agree that these practices are prohibited by Common Article 3. We \nneed to send a clear message to the world that this is the case, so \nthat the rest of the world will abide by the same standard. That is why \nI strongly support the Kennedy amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes remain under the Senator's \ncontrol.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I want to point out why this is so necessary and so \nessential.\n  In reviewing the underlying legislation, if you look under the \nprovisions dealing with definitions on page 70 and 71, and then read \non, you will find that it is difficult to read that without having a \nsense of the kind of vagueness which I think surrounds prohibited \ninterrogation techniques. It talks about substantial risks and extreme \nphysical pain. But the statute does not have specifics to define the \nareas which are prohibited. The techniques in my amendment are the same \nones the Department of the Army and, to my best knowledge, our \ncolleague and friend from Arizona has identified. Voting for my \namendment would provide those specifics.\n  The President has asked for specificity, but he has refused to say \nwhether Common Article 3 would prohibit these kinds of acts. That has \nleft the world doubting our commitment to Common Article 3 and has \nendangered our people around the globe--those who are working for the \nUnited States in the war on terror. The administration's obfuscation \ncomes at a great risk.\n\n  This amendment provides the clarity and sends a message to the world \nthat these techniques are prohibited. They are prohibited from our \nmilitary bringing them to bear on any combatants. We interpret the \nlegislation so that any country in the world that has signed on to the \nGeneva Conventions, any of those countries that are going to practice \nactivities prohibited by the field manual, that I consider to be \ntorture, are going to be held by the United States interrogation \ncommitting a war crime. This is important. It is essential. It is \nnecessary.\n  The general concept was improved without objection a number of years \nago in the wake of the Vietnam situation, regarding the definition of \nwar crimes. We ought to restate and recommit ourselves to protecting \nAmericans involved in the war on terror and ensure they will not be \nsubject to these activities.\n  At the present time, without this amendment, it will be left open. If \nwe accept this amendment, it would make it clear it is prohibited. That \nis what we should do.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest the absence of a quorum and that it not be \nchargeable to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be laid aside so that I may offer an amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, I would simply like to make it clear in laying aside the \namendment\n\n[[Page S10385]]\n\nthe times remaining under the control of the Senator from Virginia and \nthe Senator from Michigan remain in place. We will now, to accommodate \nour distinguished senior colleague, go off of the Kennedy amendment and \nproceed to address his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be the case.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5104\n\n       (Purpose: To prohibit the establishment of new military \n     commissions after December 31, 2011)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I also thank my very \nable and distinguished friend from Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I shall offer an amendment today that provides a 5-\nyear sunset to any Presidential authorization of any military \ncommission enacted under the legislation currently being debated. This \namendment which I shall offer is essential to the ability of the \nCongress to retain its power of oversight and as an important check on \nfuture executive actions.\n  As I stand here now, Members are readying themselves to beat a path \nhome to their States--I understand that--so they may get in their final \npoliticking. Unfortunately, though, in the feverish climate of a \nlooming election, the most important business of the Senate may suffer. \nI have seen that happen over the years. This is no surprise. We have \nseen before the fever of politics can undermine the serious business of \nthe Congress once November and the winds of November draw nigh. We have \nseen the mistakes that can come when Congress rushes to legislate \nwithout the benefit of thorough vetting by committees, without adequate \ndebate, without the opportunity to offer amendments.\n  Likewise, when legislation is pushed as a means of political \nshowboating--we all know what that is--instead of by a diligent \ncommitment to our constitutional duties, the results can be disastrous.\n  In fact, there have been various proposals to bring congressional \noversight to the military tribunals which were first authorized in \nNovember, 2001. Senators Specter, Leahy, and Durbin were instrumental \nin attempting to push back against unilateral actions by the President \nto establish these commissions. These attempts were to reassert the \npower of the Congress--yes, the constitutional duty embodied in Article \nI of this Constitution that is vested in the Congress and in the \nCongress alone, to make our country's laws and specifically to make \nrules concerning captures on land and water.\n  Let me say that again. I will repeat the verbiage of the \nConstitution: to make our country's laws and specifically to ``make \nrules concerning captures on land and water.''\n  Nothing came of these proposals. Since then, the Congress has ignored \nits responsibilities and this most important issue has been shoved \naside.\n  What is this new impetus spurring congressional action and a renewed \ninterest in the issue? Did Congress find its way back to embracing its \nArticle I duties? No. Did the executive branch wake up to realize it is \nnot within its purview to dictate the laws of the land? No. It was the \nSupreme Court's decision in the Hamdan case.\n  While the President grabbed the wheel and the Congress dozed, the \nCourt stepped in to remind us of the separation of powers and the \nconstitutional role of each branch, thank God. Yes, thank God for the \nseparation of powers envisioned by our forefathers. Thank God for the \nSupreme Court. Yes, I said this before; I say it again: Thank God for \nthe Supreme Court.\n  It is no coincidence that the traditional pathways of legislation \nthrough the committee and amendment process and ample opportunity for \ndebate are the best recourse against the enactment of bad, bills.\n  This is the way the Senate was designed to operate and this is how it \nseparates in the best interests of the people.\n  Unfortunately, because of the timing of the Supreme Court's decision \nand the charged atmosphere of the midterm elections, we are again \nconfronted with slap-happy legislation that is changing by the minute.\n  The bill reported by the Senate Committee on Armed Services, which I \nsupported, was the product of a thorough process, a deliberative \nprocess. Unfortunately, this bill's progress was halted by the \nadministration's objections, and the product suffered mightily. Then, \nin closed-door negotiations with the White House, many of the successes \nannounced less than a week ago in the previous version were trashed.\n\n  When the administration met stiff opposition to its views by former \nJAG--judge advocate general--officers and previous members of its own \nCabinet, it realized it must come back to the table. Last Friday's \nversion of the bill was superseded by Monday's version, and changes are \nstill forthcoming. In such a frenzied, frenetic, and uncertain state, \nwho really knows the nature of the beast? This bill could very well be \nthe most important piece of legislation--certainly one of the most \nimportant pieces of legislation--this Congress enacts, and the adoption \nof my amendment, which I shall offer, ensures--ensures--a reasonable \nreview of the law authorizing military tribunals.\n  There is nothing more important to scrutinize than the process of \nbringing suspected terrorists to justice for their crimes in a fair \nproceeding, without the taint--without the taint--of a kangaroo court. \nThose are the values of our country. We dare not handle the matter \nsloppily. The Supreme Court has once struck down the President's \napproach to military commissions, has it not? Do we want the product of \nthis debate subjected to the same fate? Do we want it stricken also?\n  The original authorization of the PATRIOT Act is a case study of the \nrisks we run in legislating from the hip--too much haste--and how, in \nour haste, we can place in jeopardy those things we hold most dear. \nApparently, the Senate has not recognized the error of its ways. This \nlegislation is complex. This legislation defines the processes and the \nprocedures for bringing enemy combatants to trial for offenses against \nour country, and it involves our obligations under the Geneva \nConventions. This bill defines rules of evidence, it determines \ndefendants' access to secret evidence, and it seeks to clarify what \nconstitutes torture. We cannot afford to get this wrong.\n  As with the PATRIOT Act, my amendment offers us an opportunity to \nprovide a remedy for the unanticipated consequences that may arise as a \nresult of hasty congressional action. Along with the sweeping changes \nmade by the PATRIOT Act, the great hope included in it was the review \nthat was required by the sunset provision. Everyone knows the saying \nthat hindsight is 20-20, but the use of this type of congressional \nreview gives us the opportunity both to strengthen the parts of the law \nthat may be found to be weak, and to right the wrongs of past \ntransgressions.\n  So if we will not today legislate in a climate of steady \ndeliberation, then let us at least prescribe for ourselves an antidote \nfor any self-inflicted wounds. Let us prescribe for ourselves the \nremedy of reason--the remedy of reason. Let this be the age of reason \nonce more. Sunset provisions have historically been used to repair the \nunforeseen consequences of acting in haste. You have heard that haste \nmakes waste. If ever there were a piece of legislation that cries out \nto be reviewed with the benefit of hindsight, it is the current bill.\n  My amendment, which I hold in my hand, provides that opportunity \nthrough a 5-year sunset provision. Now, what is wrong with that? There \nis nothing wrong with that--a 5-year sunset provision. And I thank \nSenator Obama and I thank Senator Clinton for their cosponsorship of my \namendment. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself and \n     Mr. Obama, and Mrs. Clinton, proposes an amendment numbered \n     5104:\n\n       On page 5, line 19, add at the end the following: ``The \n     authority of the President to establish new military \n     commissions under this section shall expire on December 31, \n     2011. However, the expiration of that authority shall not be \n     construed to prohibit the conduct to finality of any \n     proceedings of a military commission established under this \n     section before that date.''.\n\n\n[[Page S10386]]\n\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are about to receive a copy of the \namendment. But I listened very carefully to my distinguished \ncolleague's remarks. As he well knows, in my relatively short 28 years \nin the Senate, I have listened to him and I have the highest respect \nfor his judgment, and particularly as it relates to how the legislative \nbody should discharge its constitutional responsibilities and how, \nalso, it should not try to discharge its constitutional \nresponsibilities. And I guess my opposition falls, most respectfully, \nin the latter category because I find this Congress has a very high \ndegree of vigilance in overseeing the exercise of the executive powers \nas it relates to the war against those whom I view as jihadists, those \nwho have no respect for, indeed, the religion which they have \nostensibly committed their lives to, and those who have no respect for \nhuman life, including their human life.\n  It is a most unusual period in the history of our great Republic. The \ngood Senator, having been a part of this Chamber for nearly a half \ncentury, has seen a lot of that history unfold. The Senator and I have \noften discussed the World War II period. That is when my grasp of \nhistory began to come into focus. And, indeed, the Senator himself was \nengaged in his activities in the war effort, as we all were in this \nNation.\n  The ensuing conflicts, while they have been not exactly like World \nWar II, have been basically engaging those individuals acting in what \nwe refer to as their adhering to a state, an existing government that \nhas promulgated rules and regulations, such as they may be, for the \norders issued to their troops, most of whom wore uniforms, certainly to \na large degree in the war that followed right after World War II, the \nKorean war. Most of those individuals in that conflict had some vestige \nof a uniform, conducting their warfare under state-sponsored \nregulations. I had a minor part in that conflict and remember it quite \nwell.\n  Vietnam came along, and there we saw the beginning of the blurring of \nstate sponsored. Nevertheless, it was present. The uniforms certainly \nlacked the clarity that had been in previous conflicts. And on the \nhistory goes.\n  But this one is so different, I say to my good friend, the Senator \nfrom West Virginia. And I think our President, given his duty as \nCommander in Chief under the Constitution, has to be given the maximum \nflexibility as to how he deals with these situations. We see that in a \nvariety of issues around here. But, nevertheless, it is the exercise of \nexecutive authority, and that exercise of executive authority must also \nbe subject to the oversight of the Congress of the United States.\n  But I feel that in the broad powers conferred on the executive branch \nto carry out its duty to defend the Nation in the ongoing threat \nagainst what we generally refer to as terrorism--but more specifically \nthe militant jihadists--we have to fight with every single tool we have \nat our disposal, consistent with the law of this Nation and \ninternational law. And, therefore, we are here in this particular time \naddressing a bill which provides for meting out justice, a measure of \njustice, to certain individuals who have been apprehended in the course \nof the war against this militant jihadist terrorist group.\n  I find it remarkable, as I have worked it through with my other \ncolleagues, that they are alien, they are unlawful by all international \nstandards in the manner they conduct the war. Yet this great Nation, \nfrom the passage of this bill, is going to mete out a measure of \njustice as we understand it.\n  Now, the Senator's concern is--and it always should be; it goes back \nto the time of George Washington and the Congress at that time--the \nfear of the overexercise of the authorities within the executive \nbranch. But I think to put a clause and restriction, such as the \nSenator recommends in his amendment, into this bill would, in a sense, \ninhibit the ability of the President to rapidly exercise all the tools \nat his disposal.\n  I say to the Senator, your bill says:\n\n       The authority of the President to establish new military \n     commissions under this section shall expire. . . . However, \n     the expiration of that authority shall not be construed to \n     prohibit the conduct to finality of any proceedings of a \n     military commission established under this section before \n     that date.\n\n  That could be misconstrued. This war we are engaged in, most notably \non the fronts of Afghanistan and Iraq today, we see where it could \nspread across our globe and has--not to the degree of the significance \nof Iraq or Afghanistan, but it has spread. Other nations have become \nthe victims, subject to the threats, subject to the overt actions such \nas took place in Spain and other places of the world. We should not \nhave overhanging this important bill any such restriction as you wish \nto impose by virtue of what we commonly call a sunset. I think that \nwould not be correct. It could send the wrong message. We have to rely \nupon the integrity of the two branches of the Congress to be ever \nwatchful in their oversight, ever unrestrained in the authority they \nhave under the Constitution. As we commonly say around here, what the \nCongress does one day, it can undo the next day.\n\n  If, in the course of exercising our authority under the doctrine of \nthe separation of powers--how many times have I heard the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia discuss the doctrine of the separation of \npowers? So often. I remember when we were vigilantly trying to protect \nthose powers reserved unto the Congress from an encroachment by the \nexecutive branch.\n  So for that reason I most respectfully say that I do not and I urge \nother colleagues not to support this amendment but to continue in their \ntrust in this institution, in the Senate and in the House, to exercise \ntheir constitutional responsibilities in such a way that we will not \nlet the executive branch at any time transcend what we believe are \ncertain parameters that we have set forth in this bill regarding the \ntrials and the conduct of interrogations.\n  I think an extraordinary legislation that I was privileged to be \ninvolved in, which garnered 90-some votes, was the Detainee Act, \nsponsored by our distinguished colleague, Mr. McCain. That was landmark \nlegislation. From that legislation has come now what we call the Army \nField Manual, in which we published to the world what America will do \nin connection with those persons--the unlawful aliens who come into our \ncustody by virtue of our military operations, and how they will be \ndealt with in the course of interrogation. That was an extraordinary \nassertion by the Congress, within the parameters of its powers, as to \nwhat they should do, the executive branch.\n  But a sunset date for the authority to hold military commissions, in \nmy judgment, is not in the best interests, at this time in this war, of \nour country.\n  I know there are other speakers. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nineteen minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator knows my great respect for him. \nIt is an abiding respect. When I look at him, I see a man--a Member of \nthis Senate--who has had vast experience and worn many coats of honor. \nI see a man who stands by his word, who keeps his word, and is always \nvery meticulous in criticizing another Senator or criticizing \nlegislation. He is most circumspect, most respectful to his colleagues, \nand most respectful to the Constitution. But I am abhorrent--I cannot \nwrite very well anymore. I would like to be able to write down words \nthat other Senators say in a debate. But I cannot write. So I may have \nmisinterpreted, or I may misstate the words. But I cannot understand \nwhy this legislation would not be in the best interests of my country.\n  I believe the Senator said--he certainly implied strongly--that this \nlegislation would not be in the best interests of our country. If I am \nwrong, I know the Senator will correct me. Let me read, though, the \namendment:\n\n       On page 5, line 19, add at the end the following: ``the \n     authority of the President to establish new military \n     commissions under this section shall expire on December 31, \n     2011. However, the expiration of that authority shall not be \n     construed to prohibit the conduct to finality of any \n     proceedings of a military commission established under this \n     section before that date.''\n\n  Mr. President, what is wrong with that language? How would that \nlanguage not be in the interest of our country? I think we are all \nsubject to\n\n[[Page S10387]]\n\nerror. Adam and Eve were driven from the Garden of Eden because of \nerror. So from the very beginning of history, the very history of \nmankind, this race of human beings, there has been evidence of errors, \nmistakes. People did not foresee the future, and this language is a \nprotection against that.\n  What is wrong with providing an expiration date for the authority \ngiven to the President in this bill, after a period of 5 years? Can we \nnot be mistaken? Might we not see the day when we wish that we had an \nautomatic opportunity to review this? Five years is a long time. Five \nyears is ample time.\n  So I must say that I am somewhat surprised that my friend, the great \nSenator from Virginia, would seek to oppose this amendment. Let me read \nit once again. This is nothing new, having sunset provisions in bills. \nI think they are good. We can always review them, and if mistakes have \nnot been made, we can renew them. There is that opportunity. But it \ndoes guarantee that there will come a time when this legislation will \nbe reviewed. Only the word of Almighty God is so perfect that there is \nno sunset provision in the Holy Writ. No. But the sunset provision \nthere is with us, and the time will come when all of us will take a \nvoyage into the sunset.\n  Mr. WARNER. May I reply at the appropriate time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely. I will yield right now.\n  Mr. WARNER. Many times, the two of us have stood right here and had \nour debates together. It is one of those rich moments in the history of \nthis institution when two colleagues, without all of the prepared text \nand so forth, can draw upon their experience and knowledge and their \nown love for the Constitution of the United States and engage.\n  I say to my good friend, 3 weeks ago, there were headlines that three \nSenators were in rebellion against their President, three Senators were \ndissidents, and on and on it went. Well, the fact is, the three of us--\nand there were others who shared our views, but somehow the three of us \nwere singled out--believed as a matter of conscience we were concerned \nabout an issue.\n  The concern was that the bill proposed by the administration, in our \njudgment, could be construed as in some way--maybe we were wrong--\nindicating that America was not going to follow the treaties of 1949--\nmost particularly, Common Article 3. Common Article 3 means that \narticle in each of these three treaties. As my good friend knows--and \nwe draw on our own individual recollections about the horrors of World \nWar II. I was involved in the foreign battlefield. We certainly knew \nabout it back here at home and studied it. I was a youngster, a skinny \nyoungster in my last year in the Navy. So much for that. But we were \nvery conscious of what was going on, and the frightful treatment of \nhuman beings as a consequence of that war.\n  The world then came together--and I say the world--after that and \nenacted these three treaties. The United States was in the lead of \nputting those treaties in. Those treaties were for the purpose of \nensuring that future mankind, generations, hopefully, would not \nexperience what literally millions of people experienced by death and \nmaiming--not only soldiers but civilians.\n  Mr. President, we believed that the administration's approach to this \ncould be interpreted by the world as somehow we were not behind those \ntreaties. If we were to put a sunset in here after all of the \ndeliberation and all of the work on the current bill that is before \nthis body, it could once again raise the specter that, well, if in fact \nthe United States was trying to not live up to the treaties that \nbrought on this debate in the Senate, then at the end of 5 years we go \nback to where we were. That could happen. We do not want to send that \nmessage. We want to send a message that this Nation has reconciled, \nhopefully, this body, as we vote this afternoon, and will send a strong \nbipartisan message that we are reconciled behind this legislation to \nensure that in the eyes of the world we are going to live fully within \nthe confines of the treaties of 1949.\n  Mr. BYRD. We are not dealing with the treaties of 1949.\n  Mr. WARNER. I respectfully say that our bill does, in my judgment. \nClearly, it constitutes an affirmation of the treaties. I would not \nwant to send a message at this time that there could come a point, \nnamely, December 31, 2011, that such assurances as we have given about \nthose treaties might expire. That is what concerns me.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am almost speechless. I listened to the \nwords that have just been uttered by my friend. My amendment does not \naffect, in any way, the portions of this bill that relate to the Geneva \nConventions.\n  It sunsets only the authority of the President to convene military \ncommissions and, of course, the Senate can renew that authority. That \nis done in many instances here. I think it is insurance for our country \nand the welfare of our country and the welfare of the people who serve \nin the military.\n  We say 5 years. Do we want to make that 6 years? Do we want to make \nit 7 years? Fine. It will expire at that time. It simply means that the \nSenate and the House take a look at it again and renew it. What is \nwrong with that?\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my friend, Mr. President, from a technical \nstandpoint, he is correct. He is going in there and incising out \nregarding commissions. But the whole debate has been focused around how \nthose commissions will conduct themselves in accordance with the common \nunderstanding of Article 3, particularly.\n  So while the Senator, in his very fine and precise way of dealing \nwith the legislation, takes out just that, it might not be fully \nunderstood beyond our shores. The headline could go out that there is \ngoing to be an expiration.\n  I say to my good friend, it is just not wise to go in and try and put \nany imprint on this that expiration could occur. It could raise, again, \nthe debate, and I do not think that is in the interest of the country. \nI think this debate, this legislation has been settled, and I don't \nthink it was ever the President's intention in the course of the \npreparation of his legislation, but some fear it could.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it could be a Democratic President, as far \nas I am concerned. I think this is wise on the part of the Senate in \nconducting its constitutional oversight, to say that we will do it this \nfar and then we will take another look at it in the light of the new \nday, in the light of the new times, the new circumstances; we will take \nanother look at it. We are not passing any judgment on that legislation \n5 years out.\n  I am flabbergasted--flabbergasted--that my friend would take umbrage \nat this legislation.\n  I only have a few minutes left.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from West Virginia yield for 3 minutes?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield 3 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I think the Senator from West Virginia is, \nmore than any other person in the history of this body, the custodian \nin his person of the Constitution of the United States. The bill that \nis before us obviously raises a number of very significant issues \ninvolving our Constitution.\n  What the amendment of Senator Byrd does very wisely is say that after \n5 years, let us double back and doublecheck--double back and \ndoublecheck--so that we can be confident that what we have done \ncomports with the Constitution of the United States. This amendment \ndoes it very carefully. It does not disturb any pending proceeding \nunder the commission. The Senator has written this amendment so \ncarefully that he says even though it will sunset, forcing us to go \nback and doublecheck, to look at our work, that it will not in any way \ndisturb any existing or pending proceeding.\n  I believe this is such an important statement of our determination \nthat we act in a way that is constitutional, not in the heat of a \nmoment which is obviously critical to us, but that we comport in every \nway with this Constitution. We ought to heed the words of Senator Byrd, \nwho understands the importance of this Constitution and that this body \nbe the guardian of the Constitution. We are the body that must protect \nthis Constitution.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And this, as he puts it, is an insurance policy that we \nwill do just that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor to \nthe Byrd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S10388]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have 4 minutes remaining; do I?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 14 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 5 minutes to my friend, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Illinois, Mr. Obama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I thank my dear friend and colleague from \nWest Virginia.\n  I am proud to be sponsoring this amendment with the senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia. He is absolutely right that Congress has abrogated \nits oversight responsibilities, and one way to reverse that troubling \ntrend is to adopt a sunset provision in this bill. We did it in the \nPATRIOT Act, and that allowed us to make important revisions to the \nbill that reflected our experience about what worked and what didn't \nwork during the previous 5 years. We should do that again with this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  It is important to note that this is not a conventional war we are \nfighting, as has been noted oftentimes by our President and on the \nother side of the aisle. We don't know when this war against terrorism \nmight end. There is no emperor to sign a surrender document. As a \nconsequence, unless we build into our own processes some mechanism to \noversee what we are doing, then we are going to have an open-ended \nsituation, not just for this particular President but for every \nPresident for the foreseeable future. And we will not have any formal \nmechanism to require us to take a look and to make sure it is being \ndone right.\n  This amendment would make a significant improvement to the existing \nlegislation, and it is one of those amendments that would, in normal \ncircumstances, I believe, garner strong bipartisan support. \nUnfortunately, we are not in normal circumstances.\n  Let me take a few minutes to speak more broadly about the bill before \nus.\n  I may have only been in this body for a short while, but I am not \nnaive to the political considerations that go along with many of the \ndecisions we make here. I realize that soon--perhaps today, perhaps \ntomorrow--we will adjourn for the fall. The campaigning will begin in \nearnest. There are going to be 30-second attack ads and negative mail \npieces criticizing people who don't vote for this legislation as caring \nmore about the rights of terrorists than the protection of Americans. \nAnd I know that this vote was specifically designed and timed to add \nmore fuel to the fire.\n  Yet, while I know all of this, I am still disappointed because what \nwe are doing here today, a debate over the fundamental human rights of \nthe accused, should be bigger than politics. This is serious and this \nis somber, as the President noted today.\n  I have the utmost respect for my colleague from Virginia. It saddens \nme to stand and not be foursquare with him. I don't know a more \npatriotic individual or anybody I admire more. When the Armed Services \nbill that was originally conceived came out, I thought to myself: This \nis a proud moment in the Senate. I thought: Here is a bipartisan piece \nof work that has been structured and well thought through that we can \nall join together and support to make sure we are taking care of \nbusiness.\n  The fact is, although the debate we have been having on this floor \nhas obviously shown we have some ideological differences, the truth is \nwe could have settled most of these issues on habeas corpus, on this \nsunset provision, on a whole host of issues. The Armed Services \nCommittee showed us how to do it.\n  All of us, Democrats and Republicans, want to do whatever it takes to \ntrack down terrorists and bring them to justice as swiftly as possible. \nAll of us want to give our President every tool necessary to do this, \nand all of us were willing to do that in this bill. Anyone who says \notherwise is lying to the American people.\n  In the 5 years the President's system of military tribunals has \nexisted, the fact is not one terrorist has been tried, not one has been \nconvicted, and in the end, the Supreme Court of the United States found \nthe whole thing unconstitutional because we were rushing through a \nprocess and not overseeing it with sufficient care. Which is why we are \nhere today.\n  We could have fixed all this several years ago in a way that allows \nus to detain and interrogate and try suspected terrorists while still \nprotecting the accidentally accused from spending their lives locked \naway in Guantanamo Bay. Easily. This was not an either-or question. We \ncould do that still.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, charged against the allocation under the \nproponent of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponent has no time remaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are under fairly rigid time control, but I will give \nthe Senator from Illinois a minute.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I will conclude, then. I appreciate the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Instead of allowing this President--or any President--to decide what \ndoes and does not constitute torture, we could have left the definition \nup to our own laws and to the Geneva Conventions, as we would have if \nwe passed the bill that the Armed Services committee originally \noffered.\n  Instead of detainees arriving at Guantanamo and facing a Combatant \nStatus Review Tribunal that allows them no real chance to prove their \ninnocence with evidence or a lawyer, we could have developed a real \nmilitary system of justice that would sort out the suspected terrorists \nfrom the accidentally accused.\n  And instead of not just suspending, but eliminating, the right of \nhabeas corpus--the seven century-old right of individuals to challenge \nthe terms of their own detention, we could have given the accused one \nchance--one single chance--to ask the Government why they are being \nheld and what they are being charged with.\n  But politics won today. Politics won. The administration got its \nvote, and now it will have its victory lap, and now they will be able \nto go out on the campaign trail and tell the American people that they \nwere the ones who were tough on the terrorists.\n  And yet, we have a bill that gives the terrorist mastermind of 9/11 \nhis day in court, but not the innocent people we may have accidentally \nrounded up and mistaken for terrorists--people who may stay in prison \nfor the rest of their lives.\n  And yet, we have a report authored by sixteen of our own Government's \nintelligence agencies, a previous draft of which described, and I \nquote, ``. . . actions by the United States government that were \ndetermined to have stoked the jihad movement, like the indefinite \ndetention of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay . . .''\n  And yet, we have al-Qaida and the Taliban regrouping in Afghanistan \nwhile we look the other way. We have a war in Iraq that our own \nGovernment's intelligence says is serving as al-Qaida's best \nrecruitment tool. And we have recommendations from the bipartisan 9/11 \ncommission that we still refuse to implement 5 years after the fact.\n  The problem with this bill is not that it is too tough on terrorists. \nThe problem with this bill is that it is sloppy. And the reason it is \nsloppy is because we rushed it to serve political purposes instead of \ntaking the time to do the job right.\n  I have heard, for example, the argument that it should be military \ncourts, and not Federal judges, who should make decisions on these \ndetainees. I actually agree with that.\n  The problem is that the structure of the military proceedings has \nbeen poorly thought through. Indeed, the regulations that are supposed \nto be governing administrative hearings for these detainees, which \nshould have been issued months ago, still haven't been issued. Instead, \nwe have rushed through a bill that stands a good chance of being \nchallenged once again in the Supreme Court.\n  This is not how a serious administration would approach the problem \nof terrorism. I know the President came here today and was insisting \nthat this is supposed to be our primary concern. He is absolutely right \nit should be our primary concern--which is why we should be approaching \nthis with a somberness and seriousness that this administration has not \ndisplayed with this legislation.\n  Now let me make clear--for those who plot terror against the United\n\n[[Page S10389]]\n\nState, I hope God has mercy on their soul, because I certainly do not.\n  For those who our Government suspects of terror, I support whatever \ntools are necessary to try them and uncover their plot.\n  We also know that some have been detained who have no connection to \nterror whatsoever. We have already had reports from the CIA and various \ngenerals over the last few years saying that many of the detainees at \nGuantanamo shouldn't have been there--as one U.S. commander of \nGuantanamo told the Wall Street Journal, ``Sometimes, we just didn't \nget the right folks.'' And we all know about the recent case of the \nCanadian man who was suspected of terrorist connections, detained in \nNew York, sent to Syria, and tortured, only to find out later that it \nwas all a case of mistaken identity and poor information. In the \nfuture, people like this may never have a chance to prove their \ninnocence. They may remain locked away forever.\n  The sad part about all of this is that this betrayal of American \nvalues is unnecessary.\n  We could have drafted a bipartisan, well-structured bill that \nprovided adequate due process through the military courts, had an \neffective review process that would've prevented frivolous lawsuits \nbeing filed and kept lawyers from clogging our courts, but upheld the \nbasic ideals that have made this country great.\n  Instead, what we have is a flawed document that in fact betrays the \nbest instincts of some of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--\nthose who worked in a bipartisan fashion in the Armed Services \nCommittee to craft a bill that we could have been proud of. And they \nessentially got steamrolled by this administration and by the \nimperatives of November 7.\n  That is not how we should be doing business in the U.S. Senate, and \nthat is not how we should be prosecuting this war on terrorism. When we \nare sloppy and cut corners, we are undermining those very virtues of \nAmerica that will lead us to success in winning this war. At bare \nminimum, I hope we can at least pass this provision so that cooler \nheads can prevail after the silly season of politics is over.\n  I conclude by saying this: Senator Byrd has spent more time in this \nChamber than many of us combined. He has seen the ebb and flow of \npolitics in this Nation. He understands that sometimes we get caught up \nin the heat of the moment. The design of the Senate has been to cool \nthose passions and to step back and take a somber look and a careful \nlook at what we are doing.\n  Passions never flare up more than during times where we feel \nthreatened. I strongly urge, despite my great admiration for one of the \nsponsors of the underlying bill, that we accept this extraordinarily \nmodest amendment that would allow us to go back in 5 years' time and \nmake sure what we are doing serves American ideals, American values, \nand ultimately will make us more successful in prosecuting the war on \nterror about which all of us are concerned.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia, may I have 10 seconds?\n  Mr. WARNER. I am going to give the Senator more than 10 seconds. I \nhave to do a unanimous consent request on behalf of the leadership.\n\n\n                         Order Vitiated--S. 295\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the order with respect to S. 295 be \nvitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  No objection.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand there is no objection. Will the Chair kindly \nrule?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield such time as Mr. Byrd wishes to \ntake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Virginia. I merely \nwanted to thank the distinguished Senator from Illinois, Mr. Obama, for \nhis statement. I think it was well said, I think it was wise, and I \nthank him for his strong support of this amendment.\n  I also close by asking that the clerk once again read this amendment. \nI will then yield the floor. I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my good friend, I fully \nunderstand what you endeavor to do here, and I respectfully strongly \ndisagree with it. I think many of us share this. This is going to be a \nvery long war against those people whom we generically call terrorists. \nIn the course of that war, this President and his successor must have \nthe authority to continue to conduct these courts-martial--these trials \nunder these commissions--and not send out a signal to terrorists: If \nyou get under the time limit and you don't get caught, this thing may \nend.\n  Mr. WARNER. If you are not caught within this period of time, when \nthis went into effect, then you are no longer going to be held \naccountable. I, and I think every Member of this body, regret that this \nNation or other nations or a consortium of nations have not captured \nOsama bin Laden. There is a debate going on about that, and I am not \ngoing to get into that debate, but the fact is he is still at large. \nThere could be other Osama bin Ladens, and it may take years to \napprehend them, no matter how diligently we pursue them. We cannot send \nout a signal that at this definitive time, it is the responsibility of \nthe President, of the executive branch, to hold those accountable for \ncrimes against humanity. They would not be held accountable if this \nprovision went into power.\n  Need I remind this institution of the most elementary fact that every \nSenator understands, that what we do one day can be changed the next. \nIf there comes a time when we feel this President or a subsequent \nPresident does not exercise authority consistent with this act, \nCongress can step in, and with a more powerful action than a sunset, a \nvery definitive action.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding I have a few minutes left under \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The time of the Senator from \nVirginia is 9\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would like to have that time transferred under my time \non the bill as a whole. I hope Senator Cornyn, who has expressed an \ninterest in this, gets the opportunity to use that time to address this \namendment.\n  Now, Mr. President, as I look at the number of Senators who are \ndesiring to speak on my side--and I think perhaps it would be helpful \nif you could, I say to my colleague, the ranking member, check on the \nother side--we still have some debate, and we are prepared to get into \ndebate on the Kennedy amendment now. Therefore, I will undertake to do \nthat just as soon as I finish.\n  But then we are in that time period where all time has expired or \nutilized or otherwise allocated on the several amendments. We will soon \nreceive an indication from the leadership as to the time to vote on the \nstacked votes. But under the time reserved for the bill, I have, of \ncourse, the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, and Senator \nGraham are going to be given by me such time as they desire, and then \nsubject to the time utilized by those two Senators, I would hope to \nhave time for Senator Hutchison, Senator Chambliss, and again Senator \nCornyn, Senator Grassley, and Senator McConnell, the distinguished \nmajority whip.\n  So I am going to manage that as fairly and as equitably as I can. \nThat is what we propose to do. I will go into the subject of the \nKennedy amendment right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am afraid that the way this now is set \nup, the Senator from Virginia has about six speakers who will have \ntime, and we have on this side, because of the interest in the \namendment process, used up our time and had to use time on the bill, so \nthat on our side we only have--how much time left on the bill, if I \ncould inquire of the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 4 minutes \nremaining on the bill. The Senator from Vermont has 12 minutes \nremaining on the bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And the Senator from Massachusetts has how many minutes on \nhis amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 7 minutes \n20 seconds.\n\n[[Page S10390]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time all together on the majority side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the bill, 50 minutes; on the Kennedy \namendment, 30 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think everybody ought to recognize the situation we are \nin. I hope we will withhold our comments until those on the other side \nwho have been indicated as having time allocated to them speak so that \nwe will have some time to respond to them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5088\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would now like to address the amendment \noffered by the senior Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I have read this very carefully and I have studied it, I say to my \ngood friend. There are certain aspects of this amendment that are well-\nintentioned. But I strongly oppose it, and I do encourage colleagues to \noppose it, because the question of the separation of powers is involved \nhere, and that is the subject on which this Chamber has resonated many \ntimes. But here I find the amendment invades the authority of the \nexecutive branch in the area of the conduct of its foreign affairs by \nrequiring the Secretary of State to notify other state parties to the \nGeneva Conventions of certain U.S. interpretations of the Geneva \nConventions, in particular Common Article 3 and the law of war.\n  It is up to the executive branch in its discretion to take such \nactions in terms of its relations with other several states in this \nworld--not the Congress directing that they must do so--such \ncommunications with foreign governments. But in the balance of powers, \nit is beyond the purview of the Congress to say to the Secretary of \nState: You shall do thus and so.\n  This bill speaks for itself by defining grave breaches of Common \nArticle 3 that amount to war crimes under U.S. law. Any congressional \nlisting of specific techniques should be avoided simply because \nCongress cannot foresee all of the techniques considered to maybe fall \nwithin the category of cruel and inhuman conduct, and therefore, they \nwould become violations of Article 3. We can't foresee all of those \nsituations. Again, it is the responsibility of this body to administer, \nto see that this bill becomes law in a manner of oversight.\n  Senator Kennedy's amendment, depending on how the vote comes--and I \nam of the opinion that this Chamber will reject it--I don't want that \nrejection to be misconstrued by the world in any way as asserting that \nthe techniques mentioned in the amendment are consistent with the \nGeneva Conventions or that they could legitimately be employed against \nour troops or anyone else. We must not leave that impression as a \nconsequence of the decision soon to be made by way of a vote on the \nKennedy amendment.\n  The types of conduct described in this amendment, in my opinion, are \nin the category of grave breaches of Common Article 3 of the Geneva \nConventions. These are clearly prohibited by our bill. Rather than \nlisting specific techniques, Congress has exercised its proper \nconstitutional role by defining such conduct in broad terms as a crime \nunder the War Crimes Act. The techniques in Senator Kennedy's amendment \nare not consistent with the Common Article 3 and would strongly protest \ntheir use against our troops or any others.\n  So I say with respect to my good friend, this is not an amendment \nthat I would in any way want to be a part of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to inquire of the Senator \nfrom Virginia, and I yield myself 3 minutes. As I understand, one of \nthe reasons this amendment is being rejected is because of the burden \nthat it is going to place on our State Department to notify the 194 \ncountries that we expect, if these techniques are used against \nAmericans, they would be considered a war crime. That is a possible \ndifficulty for us? That is a burden for our State Department? Or, \nrather is he objecting because, we can't foresee all of the different \nkinds of techniques that might be used against individuals and \ntherefore we shouldn't list these. We list them in the Army Field \nManual specifically. They are not pulled out of the air; they are \nlisted specifically in the Army Field Manual. That is where they come \nfrom. And a number of the Members on the other side of the aisle have \nsaid that those techniques are prohibited. So we have taken the \nDepartment of Defense list and incorporated it.\n  Then the last argument is that: Well, if it is rejected, we don't \nwant this to be interpreted as a green light for these techniques. \nThere must be stronger arguments. Maybe I am missing something around \nhere. With all respect, I have difficulty in understanding why the \nSenator from Virginia, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \ndoes not address the fundamental issue which is included in this \namendment, and that is this amendment protects Americans who are out on \nthe front lines of the war on terror, the SEALS, the CIA, others who \nare fighting, and it gives warning to any country: You go ahead with \nany of these techniques and you are committing a war crime and will be \nheld accountable.\n  Now, if I could get a good answer to that, I would welcome it, but I \nhaven't heard it yet. With all respect, I just haven't heard why the \nSenator is refusing and effectively denying--opposition to this \namendment is denying that kind of protection. I read, and it was when \nthe Senator was here, when we found out that similar kinds of \ntechniques were used against Americans in World War II, and we \nsentenced offenders to 10, 15 years and even executed some. Now we are \nsaying: Oh, no, we can't list those because it is going to be a bother \nto our State Department, notifying these countries. My, goodness.\n  There has to be a better reason that we are not going to protect our \nservice men and women from these kinds of techniques. We are saying to \nthose countries: If you use these techniques, you are a war criminal. \nWhat are those techniques? They are in the Department of Defense \nlisting. That is what they are. How often are they used? I gave the \nillustrations of how they were used repeatedly, whether it has been by \nIran or whether it has been by Japan, or any of our adversaries in any \nother war.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 3 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 1 minute. I want to put in the Record the \nexcellent letter from Jack Vessey, who is a distinguished former Joint \nChief of Staff:\n\n       I continue to read and hear that we are facing a different \n     enemy in the war on terror. No matter how true that may be, \n     inhumanity and cruelty are not new to warfare nor to enemies \n     we have faced in the past. In my short 46 years in the armed \n     forces, Americans confronted the horrors of the prison camps \n     of the Japanese in World War II, the North Koreans in 1950 to \n     1953, and the North Vietnamese in the long years of the \n     Vietnam War, as well as knowledge of the Nazi's holocaust \n     depredations in World War II. Through those years, we held to \n     our own values. We should continue to do so.\n\n  The Kennedy amendment does it. That is what this amendment is about. \nI reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 12, 2006.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Sometimes, the news is a little \n     garbled by the time it reaches the forests of North-central \n     Minnesota, but I call your attention to recent reports that \n     the Congress is considering legislation which might relax the \n     United States support for adherence to Common Article 3 of \n     the Geneva Convention. If that is true, it would seem to \n     weaken the effect of the McCain Amendment on torture of last \n     year. If such legislation is being considered, I fear that it \n     may weaken America in two respects. First, it would undermine \n     the moral basis which has generally guided our conduct in war \n     throughout our history. Second, it could give opponents a \n     legal argument for the mistreatment of Americans being held \n     prisoner in time of war.\n       In 1950, 3 years after the creation of the Department of \n     Defense, the then Secretary of Defense, General George C. \n     Marshall, issued a small book, titled The Armed Forces \n     Officer. The book summarized the laws and traditions that \n     governed our Armed Forces through the years. As the Senate \n     deals with the issue it might consider a short quote from the \n     last chapter of that book which General Marshall sent to \n     every American Officer. The last chapter is titled \n     ``Americans in Combat'' and it lists 29 general propositions \n     which govern the conduct of Americans in war. Number XXV, \n     which I long ago underlined in my copy, reads as follows:\n\n[[Page S10391]]\n\n       ``The United States abides by the laws of war. Its Armed \n     Forces, in their dealing with all other peoples, are expected \n     to comply with the laws of war, in the spirit and the letter. \n     In waging war, we do not terrorize helpless non-combatants, \n     if it is within our power to avoid so doing. Wanton killing, \n     torture, cruelty or the working of unusual hardship on \n     enemy prisoners or populations is not justified in any \n     circumstance. Likewise, respect for the reign of law, as \n     that term is understood in the United States, is expected \n     to follow the flag wherever it goes. . . .''\n\n       For the long term interest of the United States as a nation \n     and for the safety of our own forces in battle, we should \n     continue to maintain those principles. I continue to read and \n     hear that we are facing a ``different enemy'' in the war on \n     terror; no matter how true that may be, inhumanity and \n     cruelty are not new to warfare nor to enemies we have faced \n     in the past. In my short 46 years in the Armed Forces, \n     Americans confronted the horrors of the prison camps of the \n     Japanese in World War II, the North Koreans in 1950-53, and \n     the North Vietnamese in the long years of the Vietnam War, as \n     well as knowledge of the Nazi's holocaust depredations in \n     World War II. Through those years, we held to our own values. \n     We should continue to do so.\n       Thank you for your own personal courage in maintaining \n     those values, both in war and on the floor of the Senate. I \n     hope that my information about weakening American support for \n     Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention is in error, and if \n     not that the Senate will reject any such proposal.\n           Very respectfully,\n                               General John W. Vessey, USA (Ret.).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my distinguished colleague used two \nphrases just now. He said: Burden. He used the word burden. He then \nsaid the word bother. Senator, you walk straight into the \nconstitutional separation of powers in your language and you say: The \nSecretary of State shall--that is a direct order--notify other parties \nto the Geneva Conventions. You are putting a direct order to the \nexecutive branch. I say that is a transgression of the long \nconstitutional history of this country and the doctrine of separation \nof powers.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator support it if we changed it to \n``shall,'' that you, the chairman of our committee, will make that \nrequest and the President will go ahead and notify and follow those \ninstructions?\n  Mr. WARNER. Senator, I am not in the business of trying to amend your \namendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am just trying to accommodate you. You are saying that \nthis is a constitutional issue. I just offered to try to accommodate \nthe Chairman so we can ensure we are protecting American servicemen \nfrom torture--from torture. And the response is: Well, it is going to \nviolate the Constitution. I am interested in getting results.\n  But I hear the Senator say that it is unconstitutional that my \namendment says Department of State shall notify other countries that if \nthey are going to torture, they are going to be held accountable, and \nwe are being defeated on the floor of the U.S. Senate because the \nopponents are saying that is unconstitutional and we cannot find a way \nto do it. I find this unwillingness to compromise is outrageous.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to call the roll on this one.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this point I wish to have such time as \nremains under the control of the Senator from Virginia accorded to me \nunder the control of the time on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time will be so allocated.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to inform the Chamber that we are \nat that juncture where we will consider the statements of others, very \nimportant statements to be made. I listed them in a recitation of those \nwho have indicated their desire to speak. But I also bring to the \nattention of the body that I have just been told by the leadership they \nare anxious to proceed to the votes.\n  At this time I would ask--if I can get my colleague's attention--that \nthere be yeas and nays on all of the pending amendments remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the yeas and nays may be \nrequested on all pending amendments.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator withhold that request for 2 minutes? Will \nthe Senator withhold?\n  Mr. WARNER. Surely.\n  Mr. President, we will now put in a quorum call to accommodate the \nranking member, such that the time is not charged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the managers, together with the guidance \nfrom their respective leaders, are endeavoring to do the following. \nThere are three amendments to be voted on and then final passage. We \nhope to have as much time used on the bill as we can, to be consumed \nprior to the initiation of the votes. But then subsequent to the three \nvotes, there will be a block of time. A Senator on this side has \nreserved 12 minutes. I intend to reserve, on my side, time to Senator \nMcCain. I am trying to work in that category of time following the \nvotes. But until we are able to reconcile this, I ask that we now \nproceed.\n  Let me allow the Senator from Georgia to proceed. He has indicated a \ndesire to speak for 5 or so minutes at this time. But I hope Senators \nare following what the two managers are saying. Those desiring to speak \non the bill, with the exception of Senator McCain, would they kindly \ncome down and utilize this time before the amendments start?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Military \nCommissions Act of 2006. This historic legislation is the result of \nmuch work, thought, and debate.\n  I commend the administration, I commend Senator Warner, Senator \nMcCain, Senator Graham, and all those who were involved in the ultimate \ncompromise we have come to on this very sensitive and very complex \nissue. I am pleased we were able to find common ground on this critical \nissue and ensure that the President can authorize the appropriate \nagencies to move forward with an appropriate interrogation program.\n  There is no question that this program provides essential \nintelligence that is vital to America's success in the war on \nterrorism. At the same time, it honors our agreement under the Geneva \nConventions and underscores to other nations that America is a nation \nof laws. This has been a difficult issue and I am pleased that both \nsides worked so diligently to achieve this result. In this new era of \nthreats, where the stark and sober reality is that America must \nconfront international terrorists committed to the destruction of our \nway of life, this bill is absolutely necessary. Our prior concept of \nwar has been completely altered, as we learned so tragically on \nSeptember 11, 2001. We must address threats in a different way. If we \nare going to get at the root of terrorist activity, we need to be able \nto get critical information to do so.\n  There has been much discussion during the course of the drafting of \nthis bill about the rule of law, and the rule of law relative to \ndetainees is, indeed, reflected in this bill. It provides for \ntribunals, for judges, for counsel, for discovery, and for rules of \nevidence.\n  Most importantly, however, in my view, is that while this bill \nprovides important rule of law procedures for illegal enemy combatants, \nit does not give them the same protections which we afford lawful enemy \ncombatants or our own military personnel, and that is a critical \ndistinction. And that is how it ought to be. We have made that \ndistinction for no other reason than to provide incentive for every \nnation across the world to observe international agreements for the \nproper treatment of captives. It bears repeating--this bill applies to \nthe trial of illegal enemy combatants--those who make no pretense \nwhatsoever of conformity with even minimal standards or international \nnorms of civilized behavior when it comes to the treatment of those \nthey capture.\n\n  We hear repeatedly that we should be concerned about what we do, for \nfear that we encourage others to treat our captured service men and \nwomen in a similar manner. But let's be very clear here and state what \nevery American knows to be true. The al-Qaida terrorists treat our \ncaptured service men and women by beheading them and by dragging their \nbodies through the streets.\n\n[[Page S10392]]\n\nThey need no encouragement or excuse for their actions by reference to \nour treatment of their captives.\n  As a result of the Supreme Court's ruling, we are creating military \ncommissions that provide rule of law protections which are embodied in \nthis bill--courts, judges, legal counsel, and rules of evidence. So \nthis bill appropriately meets our international obligations and \nAmerica's sense of what is right and it is in keeping with our highest \nvalues.\n  However, this bill will allow the President to move forward with a \nterrorist interrogation program that will ensure that we continue to \nget critical information about those who are plotting to carry out \nhateful acts against America and against Americans.\n  I commend the President for his determination to respond to the new \nreality confronting us. I commend Chairman Warner and my colleagues on \nthe Armed Services Committee who worked in good faith to craft a bill \nwhich is the right bill to respond to the challenges we face. And \nagain, I am pleased we were able to find common ground on this critical \nissue and ensure that the President can move forward with an \nappropriate interrogation program.\n  I think it is important that we send a bill to the White House, to \nthe desk of the President that is exactly the same as the bill that has \nalready been passed by the House so we can put this program in place \nimmediately. The way we do that is to continue to defeat all the \namendments that have been put forward, and that we send the President \nthe same bill that has already been passed by the House so that this \nprogram can be reinitiated immediately.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague from \nGeorgia, a very valued member of the Armed Services Committee who has \nfrom time to time participated in the extensive deliberations and \nconsultations with regard to how the original bill which we worked on \nshould be shaped and finally amended. I thank him.\n  Again, I call to the attention of colleagues that I shall put in a \nquorum for the purpose of trying to accommodate Members on my side who \ndesire to speak.\n  I now see the distinguished Senator from South Carolina. We are \nprepared to allocate to him such time as he may desire. How much time \ndoes he need?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Would 15 minutes be OK?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, in 15 minutes I will try to explain the \nprocesses as I know it to be in terms of how we arrived at this moment.\n  No. 1, I am glad we are here. I think the country is better off \nhaving the bill voted on in the current fashion.\n  I have gotten to know Senator Warner very well over the last 30 days. \nI had a high opinion of the Senator before this process started, but I, \nquite frankly, am in awe of his ability to stand up for the institution \nas a U.S. Senator, who was a former Secretary of the Navy, who tried to \nhave a balanced approach about what we are trying to do.\n  It is no secret that Senator McCain is one of my closest friends in \nthis body, and I respect him in so many ways. But unlike myself and \nmost of us, Senator McCain paid a heavy price while serving this \ncountry. He and his colleagues in Vietnam were treated very poorly as \nprisoners of war. When he speaks about the Geneva Conventions, he does \nso as someone who has been in an environment where the Conventions \nwould not apply. But Senator McCain believes very strongly in the \nGeneva Conventions. When it comes to the Vietnam war, he has told me \nmore than once that if it were not for the insistence of the United \nStates and the international community that constantly pushed back \nagainst the North Vietnamese, he thought the torture would have \ncontinued and all of them would eventually be killed. But the North \nVietnamese became concerned about international criticism after a point \nin time.\n  While the Geneva Conventions were not applied evenly by any means, it \ndid have an effect on the North Vietnamese.\n  I have been a military lawyer for over 20 years. I have had the honor \nof wearing the Air Force uniform while serving my country and being \naround great men and women in uniform. It has been one of the \nhighlights of my life. I have never been shot at. The only people who \nwanted to kill me were probably some of my clients. But I do appreciate \nwhy the Geneva Conventions exist and the fact that the law of armed \nconflict is a body of law unique to itself and has a rich tradition in \nour country and throughout the world and it will work to make us safe \nand live within our values if we properly apply it.\n  The reason we are here is because the Supreme Court ruled in the \nHamdan case that the military commissions authorized by the President \nwere in violation of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. They \nwere not regularly constituted courts.\n  It surprised me greatly that the Supreme Court would find that the \nGeneva Conventions applied to the war on terror. It was President \nBush's assumption and mine, quite frankly, that humane treatment would \nbe the standard. But this enemy doesn't wear a uniform; it operates \noutside the Conventions, doesn't represent a nation, and, therefore, \nwould not be covered. But the Supreme Court came to a different \nconclusion. Thus, we are here.\n  I say to my fellow Americans, it is not a weakness, it is strength \nthat we have three branches of government. It is not healthy for one \nbranch of government to dominate the other two at a time of stress.\n  I have pushed back against the administration when I believed they \nwere pushing the executive power of the inherent authority of the \nPresident too far. Even though we are in a time of war, there is plenty \nof room for the Congress and the courts.\n  What I tried to do in helping draft this bill, working with the \nPresident and working with our friends on the other side, is come up \nwith a product that would create a balance that I think would serve us \nwell.\n  My basic proposition that I have applied to the problem is we are at \nwar, that 9/11 was an act of war, and since that moment in time our \nNation has been at war with enemy combatants who do not wear a uniform, \nwho do not represent a nation but are warriors for their cause, just as \ndedicated as Hitler was to his cause, and they are just as vicious and \nbarbaric as any enemy we have ever fought.\n  But we don't need to be like them to win. As a matter of fact, we \nneed to show the world that we are different than them.\n  When the Geneva Conventions were applied to the war on terror, we had \na problem. We had to renew the Military Commission Tribunal in line \nwith Common Article 3. Common Article 3 is a mini-human-rights tree \nthat is common to all four Convention articles. You have one about \nlawful combatants and unlawful combatants, civilians and wounded \npeople. Common Article 3 is throughout all of the treaties regarding \nthe Geneva Conventions. It says you would have to have a regularly \nconstituted court to pass judgment or render sentences against those \nwho are in your charge during time of war; that is, unlawful \ncombatants.\n  The problem with the military commission order authorized by the \nPresident was that it deviated from the formal Code of Military \nJustice, the court-martial model, without showing a practical reason. \nWithin our Uniform Code of Military Justice, it says military \ncommissions are authorized, but they need to be like the court-martial \nsystem to the extent practicable.\n  What I am proud of is we have created a new military commission based \non the UCMJ and deviations are there because of the practical need. A \ncourt martial is not the right forum to try enemy combatants--non-\ncitizen terrorists--the military commission is the right forum, but we \nare basing what we are doing on UCMJ, and the practical differences, I \nthink, will be sustained by the Court.\n  The confrontation rights that were originally posed by the \nadministration gave me great concern. I do not believe that to win this \nwar we need to create a trial procedure where the jury can receive \nevidence classified in nature, convict the accused, and the accused \nnever knows what the jury had to render a\n\n[[Page S10393]]\n\nverdict upon, could not answer that accusation, rebut or examine the \nevidence.\n  That was the proposal which I thought went too far and that would \ncome back to haunt us. As a result of this compromise, it has been \ntaken out.\n  We have a national security privilege available to the Government to \nprotect that prosecutor's file from being given over to the defense or \nto the accused so our secrets can be protected. But we will now allow \nthe prosecutor to give that to the jury and let them bring it out on \nthe side of the accused and the accused never knowing what he was \nconvicted upon. That could come back to haunt us if one of our soldiers \nfalls into enemy hands.\n  We would not want a future conviction based on evidence that our \nsoldiers and CIA operative never saw. I think we have a military \ncommission model that affords due process under the law of war that our \nNation can be proud of, that will work in a way to render justice, and \nif a condition is abstained, it will be something we can be proud of as \na nation. I am hopeful that the world would see the condition based on \nevidence, not vengeance.\n  My goal is to render justice to the terrorists, even though they will \nnot render justice to us. That is a big distinction.\n  People ask me, Why do you care about the Geneva Conventions? These \npeople will cut our heads off and they will kill us all. You are \nabsolutely right. Why do I care?\n  Because I am an American. And we have led the way for over 50-\nsomething years when it comes to the Geneva Conventions applications.\n  I am also a military lawyer, and I can tell every Member of this \nbody--some of them have served in combat unlike myself; some know \nbetter than I. But we have had downed pilots in Somalia. A helicopter \npilot was captured by militia in Somalia. We dropped leaflets all over \nthe city of Mogadishu. We told the militia leaders, ``If you harm a \nhelicopter pilot, you will be a war criminal.'' We blared that \nthroughout town on loudspeakers with helicopters. After a period of \ntime, they got the message, and he was released.\n  We had two pilots shot down over Libya when Reagan bombed Qadhafi. I \nwas on active duty in the Air Force. We told Qadhafi directly and \nindirectly, if they harm these two pilots, they will be in violation of \nthe Geneva Conventions, and we will hunt you down to the ends of the \nEarth.\n  I want to be able to say in future wars that there is no reason to \nabandon our Geneva Conventions obligations to render justice to these \nterrorists.\n  So not only do we have a military commission model that is Geneva \nConventions compliant; we have a model that I think we should be proud \nof as a nation.\n\n  The idea that the changes between the committee bill and the \ncompromise represents some grave departure, quite frankly, I vehemently \ndisagree with. I didn't get into this discussion and political fight to \ntake all the heat that we have taken to turn around and do something \nthat undercuts the purpose of being involved in it to begin with. The \nevidentiary standard that will be used in a military commission trial \nof an enemy combatant was adopted from the International Criminal \nCourt.\n  I will place into the Record statements from every Judge Advocate \nGeneral in all four branches of the services that have certified from \ntheir point of view that the evidentiary standard that the judge will \napply to any statements coming into evidence against an enemy combatant \nare legally sufficient, will not harm our standing in the world, and, \nin fact, are the model of the International Criminal Court which try \nthe war criminals on a routine basis.\n  The provision I added, along with Senator McCain, dealing with the \nprovisions of the Detainee Treatment Act, 5th, 8th, and 14th amendment \nconcepts within the Detainee Treatment Act, will also be a standard in \nthe future designed to reinforce the relevance of the Detainee \nTreatment Act in our national policy, in our legal system, not to \nundermine anything but to enforce the concept the Detainee Treatment \nAct and the judicial standard that our military judges will apply to \nterrorists accused is the same that is applied in International \nCriminal Court.\n  I have been a member of the JAG court for over 20 years. I have had \nthe honor of serving with many men and women who will be in that court-\nmartial scene. The chief prosecutor, Moe Davis, I met as a captain. \nThere is no finer officer in the military than Colonel Davis. He is \ncommitted to render justice. I am very proud of the fact that the men \nand women who will be doing these military commissions believe in \nAmerica just as much as anybody I have ever met, and they want to \nrender justice.\n  What else do we try to accomplish?\n  We reauthorize the military commissions in a way to be Geneva \nConventions-compliant to afford the defendants accused due process in \nthe way that will not come back to haunt us.\n  What else did we have to deal with? A CIA program that is classified \nin nature that needs to continue. There is a debate in this country: \nShould we have a CIA interrogation program classified in nature that \nwould allow techniques not in the Army Field Manual to get good \nintelligence from high value targets? The answer, from my point of \nview, is yes, we should, but not because we want to torture anybody, \nbecause we want to be inhumane as a nation. The reason we need a CIA \nprogram classified in nature to get good information is because in this \nwar information saves lives.\n  Mutual assured destruction was the concept of the Cold War, where if \nthe Soviet Union attacked us, they knew with certainty they would be \nwiped out. That concept doesn't work when your enemy doesn't mind \nkilling themselves when they kill you. The only way we will protect \nourselves effectively is to know what they are up to before they act. \nThe way you find that out is to have good intelligence. But you have to \ndo it with your value system.\n  Abu Ghraib was an aberration, but it has hurt this country. Anytime \nthe world believes America has adopted techniques and tactics that are \nnot of who we are, we lose our standing. So what we did regarding the \nCIA, we redefined the War Crimes Act to meet our Geneva Conventions \nobligations. The test for the Congress was, how can you have a \nclandestine CIA program and then not run afoul of the Geneva \nConventions? What are the Geneva Conventions requirements of every \ncountry that signs the treaty to outlaw domestically gray areas of the \ntreaty?\n  In Article 129 and 130 of the Geneva Conventions, it puts the burden \non each country to do it internally, to create laws to discipline their \nown personnel who may violate the treaty in a grave way. It lists six \noffenses that would be considered grave breaches of the treaty under \nthe conventions. Those six offenses were taken out of the treaty and \nput in our domestic law, title 18, the War Crimes Act, and anybody in \nour Government who violates that War Crimes Act is subject to being \npunished as a felon.\n  We added three other crimes we came up with ourselves.\n  Torture has always been a crime, so anyone who comes to the Senate \nand says the United States engages in torture, condones torture, that \nthis agreement somehow legitimizes torture, you don't know what you are \ntalking about. Torture is a crime in America. If someone is engaged in \nit, they are subject to being a felon, subject to the penalty of death. \nNot only is torture a war crime, serious physical injury, cruel and \ninhumane treatment mentally and physically of a detainee is a crime \nunder title 18 of the war crimes statute.\n  Every CIA agent, every military member now has the guidance they need \nto understand the law. Before we got involved, our title 18 War Crimes \nAct was hopelessly confusing. I couldn't understand it. We brought \nclarity. We have reined in the program. We have created boundaries \naround what we can do. We can aggressively interrogate, but we will not \nrun afoul of the Geneva Conventions. We are not going to let our people \ncommit felonies in the name of getting good information, but now they \nknow what they can and cannot do.\n  Who complies with that treaty? Who is it within our Government who \nwould implement our obligations under the treaty? The Congress has \ndecided what a war crime would be to prohibit grave breaches of the \ntreaty. The President, this President, like every other President, \nimplements treaties. So what we\n\n[[Page S10394]]\n\nsaid in this legislation, when it comes to nongrave breaches, all the \nother obligations of the Geneva Conventions, the President will have \nthe responsibility constitutionally to comply with those obligations, \nnot to rewrite title 18, not to sanction torture, not to violate the \nDetainee Treatment Act, but to fulfill the treaty the way every other \nPresident has in our constitutional history. That is all we have done. \nTo say otherwise is just political rhetoric. Not only have we allowed \nthe CIA program to go forward in a way not to violate the Geneva \nConventions, we have delegated to the President what was already our \nconstitutional responsibility to enforce the treaty--not to rewrite it \nbut to enforce it and fulfill it.\n\n  My concern was that in the process of complying with Hamdan, we would \nbe seen by the world as redefining the treaty for our own purposes. We \nhave not redefined the Geneva Conventions. We have, for the first time \nin our domestic law, clearly defined what a crime would be against the \nGeneva Conventions, and we have told the President, as a Congress: It \nis your job to fulfill the other obligations outside of criminal law. \nThat is the way it should be, and it is something of which I am \nextremely proud.\n  We have been at war for over 5 years. Here we are 5 years later \ntrying to figure out the basic legal infrastructure. It has been \nconfusing. It has been contentious. We have had two Supreme Court cases \nwhere the Government's work product was struck down.\n  My hope is that our homework will be graded by the Supreme Court, \nthat this bill eventually will go to our Federal courts, as it should, \nand the courts will say the following: the military commissions are \nGeneva Conventions compliant and meet constitutional standards set out \nby our country when it comes to trying people.\n  I am confident the court will rule that way. I am confident the \nSupreme Court will understand that the power we gave the President to \nfulfill the treaty is consistent with his role as President and the war \ncrimes we have written to protect the treaty from a grave breach from \nour own people is written in a way to sustain legal scrutiny.\n  I am also confident that Congress has finally cleared up what has \nbeen a huge problem. What role should a judge have in a time of war? \nWho should make the decision regarding enemy combatant status?\n  In every war we have been in up until now, the military has decided \nthe battlefield issues. Under the Geneva Conventions, it is a military \ndecision to consider who an enemy combatant is. The habeas cases that \nhave existed in our courts from the last 3 or 4 years have led to \ntremendous chaos at Guantanamo Bay. Our own troops are being sued by \nthe people we are fighting. They are bringing every kind of action you \ncan think of into Federal courts. Over 200 cases have been filed. It is \nimpeding the war effort.\n  A judge should not make a military decision during a time of war. The \nmilitary is far more capable of determining who an enemy combatant is \nthan a Federal judge. They are not trained to do that.\n  We have replaced a system where the judges of this country can take \nover military decisions and allow judges to review military decisions, \nonce made, for legal sufficiency. That is the way every other country \nin the world does it. Habeas has no place in this war for enemy \nprisoners. The Germans and the Japanese--no prisoner in the history of \nthe United States has ever been able to go to a Federal court and sue \nthe people they are fighting who are protecting us against the enemy.\n  We are allowing the Federal courts to review every military decision \nmade about an enemy combatant as to whether they made the right \ndecision based on competent evidence and whether the procedures they \nused are constitutional. We have rejected the idea as a Congress of \nallowing the courts to run the war when it comes to defining who an \nenemy combatant is. That was a decision which needed to be made. It is \nnot destroying the writ of habeas corpus. It is having a rational, \nbalanced approach to where the judges can play a meaningful role in \ntime of war and not play a role they are not equipped to play. This \nwill mean nothing if it does not withstand court scrutiny.\n  I hope soon we will have an overwhelming vote for the final product \nafter the amendments are disposed of. My goal for 2 years has been to \ntry to find national unity, to have the Congress, the executive branch, \nand eventually the courts on the same sheet of music where we can tell \nthe world at large that we have detention policies, interrogation \npolicies, and confinement policies that not only are humane and just \nbut will allow us to protect ourselves from a vicious enemy and live up \nto our obligations as a nation. We are very close to that day coming.\n  I thank every Member of this Senate who has worked to make this \nproduct better. When you cast a vote, please remember, we are at war, \nwe are not fighting crime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we now have an additional speaker, the \nSenator from Texas.\n  As the Senator from South Carolina has just completed his remarks, I \nhave to say it has been an unusual experience for all of us these past \nweeks. Working together with Senator McCain and the Senator from South \nCarolina has enabled this Senate to proceed in a way that is consistent \nwith Senate practices: namely, have a committee go through a bill, have \na markup, and then proceed to work on a product. It brought together \nthe consensus.\n  I say to my friend from South Carolina, although I have had some \nmodest experience as Secretary of the Navy dealing with court-martials, \nand, indeed, when I was a young officer in the Marines, I was involved \nin court-martials, the Senator brought together in this bill, in this \ndeliberation, a very special expertise of the years he has had.\n  Now he is a full colonel in the U.S. Air Force and a Judge Advocate \nGeneral recognition. I thank the Senator for his invaluable \ncontribution to putting the series of bills we have had--putting into \nthose bills matters which he believed were in the best interests of the \nmen and women of the Armed Forces and, indeed, his consultation \nthroughout this process with the Judge Advocate Generals and other past \nand present Judge Advocates and some of the younger officers who will \nbe future Judge Advocate Generals. I thank the Senator from South \nCarolina for his strong contribution to this deliberative process in \nthe Senate.\n  Now I yield the floor to our last speaker before we proceed to the \nvotes. As I understand, we will be voting at the conclusion of this \nstatement?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I don't know if the unanimous consent agreement has been \nfinished yet. That is our hope.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are finishing a unanimous consent request, but I alert \nthe Senate that it is my strong hope and prediction we will soon be \nvoting in sequence on three amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I first compliment the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, the Senator from \nVirginia, for being the calm and steady hand on the rudder during the \ncourse of the discussions and debates involving this important piece of \nlegislation. His work and demeanor have always been constructive and \ncivil, and any disagreements we have had are befitting of the great \ntraditions of this institution. I thank him for that.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I may, I thank the Senator from Texas. Several times \nwe came to the Senator's office in the course of the deliberations on \nthis bill because the Senator, too, brings to the debate a vast \nexperience, having risen through the ranks of the legal profession to \nbecome a judge in his State. The Senator is very well equipped and did \nprovide a very valuable input into this debate.\n  Mr. CORNYN. My thanks to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. President, not everyone who has been engaging in this debate has \nbeen as constructive. We have heard some outlandish statements that \nbear correction, some suggesting this bill would actually permit the \nuse of torture. Nothing--nothing--could be further from the truth. In \nfact, what this bill does is make sure that the provisions of the \nDetainee Treatment Act,\n\n[[Page S10395]]\n\nwhich were passed in December of 2005 in this same Senate, that ban \ntorture, cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment of detainees, that we \ncomply with those laws which reflect upon our international treaty \nobligations as well as our domestic laws and which reflect our American \nvalues.\n  We are a nation at war. But there is no equivalency with the way this \nwar is fought and prosecuted by the United States and our allies, no \nequivalency with the manner in which the war is prosecuted by our \nenemies. We have learned that our enemies have been at war against us \nfor much longer than just September 11, 2001, and date back many years \nbefore we even realized America was under attack.\n  We know that this enemy, represented by Islamic extremism, justifies \nthe use of murder against innocent civilians in order to accomplish its \ngoals.\n  America complies with all of its international treaty obligations and \ndomestic laws. What this bill is about is to try to provide our \nintelligence authorities the clear direction they need so they know how \nto comply with those laws and, at the same time, preserve an absolutely \ncritical means of collecting intelligence through the interrogation of \nhigh-value detainees at Guantanamo Bay.\n  But no civilian employee of the U.S. Government working at the CIA or \nelsewhere is going to risk their career, their reputation, and their \nassets using some sort of cloudy law or gray law that does not make \nclear what is permitted and what is not permitted. This bill we are \nprepared to pass in a few minutes provides that kind of clear \ndirection. What it says is that we in the U.S. Congress are stepping up \nto take the responsibility ourselves to provide that kind of clarity \nthat will allow our intelligence authorities to gain this important \nintelligence while at the same time be secure in the knowledge that \nwhat they are doing fully complies with our law, including our \ninternational treaty obligations.\n  We know the aggressive interrogation techniques that are legal under \nthe provisions of the McCain amendment in the Detainee Treatment Act \nhave provided much valuable intelligence that has saved American lives. \nWe know the CIA's high-value terrorist detainee program works. For \nexample, detainees have provided the names of approximately 86 \nindividuals whom al-Qaida deemed suitable for Western operations. Half \nof these individuals have now been removed from the battlefield and are \nno longer a threat to the United States of America or our allies.\n  This program is effective and has saved American lives and must be \npreserved. Yet there are people who would go so far as to intimate that \nwe are torturing people. But we are not torturing people. But we are \nusing legal, aggressive interrogations consistent with the U.S. \nConstitution, U.S. laws, and our treaty obligations. In doing so, we \nare keeping faith with the American people that the Federal Government \nwill use every legal means available to us to keep the American people \nsafe.\n  Now, we may disagree--and we do disagree on the Senate floor--with \nthe level of rights that an accused terrorist should have. I happen to \nbelieve these individuals, who are high-value detainees at Guantanamo \nBay, do not deserve the same panoply of rights preserved for American \ncitizens in our legal system. But I would hope that we would all agree \nthat the CIA interrogation program must continue. We must not allow the \nbrave patriots who conduct these interrogations to be at risk \nunnecessarily by providing a gray zone as opposed to absolute clarity \ninsofar as it is within our power to give it so that we may interrogate \nthese captured terrorists to the fullest extent of the law.\n  To suggest that we are somehow torturing individuals or violating our \nown laws that we passed just last year in the Detainee Treatment Act \nunder the McCain amendment banning torture, cruel and inhuman \ntreatment, is absolutely untrue and irresponsible. The American people \nhave a right to believe we will use every legal tool available to us to \nhelp keep them safe against this new and different type of enemy.\n  Let me just say a word about who that enemy is. We have heard we are \nengaged in a global war on terror, and that is absolutely true. But it \ndoes not necessarily tell us who that enemy is. Unfortunately, it is an \nenemy that has hijacked one of the world's great religions, Islam, in \npursuit of their extremist goals that justifies the murder of innocent \ncivilians in order to accomplish those goals.\n  Some on the Senate floor have said this debate is all about Iraq. It \nis not just about Iraq. If it were just about Iraq, how would those \ncritics explain the attempted terrorist plot that was broken up at \nHeathrow Airport just a few short weeks ago, or the attacks in Madrid \nor Beslan in Russia or Bali or elsewhere or, for that matter, New York \nand Washington, DC?\n  The fact is, we have prevented another terrorist attack on our own \nsoil by using this interrogation program to allow us to detect and \ndeter and disrupt terrorist activity, and the fact we have also taken \nthe fight on the offensive where the terrorists plot, plan, train, and \ntry to export their terrorist attacks to the United States and \nelsewhere.\n  If we would do what some would apparently want us to do and simply \npull the covers over our head and wish the bad people would go away, \nAmerica would be less safe and we would not be able to stand here and \nsay that due to the vigilance of the American people, due to the \nvigilance of the U.S. Congress and the executive branch of Government, \nwe have been successful, thank goodness, in preventing another \nterrorist attack on our own soil, after 5 years from September 11, \n2001.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope our colleagues will vote against these ill-\nadvised amendments to this bill and will send a clean bill to be \nreconciled with the House version and sent to the President right away \nso that before too long we can see that some of the war criminals who \nsit detained at Guantanamo Bay may be brought to justice, people like \nKhalid Shaikh Mohammed, who was the mastermind of the 9/11 plot that \nkilled nearly 3,000 Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nTexas. He has been a valuable addition to those who are trying to \nstructure this piece of legislation.\n  Momentarily, I will seek a unanimous consent request ordering the \nvotes and the allocation of such time as remains between Senators.\n  So at this point in time, I will suggest the absence of a quorum, \nunless the Senator from Massachusetts would like to take the additional \n3 minutes that he has at this time on his amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just quickly, the proceedings we are \ngoing to have--if I can inquire--I use the 3 minutes, and then we are \nmoving toward a series of votes; is that right?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Then, I would ask when I have 30 seconds left--Mr. \nPresident, I have 3\\1/2\\ minutes; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Three minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I may have misunderstood my colleague. \nThat is the 3 minutes remaining on your amendment held in abeyance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is correct.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself the 3 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5088\n\n  Mr. President, just for the benefit of the membership, in my hand is \nthe Army manual. In the Army manual are the prohibitions for \ninstructions to all the interrogators of the United States, that they \ncannot use these kinds of harsh tactics which have been recognized by \nMembers as torture.\n  This amendment says if any country is going to use those similar \ntactics against those who would be representing the United States in \nthe war on terror--for example, the Central Intelligence Agency; for \nexample, the SEALs; for example, contractors working for the \nintelligence agency--then they will have committed a war crime.\n  I reviewed earlier in the debate where we have prosecuted Japanese \nand other war crimes, giving them 10 or 15 years, and even execution \nwhen they went ahead with this. That is why this is so important.\n  Now, my good friend, the chairman of the committee, says we cannot do \nit\n\n[[Page S10396]]\n\nbecause it violates the Constitution because it is instructing--\ninstructing--the President of the United States through the State \nDepartment to notify the 194 countries.\n  Well, we thought it was not unconstitutional on the Port Security \nAct, when we said:\n\n       When the Secretary . . . , after conducting an assessment . \n     . . , decides that an airport does not maintain and carry out \n     effective security measures, the Secretary . . . shall notify \n     the appropriate authorities of the government of the foreign \n     country. . . .\n\n  Here is port security.\n  Here is on the pollution issues:\n\n       The Secretary of State shall notify without delay foreign \n     states concerned. . . .\n\n  That is the second one.\n  And I have the third illustration in terms of foreign carriers.\n  In 15 minutes we got these cases. And here we are going to say we are \ngoing to refuse to protect Americans who are on the cutting edge of the \nwar on terror because we will not let our State Department go on an e-\nmail and notify the 192 countries because that is unconstitutional? If \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee feels that way, we could \nstrike that provision and just say it is the policy of the United \nStates. Then we would not be instructing anyone. Either way, this is \nabout protecting Americans. It is about protecting Americans.\n  I believe those Americans who are out there in the hills and in the \nmountains of Afghanistan today and tonight, those people who are in the \nhills and mountains and deserts of Iraq, those people who are out in \nSoutheast Asia or all over the world in order to try to deal with the \nproblems of terrorism ought to know, if they are in danger of getting \ncaptured, if any of their host countries are going to perform this kind \nof procedure and torture on them, they will be war criminals.\n  That is what this amendment is about. I hope it will be accepted. It \nshould be.\n  Mr. President, I yield what time I have to my ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time we are waiting for clearance \nby the leadership of the UC. But I will ask at this time we get the \nyeas and nays on all the votes, the amendments and final passage.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, without objecting, does any unanimous \nconsent request allow me to close on my amendment for 2 minutes?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the UC, as presently drafted, gives 2 \nminutes to each side for the purpose of addressing amendments.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I once again restate the request for the \nyeas and nays on the amendments and final passage. I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be in order to ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendments and final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendments and final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that any remaining \ntime be yielded back, other than as noted below, and that the Senate \nproceed to votes in relation to the amendments in the following order:\n  The Rockefeller amendment No. 5095, the Byrd amendment No. 5104, and \nthe Kennedy amendment No. 5088.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that there be 4 minutes for debate, \nequally divided, prior to each of the above votes.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that prior to passage of the bill, \nSenator Leahy be recognized for his remaining 12 minutes and, as set \nforth in the initial unanimous consent request, which was provided for \nunder the original consent order, Senator Levin be in control of 4 \nminutes, Senator Warner in control of 16 minutes, to be followed by \nclosing remarks by the two leaders and, following that time, the Senate \nproceed to passage of the bill; further, that there then be 5 minutes \nequally divided prior to the vote on invoking cloture on the border \nfence legislation; provided further that with respect to the border \nfence bill, it be in order to file second degrees at the desk no later \nthan 5 p.m. today under the provisions of rule XXII.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I did not \nunderstand the part about the fence.\n  Mr. WARNER. Can the Senator repeat that?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I did not understand the part about the timing of the \nfence bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will repeat it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Just that part.\n  Mr. WARNER. It reads as follows: Following that time, the Senate \nproceed to passage of the bill; further, there then be 5 minutes \nequally divided prior to the vote on invoking cloture on the border \nfence legislation; provided further that with respect to the border \nfence bill, it be in order to file second degrees at the desk no later \nthan 5 p.m. today under the provisions of rule XXII.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, even though I believe we have made a \nterrible and tragic mistake in the Senate, including major changes in \nour constitutional rights willy-nilly to get out to campaign, I realize \nthey have locked this in and there is not much one can do about it. I \nthink it is a farce in the Senate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I renew the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5095\n\n  There will now be 4 minutes of debate, equally divided, on the \nRockefeller amendment.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, my amendment would require, as I \nexplained this morning, the CIA to provide the Congressional \nIntelligence Committees, which are required by law to be informed of \nwhat is going on in the intelligence world, fully the most basic and \nfundamental information it needs to oversee the CIA detention and \ninterrogation program.\n  Frankly, for the past 4 years we have not had that information. The \nadministration has withheld this information from us. I am not saying \nthat in partisan fashion. It is a fact.\n  It has been very frustrating as a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee, much less as a Member of the Senate. We have made repeated \nrequests and the Intelligence Committee has been prevented from \ncarefully reviewing the program. The program has operated, as a result, \nwithout any meaningful congressional oversight whatsoever, and that is \nour responsibility under the law.\n  All of my colleagues should be troubled by this fact. We cannot \nassure ourselves, we cannot assure the American people, and we cannot \nassure our agents overseas that the CIA program is both legally sound \nand effective, without the basic information required under my \namendment.\n  My amendment is simply about oversight and accountability, nothing \nmore, nothing less. Nothing in the amendment would require the public \ndisclosure of any classified document or aspect of the CIA program.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Feinstein be \nadded as a cosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I spoke in strong opposition to this \namendment. Again, I think it tries to displace the oversight that is \nperformed by the Intelligence Committee. I would like to add the \nfollowing bit of information.\n  On September 28 of this year, GEN Michael V. Hayden, who is the \ncurrent Director of the CIA, wrote a letter to Chairman Pat Roberts of \nthe Intelligence Committee in the Senate. In it he said:\n\n       On September 6, 2006, I briefed the full SSCI membership on \n     key aspects of the detainee program, providing a level of \n     detail\n\n[[Page S10397]]\n\n     previously not made available to SSCI members. I made clear \n     to the committee that upon passage of the new detainee \n     legislation, I would brief the SSCI on how CIA would execute \n     the future program, and I agreed to promptly notify the \n     committee when any modifications to the program were \n     proposed, or when the status of any individual detainee \n     changed.\n\n  I think that is dispositive of a very clear indication by the \nexecutive branch to allow the Senate to perform its oversight through \nthe properly designated committee, the Senate Committee on \nIntelligence.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Central Intelligence Agency,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 28, 2006.\n     Hon. Pat Roberts,\n     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence,\n     United States Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write today regarding the Rockefeller \n     amendment to the military commissions legislation now pending \n     on the Senate floor. The CIA strongly opposes adoption of the \n     Rockefeller amendment.\n       Since the inception of its detention program, the CIA has a \n     strong and consistent record of keeping its oversight \n     committees fully and currently informed of critical aspects \n     of the program. Further, the bipartisan leadership of \n     Congress has been briefed regularly by the CIA on this \n     program since its inception, and I personally briefed the \n     Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate only weeks ago. \n     The CIA remains committed to a frank and open dialogue with \n     the Congress on detailed aspects of the detainee program, \n     while ensuring the secrecy of this particularly sensitive \n     activity. Senate adoption of the Rockefeller amendment would \n     go far beyond traditional CIA reports to Congress by \n     mandating detailed information about assets, methods, \n     locations and individuals involved in sensitive operations. \n     In addition, detailing in public law the amount of sensitive \n     information that CIA must provide to Congress will chill some \n     of our counterterrorism partners whose cooperation is fully \n     conditioned on the absolute secrecy of their support.\n       Since becoming Director of the CIA, I have made every \n     effort to keep your committee apprised of the status of the \n     detainee program. In July, I updated you and SSCI Vice \n     Chairman Rockefeller on the program, sharing sensitive \n     aspects, including information about specific detainees, \n     examples of actionable intelligence gained from the program \n     and about ways in which the program could continue to be \n     successful in the future. Following this briefing and despite \n     its highly sensitive nature, at your request--and that of \n     Sen. Rockefeller--I fully supported briefing the entire SSCI \n     membership.\n       On September 6, 2006, I briefed the full SSCI membership on \n     key aspects of the detainee program, providing a level of \n     detail previously not made available to SSCI members. I made \n     clear to the committee that upon passage of new detainee \n     legislation, I would brief the SSCI on how CIA would execute \n     the future program and I agreed to promptly notify the \n     committee when any modifications to the program were proposed \n     or when the status of any individual detainee changed.\n       Upon Senate passage of the military commissions \n     legislation, I stand ready to again brief your committee and \n     the bipartisan Senate leadership on the future of the \n     detainee program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael V. Hayden,\n                                           General, USAF Director.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, are we prepared to move to a vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5104\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 4 minutes equally divided on \nthe Byrd amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Friends, Senators, lend me your ears. Friends, Senators, \nlend me your ears. I voted to report a fair and balanced bill from the \nArmed Services Committee, but the legislation before the Senate today \nbears little resemblance to that legislation. It has been changed so \nmany times, we don't know the real implications of this ever-changing \nbill. The Byrd-Obama-Clinton-Levin amendment sunsets the authority of \nthe President to convene new military commissions after 5 years. There \nis nothing wrong with that.\n  This amendment ensures that Congress will not simply stand aside and \nignore its oversight responsibilities after this bill is enacted. This \namendment will not stop any trials of suspected terrorists that \ncommence before the sunset date. It simply forces Congress to revisit--\nrevisit--the weighty constitutional implications of this bill in 5 \nyears' time and then be in a position, on the basis of new knowledge \nand experience, to make a decision again.\n  It is a very reasonable amendment. I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to our most distinguished senior \ncolleague that this amendment was well debated on the floor, but I \nwould bring to the attention of all Senators that we do not have any \nestimates of how long the war on terrorism against the jihadists is \ngoing to take place. We may be having those who commit crimes today not \napprehended until after this sunset provision. Then they go free. They \nare not subject, unless the Senate at that time somehow restores the \nimportance of the next President to continue--to continue, Mr. \nPresident--bringing to justice and trial under our rules these \nindividuals who are committing war crimes. So I urge all Senators to \noppose this amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 36 seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. This amendment will not set any terrorists free. Let \nSenators who are here 5 years from now take a new look on the basis of \nexperience and make a decision in the light of the then circumstances. \nThat is all I am asking. This is nothing new.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the Byrd amendment No. 5104.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

There are 4 minutes equally divided on the \nKennedy amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, here is the Army Manual of 2006 printed \nafter the Senate of the United States went on record in accepting the \nMcCain amendment prohibiting torture. In the printed Army Manual is a \nlist of the prohibited activities where any person who is a member of \nthe Defense Department is prohibited to engage in these kinds of \nactivities because they have made a finding that they are basically and \neffectively torture.\n  Today we have thousands of Americans in the Central Intelligence \nAgency, Special Forces, the SEALS, and American contractors working for \nthe CIA around the world fighting terrorism. All this amendment does is \ngive notice to each and every country that any country that is going to \npractice these kinds of techniques on any American will be guilty \neffectively of a war crime.\n  That is effectively what we have done with the Army Manual, and we \nought to protect our intelligence agency personnel, our SEALS, and all \nof those who are all over the world protecting the United States.\n  Arguments against? It is a violation of the Constitution because it \nis an instruction to a member of the Cabinet about what they ought to \ndo.\n  Here it is for airports. The Secretary of Transportation shall \nconduct an assessment with foreign countries.\n  Here it is on voting rights. The Attorney General is authorized and \ndirected to institute suits that are going to be involved in poll \ntaxes.\n  The Secretary of State shall notify without delay foreign states that \nare involved in pollution. The list goes on. If we can do it for \npollution, we can do it for violation of basic and fundamental rights \nof Americans overseas.\n  This is effectively about what we adopted when we adopted the War \nCrimes Act, which was virtually unanimous, with not a single vote in \nopposition.\n  This is basically a restatement. I hope it will be accepted \noverwhelmingly.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this is an amendment that requires close \nattention by all colleagues.\n  In the preparation of this bill, we defined in broad terms the \nconduct that is regarded as a grave breach of Common Article 3. These \nare war crimes. We the Congress should not try to provide a specific \nlist of techniques. We don't know what the future holds. That is not \nthe responsibility of the Congress. We are not going to direct. We try \nto make a list of techniques, that the United States describe every \ntechnique that violates Common Article 3. We cannot foresee into the \nfuture every technique that might violate Common Article 3. We should \nnot step on that situation. It is not ours to do.\n  Under the separation of powers, it is reserved to the executive \nbranch to work this out. But if at any time it is the judgment of any \nMember of this body, or collectively, that we are not abiding by this \nlaw, I am confident that this institution's oversight will correct and \nquickly remedy the situation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Maine (Ms. Snowe).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee).

I ask the Presiding Officer to read the unanimous consent \nthat is in place so all Members understand what is to take place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Leahy will be recognized for his \nremaining 12 minutes. Senator Levin is under the control of 4 minutes, \nSenator Warner is under the control of 16 minutes, to be followed by \nclosing remarks by the two leaders. Following that time, the Senate \nwill proceed to passage of the bill. Further, that there then be 5 \nminutes equally divided prior to the vote on the motion to invoke \ncloture on border fence legislation.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Chair will now recognize Senator Leahy?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, my understanding is that was the allocation \nof time, not necessarily the order of speaking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The agreement does not appear to be in any \nparticular order.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at the appropriate time, I will allocate \n14 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  At this point in time, I recognize the extraordinary contributions of \nthe staff persons who worked on this bill, and I shall include the \nentire list.\n  We worked under the direction of Charlie Abell, Scott Stucky, David \nMorriss, Rick DeBobes, Peter Levine, Chris Paul, Pablo Chavez, Richard \nFontaine, Jen Olson, Adam Brake, James Galyean, and legislative counsel \nCharlie Armstrong.\n  I assure Members it was a challenge from beginning to end. I cannot \nrecall seeing a more professional group of staffers serving their \nMembers in the Senate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time not be charged to either side or to any party.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S10399]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2781\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar 625, S. 2781, and I \nask unanimous consent that the committee-reported amendment be, for the \nthird time, passed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I object. I agree that wastewater security is an \nimportant issue. In fact, it is made even more important because the \nHomeland Security appropriations conferees have exempted these \nfacilities from security requirements--a decision that I understand was \ndue in large part to the Senator's opposition to including these \nfacilities within the protections of that bill.\n\n  Although I would like to have seen stronger chemical security \nprovisions than those I understand are forthcoming from the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations conference, I anticipate supporting that \nmeasure. I would support including wastewater facilities in that \nmeasure. But I will not support a bill like S. 2781 that provides \nweaker protections.\n  By contrast, I long ago introduced S. 1995, The Wastewater Treatment \nWorks Security Act of 2005. I feel certain that if I asked unanimous \nconsent to pass this bill, the Senator would object to my request. I \nprefer a more constructive pathway to providing essential protection to \nour communities.\n  We should fill this gap in our Nation's security, and in order to do \nso, we need full and fair opportunity to offer amendments to cure the \nserious deficiencies in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert a statement in the \nRecord concerning my objection to consideration of the Wastewater \nSecurity bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wanted to call the Senate's attention to \nthe fact we do have wastewater legislation that has passed both the \nHouse and the Senate, in the House by a vote of 413 to 2. It is \nsomething which is desperately needed. We need to attend to that as \nsoon as possible.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objction, it is so ordered.\n\n\nCOMMON ARTICLE 3 AND WAR CRIMES PROVISIONS OF THE MILITARY COMMISSIONS \n                                  ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Senators Warner and McCain, over the last year, you have \nplayed an instrumental role in bringing needed clarity to the rules for \nthe treatment of detainees in U.S. custody. I understand that you also \nplayed a key role in negotiating the provisions of the military \ncommissions bill regarding the War Crimes Act and Common Article 3 of \nthe Geneva Conventions. As you said last year when the Detainee \nTreatment Act was adopted, this is not an area in which ambiguity is \nhelpful. For this reason, I hope that you will help me in providing a \nclear record of our intent on these issues.\n  In particular, section 8(a)(3) of the bill provides that ``the \nPresident has the authority for the United States to interpret the \nmeaning and application of the Geneva Conventions'', that these \ninterpretations shall be issued by Executive order, and that such an \nExecutive order ``shall be authoritative (as to non-grave breach \nprovisions of Common Article 3) as a matter of United States law, in \nthe same manner as other administrative regulations.''\n  Would you agree that nothing in this provision gives the President or \ncould give the President the authority to modify the Geneva Conventions \nor U.S. obligations under those treaties?\n  Mr. McCAIN. First, I say to my good friend from Michigan that this \nlegislation clearly defines grave breaches of Common Article 3, which \nare criminalized and ultimately punishable by death. It is critical for \nthe American public to understand that we are criminalizing breaches of \nCommon Article 3 that rise to the level of a felony. Such acts--\nincluding cruel or inhuman treatment, torture, rape, and murder, among \nothers--will clearly be considered war crimes.\n  Where the President may exercise his authority to interpret treaty \nobligations is in the area of ``nongrave'' breaches of the Geneva \nConventions--those breaches that do not rise to the level of a war \ncrime. In interpreting the conventions in this manner, the President is \nbounded by the conventions themselves. Nothing in this bill gives the \nPresident the authority to modify the conventions or our obligations \nunder those treaties. That understanding is at the core of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. WARNER. I concur with the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would you agree that nothing in this provision gives the \nPresident, or could give the President, the authority to modify the \nrequirements of the Detainee Treatment Act?\n  Mr. WARNER. The purpose of this legislation is to strengthen, not to \nweaken or modify, the Detainee Treatment Act. For the first time, this \nlegislation is required to ``take action to ensure compliance'' with \nthe DTA's prohibition on cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, as \ndefined in the U.S. reservation to the Convention Against Torture. He \nis directed to do so through, among other actions, the establishment of \nadministrative rules and procedures. Nothing in this legislation \nauthorizes the President to modify the requirements of the DTA, which \nwere enshrined in a law passed last December. I would point out as well \nto the distinguished ranking member that the President himself never \nproposed to weaken the DTA. Rather, he proposed to make compliance with \nthe DTA tantamount to compliance with Common Article 3 of the Geneva \nConventions. That proposal is not included in this legislation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I agree entirely with Senator Warner's comments.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would you agree that any interpretation issued by the \nPresident under this section would only be valid if it is consistent \nwith U.S. obligations under the Geneva Conventions and the Detainee \nTreatment Act?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I agree.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Section 8(b) of the bill would amend the War Crimes Act to \nprovide that only ``grave breaches'' of Common Article 3 of the \nGeneva Conventions constitute war crimes under U.S. law. The provision \ngoes on to define those grave breaches to include, among other things, \ntorture, and ``cruel or inhuman treatment''. The term ``cruel or \ninhuman treatment' is defined to include acts ``intended to inflict \nsevere or serious physical or mental pain or suffering.''\n\n  Would you agree that the changes to the War Crimes Act in section \n8(b) do not in any way alter U.S. obligations under the Geneva \nConventions or under the Detainee Treatment Act?\n  Mr. McCAIN. The changes to the War Crimes Act are actually a \nresponsible modification in order to better comply with America's \nobligations under the Geneva Conventions to provide effective penal \nsanction for grave breaches of Common Article 3. It is important to \nnote, as has the Senator from Michigan, that in this section ``cruel or \ninhuman treatment'' is defined for purposes of the War Crimes Act only. \nIt does not infringe, supplant, or in any way alter the definition of \ncruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment prohibited in the \nDTA and defined therein with reference to the 5th, 8th, and 14th \namendments to the U.S. Constitution. Nor do the changes to the War \nCrimes Act alter U.S. obligations under the Geneva Conventions.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would associate myself with the comments from the \nSenator from Arizona.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would you agree that nothing in this section or in this \nbill requires or should be interpreted to authorize any modification to \nthe new Army Field Manual on interrogation techniques, which was issued \nlast month and provides important guidance to our solders on the field \nas to what is and is not permitted to the interrogation of detainees?\n  Mr. WARNER. The executive branch has the authority to modify the Army \nField Manual on Intelligence Interrogation at any time. I welcomed the \nnew version of the field manual issued last\n\n[[Page S10400]]\n\nmonth and agree that it provides critical guidance to our solders in \nthe field. That said, the content of the field manual is an issue \nseparate from those at issue in this bill, and it was not my intent to \neffect any change in the field manual through this legislation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I concur wholeheartedly with the Senator from Virginia. \nAs the Senator form Virginia is aware, there is a provision in the bill \nbefore the Senate that defines ``cruel and inhuman treatment'' under \nthe War Crimes Act. I would note first that this definition is limited \nto criminal offenses under the War Crimes Act and is distinct from the \nbroader prohibition contained in the Detainee Treatment Act. That act \ndefined the term ``cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment'' with \nreference to the reservation the United States took to the Convention \nAgainst Torture.\n\n  In the war crimes section of this bill, cruel and inhuman treatment \nis defined as an act intended to inflict severe or serious physical or \nmental pain or suffering. It further makes clear that such mental \nsuffering need not be prolonged to be prohibited. The mental suffering \nneed only be more than transitory. It is important to note that the \n``nontransitory'' requirement applies to the harm, not to the act \nproducing the harm. Thus if a U.S. soldier is, for example, subjected \nto some terrible technique that lasts for a brief time but that causes \nserious and nontransitory mental harm, a criminal act has occurred.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is my understanding and intent as well, and I agree \nwith the Senator's other clarifying remarks.\n  In the same section, the term ``serious physical pain or suffering'' \nis defined as a bodily injury that involves one of four \ncharacteristics: ``a substantial risk of death,'' ``extreme physical \npain,'' ``a burn or physical disfigurement or a serious nature,'' or \n``significant loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, \norgan or mental faculty.'' I do not believe that the term ``bodily \ninjury'' adds a separate requirement which must be met for an act to \nconstitute serious physical pain or suffering.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am of the same view.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And would the Senator from Arizona agree with my view that \nsection 8(a)(3) does not make lawful or give the President the \nauthority to make lawful any technique that is not permitted by Common \nArticle 3 or the Detainee Treatment Act?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I do agree.\n  Mr. WARNER. I agree with both of my colleagues.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in times of war, our obligation is to \nprotect our Nation and to protect those men and women who risk their \nlives to defend us. This bill fails that duty. By failing to renounce \ntorture, it inflames an already dangerous world and makes new enemies \nfor America in our war against terror. This puts cause or people and \nour troops at greater risk. That is why so many respected military \nleaders oppose this bill.\n  Throughout our history, America has led the world in promoting human \nrights and decency. We have fought wars against tyranny and oppression. \nOur enemies have employed tactics that were rightly and roundly \ncondemned by the civilized world. We maintained American strength and \nhonor by refusing to stoop to the level of our enemies. And we should \nnot stoop to the level of the terrorists in the war on terror.\n  I rise to express my profound opposition to this bill both in terms \nof its substance and the procedure by which it reached the floor. The \nArmed Service Committee reported out a bill that I supported. That bill \nwas not perfect, but it preserved our commitment to the Geneva \nConventions, limited the possibility that detainees would be treated \nabusively and set up procedures for military tribunals that generally \nrespected the fundamental requirements of fairness.\n  Republican members of the Armed Services Committee then began a \nprocess of secret negotiation with the White House that produced a bill \nthat is far worse than the committee bill. Indeed, we have continued to \nsee changes in that bill as it has been moved toward the floor in a \nrush to achieve passage before the Senate recesses for the election. \nThis rush to passage to serve a political agenda is no way to produce \ncareful and thoughtful legislation on profound issues of national \nsecurity and civil liberties. At this point, most Members of this body \nhardly know what they are being asked to approve.\n  The bill as it now appears on the floor works profound and disastrous \nchanges in our law.\n  This legislation sets out an overly broad definition of unlawful \nenemy combatant. This definition would allow the President to pick up \nanyone citizen and legal residents included anywhere around the world, \nand throw them into prison in Guantanamo without even charging or \ntrying them. These people would never get a day in court to prove their \ninnocence. There is no check whatsoever on the President's ability to \ndetain people in an arbitrary manner.\n  We already know that our military has made mistakes in detaining \npeople. We are currently holding dozens of people at Guanatanamo who we \nknow based on the military's own records are not guilty of anything. \nYet they have not been let go.\n  This legislation also makes a distinction between citizens and lawful \npermanent residents. Citizens cannot be subject to military commissions \nand their flawed procedures. Yet lawful permanent residents, those \ngreen card holders who are on the path to citizenship, could be sent to \nmilitary commissions. Green Card holders must obey our laws, pay taxes, \nand register for the draft. They are serving our country in Iraq. They \nhave an obligation to protect our laws, and they deserve the protection \nof those same laws.\n  The Geneva Conventions were adopted in the wake of the horrific \natrocities during World War II. These conventions reflect the \ninternational consensus on how individuals should be treated in times \nof war. They set a minimum floor of humane treatment for all prisoners, \nmilitary and civilian alike. This floor is known as Common Article 3 \nbecause it is common to all of the conventions. Yet this bill also \ngives the President authority to decide what conduct violates Common \nArticle 3 of the Geneva Conventions. Again, the President's authority \nto define the meaning of Common Article 3 is virtually unreviewable. He \nis required to publish his interpretation in the Federal Register, but \nthe administration has already made clear that it will not make public \nwhich interrogation tactics are being used. Moreover, the bill \nexpressly states that the Geneva Conventions cannot be relied upon in \nany U.S. court as a source of rights. The President's interpretation \nmay well likely escape judicial review, as well.\n  As the final method of concealing its activities, the administration \nhas stripped the courts of their ability to review the confinement or \ntreatment of detainees. The administration won a provision that \neliminates the ability of any detainee anywhere in the world to file a \nhabeas corpus petition challenging the justification for or conditions \nof his or her confinement. The provision applies to all existing \npetitions and would require their dismissal, including the Hamdan case \nitself. There is no justification for stripping courts of jurisdiction \nto issue the great writ of habeas corpus, which has been a foundation \nof our legal system with roots in the Magna Carta. The availability of \nthe Great Writ is assured in the Constitution itself, which permits its \nsuspension only in times of invasion or rebellion. This provision of \nthe bill is most likely unconstitutional.\n  The administration has pursued a strategy to defeat accountability \nsince it first began to take detainees into custody. It chose \nGuantanamo and secret prisons abroad because it thought U.S. law would \nnot apply. It fought hard to prevent detainees from obtaining counsel \nand then argued that U.S. Courts lacked jurisdiction to hear detainees' \ncomplaints. It sought the prohibition on habeas corpus petitions \nadopted in the Detainee Treatment Act and then urged courts to \nmisconstrue it to wipe out all pending habeas cases. This new effort to \nprohibit habeas petitions is a continuation of this effort to escape \njudicial scrutiny.\n  The bill also for the first time in our history would authorize the \nintroduction of evidence obtained by torture in a judicial proceeding. \nOur courts have always rejected this type of evidence\n\n[[Page S10401]]\n\nbecause it is inconsistent with fundamental notions of justice, and \nalso because it is unreliable. We know that detainees were subjected to \nharsh interrogation techniques, and made statements as a result. Under \nthis legislation, if those statements were made before the passage of \nthe McCain Amendment last winter, then they are admissible. The \nCongress is saying for the first time in our nation's history that \nstatements obtained by torture are admissible. This fact, alone, is a \nstunning statement about how far we have strayed from our bedrock \nvalues.\n  It defines conduct that can be prosecuted as a war crime in a very \nnarrow way that appears designed to exclude many of the abusive \ninterrogation practices that this administration has employed. While \nsome have argued that cruel and inhumane practices such as \nwaterboarding, induced hypothermia and sleep deprivation would surely \nbe covered, the White House and the Republican leadership have refused \nto commit to this basic interpretation of the bill.\n  We tried to improve this bill. A number of amendments were offered \nand should have been adopted. I offered an amendment that responds to \nthe lack of clarity about which practices are prohibited by the bill. \nBecause the administration has refused to commit itself to stop using \nspecific abusive interrogation procedures, our commitment to the \nstandards of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions is in doubt. \nThat puts our own people at risk. As military leaders have repeatedly \nstated, our adherence to the Geneva Conventions is essential to protect \nour own people around the world. America has thousands of people across \nthe globe who do not wear uniforms, but put their lives on the line to \nprotect this country every day. CIA agents, Special Forces members, \ncontractors, journalists and others will all be less safe if we turn \nour backs on the standards of Common Article 3.\n  The bill as it has reached the floor would diminish the security and \nsafety of Americans everywhere and further erode our civil liberties. I \nstrongly oppose this bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we hear on a daily basis about the war \nwe are currently engaged in, the war on terror, but I don't think most \nof us stop to think about what that actually means.\n  As citizens of the greatest country in the world, we have become so \naccustomed to all the rights afforded us by our Constitution that we \nnow take them for granted. We are incredibly fortunate to live in a \nnation where our freedom and safety is our Government's first priority.\n  We aren't living in the world I grew up in. Our Nation was rocked to \nits core 5 years ago when we were attacked on our own soil. Thousands \nof innocent Americans were murdered simply because they lived in the \none country that, above all others, embodies freedom and democracy. The \nmastermind behind those attacks was Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who is now \nin custody and soon will be brought to justice.\n  In the aftermath of these attacks, Congress authorized our President \nto ``use all necessary force against those nations, organizations, or \npersons he determines planned, authorized, committed or aided the \nterrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such \norganizations or persons.'' President Bush used this authorization, \ncombined with his constitutional powers to make these sorts of \njudgments during times of war, to try enemy combatants in military \ncommissions.\n  Earlier this month, we observed the 5-year anniversary of the \nhorrific attacks on America. I cannot imagine the reaction that would \nhave come if, 5 years ago, Members of Congress had stood on this floor \nand suggested that we wouldn't do all we could to prevent another \nattack on our country. Five years ago, with the images of the \ncollapsing Twin Towers and the burning Pentagon and the smoldering \nPennsylvania field seared into our memories, we stood united in the \nproposition that we intended to protect Americans first.\n  In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, which the Supreme Court decided earlier this \nyear, the Court ruled that the administration's use of military \ncommissions to try unlawful enemy combatants violated international \nlaw. This decision forced our interrogators, key in defending America \nfrom terrorist attack, to curtail their investigations. Without a \nclarification of the vague requirements, these interrogators might be \nsubject to prosecution for war crimes. It also brought to an end the \nprosecution of unlawful enemy combatants through the military \ncommissions.\n  It is key to point out that military commissions have been used \nthroughout American history to bring enemy combatants to justice since \nbefore the United States was even officially formed. George Washington \nused them during the American Revolution, and since our Constitution \nwas ratified, Presidents have used military commissions to try those \nwho seek to harm Americans during every major conflict. Some of our \nmost popular Presidents from history have taken this route, including \nAbraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt. Whenever the leaders of this \ngreat Nation have seen threats posed by those who refuse to abide by \nthe rules of war, they have taken the necessary steps to protect us.\n  Our President has come to us and asked for help in trying these \nterrorists whose sole goal is to kill those who love freedom. He has \nasked for our help in ensuring that those investigating potential \nterrorist plots against our Nation and our citizens are secure from \narbitrary prosecution for undefined war crimes. These people are part \nof our first line of defense in securing the safety of our country--we \nowe it to them to protect them. Because of the Supreme Court's decision \nin Hamdan, the only way these terrorists will be brought to justice and \nour interrogators will be protected for doing their jobs is for \nCongress to write a new law codifying procedures for military \ncommissions and clarifying our obligations under the Geneva \nConventions.\n  I firmly believe that enemy combatants in our custody enjoyed ample \ndue process in the military commissions established by the \nadministration, which were brought to a halt by the Supreme Court. The \ncompromise that we are considering here today gives more rights to \nterrorists who were caught trying to harm America and our allies than \nour own servicemembers would receive elsewhere, more than is required \nby the Geneva Conventions--yet some are still demanding more.\n  Mr. President, it is essential that we protect human dignity at every \nopportunity, but we have gone well beyond that with this legislation. \nThe legislation before us responds to the Supreme Court's decision in \nHamdan and seeks to protect national security while ensuring that the \nterrorists who seek to destroy America are properly dealt with. This \nbill affords these unlawful enemy combatants rights that they \nthemselves would never consider granting American soldiers. It is \nbeyond reasonable, beyond fair, and beyond time for Congress to act. We \nmust pass this bill and reinstate the programs that, I believe, have \nbeen a crucial part of our Nation's security over the last 5 years.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a joint statement regarding alleged violations of the Geneva \nConventions.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Joint Statement of Senators McCain, Warner, and Graham on Individual \n        Rights Under the Geneva Conventions, September 28, 2006\n\n       Mr. President, we are submitting this statement into the \n     record because it has been suggested by some that this \n     legislation would prohibit litigants from raising alleged \n     violations of the Geneva Conventions. This suggestion is \n     misleading on three counts.\n       First, it presumes that individuals currently have a \n     private right of action under Geneva. Secondly, it implies \n     that the Congress is restricting individuals from raising \n     claims that the Geneva Conventions have been violated as a \n     collateral matter once they have an independent cause of \n     action. Finally, this legislation would not stop in any way a \n     court from exercising any power it has to consider the United \n     States' obligations under the Geneva Conventions, regardless \n     of what litigants say or do not say in the documents that \n     they file with the court.\n       The Supreme Court's decision in Hamdan left untouched the \n     widely-held view that the Geneva Conventions provide no \n     private rights of action to individuals. And, in fact, the \n     majority in Hamdan suggested that the Geneva Conventions do \n     not afford individuals private rights of action, although it \n     did not need to reach that question in its decision. This \n     view has been underscored by judicial precedent--and even \n     Salim Hamdan\n\n[[Page S10402]]\n\n     himself did not claim in his court filings that he had a \n     private right of action under Geneva.\n       Still, this legislation would not bar individuals from \n     raising to our Federal courts in their pleadings any \n     allegation that a provision of the Geneva Conventions--or, \n     for that matter, any other treaty obligation that has the \n     force of law--has been violated. It is not the intent of \n     Congress to dictate what can or cannot be said by litigants \n     in any case.\n       By the same token, this legislation explicitly reserves \n     untouched the constitutional functions and responsibilities \n     of the judicial branch of the United States. Accordingly, \n     when Congress says that the President can interpret the \n     meaning of Geneva, it is merely reasserting a longstanding \n     constitutional principle. Congress does not intend with this \n     legislation to prohibit the Federal courts from considering \n     whether the obligations of the United States under any treaty \n     have been met. To paraphrase an opinion written by Chief \n     Justice Roberts recently, if treaties are to be given effect \n     as Federal law under our legal system, determining their \n     meaning as a matter of Federal law is the province and duty \n     of the judiciary headed by the Supreme Court. So, though the \n     President certainly has the constitutional authority to \n     interpret our Nation's treaty obligations, such \n     interpretation is subject to judicial review. It is not the \n     intent of Congress to infringe on any constitutional power of \n     the Federal bench, a co-equal branch of government.\n       Most importantly, the lack of judicial enforceability \n     through a private right of action has absolutely no bearing \n     on whether Geneva is binding on the executive branch. Even if \n     the Geneva Conventions are not enforceable by individuals in \n     our Nation's courts, the President and his subordinates are \n     bound to comply with Geneva, a set of treaty obligations that \n     forms part of our American jurisprudence. That is clear to us \n     and to all who have negotiated this legislation in good \n     faith.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I view this bill as a weak plan that will \nlead to delay after delay in convicting terrorists, endanger our troops \non the field, and surrender one of the bedrock constitutional \nprinciples of our justice system--habeas corpus.\n  We had a chance to improve this bill with amendments, but this rubber \nstamp Senate defeated them one after another, leaving us with a flawed \nplan that will face a serious court challenge, and that makes us less \nsafe.\n  The Republicans even voted against a bipartisan bill that came out of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Military \nCommissions Act of 2006. I support this legislation, first and \nforemost, because this bill recognizes that we are a Nation at war. We \nare a Nation at war, and we are at war with Islamic extremists. We are \nnot conducting a law enforcement operation against a checkwriting scam \nor trying to foil a bank heist. We are at war against extremists who \nwant to kill our citizens, cripple our economy, and discredit the \nprinciples we hold dear--freedom and democracy.\n  Once you accept the premise that we are at war, the most important \nconsideration should be, Does this bill protect the American people? I \nsubmit that this bill does just that. It does so by permitting the \nPresident's CIA interrogation program to continue. This is of profound \nimportance.\n  If the attacks of September 11, 2001, taught us anything, it is that \nself-imposed limitations on our intelligence-gathering efforts can have \ndevastating consequences. For instance, the wall of separation between \nthe intelligence community and the law enforcement community that \nexisted prior to 2001 proved to be an imposing hurdle to foiling the \nSeptember 11 attacks. According to the report of the 9/11 Commission, \nin late summer 2001, the U.S. Government, in effect, conducted its \nsearch for 9/11 hijacker Khalid Mihdhar with one hand tied behind its \nback. As we all know, that search was unsuccessful. Comparable pre-9/11 \nefforts with respect to Zacarias Moussaoui were similarly frustrated in \nlarge part due to this wall.\n  Thankfully, with the PATRIOT Act, we removed this wall of separation, \nand now the intelligence and law enforcement arms of our Government can \nshare information and more effectively protect us here at home.\n  Another lesson of September 11 was the premium that should be placed \non human intelligence. Prior to September 11, we were woefully \ndeficient in our human intelligence regarding al-Qaida. Al-Qaida is an \nextremely difficult organization to infiltrate. You can't just pay dues \nand become a member. But interrogation offers a rare and valuable \nopportunity to gather vital intelligence about al-Qaida's capabilities \nand plans before they attack us.\n  The CIA interrogation program provided crucial human intelligence \nthat has saved American lives by helping to prevent new attacks. As the \nPresident has explained, 9/11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed told \nthe CIA about planned attacks on U.S. buildings in which al-Qaida \nmembers were under orders to set off explosives high enough in the \nbuilding so the victims could not escape through the windows.\n  As the President also noted, the program has also yielded human \nintelligence regarding al-Qaida's efforts to obtain biological weapons \nsuch as anthrax. And it has helped lead to the capture of key al-Qaida \nfigures, such as KSM and his accomplice, Ramzi bin al Shibh.\n  Another means of evaluating the importance of this program is by \nconsidering a grim hypothetical. What if al-Qaida or other terrorists \norganizations were able to get their hands on nuclear, chemical, or \nbiological weapons and were trying to attack a major U.S. city? \nThousands or even millions of lives could be at stake. Under such a \nchilling scenario, wouldn't we want our intelligence community to have \nall possible tools at its disposal? Would we want our intelligence \ncommunity to respond with one hand tied behind its back as it did \nbefore September 11?\n  Unfortunately, that threat is all too real. The potential for al-\nQaida to attack a U.S. city with a device that could kill millions of \npeople reflects how vital it is to permit the intelligence community to \nmake full use of the tools it needs to continue protecting American \nlives. The compromise preserves this crucial intelligence-gathering \ntool and allows the CIA and others on the front lines to continue \nprotecting America.\n  In addition, this bill protects classified information from being \nreleased to al-Qaida terrorists. This also is a serious concern. The \nidentities of U.S. intelligence officials and informants--men and women \nwho put their lives at risk to defend this Nation--must be protected at \nall costs.\n  If we needed any reminding why terrorists should not be given \nsensitive information, we should just look at the prosecution of the \n1993 World Trade Center bombers. According to the man who prosecuted \nthese Islamic extremists, intelligence from U.S. Government files was \nsupplied to the defendants through the discovery process.\n  This information was later delivered directly to Osama bin Laden \nwhile he was living in Sudan. Let me repeat that. Information given to \nthe jihadist defendants, individuals who tried to destroy the World \nTrade Center in 1993, was later given directly to bin Laden himself.\n  Since we are at war, we should not be revealing classified \ninformation to the enemy. That is just common sense. This bill protects \nclassified information.\n  Finally, while this bill preserves our ability to continue to protect \nAmerica, it also provides detainees with fair procedural rights.\n  In fact, this legislation provides broader protections for defendants \nthan did Nuremberg. Liberal law professor Cass Sunstein has written \nthat the military commissions authorized by the President in 2001 \n``provide far greater procedural safeguards than any previous military \ncommission, including Nuremberg.'' Let me say that again: liberal law \nprofessor Cass Sunstein noted that the President's 2001 military order \nprovided far greater procedural safeguards than any previous military \ncommission, including Nuremberg. And in this legislation, we provide \ndefendants with even broader procedural safeguards than the President's \n2001 military order.\n  This system is exceedingly fair since al-Qaida in no way follows the \nGeneva Conventions or any other international norm. Al-Qaida respects \nno law, no authority, no legitimacy but that of its own twisted strain \nof radical Islam.\n  Al-Qaida grants no procedural rights to Americans they capture. Look \nat journalist Daniel Pearl, who was beheaded by al-Qaida in Pakistan in \n2002. Al-Qaida simply executes those they capture, even civilians like \nPearl. Not only do they unapologetically kill innocent civilians, they \nbroadcast these brutal executions on the Internet for all to see.\n\n[[Page S10403]]\n\n  Mr. President, I would just conclude by stating that this legislation \nis vitally important. It is vitally important because it is wartime \nlegislation. It is vitally important because this bill protects our \nnational security, it protects classified information, and it protects \nthe rights of defendants. Most important, it protects America. For \nthese reasons, I urge its passage.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, once the Military Commissions Act, MCA, is \nsigned into law and section 7 is effective, Congress will finally \naccomplish what it sought to do through the Detainee Treatment Act--\nDTA--last year. It will finally get the lawyers out of Guantanamo Bay. \nIt will substitute the blizzard of litigation instigated by Rasul v. \nBush with a narrow DC Circuit -only review of the Combatant Status \nReview Tribunal--CSRT--hearings.\n  Perhaps even more important than the narrow standards of review \ncreated by the DTA is the fact that that review is exclusive to the \ncourt of appeals. This is by design. Courts of appeals do not hold \nevidentiary hearings or otherwise take in evidence outside of the \nadministrative record. The DC Circuit will operate no differently under \nthe CSRT review provisions of the DTA. The circuit court will review \nthe administrative record of the CSRTs to make sure that the right \nstandards were applied, the standards that the military itself set for \nCSRTs. And it will determine whether the CSRT system as a whole is \nconsistent with the Constitution and with Federal statutes.\n  There is no invitation in the DTA or MCA to reconsider the \nsufficiency of the evidence. Weighing of the evidence is a function for \nthe military when the question is whether someone is an enemy \ncombatant. Courts simply lack the competence--the knowledge of the \nbattlefield and the nature of our foreign enemies--to judge whether \nparticular facts show that someone is an enemy combatant. By making \nreview exclusive to the DC Circuit, the DTA helps to ensure that the \nnarrow review standards it sets do not somehow grow into something akin \nto Federal courts' habeas corpus review of State criminal convictions. \nThe court's role under the DTA is to simply ensure that the military \napplied the right rules to the facts. It is not the court's role to \ninterpret those facts and decide what they mean.\n  Because review under the DTA and MCA will be limited to the \nadministrative record, there is no need for any lawyer to ever again go \nto Guantanamo to represent an enemy combatant challenging his \ndetention. The military, I am certain, will make the paper record \navailable inside the United States. This is one of the major benefits \nof enacting the MCA. As I and others have noted previously, the \nhundreds of lawyer visits to Guantanamo sparked by Rasul have seriously \ndisrupted the operation of the Naval facility there. They have forced \nreconfiguration of the facility and consumed enormous resources, and \nhave led to leaks of information that have made it harder for our \ntroops there to do their job, to keep order at Guantanamo. Some of \nthese detainee lawyers have even bragged about what a burden their \nactivities have been on the military, and how they have disrupted \ninterrogations at Guantanamo. Putting an end to that was the major \npurpose of the DTA. Today, with the MCA, we see to it that this goal is \neffectuated.\n  Another major improvement that the MCA makes to the DTA is that it \ntightens the bar on nonhabeas lawsuits contained in 28 U.S.C. \nSec. 2241(e)(2). That paragraph, as enacted by the DTA, barred \npostrelease conditions-of-confinement lawsuits, but only if the \ndetainee had been found to be properly detained as an enemy combatant \nby the U.S. Court of Appeals on review of a CSRT hearing. Although \nnothing in the DTA or MCA directly requires the military to \nconduct CSRTs, this limitation on the bar to non-habeas actions \neffectively did compel the military to hold CSRTs--and to somehow get \nthe detainee to appeal to the DC Circuit. The alternative would have \nbeen to allow the detainee to sue U.S. troops at Guantanamo after his \nrelease.\n\n  The MCA revises section 2241(e)(2) by, among other things, adopting a \nmuch narrower exception to the bar on post-release lawsuits. Under the \nMCA, 2242(e)(2) will bar nonhabeas lawsuits so long as the detainee \n``has been determined by the United States to have been properly \ndetained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination.'' \nThis new language does several things. First, it eliminates the \nrequirement that the DC Circuit review a CSRT, or that a CSRT even be \nheld, before nonhabeas actions are barred. This is important because \nmany detainees were released before CSRTs were even instituted. We do \nnot want those who were properly detained as enemy combatants to be \nable to sue the U.S. military. And we do not want to force the military \nto hold CSRT hearings forever, or in all future wars. Instead, under \nthe new language, the determination that is the precondition to the \nlitigation bar is purely an executive determination. It is only what \nthe United States has decided that will matter.\n  In addition, the language of (e)(2) focuses on the propriety of the \ninitial detention. There inevitably will be detainees who are captured \nby U.S. troops, or who are handed over to us by third parties, who \ninitially appear to be enemy combatants but who, upon further inquiry, \nare found to be unconnected to the armed conflict. The U.S. military \nshould not be punished with litigation for the fact that they initially \ndetained such a person. As long as the individual was at least \ninitially properly detained as an enemy combatant, the nonhabeas \nlitigation is now barred, even if the U.S. later decides that the \nperson was not an enemy combatant or no longer poses any threat. The \ninquiry created here is not unlike that for reviewing, in the civilian \ncriminal justice context, the propriety of an arrest. An arrest might \nbe entirely legal, might be based on sufficient probable cause, even if \nthe arrestee is later conclusively found to be innocent of committing \nany crime. The arresting officer cannot be sued and held liable for \nmaking that initial arrest, so long as the arrest itself was supported \nby probable cause, simply because the suspect was not later convicted \nof a crime. Similarly, under 2241 (e)(2), detainees will not be able to \nsue their captors and custodians if the United States determines that \nit was the right decision to take the individual into custody.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments \nabout section 7 of the bill that is before us today. This section makes \na number of improvements to the Detainee Treatment Act, which was \npassed by the Congress and signed into law on December 30 of last year. \nFirst, section 7 will fulfill one of the original objectives of the \nDTA: to get the lawyers out of Guantanamo Bay. As my colleague Senator \nGraham has noted, these lawyers have even bragged about the fact that \ntheir presence and activities at Guantanamo have made it harder for the \nmilitary to do its job. Mr. Michael Ratner, the director of the Center \nfor Constitutional Rights, which coordinated much of the detainee \nhabeas litigation, had this to say about his activities to a magazine:\n\n       The litigation is brutal for [the United States.] It's \n     huge. We have over one hundred lawyers now from big and small \n     firms working to represent the detainees. Every time an \n     attorney goes down there, it makes it that much harder [for \n     the U.S. military] to do what they're doing. You can't run an \n     interrogation . . . with attorneys. What are they going to do \n     now that we're getting court orders to get more lawyers down \n     there?\n\n  This is what Congress thought that it was putting an end to when it \nenacted the DTA in 2005. That act provided that ``no court, justice, or \njudge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider'' claims filed by \nGuantanamo detainees, except under the review standards created by that \nAct. The DTA was made effective immediately upon the date of its \nenactment. And as Justice Scalia noted in his Hamdan v. Rumsfeld \ndissenting opinion, the DTA's jurisdictional removal made no exception \nfor lawsuits that were pending when the statute was enacted. Justice \nScalia also pointed out that ``[a]n ancient and unbroken line of \nauthority attests that statutes ousting jurisdiction unambiguously \napply to cases pending at their effective date.'' He also noted that up \nuntil the Hamdan decision, ``one cannot cite a single case in the \nhistory of Anglo-American law . . . in which a jurisdiction-stripping \nprovision was denied immediate effect in pending cases, absent an \nexplicit statutory reservation.''\n  The Hamdan majority, on the other hand, found that the Supreme \nCourt's\n\n[[Page S10404]]\n\nprecedents governing jurisdictional statutes were trumped in that case \nby a legislative intent to preserve the pending lawsuits. This \ncongressional intent, the majority concluded, was manifested in minor \nchanges that had been made to the language of the bill and, most \nexpressly, in statements made by Senators regarding the intended effect \nof the bill. As Senator Graham has explained in detail in remarks in \nthe Congressional Record on August 3, at 152 Cong. Rec. S8779, it \nappears that the Supreme Court was misled about the legislative history \nof the DTA by the lawyers for Hamdan. Those lawyers misrepresented the \nnature of the statements made in the Senate and caused the court to \nbelieve that Congress had an intent other than that reflected in the \ntext of the statute. It certainly was not my intent, when I voted for \nthe DTA, to exempt all of the pending Guantanamo lawsuits from the \nprovisions of that act.\n  Section 7 of the Military Commissions Act fixes this feature of the \nDTA and ensures that there is no possibility of confusion in the \nfuture. Subsection (b) provides that the bill's revised litigation bar \n``shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, and shall \napply to all cases, without exception, pending on or after the date of \nthe enactment of this Act which relate to any aspect of the detention, \ntransfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of detention of an alien \ndetained by the United States since September 11, 2001.'' I don't see \nhow there could be any confusion as to the effect of this act on the \npending Guantanamo litigation. The MCA's jurisdictional bar applies to \nthat litigation ``without exception.''\n\n  The new bill also bars all litigation by anyone found to have been \nproperly detained as an enemy combatant, regardless of whether the \ndetainee has been through the DC Circuit under the DTA or has been \nthrough a Combatant Status Review Tribunal hearing. The previous \nversion of this bar, in the DTA, allowed detainees to bring conditions-\nof-confinement lawsuits after their release if their detention was not \nreviewed by the DC Circuit. Obviously, the Government could not force \nthe detainee to appeal, and there are some who were released before \nCSRT hearings were instituted. The new bill states that as long as the \nmilitary decides that it was appropriate to take the individual into \ncustody as an enemy combatant, as a security risk in relation to a war, \nthat person cannot turn around and sue our military after he is \nreleased. It should not be held against our soldiers that they take \nsomeone into custody, believing in good faith that he appears to be \nconnected to hostilities against the United States, and then determine \nthat the individual is not an enemy combatant and release the person. \nThe fact of release should not be an invitation to litigation, so long \nas the military finds that it was appropriate to take the individual \ninto custody in the first place.\n  The biggest change that the MCA makes to section 2241(e) is that the \nnew law applies globally, rather than just to Guantanamo detainees. We \nare legislating through this law for future generations, creating a \nsystem that will operate not only throughout this war, but for future \nwars in which our Nation fights. In the future, we may again find \nourselves involved in an armed conflict in which we capture large \nnumbers of enemy soldiers. It is not unlikely that the safest and most \nsecure place to hold those soldiers will be inside the United States. \nThe fact that we hold those enemy soldiers in this country should not \nbe an invitation for each of them to sue our Government. We held very \nlarge numbers of enemy soldiers in this country during World War II. \nThey did not sue our Government seeking release. The Rasul decision \nwould seem to have required that enemy combatants held in this country \nduring wartime can sue. If that court allowed enemy combatants held in \nCuba to sue, it is inevitable that those held inside this country would \nhave been allowed to sue as well. That is simply not acceptable. It \nwould make it very difficult to fight a major war in the future if \nevery enemy war prisoner detained inside this country could sue our \nmilitary. Through section 7 of the MCA, we not only solve our current \nproblems with Guantanamo, but we plan for future conflicts as well. We \nensure that, if need be, we can again hold enemy soldiers in prison \ncamps inside our country if we need to, without becoming embroiled in a \ntempest of litigation.\n  I imagine that, now that Congress has clearly shut off access to \nhabeas lawsuits, the lawyers suing on behalf of the detainees will \nshift their efforts toward arguing for an expansive interpretation of \nthe judicial review allowed under the DTA. Paragraphs 2 and 3 of \nsection 1005(e) of the DTA allow the DC Circuit to review a CSRT enemy \ncombatant determination. The Government has provided a CSRT hearing to \nevery detainee held at Guantanamo, with the likely exception of those \ntransferred there this month, so all of those detainees will now be \nallowed to seek DTA review in the DC Circuit. Paragraphs 2 and 3 allow \nthe DC Circuit to ask whether the military applied its own standards \nand procedures for CSRTs to the detainee, and they allow the court to \nask whether those standards are constitutional and are consistent with \nnontreaty Federal law. I think that those standards speak for \nthemselves, that they clearly allow only a very limited review. In \nparticular, they do not allow the courts to second-guess the military's \nevidentiary findings. The courts simply are not in a position, they do \nnot have the expertise, to judge whether particular evidence suggests \nthat an individual is an enemy combatant.\n\n  I would like to note here that this is the consensus view of the DTA \nat this time, at least for now. I have no doubt that in the future, \nlawyers will argue that these standards invite the court to reweigh the \nevidence, to take in evidence outside of the CSRT record, and to decide \nif the military was right about its factual judgment. At this time, \nhowever, both proponents and opponents of section 7 of the MCA seem to \nagree on what kind of review it will allow. Earlier today, for example, \nI heard Senator Specter, who opposes section 7, criticize the paragraph \n2 and 3 review standards on the Senate floor. He said, ``the statute \nprovides that the Combatant Status Review Tribunal may be reviewed by \nthe Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia only to the extent \nthat it was--the ruling was consistent with the standards and \nprocedures specified by the Secretary of Defense. Now, to comply with \nthe standards and procedures determined by the Secretary of Defense \ndoes not mean--excludes on its face--a factual determination as to what \nhappens to the detainees.''\n  I have also come into possession of a so-called fact sheet on the DTA \nreview standards that is being distributed on Capitol Hill by Human \nRights First, a group that is lobbying Senators to oppose the MCA and \nto support the Specter amendment that was defeated earlier today. This \nfact sheet is titled, ``The Limited Review Allowed Under the DTA is No \nSubstitute for Habeas.'' Here is what the Human Rights First fact sheet \nsays:\n\n       The DTA restricts the court to determining whether the \n     prior CSRTs followed their own procedures.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       It has been suggested that the court of appeals, in \n     reviewing the CSRT decisions, can fix the problem simply by \n     choosing to review the evidence itself. But that is simply \n     not the way the statute reads. The government has taken the \n     firm position in Bismullah that no review even of \n     ``significant exculpatory evidence'' is permitted under the \n     DTA. If Congress believes that the courts should be allowed \n     to review the evidence--and they clearly should be--then it \n     should change the statute to say so. It is no solution to \n     hope that the courts will ignore the actual statutory \n     language and rewrite the statute to correct the deficiency.\n\n  There you have it. Senators have been told in floor debate by the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee that the DTA ``excludes on its \nface'' any factual determination with regard to the Guantanamo \ndetainees. The groups lobbying Senators with regard to the MCA have \npointed out that having courts make their own factual determinations, \nto judge the sufficiency of the evidence behind the military's \nfindings, ``is simply not the way the statute reads.'' We are informed \nthat the Justice Department has taken the ``firm position'' that no \nevidentiary review is permitted under the DTA. And we are told that if \nwe disagree with this system, if we think that ``the courts should be \nallowed to review the evidence,'' then we ``should change the statute \nto say so.'' The Senate is clearly on notice as to how the DTA review\n\n[[Page S10405]]\n\nwill work, what the statute says on its face, how the Justice \nDepartment has construed that statute. By rejecting the Specter \namendment earlier today, and by passing the MCA later today, the Senate \nmakes clear that it does not disagree with the Justice Department and \ndoes not want to change this system.\n  I will close my remarks by quoting at length from the testimony of \nU.S. Attorney General William Barr, who spoke on the matters addressed \nby this legislation before the Judiciary Committee on June 15, 2005. \nMr. Barr's testimony informs our understanding of the history, law, and \npractical reality underlying the DTA and the MCA. I would commend his \nstatement to anyone seeking to understand these statutes and the \ncomplex relationship between the President's war-making power and the \njudiciary. This relationship is superficially similar to, but is \nfundamentally different from, the judiciary's oversight of the civilian \ncriminal justice system. I particularly found to be true Mr. Barr's \nemphasis that the proper role of the courts in this area is not \naccurately described as ``deference'' to military decisions because \ndeference implies that the ultimate decisions still lie with the \ncourts. As Mr. Barr notes, ``the point here is that the ultimate \nsubstantive decision rests with the President and that the courts have \nno authority to substitute their judgments for that of the President.''\n  Here is an extended excerpt from Attorney General Barr's testimony \nregarding the detention of alien enemy combatants:\n\n       The determination that a particular foreign person seized \n     on the battlefield is an enemy combatant has always been \n     recognized as a matter committed to the sound judgment of the \n     Commander in Chief and his military forces. There has never \n     been a requirement that our military engage in evidentiary \n     proceedings to establish that each individual captured is, in \n     fact, an enemy combatant. Nevertheless, in the case of the \n     detainees at Guantanamo, the Deputy Secretary of Defense and \n     the Secretary of the Navy have established Combatant Status \n     Review Tribunals (``CSRTs'') to permit each detainee a fact-\n     based review of whether they are properly classified as enemy \n     combatants and an opportunity to contest such designation.\n       As to the detention of enemy combatants, World War II \n     provides a dramatic example. During that war, we held \n     hundreds of thousands of German and Italian prisoners in \n     detention camps within the United States. These foreign \n     prisoners were not charged with anything; they were not \n     entitled to lawyers; they were not given access to U.S. \n     courts; and the American military was not required to \n     engage in evidentiary proceedings to establish that each \n     was a combatant. They were held until victory was \n     achieved, at which time they were repatriated. The \n     detainees at Guantanamo are being held under the same \n     principles, except, unlike the Germans and Italians, they \n     are actually being afforded an opportunity to contest \n     their designation as enemy combatants.\n       Second, once hostile forces are captured, the subsidiary \n     question arises whether they belonged to an armed force \n     covered by the protections of the Geneva Convention and hence \n     entitled to POW status? If the answer is yes, then the \n     captives are held as prisoners of war entitled to be treated \n     in accord with the various requirements of the Convention. If \n     the answer is no, then the captives are held under humane \n     conditions according to the common law of war, though not \n     covered by the various requirements of the Convention. The \n     threshold determination in deciding whether the Convention \n     applies is a ``group'' decision, not an individualized \n     decision. The question is whether the military formation to \n     which the detainee belonged was covered by the Convention. \n     This requires that the military force be that of a signatory \n     power and that it also comply with the basic requirements of \n     Article 4 of the Treaty, e.g., the militia must wear \n     distinguishing uniforms, retain a military command structure, \n     and so forth. Here, the President determined that neither al-\n     Qaeda nor Taliban forces qualified under the Treaty.\n       The third kind of action we are taking goes beyond simply \n     holding an individual as an enemy combatant. It applies so \n     far only to a subset of the detainees and is punitive in \n     nature. In some cases, we are taking the further step of \n     charging an individual with violations of the laws of war. \n     This involves individualized findings of guilt. Throughout \n     our history we have used military tribunals to try enemy \n     forces accused of engaging in war crimes. Shortly after the \n     attacks of 9/11, the President established military \n     commissions to address war crimes committed by members of al-\n     Qaeda and their Taliban supporters.\n       Again, our experience in World War II provides a useful \n     analog. While the vast majority of Axis prisoners were simply \n     held as enemy combatants, military commissions were convened \n     at various times during the war, and in its immediate \n     aftermath, to try particular Axis prisoners for war crimes. \n     One notorious example was the massacre of American troops at \n     Malmedy during the Battle of the Bulge. The German troops \n     responsible for these violations were tried before military \n     commissions.\n       Let me turn to address some of the challenges being made to \n     the way we are proceeding with these al-Qaeda and Taliban \n     detainees.\n\n\n     I. The Determination That Foreign Persons Are Enemy Combatants\n\n       The Guantanamo detainees' status as enemy combatants has \n     been reviewed and re-reviewed within the Executive Branch and \n     the military command structure. Nevertheless, the argument is \n     being advanced that foreign persons captured by American \n     forces on the battlefield have a Due Process right under the \n     Fifth Amendment to an evidentiary hearing to fully litigate \n     whether they are, in fact, enemy combatants. In over 225 \n     years of American military history, there is simply no \n     precedent for this claim.\n       The easy and short answer to this claim is that it has \n     been, as a practical matter, mooted by the military's \n     voluntary use of the CSRT process, which gives each detainee \n     the opportunity to contest his status as an enemy combatant. \n     As discussed below, those procedures are clearly not required \n     by the Constitution. Rather they were adopted by the military \n     as a prudential matter.\n       Nonetheless, those procedures would plainly satisfy any \n     conceivable due process standard that could be found to \n     apply. In its recent Hamdi decision, the Supreme Court set \n     forth the due process standards that would apply to the \n     detention of an American citizen as an enemy combatant. The \n     CSRT process was modeled after the Hamdi provisions and thus \n     provides at least the same level of protection to foreign \n     detainees as the Supreme Court said would be sufficient to \n     detain an American citizen as an enemy combatant. Obviously, \n     if these procedures are sufficient for American citizens, \n     they are more than enough for foreign detainees who have no \n     colorable claim to due process rights.\n       Moreover, most of the guarantees embodied in the CSRT \n     parallel and even surpass the rights guaranteed to American \n     citizens who wish to challenge their classification as enemy \n     combatants. The Supreme Court has indicated that hearings \n     conducted to determine a detainee's prisoner-of-war status, \n     pursuant to the Geneva Convention, could satisfy the core \n     procedural guarantees owed to an American citizen. In certain \n     respects, the protocols established in the CSRTs closely \n     resemble a status hearing, as both allow all detainees to \n     attend open proceedings, to use an interpreter, to call and \n     question witnesses, and to testify or not testify before the \n     panel. Furthermore, the United States has voluntarily given \n     all detainees rights that are not found in any prisoner-of-\n     war status hearing, including procedures to ensure the \n     independence of panel members and the right to a personal \n     representative to help the detainee prepare his case. \n     Nevertheless, there appear to be courts and critics who \n     continue to claim that the Due Process Clause applies and \n     that the CSRT process does not go far enough. I believe these \n     assertions are frivolous.\n       I am aware of no legal precedent that supports the \n     proposition that foreign persons confronted by U.S. troops in \n     the zone of battle have Fifth Amendment rights that they can \n     assert against the American troops. On the contrary, there \n     are at least three reasons why the Fifth Amendment has no \n     applicability to such a situation. First, as the Supreme \n     Court has consistently held, the Fifth Amendment does not \n     have extra-territorial application to foreign persons outside \n     the United States. As Justice Kennedy has observed, ``[T]he \n     Constitution does not create, nor do general principles of \n     law create, any juridical relation between our country and \n     some undefined, limitless class of non-citizens who are \n     beyond our territory.'' Moreover, as far as I am aware, prior \n     to their capture, none of the detainees had taken any \n     voluntary act to place themselves under the protection of our \n     laws; their only connection with the United States is that \n     they confronted U.S. troops on the battlefield. And finally, \n     the nature of the power being used against these individuals \n     is not the domestic law enforcement power--we are not seeking \n     to subject these individuals to the obligations and sanctions \n     of our domestic laws--rather, we are waging war against them \n     as foreign enemies, a context in which the concept of Due \n     Process is inapposite.\n       In society today, we see a tendency to impose the judicial \n     model on virtually every field of decision-making. The notion \n     is that the propriety of any decision can be judged by \n     determining whether it satisfies some objective standard of \n     proof and that such a judgment must be made by a ``neutral'' \n     arbiter based on an adversarial evidentiary hearing. What we \n     are seeing today is an extreme manifestation of this--an \n     effort to take the judicial rules and standard applicable in \n     the domestic law enforcement context and extend them to the \n     fighting of wars. In my view, nothing could be more farcical, \n     or more dangerous.\n       These efforts flow from a fundamental error--confusion \n     between two very distinct constitutional realms. In the \n     domestic realm of law enforcement, the government's role is \n     disciplinary--sanctioning an errant member of society for \n     transgressing the internal\n\n[[Page S10406]]\n\n     rules of the body politic. The Framers recognized that in the \n     name of maintaining domestic tranquility an overzealous \n     government could oppress the very body politic it is meant to \n     protect. The government itself could become an oppressor of \n     ``the people.''\n       Thus our Constitution makes the fundamental decision to \n     sacrifice efficiency in the realm of law enforcement by \n     guaranteeing that no punishment can be meted out in the \n     absence of virtual certainty of individual guilt. Both the \n     original Constitution and the Bill of Rights contain a number \n     of specific constraints on the Executive's law enforcement \n     powers, many of which expressly provide for a judicial role \n     as a neutral arbiter or ``check'' on executive power. In this \n     realm, the Executive's subjective judgments are irrelevant; \n     it must gather and present objective evidence of guilt \n     satisfying specific constitutional standards at each stage \n     of a criminal proceeding. The underlying premise in this \n     realm is that it is better for society to suffer the cost \n     of the guilty going free than mistakenly to deprive an \n     innocent person of life or liberty. The situation is \n     entirely different in armed conflict where the entire \n     nation faces an external threat. In armed conflict, the \n     body politic is not using its domestic disciplinary powers \n     to sanction an errant member, rather it is exercising its \n     national defense powers to neutralize the external threat \n     and preserve the very foundation of all our civil \n     liberties. Here the Constitution is not concerned with \n     handicapping the government to preserve other values. \n     Rather it is designed to maximize the government's \n     efficiency to achieve victory--even at the cost of \n     ``collateral damage'' that would be unacceptable in the \n     domestic realm.\n       It seems to me that the kinds of military decisions at \n     issue here--namely, what and who poses a threat to our \n     military operations--are quintessentially Executive in \n     nature. They are not amenable to the type of process we \n     employ in the domestic law enforcement arena. They cannot be \n     reduced to neat legal formulas, purely objective tests and \n     evidentiary standards. They necessarily require the exercise \n     of prudential judgment and the weighing of risks. This is one \n     of the reasons why the Constitution vests ultimate military \n     decision-making in the President as Commander-in-Chief. If \n     the concept of Commander-in-Chief means anything, it must \n     mean that the office holds the final authority to direct how, \n     and against whom, military power is to be applied to achieve \n     the military and political objectives of the campaign.\n       I am not speaking here of ``deference'' to Presidential \n     decisions. In some contexts, courts are fond of saying that \n     they ``owe deference'' to some Executive decisions. But this \n     suggests that the court has the ultimate decision-making \n     authority and is only giving weight to the judgment of the \n     Executive. This is not a question of deference--the point \n     here is that the ultimate substantive decision rests with the \n     President and that courts have no authority to substitute \n     their judgments for that of the President.\n       The Constitution's grant of ``Commander-in-Chief'' power \n     must, at its core, mean the plenary authority to direct \n     military force against persons the Commander judges as a \n     threat to the safety of our forces, the safety of our \n     homeland, or the ultimate military and political objectives \n     of the conflict. At the heart of these kinds of military \n     decisions is the judgment of what constitutes a threat or \n     potential threat and what level of coercive force should be \n     employed to deal with these dangers. These decisions cannot \n     be reduced to tidy evidentiary standards, some predicate \n     threshold, that must be satisfied as a condition of the \n     President ordering the use of military force against a \n     particular individual. What would that standard be? \n     Reasonable suspicion, probable cause, substantial evidence, \n     preponderance of the evidence, or beyond a reasonable doubt? \n     Does anyone really believe that the Constitution prohibits \n     the President from using coercive military force against a \n     foreign person--detaining him--unless he can satisfy a \n     particular objective standard of evidentiary proof?\n       Let me posit a battlefield scenario. American troops are \n     pinned down by sniper fire from a village. As the troops \n     advance, they see two men running from a building from which \n     the troops believe they had received sniper fire. The troops \n     believe they are probably a sniper team. Is it really being \n     suggested that the Constitution vests these men with due \n     process rights as against the American soldiers? When do \n     these rights arise? If the troops shoot and kill them--i.e., \n     deprive them of life--could it be a violation of due process? \n     Suppose they are wounded and it turns out they were not enemy \n     forces. Does this give rise to Bivens' Constitutional tort \n     actions for violation of due process? Alternatively, suppose \n     the fleeing men are captured and held as enemy combatants. \n     Does the due process clause really mean that they have to be \n     released unless the military can prove they were enemy \n     combatants? Does the Due Process Clause mean that the \n     American military must divert its energies and resources from \n     fighting the war and dedicate them to investigating the \n     claims of innocence of these two men?\n       This illustrates why military decisions are not susceptible \n     to judicial administration and supervision. There are simply \n     no judicially-manageable standards to either govern or \n     evaluate military operational judgments. Such decisions \n     inevitably involve the weighing of risks. One can easily \n     imagine situations in which there is an appreciable risk that \n     someone is an enemy combatant, but significant uncertainty \n     and not a preponderance of evidence. Nevertheless, the \n     circumstances may be such that the President makes a judgment \n     that prudence dictates treating such a person as hostile in \n     order to avoid an unacceptable risk to our military \n     operations. By their nature, these military judgments must \n     rest upon a broad range of information, opinion, prediction, \n     and even surmise. The President's assessment may include \n     reports from his military and diplomatic advisors, field \n     commanders, intelligence sources, or sometimes just the \n     opinion of frontline troops. He must decide what weight to \n     give each of these sources. He must evaluate risks in light \n     of the present state of the conflict and the overall military \n     and political objectives of the campaign.\n       Furthermore, extension of due process concepts from the \n     domestic prosecutive arena as a basis for judicial \n     supervision of our military operations in time of war would \n     not only be wholly unprecedented, but it would be \n     fundamentally incompatible with the power to wage war itself, \n     so altering and degrading that capacity as to negate the \n     Constitution's grant of that power to the President.\n       First, the imposition of such procedures would \n     fundamentally alter the character and mission of our combat \n     troops. To the extent that the decisions to detain persons \n     as enemy combatants are based in part on the circumstances \n     of the initial encounter on the battlefield, our frontline \n     troops will have to concern themselves with developing and \n     preserving evidence as to each individual they capture, at \n     the same time as they confront enemy forces in the field. \n     They would be diverted from their primary mission--the \n     rapid destruction of the enemy by all means at their \n     disposal--to taking notes on the conduct of particular \n     individuals in the field of battle. Like policeman, they \n     would also face the prospect of removal from the \n     battlefield to give evidence at post-hoc proceedings.\n       Nor would the harm stop there. Under this due process \n     theory, the military would have to take on the further burden \n     of detailed investigation of detainees' factual claims once \n     they are taken to the rear. Again, this would radically \n     change the nature of the military enterprise. To establish \n     the capacity to conduct individualized investigations and \n     adversarial hearings as to every detained combatant would \n     make the conduct of war--especially irregular warfare--vastly \n     more cumbersome and expensive. For every platoon of combat \n     troops, the United States would have to field three platoons \n     of lawyers, investigators, and paralegals. Such a result \n     would inject legal uncertainty into our military operations, \n     divert resources from winning the war into demonstrating the \n     individual ``fault'' of persons confronted in the field of \n     battle, and thereby uniquely disadvantage our military vis-a-\n     vis every other fighting force in the world.\n       Second, the introduction of an ultimate decision maker \n     outside of the normal chain of command, or altogether outside \n     the Executive Branch, would disrupt the unitary chain of \n     command and undermine the confidence of frontline troops in \n     their superior officers. The impartial tribunals could \n     literally overrule command decisions regarding battlefield \n     tactics and set free prisoners of war whom American soldiers \n     have risked or given their lives to capture. The effect of \n     such a prospect on military discipline and morale is \n     impossible to predict.\n       The Supreme Court's decision in Rasul v. Bush does not \n     undercut these long-standing principles. In Rasul, the \n     Supreme Court addressed a far narrower question--whether the \n     habeas statute applies extraterritorially--and expressly \n     refrained from addressing these settled constitutional \n     questions. The Court, in concluding that the habeas statute \n     reached aliens held at Guantanamo Bay, relied on the peculiar \n     language of the statute and the `` `extraordinary territorial \n     ambit' of the writ at common law.'' Of course, the \n     idiosyncrasies of the habeas statute do not have any impact \n     on judicial interpretation of the reach of the Fifth \n     Amendment or other substantive constitutional provisions. \n     Moreover, the Court's recognition in Rasul that the United \n     States exercises control, but ``not ultimate sovereignty'' \n     over the leased Guantanamo Bay territory confirms the \n     inapplicability of the Fifth Amendment to aliens held there.\n       Nevertheless, even if Guantanamo Bay is somehow deemed \n     sovereign United States territory, the Fifth Amendment is \n     still inapplicable. The Supreme Court, in addition to the \n     requisite detention on sovereign United States territory, \n     demands that the aliens only ``receive constitutional \n     protections'' when they have also ``developed substantial \n     connections with this country.'' Thus, under the Court's \n     formulation, ``lawful but involuntary'' presence in the \n     United States ``is not of the sort to indicate any \n     substantial connection with our country'' sufficient to \n     trigger constitutional protections. The ``voluntary \n     connection'' necessary to trigger the Fifth Amendment's due \n     process guarantee is sorely lacking with respect to enemy \n     combatants.\n       Whatever else may be said, there can be no dispute that \n     these individuals did not arrive at Guantanamo Bay by free \n     choice. Captured enemy combatants that have been transported \n     to Guantanamo Bay for detention thus are not entitled to \n     Fifth Amendment due process rights. It should also be noted \n     that the Supreme Court's decision in Rasul was a statutory \n     ruling, not a constitutional\n\n[[Page S10407]]\n\n     one. In other words, the Court concluded only that the \n     federal habeas statute confers jurisdiction on federal \n     district courts to hear claims brought by aliens detained at \n     Guantanamo Bay. The Court nowhere suggested that the \n     Constitution grants such aliens a right of access to American \n     courts.\n       An important consequence follows: Congress remains free to \n     restrict or even to eliminate entirely the ability of enemy \n     aliens at Guantanamo Bay to file habeas petitions. Congress \n     could consider enacting legislation that does so--either by \n     creating special procedural rules for enemy alien detainees, \n     by requiring any such habeas petitions to be filed in a \n     particular court, or by prohibiting enemy aliens from haling \n     military officials into court altogether.''\n\n  Mr. President, with the Military Commissions Act, the Senate today \nenacts Mr. Barr's third suggestion. We create a system that is \nconsistent with our treaty obligations but that also is consistent with \nmilitary tradition and the needs of our fighting forces in a time of \nwar. It is a system that will serve this Nation well. I look forward to \nthe act's passage and enactment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, since my years as a pilot with the U.S. \nNavy, nothing has been more important to me than protecting the \nAmerican people and ensuring the security of our country.\n  Today, we are at war with extremists who want to do grievous harm to \nAmerica. We all want to fight these extremists and defeat them. We all \nwant to ensure that those who committed or supported acts of terror are \nbrought to justice. The only disagreement is about how best to do that. \nWhat is the smartest, most effective way to fight and defeat our \nenemies?\n  Unfortunately, as the newly declassified National Intelligence \nEstimate testifies very clearly, our current course is, in many ways, \nplaying into the hands of the terrorists. It is stirring up virulent \nanti-Americanism around the world, it is drawing new recruits to the \njihadists' cause, and it is making America less safe.\n  We have to do a better job, and we can do a better job. It is not \ngood enough to be strong and wrong. We need to be strong and smart. \nThis is especially true when it comes to our policies on interrogating \nand trying suspected terrorists. Again, we all want to extract \ninformation from these suspects. We all want to try them and, if \nguilty, punish them. The only disagreement is about how best to do \nthat. What is the smartest, most effective way to interrogate and to \ntry these suspected terrorists?\n  There is plenty of evidence that our current course, which clearly \nincludes torturing suspects and imprisoning them without trial, is not \nworking. To take just one case in point, consider the Canadian citizen, \nwhom we now know to be completely innocent, who was arrested by the \nCIA--I use the word ``arrested'' loosely. He was picked up by the CIA, \nbound, gagged, blindfolded, and sent to Syria for interrogation under \ntorture. Not surprisingly, he told his torturers exactly what they \nwanted to hear--that he had received terrorist training in Afghanistan. \nThe truth, of course, is that he was never in Afghanistan, had no \nterrorist ties, and is completely innocent.\n  The cost to the United States for this miscarriage of justice, in \nterms of our forfeited reputation and moral standing, has been \ndisastrous--just as the revelations of torture and abuse at Abu Ghraib. \nWhat is more, it has endangered our troops in the field--now and in the \nfuture--should they fall into the hands of captors who say they have \nthe right to subject American prisoners to the same torture and abuse.\n  Again, it is not enough to be strong and wrong. We need to be strong \nand smart. We need to be true to 230 years of American jurisprudence, \nour Constitution, and the humane values that define us as Americans.\n  Back during the dark days of McCarthyism in the 1950s, former Senator \nJoseph McCarthy went on a rampage. What he was basically saying to the \nAmerican people is that we have to become like the Communists in order \nto defeat them. Cooler heads prevailed but not until Senator McCarthy \nhad done a lot of damage in this country, not until a lot of innocent \npeople were blacklisted, denied employment, many of whom committed \nsuicide because they had no place to turn. The dark days of Joseph \nMcCarthy come back to us in the guise of this military tribunal bill.\n  We do not have to become like the jihadists. We don't have to become \nlike the terrorists in order to defeat them. The best way to defeat \nthem is the same way we defeated Joseph McCarthy and the Communists. We \nstayed true to our American ideals, our American jurisprudence, and the \nhumane values we cherish as a free society. Regrettably, the bill \nbefore us fails this test. I cannot, in good conscience, support it.\n  The bill includes no barrier on the President's reinterpreting our \nobligations under the Geneva Conventions as he pleases, allowing \npractices such as simulated drowning, induced hypothermia, and extreme \nsleep deprivation. The President can allow all of those to continue, in \ncontravention of the Geneva Conventions.\n  The bill before us rewrites the War Crimes Act in a way that fails to \ngive clarity as to interrogation techniques that are allowed or \nforbidden, effectively allowing the administration--any \nadministration--to continue the abusive techniques I just mentioned.\n  The bill creates a very bizarre double standard, immunizing, on the \none hand, policymakers and the CIA and its contractors for committing \nacts of torture--immunizing them--while leaving our military troops \nsubject to prosecution under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for \nthe exact same practices. Let me repeat that. The bill creates this \ndouble standard: it immunizes the CIA, for example, and any contractors \nwith the CIA, for committing acts of torture, while at the same time \nthose same acts, if committed by a military person, would subject that \nmilitary person to prosecution under the Uniform Code of Military \nJustice.\n  What kind of a signal does this send? What kind of signal is this? \nThe bill completely eliminates the ability of noncitizens to bring a \nhabeas corpus petition, effectively removing the only remaining check \non the administration's decision regarding torture and other abuses.\n  Indeed, the habeas provisions in this bill would permit--get this--\nthe bill would permit a legal permanent resident of the United States--\na legal permanent resident of the United States--to be snatched off the \nstreet in the dark of night, bound, blindfolded, subject to indefinite \ndetention, even torture, with absolutely no way for that person to \nchallenge it in court.\n  Is that what we want to become as a nation? A legal permanent \nresident in the United States, of which there are millions in this \ncountry, taken out of his or her home at night, and we don't know what \nhappens to them? They go into the dark dungeons of who knows where. \nMaybe Guantanamo Bay.\n  Habeas corpus is the only independent remedy available to people \nbeing held in indefinite detention who, in fact, have no connection to \nterrorism.\n  I heard one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle going on \nyesterday about this habeas provision. He went on about how habeas \ncorpus is to protect U.S. citizens. It is in no way, he went on, aimed \nat protecting enemy combatants who are picked up.\n  Therein lies the problem. How do we know they are enemy combatants? \nIs it because the CIA says they are an enemy combatant? Who says they \nare an enemy combatant? This is not World War II, folks, where the \nGermans are on one side and they have uniforms, and the Japanese are on \nthe other side and they have uniforms. This is an amorphous terrorist \nwar where the terrorists don't wear uniforms. They can be dressed like \nyou or me. They can look just like you or me. So we don't know.\n  We have instances where people have been thrown into Guantanamo, for \nexample, and they were fingered by a neighbor who didn't like them and \nwanted their property or house or didn't like them because of something \nthey had done to them in the past. They fingered them and said: Guess \nwhat. They are big terrorists. People were picked up and thrown in \njail.\n  Habeas is the one provision that allows someone snatched off the \nstreets here or anywhere else suspected of being a terrorist to at \nleast come forward and say: What are the charges against me?\n  We have seen this happen in Guantanamo, people kept for months, for \nyears, without ever having a charge filed against them, and many of \nthem we found out were totally innocent.\n\n[[Page S10408]]\n\nWhat does this say to the rest of the world?\n  Senator Obama from Illinois told the story the other day about when \nhe was in Chad in August and heard about an American citizen who was \npicked up in Sudan and held by the Sudanese. He made some calls to try \nto get this person released. It was an American journalist. After a \nwhile, he was released.\n  The American journalist came back and said: I was picked up by the \nSudanese officials. I asked for permission to contact the U.S. Embassy \nwith a phone call so I could talk to our Embassy.\n  The Sudanese captor said: Why should we let you do that? You don't \nlet the people in Guantanamo Bay do that.\n  The use of habeas is not just to protect the people who are suspected \nso that we know whether they really are an enemy combatant. It is also \nas a protection for our troops, our soldiers, our civilians, our \nbusiness people traveling around the world, people traveling on \nvacation, journalists, just like this one, who may be snatched, picked \nup by a foreign government. We want to be able to say to that \ngovernment: Produce the person. What are the charges? If we don't allow \nit, we are giving the green light to every other would-be dictator \nanywhere in the world to do the same thing--any government anywhere.\n  If the moral argument against torture does not hold any weight with \nthis administration, they should just examine the abundant evidence \nthat torture simply doesn't work. This is not just my opinion, this is \nwhat the experts are saying.\n  Let me quote from a letter signed by 20 former U.S. Army \ninterrogators and interrogation technicians:\n\n       Prisoner/detainee abuse and torture are to be avoided at \n     all costs, in part because they can degrade the intelligence \n     collection effort by interfering with a skilled \n     interrogator's efforts to establish rapport with the subject.\n\n  Simply put, torture does not help gather useful, reliable, actionable \nintelligence. In fact, it inhibits the collection of such intelligence.\n  Earlier this month, the U.S. Army released its new field manual \n222.3: ``Human Intelligence Collector Operations,'' which covers \ninterrogations by the U.S. military in detail. This manual replaces the \nprevious manual and is to be used by our military personnel around the \nworld in performing interrogations.\n  The Army Field Manual explicitly bans, among other things, beating \nprisoners, sexually humiliating them, threatening them with dogs, \ndepriving them of food and water, performing mock executions, shocking \nthem with electricity, burning them, causing other pain, or subjecting \nthem to the technique called waterboarding, which simulates drowning.\n  So if these techniques are explicitly banned in the Army Field \nManual, why shouldn't they be explicitly banned for CIA personnel or \nCIA contract personnel? Why do we have a high standard for our military \nand effectively no standard for the CIA and its contractors?\n  For me, this debate about illegal imprisonment and officially \nsanctioned torture is not an abstraction. It strikes very close to home \nfor me.\n  Thirty-six years ago this summer at the height of the Vietnam war, I \nbrought back photographs of the so-called tiger cages at Con Son Island \nwhere the Vietcong and North Vietnamese prisoners, as well as civilians \nwho had committed no crime whatsoever, were being tortured and killed \nwith the full knowledge and sanction of the U.S. Government. That was \nJuly of 1970 when I was a staff person in the House of Representatives \nworking with a congressional delegation on a factfinding trip to \nVietnam.\n  We had all heard reports about the possible existence of these so-\ncalled tiger cages in which people were brutally tortured and killed. \nOur State Department and our military officials denied their existence. \nThey said it was only Communist propaganda.\n  Through various sources, I thought that the reports about the tiger \ncages were at least credible and should be investigated further.\n  Thanks to the courage of Congressman William Anderson of Tennessee \nand Congressman Augustus Hawkins of California and to Don Luce, an \nAmerican working for a nongovernmental organization, and because of the \nbravery of a young Vietnamese man who gave us the maps on how to find \nthe prison, we were able to expose the tiger cages on Con Son Island.\n  This young Vietnamese man about whom I speak was let out of the tiger \ncages, but they kept his brother, and they said: If you breathe one \nword about this, we are going to kill your brother.\n  Why did they let him out of the tiger cages? Because he was president \nof the student body at Saigon University. What had been his crime? He \nhad demonstrated against the war. So they picked up he and his brother \nand threw them in the tiger cages and tortured them.\n  The students refused to go back to class--this was a big deal--until \nthey returned this young man to his university, which they did, but \nthey kept his brother and said: If you breathe a word of this, we will \nkill him.\n  This young man decided he needed to take a chance, and he took a \nchance on me. He drew the maps and gave us the story on how to find \nthese tiger cages which were well hidden, and without the maps we never \nwould have found them. Fortunately, I had a camera and a hidden tape \nrecorder which proved useful when I returned to the United States.\n  Supporters of the war claim that the tiger cages were not all that \nbad. But then Life magazine published my pictures, and the world saw \nthe horrific conditions where, in clear violation of the Geneva code, \nNorth Vietnamese, Vietcong, as well as civilian opponents of the war--\njust civilians--who committed no crimes whatsoever--were all crowded \ntogether in these cages, as I said, in clear violation of the Geneva \nConventions and the most fundamental principles of human rights.\n  At the same time, the U.S. Government had been insisting that the \nNorth Vietnamese abided by the Geneva Conventions in their treatment of \nprisoners in North Vietnam. Yet here we were condoning and even \nsupervising the torture of civilian Vietnamese, along with Vietnamese \nsoldiers and others in clear violation of the Geneva Conventions.\n  We may not have known about it--our public did not know about that--\nbut the Vietnamese sure knew about it.\n  I thought we had learned our lesson from that, and then I saw Abu \nGhraib and thought: Wait a minute. Haven't we learned our lesson? And, \nMr. President, just as 37 years ago when the tiger cages were first \ntalked about, they were denied--and they thought they could deny them \nbecause it was hard to get to the island. You couldn't really get out \nthere. As far as they knew, no one had ever taken pictures of it and no \none had really ever escaped from there, like a Devil's Island kind of \nplace. So the military denied it. Our Government denied it year after \nyear until I was able to take the pictures and bring back the evidence.\n  Mr. President, I submit to you and everyone here and the American \npeople that had not that courageous soldier taken the pictures of Abu \nGhraib and kept those pictures, they would have denied that ever \nhappened. They would have denied to high Heaven that such things took \nplace at Abu Ghraib. Thankfully, one courageous young soldier decided \nthis was wrong, it was inhumane, it was not upholding the highest human \nstandards of America, and it was in violation of the Geneva \nConventions. Had he not taken those pictures, it would be denied \nforever that ever happened at Abu Ghraib.\n  So now, as if we learned nothing from that previous tragedy of the \ntiger cages 36 years ago or Abu Ghraib just a couple of years ago, here \nwe go again denying obvious instances of torture and abuse, effectively \ngiving the green light to torture by U.S. Government agents and \ncontractors and watering down the War Crimes Act.\n  This is a betrayal of our laws. It is a betrayal of our values. It is \na betrayal of everything that makes us unique and proud to be \nAmericans.\n  The administration apparently thinks that we will just go along with \nthis betrayal because there is an election in 6 weeks. Apparently they \nthink we are afraid of being branded weak on terrorism. Indeed, some \nare no doubt hoping that we will vote against this bill so they can use \nit as a bludgeon against us in the election. All I can say is: Shame on \nthem. What is more, it is not going to work. Because opposing\n\n[[Page S10409]]\n\nthis bill, which would give the green light to torture, is far, far \nbigger than the outcome of the November election.\n  This is about preserving our core values as Americans. It is about \nstanding up for our troops and ensuring that they do not become subject \nto the same acts of torture and retaliation. It is about standing up \nfor American citizens, civilians, and others who may be caught up in \nsome foreign land with false charges filed against them, and yet not \neven being able to contact our embassy. It is about protecting \nAmericans. And it is about changing course and beginning to wage an \neffective war against the terrorists who attacked us on September 11, \n2001.\n  It is time to quit being strong and wrong, and it is time to start \nbeing strong and smart. Being strong and wrong has been a disaster. It \nhas bogged us down in a civil war in Iraq. It has turbocharged the \nterrorists. It has made America less safe. So it is time to be strong \nand smart. It is time to be true to who we are as Americans. It is time \nto say no to indefinite--indefinite--incarceration. It is time to say \nno to taking away the right of someone put away to at least have the \ncharges pressed against them. It is time to say no to torture in all \nits forms now and at any time in the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to start by complimenting Senators \nWarner, McCain and Graham and the work that they did to improve this \nbill, particularly in two areas.\n  First, our colleagues did the right thing by rejecting the attempt by \nthe administration to reinterpret, by statute, Common Article III of \nthe Geneva Conventions. That would have been an enormous mistake--and \nan invitation for other countries to define for themselves what the \nGeneva Conventions require.\n  Second, our colleagues were right to reject the use of secret \nevidence in military commissions. Such a proposal is not consistent \nwith American jurisprudence, and would not have satisfied the \nrequirements of the Supreme Court decision in Hamdan.\n  Overall, the bill provides a much better framework for trying \nunlawful enemy combatants than under the flawed order issued by the \nPresident. All this is positive, and our three colleagues deserve \ncredit for their good work.\n  But the bill contains a significant flaw. It limits the right of \nhabeas corpus in a manner that is probably unconstitutional. Don't take \nmy word for it. Listen to the words of a conservative Republican, \nKenneth Starr, who used to sit on this nation's second highest court, \nand is now one of the country's leading appellate advocates, in a \nletter written to Senator Specter earlier this week:\n\n       Article 1, section 9, clause 2 of the United States \n     Constitution provides that ``[t]he privilege of the Writ of \n     Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of \n     Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.'' The \n     United States is neither in a state of rebellion nor \n     invasion. Consequently, it would be problematic for Congress \n     to modify the constitutionally protected writ of habeas \n     corpus under current events.\n\n  Accordingly, I believe this bill is likely unconstitutional. I hope \nthat I am wrong. But I fear that I am right, and that we will be back \nhere in a few years debating this issue again.\n  We had one chance to get this right--to ensure that we don't end up \nback here again after a new round of litigation. There was no reason to \nrush. No one challenges our right to detain the high-value prisoners \nthe President just transferred to Guantanamo. We are not about to \nrelease them--nor should we.\n  But rush we did. In the last week, there have been two different \nversions of the legislation that emerged from closed-door negotiations \nwith the administration. My colleagues may be willing to trust the \nlegal judgment and competence of this administration. But I am not.\n  Since 9/11, several major cases have gone to the Supreme Court that \nrelate to the laws governing the war on al-Qaida and the President's \npowers. And the administration has been wrong too many times--wrong \nabout whether habeas corpus rights applied to detainees in Guantanamo \nBay, wrong about whether U.S. citizens detained as enemy combatants had \na right to meaningful due process, and wrong about whether the military \ncommissions the President established by order were legal. Simply put, \nI am not willing to trust the administration's legal judgment again. \nAnd it is clear that the administration has put its imprint on this \nlegislation in several troubling respects, including in the stripping \nof habeas rights.\n  In the struggle in which we are engaged against radical \nfundamentalists, we must be both tough and smart. This bill is not \nsmart because it risks continued litigation about how we detain and try \nunlawful enemy combatants.\n  It is also not smart because it risks continued harm to the image of \nthe United States. The 9/11 Commission concluded that ``[a]llegations \nthat the United States abused prisoners in its custody make it harder \nto build the diplomatic, political, and military alliances the \ngovernment will need.'' The recently released National Intelligence \nEstimate made plain that there are several factors fueling the spread \nof the jihadist movement, including ``entrenched grievances, such as \ncorruption, injustice, and fear of Western domination, leading to \nanger, humiliation, and a sense of powerlessness.'' The mistreatment of \ndetainees at Abu Ghraib, and concerns about our policies governing \ndetainees at Guantanamo Bay, undoubtedly fuel these grievances and \nanger against the United States. Our detainee policies have also made \nit harder for our allies to support our anti-terrorism policies. We \nhave to get this right.\n  Therefore, even though our colleagues achieved significant \nimprovements, I cannot support this legislation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this point in time I yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona 14 minutes.\n  I would say that I have been privileged to be a Member of this \ninstitution for now 28 years, and I first met John McCain through his \nfather when I was Secretary of the Navy. So that goes back 28 plus \nanother 5 years that I have known of John McCain.\n  This Chamber, and indeed all of America, knows full well about the \nextraordinary record that this man has in the service of his Nation, \nshowing unselfishness, showing courage, showing foresight.\n  I am proud to have worked with him as a partner in these past weeks, \nindeed, months now, on this piece of legislation.\n  I just want to express my gratitude, and I think the gratitude of \nmany people across this country, for the service he is rendering the \nSenate and hopefully will continue to render the Senate in the coming \nyears.\n  When I step down under the caucus, it is my hope that John McCain is \nelected to succeed me as chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  But at this point in time, I am proud to yield, as manager, my time \nto the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Arizona yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I heartily join my good friend from \nVirginia in his assessment of Senator McCain. I know there has been \nsome disagreement as to who would go first, but that should not in any \nway, I hope, cloud the real affection which I think everybody in this \nbody holds for Senator McCain and the effort he has made for so long to \ntry to bring some kind of decency to the approaches we use to people \nwhom we detain.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 14 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank both my friends of many years, \nSenator Levin and Senator Warner, for the collegiality, the \nbipartisanship, and the effort that we all make under their leadership \non the Armed Services Committee for the betterment of the men and women \nwho serve our country and our Nation's defense. I am honored to serve \nunder both.\n  For the record, I believe I just calculated, I say to my dear friend \nfrom Virginia, it has been 33 years since I came home from Vietnam and \nfound that our distinguished Secretary of the Navy was very concerned \nabout the welfare of those who had the lack of talent that we were able \nto get shot down. So I thank my friend from Virginia especially, and I \nthank my friend from Michigan. I believe our committee conducts itself \nin a fashion\n\n[[Page S10410]]\n\nwhich has been handed down to us from other great Members of the \nSenate, such as Richard Russell and others.\n  Mr. President, before I move on to other issues, I have heard some \ncriticism on the Senate floor today about the way in which the bill \ntreats admissibility of coerced testimony.\n  A New York Times editorial today said that in this legislation \n``coercion is defined in a way that exempts anything done before the \npassage of the 2005 Detainee Treatment Act, and anything else Mr. Bush \nchooses'' in their own inimitable style.\n  This is thoroughly incorrect, and I would like to correct not only \nthe impression but the facts.\n  This bill excludes any evidence obtained through illegal \ninterrogation techniques, including those prohibited by the 2005 \nDetainee Treatment Act. The goal is to bolster the Detainee Treatment \nAct by ensuring that the fruits of any illegal treatment will be per se \ninadmissible in the military commissions.\n  For evidence obtained before passage of the Detainee Treatment Act, \nwe adopted the approach recommended by the military JAGs. In order to \nadmit such evidence, the judge--we leave it to the judge--must find \nthat: it passes the legal reliability test--and, as applied in \npractice, the greater the degree of coercion, the more likely the \nstatement will not be admitted; the evidence possesses sufficient \nprobative value; and that the interests of justice would best be served \nby admission of the statement into evidence.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that three different letters \nfrom three different JAGs--Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps--be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Department of the Air Force,\n\n\n                                   Headquarter U.S. Air Force,\n\n                                   Washington DC, August 28, 2006.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Thank you for your letter of 23 August \n     2006, in which you requested my written recommendations on \n     the military commissions legislation Congress is expected to \n     consider next month. You specifically ask for my personal \n     views on the most pressing issues involving the legislation.\n       As of the date of this letter, several bills have been \n     introduced and I believe the administration is also \n     considering legislation for congressional consideration. I \n     appreciate the opportunity to provide my personal perspective \n     and comments on the general nature of the potential \n     legislation.\n       I begin with the premise that legislation is appropriate. \n     As the Supreme Court noted again in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld. 548 \n     U.S.     , 126 S.Ct. 2749 (2006), the President's powers in \n     wartime are at their greatest when specifically authorized by \n     Congress. While different approaches are feasible, I believe \n     the Nation will be best served by a fresh start to the \n     military commission process. Existing criminal justice \n     systems, including the process established by Military \n     Commission Order 1, should be reviewed to develop a system \n     that will best serve the interests of justice and the United \n     States. The Uniform Code of Military Justice (10 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 801 et. seq.) (UCMJ) and the Manual for Courts-Martial \n     (MCM) provide superb starting points. The processes and \n     procedures in the UCMJ and MCM have served us well and can be \n     readily adapted to meet the needs of military conmnssions.\n       As I have testified, Congress could enact a UCMJ Article \n     135a to establish the basic substantive requirements for \n     military commissions, and an executive order could provide \n     detailed guidance, just as the MCM provides detailed guidance \n     for the trial of courts-martial. Alternatively, Congress \n     could create a separate Code of Military Commissions as a new \n     chapter in Title 10, modeled to an appropriate degree after \n     the UCMJ, and similarly leave the details to an executive \n     order. Either approach must address the requirements of the \n     Geneva Conventions and the concerns articulated in Hamdan.\n       There will necessarily be differences between current \n     court-martial procedures and the rules and procedures for \n     military commissions. However, the processes and procedures \n     in the UCMJ and MCM can be readily adapted to meet the needs \n     of military commissions and still meet the requirements of \n     criminal justice systems established by common Article 3 of \n     the Geneva Conventions.\n       The legislation must appropriately address access to \n     evidence and the accused's presence during the trial. \n     Specifically, it is my strongly held view that all evidence \n     admitted against an accused and provided to members of a \n     military commission must also be provided to the accused and \n     accused's counsel. Any statute that allows evidence to be \n     admitted outside the presence of the accused would mean the \n     military commission could convict (and possibly impose a \n     sentence of death) without the accused ever fully knowing the \n     evidence considered against him: Such a procedure is \n     extremely problematic, both constitutionally and from a \n     Common Article 3 perspective.\n       The accused's presence is a critical facet of this \n     legislation. The United States is more than a nation of laws; \n     it is a country founded upon strong moral principles of \n     fairness to all. Moreover, our country--to the delight of our \n     adversaries--has been heavily criticized because of the \n     perception that the pre-Hamdan military commission process \n     was unfair and did not afford ``all the judicial guarantees \n     which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.''\n       Now is the time to correct that perception and clearly \n     establish procedures and rules that meet that standard. These \n     procedures and rules will do more than merely correct legal \n     deficiencies; they will help reestablish the United States as \n     the leading advocate of the rule of law. I firmly believe \n     doing so is an important facet of winning the global war on \n     terrorism.\n       Inextricably tied to that concept is an awareness of \n     reciprocity. We cannot hold out as acceptable a military \n     commission process that we would consider to be unfair and \n     illegal if used by a foreign authority to try captured United \n     States servicemen and women for alleged offenses.\n       Additionally, concerns have been raised about other \n     evidentiary and procedural issues, including the ability of \n     the accused to represent himself, and the admissibility of \n     hearsay, classified evidence, and an accused's own \n     statements.\n       The right of an accused to represent himself pro se is well \n     recognized in our jurisprudence. In the context of military \n     commissions, it presents difficult issues. Current procedures \n     allow an accused to expressly waive the right to be \n     represented and conduct his defense personally. That option \n     should be available if the accused competently demonstrates \n     to the military judge he understands the potential \n     disadvantages and consequences of self-representation and he \n     voluntarily and knowingly waives the right to representation. \n     The military judge should have the authority to require that \n     a defense counsel remain present even if the waiver is \n     granted and to revoke the waiver if the accused is disruptive \n     or fails to follow basic rules of decorum and procedure. This \n     right is obviously contingent on the accused's presence \n     throughout the proceeding as well as access to the evidence.\n       Again, I recommend that Congress detail the basic \n     evidentiary requirements in the legislation and then permit \n     an executive order to flesh out the details, just as the MCM \n     provides evidentiary details for the UCMJ. Evidence should be \n     admissible if, in the judgment of an experienced military \n     judge, there are guarantees of its trustworthiness, the \n     evidence has probative value, and the interests of justice \n     are best served by its admission.\n       There has been some comment that the admission of hearsay \n     is improper. In my view, such criticisms reflect a \n     misunderstanding of the rules of evidence used in Federal, \n     military and state trials today. Under the Military Rules of \n     Evidence (MRE), hearsay is not admissible except as provided \n     in the MREs or by statute. The MREs further define statements \n     that are not hearsay and provide for exceptions conditioned \n     on the availability of the declarant. Additionally, there is \n     a residual hearsay rule that permits the introduction of \n     other statements, having equivalent circumstantial guarantees \n     of trustworthiness, if the court determines that the \n     statement is material evidence; has more probative value than \n     other available evidence; and serves the interests of \n     justice. The Supreme Court recently narrowed the application \n     of residual hearsay as it applies to out-of-court statements \n     that are testimonial in nature. Such statements are now \n     barred unless there is a showing that the witness is \n     unavailable and the accused had a prior opportunity to cross-\n     examine the witness. The overall application of the residual \n     hearsay rule is functionally very much like that used in \n     international tribunals and requires a military judge to find \n     the evidence is probative and reliable. These existing \n     procedures provide a meaningful starting point for addressing \n     the hearsay issues arising in military commissions.\n       As to the use of classified evidence, I believe the \n     procedures of MRE 505 adequately protect national security. \n     MRE 505 is based on the Classified Information Procedures Act \n     (CIP A) (Title 18, U.S.C. App III). CIP A is designed to \n     prevent unnecessary or inadvertent disclosures of classified \n     information and advise the government of the national \n     security implications of going forward with certain evidence. \n     MRE 505 achieves a reasonable accommodation of the United \n     States' interest in protecting information and the accused's \n     need to be able to mount a defense. The rule permits in \n     camera, ex parte consideration of the Government's concerns \n     by a judge, the substitution of unclassified summaries or \n     other alternative forms of evidence, and ensures fairness to \n     the accused. Under MRE 505, both the prosecution and the \n     accused rely on and know about the evidence going to the \n     court. The accused knows all that is to be considered by the \n     trier-of-fact, has an opportunity to respond, and is able to \n     assist the defense counsel to respond appropriately.\n       Concerns about the admissibility of statements made by an \n     accused primarily involve the current requirement to provide \n     Miranda warnings (codified more broadly in the UCMJ at \n     Article 31) and whether the statement is the product of \n     torture or coercion.\n\n[[Page S10411]]\n\n     The military commission process must recognize the \n     battlefield is not an orderly place. The requirement to warn \n     an individual before questioning is one area where deviation \n     from the established UCMJ framework may well be warranted.\n       Generally, if a military judge concludes the confession or \n     admission of an accused is involuntary, the statement is not \n     admissible in a court-martial over the accused's objection. \n     Commonly, a statement is involuntary if it is obtained in \n     violation of the self-incrimination privilege or due process \n     clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States; Article 31; or through the use of coercion, \n     unlawful influence, or unlawful inducement. Each situation is \n     obviously fact determinative and the military judge decides \n     whether the statement is voluntary considering the totality \n     of the circumstances. I trust the judgment of experienced \n     military judges. Military commissions should not be permitted \n     to consider evidence that is found to be unlawfully coerced \n     and thus involuntary.\n       Finally, appellate jurisdiction over military commission \n     decisions should be clearly established. That jurisdiction \n     would be most appropriately vested in the United States Court \n     of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (consistent \n     with the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005).\n       I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if \n     additional information or comments from me on this matter are \n     desired.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Jack L. Rives,\n\n                                              Major General, USAF,\n     The Judge Advocate General.\n                                  ____\n\n         Department of the Navy,\n\n\n        Office of the Judge Advocate General, Washington Navy \n                                                         Yard,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Aug. 31, 2006.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain. Thank you for your letter of August \n     23, 2006 requesting my personal views on military commission \n     legislation.\n       Before proceeding with discussion of specific issues, I \n     would like to note that I have had the opportunity to provide \n     comment to the DoD General Counsel and the Department of \n     Justice regarding draft commission legislation. As of this \n     writing, I have not seen the final version of the \n     Administration's draft.\n       Although existing courts-martial rules are not practical \n     for the prosecution of unlawful enemy combatants, they \n     provide a good starting point for the drafting of Commission \n     legislation. I recommend that legislation establish the \n     jurisdiction of military commissions, set baseline standards \n     of structure, procedure, and evidence consistent with U.S. \n     law and the law of war, and prescribe all substantive \n     offenses. It also should authorize the President to \n     promulgate supplemental rules of practice. In this regard, I \n     believe we should follow the military justice model, whereby \n     Congress establishes the legal framework (the Uniform Code of \n     Military Justice, or in this case a Code for Military \n     Commissions) and the President promulgates supplemental rules \n     of practice (a Manual for Courts-Martial, or in this case a \n     Manual for Military Commissions) .\n       Within that context, I recommend that the jurisdiction of \n     military commissions be expanded to permit prosecution of all \n     unlawful enemy combatants who engage in or attempt to engage \n     in hostilities against the United States. In particular, we \n     need the ability to prosecute before military commissions \n     irregular belligerents who violate the laws of war while \n     acting on behalf of foreign governments as well as terrorists \n     not associated with al Qaida and/or the Taliban.\n       With regard to baseline standards of structure, procedure, \n     and evidence, it is critically important that independent \n     military judges preside at military commissions and have \n     authority to make final rulings on all matters of law. \n     Similarly, defense counsel must have an independent reporting \n     chain of command, free from both actual and perceived \n     influence of prosecution and convening authorities.\n       The introduction of evidence outside the presence of an \n     accused is, in my view, inconsistent with U.S. law and the \n     law of war. The Supreme Court held in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 126 \n     S.Ct. 2749 (2006), that absent a sufficient practical need to \n     deviate from existing U.S. laws and criminal trial \n     procedures, an accused must be present at trial and have \n     access to all evidence presented against him. A four-justice \n     plurality also opined that Common Article 3 of the 1949 \n     Geneva Conventions requires, at a minimum, that an accused be \n     present at trial and have access to the evidence presented \n     against him. Justice Kennedy, who was not part of the \n     plurality, further signaled in a separate concurring opinion \n     that introduction of evidence outside the presence of the \n     accused would be ``troubling'' and, if done to the prejudice \n     of the accused would be grounds for reversal. Furthermore, as \n     a matter of policy, adopting such practice for military \n     commissions may encourage others to reciprocate in kind \n     against U.S. service members held in captivity.\n       I recommend that the legislation adopt Military Rule of \n     Evidence 505 (M.R.E. 505), which is partly based on the \n     Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA). M.R.E. 505 \n     permits a military judge to conduct an in camera, ex parte \n     review of the Government's interest in protecting classified \n     information and encourages the substitution of unclassified \n     summaries or alternative forms of evidence in lieu of the \n     classified information. This type of procedure ensures that \n     classified information is not disclosed under circumstances \n     that could injure national security.\n       While it is true that application of a M.R.E. 55-style \n     process might conceivably result in the Government being \n     unable to introduce evidence against an accused under certain \n     circumstances, it is my view that we are better served by \n     fully honoring the law of war, which requires that we afford \n     even terrorists the judicial guarantees which are recognized \n     as indispensable amongst civilized peoples when we choose \n     to prosecute. For it is that very same law that allows us \n     to hold terrorists for the duration of hostilities, \n     however long those hostilities might last.\n       With regard to hearsay evidence, I have no objection to the \n     introduction of hearsay evidence so long as the evidentiary \n     standard is clarified to exclude information that is \n     unreliable, not probative, unfairly prejudicial, confusing, \n     or misleading, or when such exclusion is necessary to protect \n     the integrity of the proceedings. Such an approach would be \n     consistent with the practice of international war crimes \n     tribunals supported by the United States in Rwanda and the \n     former Yugoslavia. Those tribunals satisfy the requirements \n     of the law of war including Common Article 3 of the Geneva \n     Conventions of 1949.\n       With regard to statements alleged to have been derived from \n     coercion, the presiding military judge should have the \n     discretion and authority to inquire into the underlying \n     factual circumstances and exclude any statement derived from \n     coercion, in order to protect the integrity of the \n     proceeding.\n       As I noted earlier, the legislation should enumerate all \n     offenses triable by military commission. Conspiracy should be \n     included, but only conspiracies to commit one of the \n     substantive offenses specifically enumerated and there must \n     be a requirement to prove the defendant committed an overt \n     act in furtherance of the conspiracy. This would mean, for \n     example, that conspiracy to commit murder in violation of the \n     laws of war would be a cognizable offense, but affiliation \n     with a terrorist organization, standing alone, would not be \n     cognizable.\n       I would also like to address Common Article 3 of the Geneva \n     Conventions. Common Article 3 is a baseline standard that \n     U.S. Armed Forces have trained to for decades. Its \n     application to the War on Terror imposes no new requirements \n     on us. However, if Congress desires to clarify the Common \n     Article 3 phrase ``outrages upon personal dignity, in \n     particular humiliating and degrading treatment,'' this would \n     be beneficial. The legislation might consider requiring an \n     objective standard be used in interpreting this phrase, and \n     define the language to encompass willful acts of violence, \n     brutality, or physical injury, and so severely humiliating or \n     degrading as to constitute an attack on human dignity. \n     Examples of such conduct include forcing detainees to perform \n     sexual acts, threatening a detainee with sexual mutilation, \n     systematically beating detainees, and forcing them into \n     slavery: Such an approach would accurately reflect \n     established war crimes jurisprudence and adoption would \n     prevent the perception that we are attempting to abrogate our \n     obligations under the 1949 Geneva Conventions.\n       Thank you again for this opportunity to provide personal \n     comment on military commission legislation. I hope that this \n     information is helpful.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Bruce MacDonald,\n\n                                    Rear Admiral, JAGC, U.S. Navy,\n     Judge Advocate General.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Department of the Navy,\n\n\n                               Headquarters U.S. Marine Corps,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Aug. 31, 2006.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain. Thank you for your letter of 23 August \n     2006, in which you requested written recommendations from the \n     service Judge Advocates General on the military commissions \n     legislation Congress is expected to consider in September. \n     You specifically asked for our personal views on the most \n     pressing issues involving the legislation. I appreciate the \n     opportunity to provide my personal perspective and comments.\n       Although I assumed the position of Staff Judge Advocate to \n     the Commandant of the Marine Corps on 25 August, I am \n     certainly familiar with the process to date, including the \n     previous testimony of my predecessor, Brigadier General Kevin \n     M. Sandkuhler, and the Judge Advocates General. Like them, I \n     believe that military commissions, in some form, are both \n     appropriate and necessary in prosecuting alleged terrorists \n     while continuing to wage the Global War on Terror. I also \n     believe that there is middle ground to be found between the \n     Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and the original \n     military commissions process, which would comport with the \n     requirements of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.\n       Any legislation must be approached with an eye toward both \n     precedent and reciprocity. We must account for the values for \n     which our nation has always stood, and also be cognizant of \n     the fact that the solution we create may influence how our \n     service members are judged internationally in the future.\n       I share in the strong position previously expressed by the \n     Judge Advocates General\n\n[[Page S10412]]\n\n     regarding the fundamental importance of an accused's access \n     to evidence and presence at trial. Simply put, an accused \n     (and his counsel) must be provided the evidence admitted \n     against him. This may require the government to balance the \n     need for prosecution on particular charges against the need \n     to protect certain classified information. This balancing \n     concept is not new. Domestically, the government must often \n     weigh the sanctity of sensitive information against having to \n     disclose it for use in a successful prosecution believe that \n     the indispensable ``judicial guarantees'' referenced in \n     Common Article 3 require the same sort of deliberative \n     decision-making in the context of these commissions. Where \n     the government intends to prosecute an accused using \n     classified information, Military Rule of Evidence (MRE) 505 \n     should serve as the evidentiary benchmark.\n       The commissions should be presided over by a certified and \n     qualified (pursuant to Article 26 of the UCMJ) military \n     judge, who is trained to make measured evidentiary rulings. \n     While I recommend that Congress allow for an executive order \n     to promulgate specific applicable evidentiary rules (same as \n     with the Manual for Courts-Martial, or MCM), I do offer \n     comment here on what I believe are two more notable \n     evidentiary issues: hearsay and statements by an accused.\n       Regarding hearsay evidence, the residual hearsay exception \n     found in the Military Rules of Evidence (MRE) provides a \n     solid foundation upon which to build for the commissions. \n     This exception requires that a military judge find the \n     evidence to be probative and reliable--a standard with \n     international acceptance. In practice, this standard could \n     allow for alternatives to live testimony, such as by video \n     teleconference, which take into account the global nature of \n     the conflict.\n       I share previously expressed concerns about the \n     admissibility of statements made by an accused as a product \n     of torture or coercion. Without exception, statements \n     obtained by torture, as defined in Title 18 of the U.S. Code, \n     must be inadmissible. Coercion is a more nebulous concept. As \n     a result, military judges should retain discretion to \n     determine whether statements so alleged are admissible. After \n     an examination of all the facts and circumstances surrounding \n     the statement, the military judge could determine if it is \n     inadmissible because it is either unreliable or lacking in \n     probative value.\n       In closing, I submit that the jurisdiction of the military \n     commissions should be broad enough to facilitate the \n     prosecution of all unlawful enemy combatants, and not merely \n     members of al Qaida, the Taliban, and associated \n     organizations. Jurisdiction must extend to other terrorist \n     groups, regardless of their level of organization, and the \n     individual ``freelancers'' so common on the current \n     battlefield.\n       Thank you again for the opportunity to provide comment. I \n     look forward to continuing to work toward resolution of this \n     matter.\n           Very respectfully,\n\n                                              James C. Walker,\n\n                                          Brigadier General, USMC,\n                           Staff Judge Advocate to the Commandant.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the JAG of the Air Force says:\n\n       . . . through the use of coercion, unlawful influence, or \n     unlawful inducement. Each situation is obviously fact \n     determinative and the military judge decides whether the \n     statement is voluntary considering the totality of the \n     circumstances. I trust the judgment of experienced military \n     judges. Military commissions should not be permitted to \n     consider evidence that is found to be unlawfully coerced and \n     thus involuntary.\n\n  And the other two Judge Advocate Generals say the same thing, that \nthe provisions of this bill are exactly in line with their opinions. \nFrankly, that had a great deal of weight in our adopting them.\n  Almost exactly 3 months ago, the Supreme Court decided the \ngroundbreaking case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld. In that case, a majority of \nthe Court ruled that the military procedures used to try detainees held \nat Guantanamo Bay fell short of the standards of the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice and the Geneva Conventions.\n  The Court also determined that Common Article 3 of the Geneva \nConventions applies to al-Qaida because our conflict with that \nterrorist organization is ``not of an international character.'' Some \nof my colleagues may disagree with the Court's decision, but once \nissued it became the law of the land.\n  Unfortunately, the Hamdan decision left in its wake a void and \nuncertainty that Congress needed to address--and address quickly--in \norder to continue fighting the war on terrorism. I believe this act \nallows us to do that in a way that protects our soldiers and other \npersonnel fighting on the front lines and respects core American \nprinciples of justice. I would like to thank Senators Graham and Warner \nand many others for their unceasing work on this bill.\n  I would like to take a few moments to describe some of the key \nelements of the legislation.\n  As is by now well known, Senators Warner, Graham, and I, and others, \nhave resisted any redefinition or modification of our Nation's \nobligations under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. We did so \nbecause we care deeply about legal protections for American fighting \nmen and women and about America's moral standing in the world. More \nthan 50 retired military generals and flag officers expressed grave \nconcern about redefining our Geneva obligations, including five former \nChairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters from GEN Colin Powell, GEN Jack Vessey, and GEN Hugh Shelton, \nand a letter from the former Commandant of the Marine Corps, General \nKrulak.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 13, 2006.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I just returned to town and learned \n     about the debate taking place in Congress to redefine Common \n     Article 3 of the Geneva Convention. I do not support such a \n     step and believe it would be inconsistent with the McCain \n     amendment on torture which I supported last year.\n       I have read the powerful and eloquent letter sent to you by \n     one of my distinguished predecessors as Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff, General Jack Vessey. I fully endorse in tone \n     and tint his powerful argument. The world is beginning to \n     doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism. To \n     redefine Common Article 3 would add to those doubts. \n     Furthermore, it would put our own troops at risk.\n       I am as familiar with The Armed Forces Officer as is Jack \n     Vessey. It was written after all the horrors of World War II \n     and General George C. Marshall, then Secretary of Defense, \n     used it to tell the world and to remind our soldiers of our \n     moral obligations with respect to those in our custody.\n           Sincerely,\n     General Colin L. Powell, USA (Ret.).\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 12, 2006.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Sometimes, the news is a little \n     garbled by the time it reaches the forests of North-central \n     Minnesota, but I call your attention to recent reports that \n     the Congress is considering legislation which might relax the \n     United States' support for adherence to Common Article 3 of \n     the Geneva Convention. If that is true, it would seem to \n     weaken the effect of the McCain Amendment on torture of last \n     year. If such legislation is being considered, I fear that it \n     may weaken America in two respects. First, it would undermine \n     the moral basis which has generally guided our conduct in war \n     throughout our history. Second, it could give opponents a \n     legal argument for the mistreatment of Americans being held \n     prisoner in time of war.\n       In 1950, 3 years after the creation of the Department of \n     Defense, the then Secretary of Defense, General George C. \n     Marshall, issued a small book, titled The Armed Forces \n     Officer. The book summarized the laws and traditions that \n     governed our Armed Forces through the years. As the Senate \n     deals with the issue, it might consider a short quote from \n     the last chapter of that book which General Marshall sent to \n     every American Officer. The last chapter is titled \n     ``Americans in Combat'' and it lists 29 general propositions \n     which govern the conduct of Americans in war. Number XXV, \n     which I long ago underlined in my copy, reads as follows:\n\n       ``The United States abides by the laws of war. Its Armed \n     Forces, in their dealing with all other peoples, are expected \n     to comply with the laws of war, in the spirit and the letter. \n     In waging war, we do not terrorize helpless non-combatants, \n     if it is within our power to avoid so doing. Wanton killing, \n     torture, cruelty or the working of unusual hardship on \n     enemy prisoners or populations is not justified in any \n     circumstance. Likewise, respect for the reign of law, as \n     that term is understood in the United States, is expected \n     to follow the flag wherever it goes. . . .''\n\n       For the long term interest of the United States as a nation \n     and for the safety of our own forces in battle, we should \n     continue to maintain those principles. I continue to read and \n     hear that we are facing a ``different enemy'' in the war on \n     terror; no matter how true that may be, inhumanity and \n     cruelty are not new to warfare nor to enemies we have faced \n     in the past. In my short 46 years in the Armed Forces, \n     Americans confronted the horrors of the prison camps of the \n     Japanese in World War II, the North Koreans in 1950-53, and \n     the North Vietnamese in the long years of the Vietnam War, as \n     well as knowledge of the Nazi's holocaust depredations in \n     World War II. Through those years, we held to our own values. \n     We should continue to do so.\n       Thank you for your own personal courage in maintaining \n     those values, both in war and on the floor of the Senate. I \n     hope that my information about weakening American support for \n     Common Article 3 of the Geneva\n\n[[Page S10413]]\n\n     Convention is in error, and if not that the Senate will \n     reject any such proposal.\n           Very respectfully,\n     General John. W. Vessey, USA (Ret.).\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 20, 2006.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I have followed with great interest \n     the debate over whether to redefine in law Common Article 3 \n     of the Geneva Conventions. I join my distinguished \n     predecessors as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \n     Generals Vessey and Powell, in expressing concern regarding \n     the contemplated change. Such a move would, I believe, hinder \n     our efforts to win America's wars and protect American \n     soldiers.\n       Common Article 3 and associated Geneva provisions have \n     offered legal protections to our troops since 1949. American \n     soldiers are trained to Geneva standards and, in some cases, \n     these standards constitute the only protections remaining \n     after capture. Given our military's extraordinary presence \n     around the world, Geneva protections are critical.\n       Should the Congress redefine Common Article 3 in domestic \n     statute, the United States would be inviting similar \n     reciprocal action by other parties to the treaty. Such an \n     action would send a terrible signal to other nations that the \n     United States is attempting to water down its obligations \n     under Geneva. At a time when we are deeply engaged in a war \n     of ideas, as well as a war on the battlefield, this would be \n     an egregious mistake. I firmly believe that not only is such \n     a move unnecessary, it potentially subjects our men and women \n     in uniform to unnecessary danger.\n       The legislation sponsored by Senator Warner, which would \n     enumerate war crime offenses while remaining silent on \n     America's obligations under Common Article 3, is a better \n     course of action. By doing so, our men and women in field \n     will have the clarity they require, we can still interrogate \n     terrorists, and our service personnel will have the undiluted \n     protections offered by the Geneva Convention.\n           Respectfully,\n     General H. Hugh Shelton.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator McCain: This is the first time I have publically \n     spoken about the administration policy regarding the war \n     against terror but my professionalism and my conscience leads \n     me to comment on the proposed ``interpretation/change'' to \n     the Geneva Convention.\n       My concerns are as follows:\n       I. A redefinition or reinterpretation of the Geneva \n     Convention, a document that has been taught to every recruit \n     and officer candidate since its inception, would immediately \n     attack the moral dimension with which every Soldier, Sailor, \n     Marine and Airman is inculcated during their time as a member \n     of the US Armed Forces. By weakening the moral link that \n     these young men and women depend on . . . by allowing a \n     redefinition of a lawful Convention . . . we run the risk of \n     undermining the foundation upon which they willingly fight \n     and die for our Country.\n       2. The mothers and fathers who give their sons and \n     daughters to our care brought their children up to do \n     ``right'' . . . to obey the law . . . to take the moral high \n     ground. We do these parents a grave disservice by \n     ``legalizing'' a different standard for their children.\n       3. This issue is NOT about what our enemy does to our \n     servicemen and women when captured! This issue is all about \n     how we, as Americans, act. Do we walk our talk. Do we change \n     the rules of the game because our enemy acts in a horrific \n     manner. Do we give up our honor because our enemy is without \n     honor? If we do, we begin to mimic the very behavior we \n     abhor.\n       4. Many countries already look at the United States as \n     arrogant. This redefinition/reinterpretation would only serve \n     to strengthen that conviction. The idea that the United \n     States would ``pick and choose'' what portion of the Geneva \n     Convention to follow . . . and what portion to ``redefine/\n     reinterpret'' . . . goes against who we are as a people and \n     as a Nation. The unintended consequence of this type of \n     action is that it opens the door for other nations to make \n     interpretations of their own . . . across a gamut of issues. \n     The world is a dangerous place and our actions might well \n     serve as precedents during the first battle of the NEXT war.\n       5. Finally, Duty-Honor-Country and Semper Fidelis are NOT \n     just ``bumper stickers''. These words, and others like them, \n     form the ethos of our Armed Forces. When you start to tamper \n     with the laws governing warfare . . . laws recognized by \n     countries around the world . . . you run the risk of bringing \n     into question the very ethos that these men and women hold \n     dear.\n           Semper Fidelis,\n\n                                                  C.C. Krulak,\n\n                                              General, USMC (Ret),\n                              31st Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. These men express one common view: that modifying the \nGeneva Conventions would be a terrible mistake and would put our \npersonnel at greater risk in this war and the next. If America is seen \nto be doing anything other than upholding the letter and spirit of the \nconventions, it will be harder, not easier, to defeat our enemies. I am \npleased that this legislation before the Senate does not amend, \nredefine, or modify the Geneva Conventions in any way. The conventions \nare preserved intact.\n  The bill does provide needed clarity for our personnel about what \nactivities constitute war crimes. For the first time, there will be a \nlist of nine specific activities that constitute criminal violations of \nCommon Article 3, punishable by imprisonment or even death. There has \nbeen much public discussion about specific interrogation methods that \nmay be prohibited. But it is unreasonable to suggest that any \nlegislation could provide an explicit and all-inclusive list of what \nspecific activities are illegal and which are permitted. Still, I am \nconfident that the categories included in this section will criminalize \ncertain interrogation techniques, like waterboarding and other \ntechniques that cause serious pain or suffering that need not be \nprolonged--I emphasize ``that need not be prolonged.''\n  Some critics of this legislation have asserted that it gives amnesty \nto U.S. personnel who may have committed war crimes since the enactment \nof the War Crimes Act. Nothing--nothing--could be further from the \ntruth. As currently written, the War Crimes Act makes criminal any and \nall behavior that constitutes a violation of Common Article 3--\nspecifically, any act that constitutes an ``outrage upon personal \ndignity.'' Observers have commented that, though such outrages are \ndifficult to define precisely, we all know them when we see them. \nHowever, neither I nor any other responsible Member of this body should \nwant to prosecute and potentially sentence to death any individual for \nviolating such a vague standard.\n  The specificity that the bill provides to the War Crimes Act--and its \nretroactive effect--will actually make prosecuting war criminals a \nrealistic goal. None of my colleagues should object to that goal.\n  It is also important to note that the acts that we propose to \nenumerate in the War Crimes Act are not the only activities prohibited \nunder this legislation. The categories enumerated in the War Crimes Act \nlist only those violations of Common Article 3 that are so grave as to \nconstitute felonies potentially punishable by death. The legislation \nstates explicitly that there are other, nongrave breaches of Common \nArticle 3.\n  This legislation also requires the President to publish his \ninterpretations of the Geneva Conventions, including what violations \nconstitute nongrave breaches, in the Federal Register--in the Federal \nRegister--for every American to see. These interpretations will have \nthe same force as any other administrative regulation promulgated by \nthe executive branch and, thus, may be trumped--may be trumped--by law \npassed by Congress.\n  Simply put, this legislation ensures that we respect our obligations \nunder Geneva, recognizes the President's constitutional authority to \ninterpret treaties, and brings accountability and transparency to the \nprocess of interpretation by ensuring that the Executive's \ninterpretation is made public--the Executive's interpretation is made \npublic. The legislation would also guarantee that Congress and the \njudicial branch will retain their traditional roles of oversight and \nreview with respect to the President's interpretation of nongrave \nbreaches of Common Article 3.\n  In short, whereas last year only one law--the torture statute--was \ndeemed to apply to the treatment of all enemy detainees, now there is a \nset of overlapping and comprehensive legal standards that are in force: \nthe Detainee Treatment Act, with its prohibition on cruel, inhuman, and \ndegrading treatment as defined by the fifth, eighth, and fourteenth \namendments to the Constitution, Common Article 3 of the Geneva \nConventions, and the War Crimes Act. This legislation will allow--my \ncolleagues, have no doubt--this legislation will allow the CIA to \ncontinue interrogating prisoners within the boundaries established in \nthe bill.\n  Let me state this flatly: It was never our purpose to prevent the CIA \nfrom detaining and interrogating terrorists. On the contrary, it is \nimportant to the war on terror that the CIA have the ability to do so. \nAt the same time, the CIA's interrogation program has to abide by the \nrules, including the standards of the Detainee Treatment Act.\n\n[[Page S10414]]\n\n  I, like many of my colleagues, find troubling the reports that our \nintelligence personnel feel compelled to purchase liability insurance \nbecause of the lack of legal clarity that exists in the wake of the \nHamdan decision. This legislation provides an affirmative defense for \nany Government personnel prosecuted under the War Crimes Act for \nactions they reasonably believed to be legal at the time. That is a \nlongstanding precedent. In addition, it would eliminate any private \nright of action against our personnel based on a violation of the \nGeneva Conventions. The intent of this provision is to protect \nofficers, employees, members of the Armed Forces, and other agents of \nthe United States from suits for money damages or any other lawsuits \nthat could harm the financial well-being of our personnel who were \nengaged in lawful--I emphasize ``lawful''--activities.\n  It is important to note, however, that the fact that the Geneva \nConventions lack a private right of action--and the fact that this \nlegislation does not create such a right--has absolutely no bearing on \nwhether the Conventions are binding on the executive branch. Even if \nthe Geneva Conventions do not enable detainees to sue our personnel for \nmoney damages, the President and his subordinates are nevertheless \nbound to comply with Geneva. That is clear to me and to all who have \nnegotiated this legislation in good faith.\n  This point is critical, because our personnel deserve not only the \nlegal protections written into this legislation, but also the undiluted \nprotections offered since 1949 by the Geneva Conventions. Should the \nUnited States be seen as amending, modifying, or redefining the Geneva \nConventions, it would open the door for our adversaries to do the same, \nnow and in the future. The United States should champion the Geneva \nConventions, not look for ways to get around them, lest we invite \nothers to do the same. America has more personnel deployed, in more \nplaces, than any other country in the world, and this unparalleled \nexposure only serves to further demonstrate the critical importance of \nour fulfilling the letter and the spirit of our international \nobligations. To do any differently would put our fighting men and women \ndirectly at risk. We owe it to our fighting men and women to uphold the \nGeneva Conventions, just as we have done for 57 years.\n  For these reasons, this bill makes clear that the United States will \nfulfill all of its obligations under those Conventions. We expect the \nCIA to conduct interrogations in a manner that is fully consistent not \nonly with the Detainee Treatment Act and the War Crimes Act, but with \nall of our obligations under Common Article 3 of the Geneva \nConventions.\n  Finally, I note that there has been opposition to this legislation \nfrom some quarters, including the New York Times editorial page. \nWithout getting into a point-by-point rebuttal here on the floor, I \nsimply say that I have been reading the Congressional Record trying to \nfind the bill that page so vociferously denounced. The hyperbolic \nattack is aimed not at any bill this body is today debating, nor even \nat the administration's original position. I can only presume that some \nwould prefer that Congress simply ignore the Hamdan decision and pass \nno legislation at all. That, I suggest to my colleagues, would be a \ntravesty.\n  This is a very long, difficult task. This is critical for the future \nsecurity of this Nation, and we have done the very best we can. I \nbelieve we have come up with a good product. I believe good-faith \nnegotiations have taken place. I hope we will pass this legislation \nvery soon. I think you will find that people will be brought to justice \nand we can move forward with trials with treating people under the \nGeneva Conventions and restoring America's prestige in the world.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to commend our distinguished \ncolleague on an excellent summary of the bill and his heartfelt \nexpressions and interpretations of this bill, which I share.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is from strength that America should \ndefend our values and our Constitution. It takes a commitment to those \nvalues to demand accountability from the Government. In standing up for \nAmerican values and security, I will vote against this bill.\n  I can give you many reasons, but let me take one. We will turn back \nthe protections of the Great Writ of habeas corpus. Since 13th century \nAnglo jurisprudence, we have had the Great Writ. We have had habeas \ncorpus since the birth of our Nation. We fought a revolution to make \nsure we could retain it. We fought a civil war, and we fought through \ntwo world wars. Now, in a matter of hours, in a debate that has so \noften skirted the issues, we are ready to strip back habeas corpus. I \ncannot vote for that.\n  Senator Smith spoke stirringly earlier today of the dangers of the \nbill's habeas provision, which would eliminate the independent judicial \ncheck on Government overreaching and lawlessness. He quoted from great \ndefenders of liberty. It was Justice Robert H. Jackson who said in his \nrole as Chief Counsel for the Allied Powers responsible for trying \nGerman war criminals after World War II: ``That four great nations, \nflushed with victory and stung with injury stay the hand of vengeance \nand voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law \nis one of the most significant tributes that Power ever has paid to \nReason.'' He closed the Nuremberg trials about which Senator Dodd spoke \nearlier by saying: ``Of one thing we may be sure. The future will never \nhave to ask, with misgiving, `What could the Nazis have said in their \nfavor?' History will know that whatever could be said, they were \nallowed to say. They have been given the kind of a trial which they, in \nthe days of their pomp and power, never gave to any man. But fairness \nis not weakness. The extraordinary fairness of these hearings is an \nattribute of our strength.''\n  He was right and his wisdom was echoed this week at our Judiciary \nCommittee hearing when Admiral Hutson and Lieutenant Commander Swift \ntestified that fairness and lawfulness are our greatest strengths. This \nlegislation doesn't live up to that ideal. It strips away fairness.\n  The actions by the U.S. Government, this administration, for all its \ntalk of strength, have made us less safe, and its current proposal is \none that smacks of weakness and shivering fear. Its legislative demands \nreflect a cowering country that is succumbing to the threat of \nterrorism. I believe we Americans are better than that. I believe we \nare stronger than that. I believe we are fairer than that. And I \nbelieve America should be a leader in the fight for human rights and \nthe rule of law, and that will strengthen us in our fight against \nterrorists.\n  We have taken our eye off the ball in this fight against terrorists. \nThat is essentially what all of our intelligence agencies concluded in \nthe National Intelligence Estimate that the administration had for six \nmonths while this was rolling along, but that they only shared a part \nof this past weekend. Our retooled and reorganized intelligence \nagencies, with leadership handpicked by the administration, have \nconcluded, contrary to the campaign rhetoric of the President and Vice \nPresident, that the Iraq war has become a ``cause celebre'' that has \ninspired a new generation of terrorists. It hasn't stopped terrorists, \nit has inspired new terrorists. Surely, the shameful mistreatment of \ndetainees at Guantanamo, at Abu Ghraib, at secret CIA prisons, and that \nby torturers in other countries to whom we have turned over people, \nhave become other ``causes celebre'' and recruiting tools for our \nenemies.\n  Surely, the continued occupation of Iraq, when close to three-\nquarters of Iraqis want U.S. forces to depart their country, is another \ncircumstance being exploited by enemies to demonize our great country.\n  Passing laws that remove the remaining checks against mistreatment of \nprisoners will not help us win the battle for the hearts and minds of \nthe generation of young people around the world being recruited by \nOsama bin Laden and al-Qaida. Authorizing indefinite detention of \nanybody the Government designates, without any proceeding or without \nany recourse, putting them into the secret prisons we condemned during \nthe Cold War, is what our worse critics claim the United States would \ndo. That is not what American values, our traditions, and our rule of \nlaw would have us do.\n\n[[Page S10415]]\n\nThis is not just a bad bill, this is truly a dangerous bill.\n  I have been asking Secretary Rumsfeld's question for the last several \nweeks: whether our actions are eliminating more of our enemies than are \nbeing created. But now we understand that we are creating more enemies \nthan we are eliminating. Our intelligence agencies agree that the \nglobal jihadist movement is spreading and adapting; it is ``increasing \nin both number and geographic dispersion.'' We are putting ourselves \nmore at risk.\n  ``If this trend continues,'' our intelligence agencies say, that is, \nif we do not wise up and change course and adopt a winning new \nstrategy, ``threats to U.S. interests at home and abroad will become \nmore diverse, leading to increasing attacks worldwide.'' Attacks have \nbeen increasing worldwide over the last 5 years of these failing \npolicies and are, according to the judgment of our own, newly \nreconstituted intelligence agencies, likely to increase further in the \ndays and months and years ahead. The intelligence agencies go on to \nnote ominously that ``new jihadist networks and cells, with anti-\nAmerican agendas, are increasingly likely to emerge'' and further that \nthe ``operational threat will grow,'' particularly abroad ``but also in \nthe homeland.''\n  This is truly chilling. The Bush-Cheney administration not only \nfailed to stop 9/11 from happening, but for 5 years they have failed to \nbring Osama bin Laden to justice, even though they had him cornered at \nTora Bora. They yanked the special forces out of there to send them \ninto Iraq. We have witnessed the growth of additional enemies.\n  And what do our intelligence agencies suggest is the way out of this \ndangerous quagmire? The National Intelligence Estimate suggests we have \nto ``go well beyond operations to capture or kill terrorist leaders,'' \nand we must foster democratic reforms. When America can be seen \nabandoning its basic American democratic values, its checks and \nbalances, its great and wonderful legal traditions, and can be seen as \nbecoming more autocratic and less accountable, how will that foster \ndemocratic reforms elsewhere? ``Do as I say and not as I do'' is a \nmodel that has never successfully inspired peoples around the world, \nand it doesn't inspire me.\n  The administration has yet to come clean to the Congress or the \nAmerican people in connection with the secret legal justifications it \nhas generated and secret practices it has employed in detaining and \ninterrogating hundreds, if not thousands, of people. Even they cannot \ndismiss the practices at Guantanamo as the actions of a few ``bad \napples.''\n  With Senate adoption of the antitorture amendment last year and the \nrecent adoption of the Army Field Manual, I had hoped that 5 years of \nadministration resistance to the rule of law and to the U.S. military \nabiding by its Geneva obligations might be drawing to a close. Despite \nthe resistance of the Vice President and the administration, the new \nArmy Field Manual appears to outlaw several of what the Administration \neuphemistically calls ``aggressive'' tactics and that much of the world \nregards as torture and cruel and degrading treatment. In rejecting the \nKennedy amendment today, the Senate has turned away from the wise \ncounsel and judgment of military professionals. Of course, the \nPresident in his signing statement already undermined enactment of the \nantitorture law.\n  The administration is now obtaining license--before, they just did it \nquietly and against the law and on their own say-so, but now they are \nobtaining license--to engage in additional harsh techniques that the \nrest of the world will see as abusive, as cruel, as degrading, and even \nas torture. Fortunately, a growing number of our own people see it that \nway, too.\n  What is being lost in this debate is any notion of accountability and \nthe guiding principles of American values and law. Where are the facts \nof what has been done in the name of the United States? Where are the \nlegal justifications and technicalities the administration's lawyers \nhave been seeking to exploit for 5 years? The Republican leadership's \nlegislation strips away all accountability and erodes our most basic \nnational values without so much as an accounting of these facts and \nlegal arguments. Senator Rockefeller's amendment to incorporate some \naccountability in the process through oversight of the CIA \ninterrogation program was unfortunately rejected by the Republican \nleadership in the Senate.\n  Secrecy for all time is to be the Republican rule of the day. \nCongressional oversight is no more. Checks and balances are no more. \nThe fundamental check that was last provided by the Supreme Court is \nnow to be taken away. This is wrong. This should be unconstitutional. \nIt is certainly unconscionable. This is certainly not the action of any \nSenate in which I have served. It is not worthy of the United States of \nAmerica. What we are saying is one person will make all of the rules; \nthere will be no checks and balances. There will be no dissent, and \nthere will be nobody else's view, and we will remove, piece by piece, \nevery single law that might have allowed checks and balances.\n  We are rushing through legislation that would have a devastating \neffect on our security and our values. I implore Senators to step back \nfrom the brink and think about what we are doing.\n  The President recently said that ``time is of the essence'' to pass \nlegislation authorizing military commissions. Time was of the essence \nwhen this administration took control in January 2001 and did not act \non the dire warnings of terrorist action. Time was of the essence in \nAugust and early September 2001 when the 9/11 attacks could still have \nbeen prevented. This administration ignored warnings of a coming attack \nand even proposed cutting the antiterror budget on September 10, the \nday before the worst foreign terrorist attack on U.S. soil in our \nhistory. This administration was focused on Star Wars, not terrorism. \nTime was of the essence when Osama bin Laden was trapped in Tora Bora. \nBut this administration was more interested in going after Sadaam \nHussein, who the President recently admitted had ``nothing'' to do with \n9/11.\n  After 5 years of this administration's unilateral actions that have \nleft us less safe, time is now of the essence to take real steps to \nkeep us safe from terrorism. Real steps like those included in the Real \nSecurity Act, S. 3875. We should be focusing on getting the terrorists \nand securing the nuclear material that this administration has allowed \nfor the last 5 years to be unaccounted for around the world. We should \nbe doing the things Senator Kerry and others are talking about, such as \nstrengthening our special forces and winning the peace in Afghanistan, \nwhere the Taliban has regrouped and is growing in strength.\n  Instead, the President and the Republican Senate leadership call for \nrubberstamping more flawed White House proposals just in time for the \nrunup to another election and for the fundraising appeals to go out.\n  I had hoped that this time, for the first time, even though the \nSenate is controlled by the President's party, we could act as an \nindependent branch of the Government and serve as a check on this \nadministration. After this debate and the rejection of all amendments \nintended to improve this measure, I see that day has long passed. I \nwill continue to speak out. That is my privilege as a Senator. But I \nweep for our country and for the American values, the principles on \nwhich I was raised and which I took a solemn oath to uphold. I applaud \nthose Senators who stood up several times on the floor today and voted \nto uphold the best of American values.\n\n  Going forward, the bill departs even more radically from our most \nfundamental values. And provisions that were profoundly troubling a \nweek ago when the Armed Services Committee marked up the bill have \ngotten much worse in the course of closed-door revisions over the past \nweek. For example, the bill has been amended to eliminate habeas corpus \nreview even for persons inside the United States, and even for persons \nwho have not been determined to be enemy combatants. It has moved from \ndetention of those who are captured having taken up arms against the \nUnited States on a battlefield to millions of law-abiding Americans \nthat the Government might suspect of sympathies for Muslim causes and \nwho knows what else--without any avenue for effective review.\n\n[[Page S10416]]\n\n  Remember, we are giving a blank check to a Government whose \nincompetence was demonstrated in historic dimensions by the lack of \npreparation in response to Hurricane Katrina. This is the same \nGovernment which, in its fight against terrorism, has had Senator \nKennedy and Congressman Lewis on terrorist watch lists, and could not \nget them off. This is a Government which repeatedly releases \nconfidential family information about our Armed Forces and veterans. It \nis a Government which just refuses to admit any mistakes or to make any \ncorrections but regards all of its representatives, from Donald \nRumsfeld to Michael Brown, as doing a ``heckuva job.''\n  The proponents of this bill talk about sending messages. What message \ndoes it send to the millions of legal immigrants living in America, \nparticipating in American families, working for American businesses, \nand paying American taxes? Its message is that our Government may at \nany minute pick them up and detain them indefinitely without charge, \nand without any access to the courts or even to military tribunals, \nunless and until the Government determines that they are not enemy \ncombatants--a term that the bill now defines in a tortured and \nunprecedentedly broad manner. And that power and any errors cannot be \nreviewed or corrected by a court. What message does that send about \nabuse of power? What message does that send to the world about \nAmerica's freedoms?\n  Numerous press accounts have quoted administration officials who \nbelieve that a significant percentage of those detained at Guantanamo \nhave no connection to terrorism. In other words, the Bush-Cheney \nadministration has been holding for several years, and intends to hold \nindefinitely without trial or any recourse to justice, a substantial \nnumber of innocent people who were turned in by anonymous bounty \nhunters or picked up by mistake in the fog of war or as a result of a \ntribal or personal vendetta. The most important purpose of habeas \ncorpus is to correct errors like that--to protect the innocent. It is \nprecisely to prevent such abuses that the Constitution prohibits the \nsuspension of the writ of habeas corpus ``unless when in Cases of \nRebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.'' But court \nreview has now embarrassed the Bush administration, as the U.S. Supreme \nCourt has three times rejected its lawyers' schemes. And, so how does \nthe administration respond? It insists that there be no more judicial \ncheck on its actions and errors.\n  When the Senate accedes to that demand, it abandons American \nprinciples and all checks on an imperial Presidency. The Senator from \nVermont will not be a party to retreat from America's constitutional \nvalues. Vermonters don't retreat.\n  Senator Smith, speaking this morning about the habeas provisions of \nthis bill, quoted Thomas Jefferson, who said:\n\n       The habeas corpus secures every man here, alien or citizen, \n     against everything which is not law, whatever shape it may \n     assume.\n\n  Jefferson said on another occasion:\n\n       I would rather be exposed to the inconveniences attending \n     too much liberty than to those attending too small a degree \n     of it.\n\n  With this bill, the Senate reverses that profound judgment of \nhistory, chooses against liberty, and succumbs to fear.\n  When former Secretary of State Colin Powell wrote last week of his \nconcerns with the administration's bill, he wrote about doubts \nconcerning our ``moral authority in the war against terrorism.'' This \nGeneral, former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former Secretary \nof State, was right. Now we have heard from a number of current and \nformer diplomats, military lawyers, Federal judges, law professors and \nlaw school deans, the American Bar Association, and even the first \nPresident Bush's Solicitor General, Kenneth Starr, that they have grave \nconcerns with the habeas corpus stripping provisions of this bill.\n  I agree with Mr. Starr that we should not suspend--and we should \ncertainly not eliminate--the Great Writ. I also agree with more than \n300 law professors, who described an earlier, less extreme version of \nthe habeas provisions of this bill as ``unwise and contrary to the most \nfundamental precepts of American constitutional traditions.'' And I \nagree with more than 30 former U.S. Ambassadors and other senior \ndiplomats, who say that eliminating habeas corpus for aliens detained \nby the United States will harm our interests abroad, and put our own \nmilitary, diplomatic, and other personnel stationed abroad at risk. We \ncannot spread a message of freedom abroad if our message to those who \ncome to America is that they may be detained indefinitely without any \nrecourse to justice.\n  In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, and in the face of the continuing \nterrorist threat, now is not the time for the United States to abandon \nits principles. Admiral Hutson was right to point out that when we do, \nthere would be little to distinguish America from a ``banana republic'' \nor the repressive regimes against which we are trying to rally the \nworld and the human spirit. Now is not the time to abandon American \nvalues, to shiver and quake, to rely on secrecy and torture. Those are \nways of repression and oppression, not the American way.\n  We need to pursue the war on terror with strength and intelligence, \nbut we need to uphold American ideals. The President says he wants \nclarity as to the meaning of the Geneva Conventions and the War Crimes \nAct. Of course, he did not want clarity when his administration was \nusing its twisted interpretation of the law to authorize torture and \ncruel and inhumane treatment of detainees. He did not want clarity when \nspying on Americans without warrants. And he certainly did not want \nclarity while keeping those rationales and programs secret from \nCongress. The administration does not seem to want clarity when it \nrefuses even to tell Congress what its understanding of the law is \nfollowing the withdrawal of a memo that said the President could \nauthorize and immunize torture. That memo was withdrawn because it \ncould not withstand the light of day.\n  It seems the only clarity this administration wants is a clear green \nlight from Congress to do whatever it wants. That is not clarity. That \nis immunity from crime. I cannot vote for that. That is what the \ncurrent legislation would give to the President on interrogation \ntechniques and on military commissions. Justice O'Connor reminded the \nnation before her retirement that even war is not a ``blank check'' \nwhen it comes to the rights of Americans. The Senate should not be a \nrubberstamp for policies that undercut America's values.\n  In reality, we already have clarity. Senior military officers tell us \nthey know what the Geneva Conventions require, and the military trains \nits personnel according to these standards. We have never had trouble \nurging other countries around the world to accept and enforce the \nprovisions of the Geneva Conventions. There was enough clarity for \nthat. What the administration appears to want, instead, is to use new \nlegislative language to create loopholes and to narrow our obligations \nnot to engage in cruel, degrading, and inhuman treatment.\n  In fact, the new legislation muddies the waters. It saddles the War \nCrimes Act with a definition of cruel or inhuman treatment so oblique \nthat it appears to permit all manner of cruel and extreme interrogation \ntechniques. Senator McCain said this weekend that some techniques like \nwaterboarding and induced hypothermia would be banned by the proposed \nlaw. But Senator Frist and the White House disavowed his statements, \nsaying that they preferred not to say what techniques would or would \nnot be allowed. That is hardly clarity; it is deliberate confusion.\n  Into that breach, this legislation throws the administration's \nsolution to all problems: more Presidential power. It allows the \nadministration to promulgate regulations about what conduct would and \nwould not comport with the Geneva Conventions, though it does not \nrequire the President to specify which particular techniques can and \ncannot be used. This is a formula for still fewer checks and balances \nand for more abuse, secrecy, and power-grabbing. It is a formula for \nimmunity for past and future abuses by the Executive.\n  I worked hard, along with many others of both parties, to pass the \ncurrent version of the War Crimes Act. I think the current law is a \ngood law, and the concerns that have been raised about it could best be \naddressed with minor adjustments, rather than with sweeping changes.\n\n[[Page S10417]]\n\n  In 1996, working with the Department of Defense, Congress passed the \nWar Crimes Act to provide criminal penalties for certain war crimes \ncommitted by and against Americans. The next year, again with the \nPentagon's support, Congress extended the War Crimes Act to violations \nof the baseline humanitarian protections afforded by Common Article 3 \nof the Geneva Conventions. Both measures were supported by a broad \nbipartisan consensus, and I was proud to sponsor the 1997 amendments.\n  The legislation was uncontroversial for a good reason. As I explained \nat the time, the purpose and effect of the War Crimes Act as amended \nwas to provide for the implementation of America's commitment to the \nbasic international standards we subscribed to when we ratified the \nGeneva Conventions in 1955. Those standards are truly universal: They \ncondemn war criminals whoever and wherever they are.\n  That is a critically important aspect of the Geneva Conventions and \nour own War Crimes Act. When we are dealing with fundamental norms that \ndefine the commitments of the civilized world, we cannot have one rule \nfor us and one for them, however we define ``us'' and ``them.'' As \nJustice Jackson said at the Nuremberg tribunals, ``We are not prepared \nto lay down a rule of criminal conduct against others which we would \nnot be willing to have invoked against us.''\n  In that regard, I am disturbed that the legislation before us narrows \nthe scope of the War Crimes Act to exclude certain violations of the \nGeneva Conventions and, perhaps more disturbingly, to retroactively \nimmunize past violations. Neither the Congress nor the Department of \nDefense had any problem with the War Crimes Act when we were focused on \nusing it to prosecute foreign perpetrators of war crimes. I am \nconcerned that this is yet another example of this administration \noverreaching, disregarding the law and our international obligations, \nand seeking to immunize others to break the law. It also could well \nprevent us from prosecuting rogues who we all agree were out of line, \nlike the soldiers who mistreated prisoners at Abu Ghraib.\n  The President said on May 5, 2004 about prisoner mistreatment at Abu \nGhraib:\n\n       I view those practices as abhorrent.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       But in a democracy, as well, those mistakes will be \n     investigated, and people will be brought to justice.\n\n  The Republican leader of the Senate said on the same day:\n\n       I rise to express my shock and condemnation of these \n     despicable acts. The persons who carried them must face \n     justice.\n\n  Many of the despicable tactics used in Abu Ghraib--the use of dogs, \nforced nudity, humiliation of various kinds--do not appear to be \ncovered by the narrow definitions this legislation would graft into the \nWar Crimes Act. Despite the President's calls for clarity, the new \nprovisions are so purposefully ambiguous that we cannot know for sure \nwhether they are covered. If the Abu Ghraib abuses had come to light \nafter the perpetrators left the military, they might not have been able \nto be brought to justice under the administration's formulation.\n  The President and the Congress should not be in the business of \nimmunizing people who have broken the law and made us less safe. If we \nlower our standards of domestic law to allow outrageous conduct, we can \ndo nothing to stop other countries from doing the same. This change in \nour law does not prevent other countries from prosecuting our troops \nand personnel for violations of the Geneva Convention if they choose; \nit only changes our domestic law. But it could give other countries the \ngreen light to change their laws to allow them to treat our personnel \nin cruel and inhuman ways.\n  Let me be clear. There is no problem facing us about overzealous use \nof the War Crimes Act by prosecutors. In fact, as far as I can tell, \nthe Ashcroft Justice Department and the Gonzales Justice Department \nhave yet to file a single charge against anyone for a violation of the \nWar Crimes Act. Not only have they never charged American personnel \nunder the act, they have never used it to charge terrorists either.\n  This bill does not clarify the War Crimes Act. It authorizes and \nimmunizes abhorrent conduct that violates our basic ideals. Perhaps \nthat is why more than 40 religious organizations and human rights \ngroups wrote to urge the Senate to take more time to consider the \neffects of this legislation on our safety, security, and commitment to \nthe rule of law, and to vote against it if the serious problems in the \nbill are not corrected.\n  The proposed legislation would also allow the admission of evidence \nobtained through cruel and inhuman treatment into military commission \nproceedings. This provision would once again allow this administration \nto avoid all accountability for its misguided policies which have \ncontributed to the rise of a new generation of terrorists who threaten \nus. Not only would the military commissions legislation before us \nimmunize those who violated international law and stomped on basic \nAmerican values, but it would allow them then to use the evidence \nobtained in violation of basic principles of fairness and justice.\n  Allowing in this evidence would violate our basic standards of \nfairness without increasing our security. Maher Arar, the Canadian \ncitizen arrested by our government on bad intelligence and sent to \nSyria to be tortured, confessed to attending terrorist training camps. \nA Canadian commission investigating the case found that his confessions \nhad no basis in fact. They merely reflected that he was being tortured, \nand he told his torturers what they wanted to hear. It is only one of \nmany such documented cases of bad information resulting from torture. \nWe gain nothing from allowing such information.\n  The military commissions legislation departs in other unfortunate \nways from the Warner-Levin bill. Early this week, apparently at the \nWhite House's request, Republican drafters added a breathtakingly broad \ndefinition of ``unlawful enemy combatant'' which includes people--\ncitizens and noncitizens alike--who have ``purposefully and materially \nsupported hostilities'' against the United States or its allies. It \nalso includes people determined to be unlawful enemy combatants by any \n``competent tribunal'' established by the President or the Secretary of \nDefense. So the Government can select any person, including a United \nStates citizen, whom it suspects of supporting hostilities--whatever \nthat means--and begin denying that person the rights and processes \nguaranteed in our country. The implications are chilling.\n  I am sorry the Republican leadership passed up the chance to consider \nand pass bipartisan legislation that would have made us safer and help \nour fight on terrorism both by giving us the tools we need and by \nshowing the world the values we cherish and defend. I will not \nparticipate in a legislative retreat out of weakness that undercuts \neverything this Nation stands for and that makes us more vulnerable and \nless secure.\n  The Senator from Vermont, consistent with my oath of office and my \nconscience and my commitment to the people of Vermont and the Nation, \ncannot--I will not--support this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CHAFEE). Who yields time? The Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I believe I have 4 minutes allocated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, less than 2 weeks ago, the Armed Services \nCommittee voted on a military commissions bill. The committee endorsed \nthat bill on a bipartisan basis with a 15-to-9 vote. Yesterday, 43 of \nus voted for the same bill on the Senate floor.\n  The bill would have provided the administration with the tools that \nit needed to detain enemy combatants, conduct interrogations, and \nprosecute detainees for any war crimes they may have committed.\n  Unfortunately, that bill went off the tracks after it was approved by \nthe Armed Services Committee. Instead of bringing to the Senate floor \nthe bill that had been adopted by the Armed Services Committee on a \nbipartisan basis, we are voting now on a dramatically different bill \nbased on changes made at the insistence of an administration that has \nbeen relentless in its determination to legitimize the abuse of \ndetainees, to protect those who authorize the abuses, and to distort \nmilitary commission procedures in order to ensure criminal convictions.\n\n[[Page S10418]]\n\n  For example, the bill before us inexplicably fails to prohibit the \nuse of statements or testimony obtained through cruel and inhuman \ntreatment as long as those statements or testimony was obtained before \nDecember 30, 2005.\n  The argument has been made that the bill before us prohibits the use \nof statements that are obtained through torture. That was never in \ncontention. The problem is that it permits the use of statements \nobtained through cruel and inhuman treatment that doesn't meet the \nstrict definition of torture as long as those statements were obtained \nbefore December 30, 2005.\n  This is a compromise on the issue of cruelty--an issue on which there \nshould be no compromise by our Nation or by the Senate. If we \ncompromise on that, we compromise at our peril. The men and women who \nrepresent us in uniform will be in much greater danger if we compromise \non the issue of statements obtained through cruelty and inhuman \ntreatment.\n  A compromise on this issue endangers our troops because if other \nnations apply the same standard and allow statements or confessions \nobtained through cruelty to be used at so-called trials of our \ncitizens, we will have little ground to stand on in our objecting to \nthem.\n  This bill also does many other things which are dramatic changes from \nthe bill that came out of the Armed Services Committee. For instance, \nthe bill would authorize the use of evidence seized without a search \nwarrant or other authorization, even if that evidence was seized from \nU.S. citizens inside the United States in clear violation of the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  Both the committee bill and the bill before us provide the executive \nbranch with the tools it needs to hold enemy combatants accountable for \nany war crimes they may have committed. On this issue we are in \nagreement. We all agree that people who are responsible for the \nterrible events of September 11 and other terrorist attacks around the \nworld should be brought to justice.\n  However, the bill before us differs dramatically from the Senate \nArmed Services Committee bipartisan-approved bill, particularly when it \ncomes to the accountability of the administration for policies and \nactions leading to the abuses of detainees.\n  The bill before us contains provision after provision designed to \nensure that the administration will not be held accountable for the \nabuse of prisoners in U.S. custody, for violations of U.S. law, or for \nthe use of such tactics that have turned much of the world against us.\n  Over the last 2 days, we have debated the habeas corpus provision in \nthe bill. Most of that debate has focused on the writ of habeas corpus \nas an individual right to challenge the lawfulness of detention. The \nwrit of habeas corpus does serve that purpose.\n  But the writ of habeas corpus has always served a second purpose as \nwell: for its 900-year history, the writ of habeas corpus has always \nserved as a means of making the sovereign account for its actions. By \ndepriving detainees of the opportunity to demonstrate that they were \ndetained in error, this bill not only deprives individuals of a \ncritical right deeply embedded in American law, it also helps ensure \nthat the administration will not be held to account for the illegal or \nabusive treatment of detainees.\n  Indeed, the court-stripping provision in the bill does far more than \njust eliminate habeas corpus rights for detainees. It also prohibits \nthe U.S. courts from hearing or considering ``any other action against \nthe United States or its agents relating to any aspect of the \ndetention, treatment, or trial'' of an alien detainee. By depriving \ndetainees of access to our courts, even if they have been subject to \ntorture or to cruel and inhuman treatment, this provision seeks to \nensure that the details of administration policies that appear to have \nviolated our obligations under U.S. and international law will never be \naired in court.\n  A number of other provisions in the bill before us appear to be \ndirected at the same objective. For example, section 5 of the bill \nprovides that no person--whether that person is an enemy combatant or \nanybody else--may invoke the Geneva Conventions as a source of rights \nin a habeas corpus or other proceeding in any court of the United \nStates. Section 948b(g) of the military commissions part of the bill \nwould similarly provide that no person subject to trial by military \ncommission may invoke the Geneva Conventions as a source of rights. \nThese provisions, like the habeas corpus provision, appear to be \ndesigned to ensure that administration policies that may have violated \nour obligations under U.S. and international law will never be aired in \ncourt.\n  Other provisions in the bill narrow the range of abuses that are \ncovered by the War Crimes Act. As a result of these amendments, some \nactions that were war crimes at the time they took place will not be \nprosecutable. Indeed, because of a complex definition in the bill, some \nactions that violated the War Crimes Act at the time they took place \nand will violate that act if they take place in the future will not be \nprosecutable. In other words, this bill carves out a window to immunize \nactions of this administration from prosecution under the War Crimes \nAct.\n  The administration and its allies have argued that these provisions \nare necessary to protect CIA interrogators from prosecution for actions \nthat they believed to be lawful and authorized at the time they were \nundertaken. However, we addressed that problem with the enactment of \nthe Detainee Treatment Act last year. That law provides a defense to \nany U.S. agent who engaged in specific operational practices that were \nofficially authorized or reasonably believed to be lawful at the time \nthey were undertaken.\n  This bill, however, goes far beyond protecting the front line \ninterrogators and agents who believed that their actions were lawful: \nit changes the law to ensure that the administration officials who \nprovided the authorization and knew or should have known that there was \nno legal basis for that authorization, will not be held accountable for \ntheir actions.\n  Last year, this Congress took an important stand for the rule of law \nby enacting the McCain amendment, which prohibits the cruel, inhuman, \nor degrading treatment of detainees in the custody of any U.S. agency \nanywhere in the world. That landmark provision is at risk of being \nrendered meaningless, if we establish rules ensuring that it can never \nbe enforced.\n  We need to provide the administration with the tools that are needed \nto prosecute unlawful enemy combatants for any war crimes that they may \nhave committed. However, we should not do so in a way that is \ninconsistent with our own values as a Nation. We need to practice what \nwe preach to the rest of the world.\n  The bill before us will put our own troops who might be captured in \nfuture conflicts at risk if other countries decide to apply similar \nstandards to us, is likely to result in the reversal of convictions on \nappeal, and is inconsistent with American values. For these reasons, I \nwill vote no on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding I am to speak and the \nmajority leader will speak and then we will vote; is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on a bright and sunny September morning 5 \nyears ago, history changed in an instant. Our Nation was attacked. \nNearly 3,000 of our citizens were murdered, and our lives as we knew \nthem were forever changed.\n  The family members of those who died that day and we, their fellow \nAmericans, have been waiting 5 years for those who masterminded that \noutrageous terrorist attack to be brought to justice. Osama bin Laden, \na man whom we have seen on videotape bragging and laughing about his \nrole in conceiving this deed, remains at large 5 years later. The \nAmerican people are justifiably frustrated that he has not been caught. \nThey have a right to ask whether our military and intelligence \nresources were unwisely diverted from that solemn task.\n  But some of Osama bin Laden's lieutenants were captured overseas \nyears ago. There is no disagreement whatsoever between Republicans and \nDemocrats on the need to bring these people to justice. We all want to \nmake sure the President has the tools he needs to make this happen.\n  For 5 years, Democrats stood ready to work with the President and the \nRepublican Congress to establish sound\n\n[[Page S10419]]\n\nprocedures for military tribunals. Mr. President, why do you think the \nDemocratic ranking member of the Judiciary Committee has been so \noutraged at what has been going on? He is outraged because as the top \nDemocrat on the Judiciary Committee, he introduced a bill in 2002 to \nsolve the problems that are now before the Senate--4 years ago. No \nwonder he is incensed.\n  Unfortunately, President Bush chose to ignore Senator Leahy and the \nCongress and ignore the advice of uniformed military professionals. He \nset up a flawed and imbalanced military tribunal system that failed to \nprosecute a single terrorist. Not surprisingly, it was ruled \nunconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Forced by the Court decision to ask Congress for help, the Bush \nadministration initially asked us, the Congress, to rubberstamp \nbasically the same system that the Supreme Court struck down. Their \nproposal for one-sided trials and murky interrogation rules was opposed \nby such well-respected leaders as GEN Colin Powell and former Secretary \nof State George Shultz, both Republicans, and many others, Democrats \nand Republicans.\n  I must say, a handful of principled Republican Senators, led by the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner, Senator \nGraham from South Carolina, and Senator McCain from Arizona stepped \nforward and forced the White House to back down from the worst elements \nof its extreme proposal. I appreciate the position of those Republican \nSenators, the names I have given you.\n  I repeat, Mr. President, I admire their courage. I appreciate the \nimprovements they managed to make in this bill. But for them what is \nbefore us would be a lot worse.\n  However, since those Senators announced their agreement with the \nadministration last Friday, the compromise has become much worse. The \nbill before us now looks more and more like the administration bill \nthese Senators fought so hard against.\n  I believe the bill approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee \nwould have given the President all necessary authority. It was \nsupported by the chairman and a bipartisan majority of that committee, \nas well as our Nation's uniformed military lawyers.\n  The bill before us diverges from the committee bill in many ways, but \nlet me talk about two.\n  First, it makes less clear that the United States will abide by our \nobligations under the Geneva Conventions. The President says the United \nStates does not engage in torture and there should be no ambiguity on \nthat point, but this bill gives the President authority to reinterpret \nour obligations and limits judicial oversight of that process, putting \nour own troops at risk on the battlefield.\n  A four-star general, former Secretary of State, former Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, GEN Colin Powell, wrote:\n  The world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against \nterrorism. To redefine Common Article 3 would add to those doubts. \nFurthermore, it would put our own troops at risk.\n  Second, this bill authorizes a vast expansion of the President's \npower to detain people, even U.S. citizens, indefinitely and without \ncharge. There are no procedures for doing so. There is no due process \nprovided, and no time limit on the detention is set.\n  At the same time, the bill would deprive Federal judges of the power \nto review the legality of many such detentions. Judges--all judges--\nwould have no power to review the legality of many such detentions. \nThis is true even in the case of a lawful permanent resident arrested \nand held in the United States, and even if that person happens to be \ncompletely innocent.\n  The Framers of our Constitution understood the need for checks and \nbalances. This bill has thrown that principle right out the window.\n  Many of the worst provisions were not in the committee-reported bill \nand were not in the compromise announced last Friday. They were added \nover the weekend. Remember, there was a bill that was put before the \nSenate last Thursday, and from Thursday to Monday, it changed after, I \nsay, back-room meetings with White House lawyers.\n  We have tried to improve this legislation. My friend, the ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Carl Levin, proposed to \nsubstitute the bipartisan bill reported by the Armed Services \nCommittee. That amendment was rejected basically on a party-line vote.\n  Senators Specter and Leahy, the two Members who are responsible for \nthe Judiciary Committee, the chairman and ranking member, offered an \namendment to restore the right of judicial review. This amendment was \nrejected on a party-line vote.\n  And Senator Rockefeller, the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence \nCommittee, offered an amendment to improve congressional oversight of \nthe CIA programs. This amendment was rejected on a party-line vote.\n  Senator Kennedy offered an amendment to clarify that inhumane \ninterrogation tactics prohibited by the Army Field Manual could not be \nused on Americans or on others. That amendment was rejected on a party-\nline vote. Senator Byrd, who has seen things come and go in this body \nand who has been a Member of Congress for more than 50 years, offered \nan amendment to sunset military commissions so Congress would be \nrequired to reconsider this far-reaching authority after 5 years of \nhaving it in effect. That commonsense, realistic amendment was rejected \non a party-line vote.\n\n  I personally believe, having been in a few courtrooms, that this \nlegislation is unconstitutional. It will certainly be struck down by \nthe Supreme Court in the years ahead, and when that happens, we will be \nback here debating how to bring terrorists to justice.\n  The families of the 9/11 victims and the Nation have been waiting 5 \nyears for the perpetrators of these attacks to be brought to justice. \nThey should not have to wait longer. We should get this right now; we \nshould do it right. We are not doing so by passing this bill.\n  The national security policies of this administration and this \nRepublican Congress may have been tough, but they certainly haven't \nbeen smart. The American people are paying a tremendous price for their \nmistakes. History will judge our actions here today. I am convinced \nthat future generations will view passage of this bill as a grave \nerror. I will be recorded as voting against this piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I dislike, I find repulsive, and I do not condone \nthese evil and horrible people, these terrorists. They should be \nbrought before the bar of justice and given what they deserve. For 5 \nyears, that has not been the case. We Democrats want terrorists brought \nto justice quickly and in a way in keeping with our Constitution and, \nin this manner, give honor to the sacrifices made by American patriots \nin days past.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for the past month we have debated how best \nto keep America safe. On one point I know all of our colleagues agree \nis that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed should be brought to justice. He should \nbe prosecuted for masterminding the mass murders of almost 3,000 \nAmericans on September 11. I know the American people and the families \nof those victims share that goal.\n  Every terrorist should be held accountable for their crimes against \nthe innocent, against our enduring freedoms, against the values that we \nall share. Unfortunately, due to the Supreme Court's decision in Hamdan \nv. Rumsfeld, prosecutions of suspected terrorists like Khalid Sheikh \nMohammed are at a stand-still, and these prosecutions will remain at a \nstand-still until we act to authorize military commissions to try these \nsuspected terrorists.\n  In addition to halting prosecutions of suspected terrorists, the \nHamdan decision has undermined effective interrogation methods employed \nby our intelligence community. These methods yield critical information \nthat allows us to prevent terrorist attacks and to save innocent lives. \nThe information provided by these enemy combatants is our primary \nsource--our best source--of reliable intelligence.\n  Past interrogations have guided us to the precise location of \nterrorists in hiding, explained how al-Qaida leaders communicate with \noperatives in Iraq, and identified voices in intercepted calls. Without \nthis information, we fight a blind war.\n  The bill we will vote on in a few minutes addresses the concerns \nraised by\n\n[[Page S10420]]\n\nthe Hamdan decision. It provides the legislative framework authorizing \nmilitary tribunals to prosecute suspected terrorists. It ensures \ncertain protections and rights for the accused such as the right to \ncounsel and the right to exclude evidence obtained through torture.\n  At the same time, the bill recognizes that because we are at war with \na different type of enemy, we should not try terrorist detainees in the \nsame way as our uniformed military or civilian criminals.\n  The bill also protects classified information from terrorists who \ncould exploit it to plan another terrorist attack.\n  Finally, the bill allows key intelligence programs to continue while \nensuring that our detention and interrogation methods comply with both \ndomestic and international laws, including Geneva Conventions Common \nArticle 3.\n  The bottom line is the bill before us allows us to bring terrorists \nto justice through full and fair military trials while preserving \nintelligence programs--intelligence programs that have disrupted \nterrorist plots and saved countless American lives.\n  Our national security demands that we pass this bill tonight. We need \nthis tool in the war on terror. In the 5 years since 9/11 we have not \nsuffered another terrorist attack on U.S. soil. One reason we have \nremained safe is by staying on the offense against emerging threats. \nThis bill is another offensive strike against terrorism.\n  For the safety and security of the American people, Mr. President, I \nurge my colleagues to join us in supporting the Military Commission Act \nof 2006.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Shall the bill, as amended, \npass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Maine (Ms. Snowe).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Maine (Ms. Snowe) \nwould have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen).

Under the previous order, pursuant \nto rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture \nmotion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Calendar No. \n     615, H.R. 6061, a bill to establish operational control over \n     the international land and maritime borders of the United \n     States.\n         Bill Frist, Lamar Alexander, Richard Burr, Gordon Smith, \n           John Thune, Johnny Isakson, John Cornyn, Judd Gregg, \n           Jim Inhofe, Saxby Chambliss, Sam Brownback, Tom Coburn, \n           Jeff Sessions, Richard Shelby, Craig Thomas, Michael B. \n           Enzi, Lisa Murkowski.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I support cloture on H.R. 6061, the Secure \nFence Act. The sooner the Congress passes this bill, the sooner the \nCongress can put aside the misguided amnesty legislation passed by the \nSenate earlier this year. The American people have listened and \nrejected the call to offer U.S. citizenship to illegal aliens. They \nhave said NO to amnesty! Hallelujah!\n  Comprehensive immigration reform is a euphemism for amnesty, and I \noppose it absolutely and unequivocally. I voted against the amnesty \nbill passed by the Senate, and I will continue to vote against amnesty \nas long as I am in the Senate.\n  I have seen how amnesties encourage illegal immigration, with the \namnesties of the 1980s and 1990s corresponding with an unprecedented \nrise in the population of unlawful aliens.\n  I have seen how amnesties open the border to terrorists, with the \nperpetrators of terrorist plots against our country taking advantage of \namnesties to circumvent the regular border and immigration checks.\n  I have seen how amnesties afford special rules to some immigrants. \nAmnesty undermines that great and egalitarian American promise that the \nrules will be applied equally and fairly to everyone.\n  We are a nation of immigrants to be sure, but that does not mean that \nwe are obligated to give away U.S. citizenship. According to \nimmigration experts, until 1986, the Congress never granted amnesty to \nany generation of immigrants. The Congress encouraged immigrants to \nlearn the Constitutional principles of our Government and the history \nof our country. Immigrants learned English, and tried to assimilate. \nU.S. citizenship was their reward. The Congress did not reward illegal \naliens with U.S. citizenship.\n  Now that this idea of amnesty has been rejected by the Congress, \nperhaps the administration will begin, at long last, to focus its \nefforts on actually reducing the number of illegal aliens already in \nthe country. Such an effort will require a significant investment of \nfunds to hire law enforcement and border security agents, and to give \nthem the resources and equipment they need to do their job. In the \nyears immediately after the September 11 attacks, those funds had not \nonly been left out of the President's annual budgets but had been \ncontinuously blocked by the White House in the appropriations process. \nI and others tried to add funds where possible, but not until recently \ndid the administration begin to respond to the inadequacies along the \nborder. So much more is required and needs to be done.\n  The bill before the Senate today is a good bill. It would authorize \ntwo-layer fencing along the southern border where our security is \nweakest, and set timetables to which the Congress can hold the \nadministration. But this bill will amount to little or no protection \nwithout the resources to implement it. The administration must do more. \nWithout its continued support and a committed effort to prevent illegal \nimmigration, the protective barrier called for in this bill will amount \nto nothing more than a line drawn in the sands of our porous Southern \nborder.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, now we have 4 minutes that can be equally \ndivided between those in favor and those in opposition; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Let us review where we in the Senate have been on the issue of \nimmigration.\n  Last May, we passed by 63 votes, with 1 favorable vote missing, a \ncomprehensive measure to try to deal with a complex and difficult \nissue. The House of Representatives passed this bill, but they refused \nto meet with the Senate of the United States. The House of \nRepresentatives held 60 hearings all over the country at taxpayers' \nexpense--millions and millions of dollars. What do they come up with? \nAfter all the pounding and finger-pointing, they came up with an 800-\nmile fence.\n  Listen to Governor Napolitano: You show me a 50-foot fence, and I \nwill show you a 51-foot ladder.\n  This is a feel-good bumper-sticker vote. It is not going to work. \nWhy? Because half of all the undocumented come here legally. They don't \ncome over the fence.\n  Do you hear us? This is going to cost $9 billion.\n  Listen to what Secretary Chertoff said about this issue. Secretary \nChertoff said: ``Don't give us old fences. Give us 20th century \nsolutions.'' Tom Ridge, the former head of Homeland Security, said the \nsame thing.\n  This is a waste of money. Let us do what we should have done in the \nfirst place. Let us sit down with the House, the way this institution \nis supposed to work, rather than just take what is served up by the \nHouse of Representatives that said take it or leave it. That is what \nthey are saying to the Senate.\n  We have had a good debate which resulted in a comprehensive measure. \nLet\n\n[[Page S10432]]\n\nus have a conference with the House. But let us reject this bumper-\nsticker solution. It isn't going to work. It is going to be enormously \ncostly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we know that fencing works. It is a \nproven approach. The San Diego fence has been incredibly successful. \nThe illegal entries have fallen from 500,000 to 100,000. Crime in San \nDiego County, the whole county, dropped 56 percent. It is an absolutely \nsuccessful experiment and demonstration of this working.\n  The chief of Border Patrol told one of the House hearings that it \nmultiplies the capacity of their agents to be effective. There is no \nway individual agents can run up and down the border without some \nbarriers in these high-traffic areas.\n  Secretary Chertoff asked us explicitly for 800 miles of barriers and \nfencing. He asked for that. We voted for it in May. We voted 83 to 16 \nin favor of the fence, and in August we voted 93 to 3 in favor of \nfunding. But we haven't gotten there yet.\n  This bill is the kind of bill which can allow us to go forward and \ncomplete what the American people would like to see, and maybe then we \ncan have some credibility with the public and we can begin to deal with \nthe very important, sensitive issues of comprehensive immigration \nreform which I favor. But I believe the present bill that came through \nthe Senate did not meet the required standard. We can do much better.\n  We have voted for this. We voted for it at least three times to make \nit a reality. And then we will have some credibility with the American \npeople after we do that and then begin to talk comprehensively about \nhow to fix an absolutely broken immigration system.\n  I urge support of cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on \nCalendar No. 615, H.R. 6061, a bill to establish operational control \nover the international land and maritime borders of the United States, \nshall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.

On this vote, the yeas are 71, the nays are \n28. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The clerk will please report the bill.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6061) to establish operational control over \n     the international land and maritime borders of the United \n     States.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Frist amendment No. 5036, to establish military \n     commissions.\n       Frist amendment No. 5037 (to amendment No. 5036), to \n     establish the effective date.\n       Motion to commit the bill to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary, with instructions to report back forthwith, with \n     an amendment.\n       Frist amendment No. 5038 (to the instructions of the motion \n     to commit H.R. 6061 to the Committee on the Judiciary), to \n     establish military commissions.\n       Frist amendment No. 5039 (to the instructions of the motion \n     to commit H.R. 6061 to the Committee on the Judiciary), to \n     establish the effective date.\n       Frist amendment No. 5040 (to amendment No. 5039), to amend \n     the effective date.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In May, the Senate passed a historic bipartisan bill \nthat bolsters national security, ensures economic prosperity and \nprotects families. The House passed a very different bill.\n  The logical next step would have been to appoint conferees and begin \nnegotiating a compromise.\n  But, instead of working to get legislation to the President's desk, \nthe House Republican leadership frittered away the summer, embarking on \na political road show featuring 60 cynical onesided hearings, and \nwasting millions of precious taxpayer dollars.\n  Repeatedly, the American people have told us that they want our \nimmigration system fixed, and fixed now. They know this complex problem \nrequires border security, a solution for the 12 million undocumented, \nand a fair temporary worker program for future workers. All security \nexperts agree.\n  So what does the Republican leadership have to show for its months of \nfist pounding and finger pointing?\n  All they have is old and failed plan--a fence bill. It makes for a \ngood bumper sticker, but it is not a solution. It is a feel good vote \nthat will do nothing but waste $9 billion.\n  The fence proposal we have before us: Goes far beyond what Secretary \nChertoff needs; it doubles the size of the fence we have already \napproved. From 370 miles to 850 miles. It is also expensive. Estimates \nrange from $3 million per mile. And it will not work. Fences will not \nstop illegal overstayers--who account for 40-50 percent of current \nundocumented population, or the many who continue to come here to work.\n  What the Republican leadership does not seem to get is that \ncomprehensive immigration reform is all about security.\n  The American people want realistic solutions, not piecemeal feel-good \nmeasures that will waste billions of precious taxpayer dollars and do \nnothing to correct a serious problem.\n  Sacrificing good immigration policy for political expediency and \nhateful rhetoric is not just shameful--it is cowardly.\n  Let us be frank. This is about politics not policy.\n  I urge my colleagues to choose good policy over political expedience \nand oppose this cloture motion.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, every Member of this body recognizes \nthat border security is critical to our Nation's security. We can and \nmust improve our efforts at the borders and prevent potential \nterrorists from entering our country. I have long supported devoting \nmore personnel and resources to border security, and I will continue to \ndo so.\n  But this bill is a misguided effort to secure our borders. I cannot \njustify pouring billions of Federal dollars into efforts that are not \nlikely to be effective.\n  Recent Congressional Budget Office estimates indicate that border \nfencing can cost more than $3 million per mile. Under this legislation, \nwe would be committing vast resources to an unproven initiative. Adding \nhundreds of miles of fencing along the border will almost certainly not \nstem the flow of people who are willing to risk their lives to come to \nthis country.\n  Furthermore, there are very serious concerns about the environmental \nimpact this type of massive construction project would have on fragile \necosystems in border areas. Before we pour precious Federal dollars \ninto a massive border fencing system, at the very least we should do a \nthorough analysis of the most effective and fiscally responsible means \nof securing our borders against illegal transit. In fact, S. 2611, the \nComprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006, would direct\n\n[[Page S10433]]\n\nthe Attorney General, in cooperation with other executive branch \nofficials, to conduct such a study on this question. The study would \nanalyze the construction of a system of physical barriers along the \nsouthern international land and maritime border, including the \nnecessity, feasibility, and impact of such barriers on the surrounding \narea.\n  Another reason that this bill is misguided is that improving our \nborder security alone will not stem the tide of people who are willing \nto risk everything to enter this country. According to a recent Cato \nInstitute report, the probability of catching an illegal immigrant has \nfallen over the past two decades from 33 percent to 5 percent, despite \nthe fact that we have tripled the number of border agents and increased \nthe enforcement budget tenfold. It would be fiscally irresponsible and \nself-defeating to devote more and more Federal dollars to border \nsecurity efforts, like this fence, without also creating a realistic \nimmigration system to allow people who legitimately want to come to \nthis country to go through legal channels to do so.\n  That is why I oppose the House ``enforcement only'' bill. That is why \nbusiness groups, labor unions and immigrant's rights groups have all \ncome together to demand comprehensive immigration reform. And that is \nwhy I oppose this bill. We need a comprehensive, pragmatic approach \nthat not only strengthens border security, but also brings people out \nof the shadows and ensures that our Government knows who is entering \nthis country for legitimate reasons, so we can focus our efforts on \nfinding those who want to do us harm. Border security alone is not \nenough. I will vote against cloture on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the Senate I proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n5631, the Defense appropriations bill. I further ask unanimous consent \nthat there be 2 hours of debate equally divided between the majority \nand minority, with that debate time not counting against the 30 hours \npostcloture, and that a vote on adoption of the conference report occur \nat 10 a.m. on Friday, September 29.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The report will be stated by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     5631), making appropriations for the Department of Defense \n     for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2007, and for other \n     purposes, having met, have agreed that the House recede from \n     its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, and agree to \n     the same with an amendment, and the Senate agree to the same, \n     signed by all of the conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the proceedings of the House in \nthe Record of September 25, 2006.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Mr. STEVENS. Mr. \nPresident, the time is equally divided, as I understand it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to present the Defense \nappropriations conference report for fiscal year 2007 with my colleague \nfrom Hawaii, our cochairman, Senator Inouye.\n  Two nights ago, in a strong measure of bipartisan support for our men \nand women in uniform, the House of Representatives passed this bill. \nThere are only 4 days left in the fiscal year. The 2007 Defense \nappropriations conference report must be signed into law by the \nPresident before Saturday at midnight.\n  Finishing debate on this bill tonight and passing it tomorrow morning \nwill ensure that this bill will get to the President in time so there \nwill be no lapse in money available to our men and women in uniform to \nconduct the ongoing activities throughout the world.\n  This bill includes the continuing resolution for those appropriations \nbills which have not been completed. This continuing resolution, or CR, \nas we call it, was negotiated on a bicameral, bipartisan basis. It is \nwhat we call a clean CR. There is no other problem associated with this \nCR. It has been supported on both sides of the aisle, and we are \ngrateful to the Members in both the House and the Senate for that \napproval.\n  Our conference report represents a balanced approach to fulfilling \nthe financial needs of the Department for fiscal year 2007. It provides \n$436.5 billion in new discretionary spending authority for the \nDepartment of Defense. This amount also includes $70 billion in \nemergency spending for early fiscal year 2007 costs associated with the \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan and the global war against \nterrorism.\n\n  The bill fully funds the 2.2 percent across-the-board military pay \nraise as proposed in the President's budget.\n  This conference agreement also provides $17.1 billion for additional \nfiscal year 2007 reset funding for the Army and $5.8 billion for the \nMarine Corps. These are specific amounts identified by the services as \nnecessary to meet their fiscal year 2007 equipment requirements.\n  The additional reset funding provides for the replacement of aircraft \nlost in battle and the recapitalization and production of combat and \ntactical vehicles, ammunition, and communications equipment.\n  In addition, the conference report provides $1.1 billion for body \narmor and personal protection equipment and $1.9 billion to combat \nimprovised explosive devices.\n  The bill also provides $1.5 billion for the Afghanistan security \nforces fund and $1.7 billion for the Iraq security forces fund. These \nfunds will continue the training of indigenous security forces and \nprovide equipment and infrastructure essential to developing capable \nsecurity forces in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  The bill does not address the funding for basic allowance for housing \nwithin the military personnel accounts, sustainment, readiness and \nmodernization funds contained in the operation and maintenance \naccounts, environmental funding, or Defense Health Program funding. \nThese accounts will be conferenced later this year with the House \nAppropriations subcommittee responsible for those accounts. They are \nseparate from this bill.\n  Finally, I would like to note that the bill provides more than $3 \nbillion for National Guard and Reserve equipment to improve their \nreadiness in combat operations as well as their critical role in our \nNation's response to natural disasters.\n  I urge all Members of the Senate to support this bill. It supports \nthe men and women in uniform who risk their lives for our country each \nday. By voting for this measure, we show our support for what they do.\n  I also wish to thank my cochairman again, Senator Inouye, for his \nsupport and invaluable counsel on the bill.\n  And before I recognize him, I would like to allocate 10 minutes of \nthe time on our side to the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma. But I \nyield to my friend from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe conference report on H. R. 5631. This bill, as the chairman has \nnoted, includes some $436.6 billion for the Department of Defense, \nincluding $70 billion to help offset the cost of war in Iraq and the \nglobal war on terrorism for the first several months of fiscal year \n2007.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that the bill does not include \nfunding, as noted by the chairman, for the Defense Health Program or \nfor environmental and real property maintenance and related programs.\n  By agreement between the Appropriations Committees in both Houses, \nthese amounts will be carried in the Military Construction bill which \nhas not yet passed the Senate.\n  Accounting for this change, the bill is $9.3 billion higher than the \nbill which passed the Senate. Of this amount, approximately $4.7 \nbillion is in emergency funding for the war on terror, and the balance \nis for regular appropriations.\n  This bill provides for the essential requirements of the Department \nof Defense and is a fair compromise between\n\n[[Page S10434]]\n\nthe priorities of the House and the Senate.\n  To my colleagues on the democratic side, I would say this is a good \nbill.\n  It was fashioned in a bi-partisan manner and it funds our critical \ndefense needs.\n  Several items which were added to this bill by democratic amendments \nare addressed favorably in this conference report.\n  The agreement urges the President to report his plans in the event of \nincreased sectarian violence in Iraq. It urges the director of national \nintelligence to assess many elements of the potential for civil war in \nIraq.\n  It includes an additional $100 million to help eradicate poppies in \nAfghanistan and it addresses concerns raised in the Senate about \nincreasing funding to find the leaders of al-Qaida.\n  I point out to the Senate that all the members of the conference on \nboth sides of the aisle supported this agreement.\n  I fully support the bill that the Chairman is recommending, and I \nurge my colleagues to support the measure as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for all \nhis hard work and dedication on defense in this country and the hard \nwork he put forward. This bill undoubtedly will pass this body, and \nprobably unanimously. I will note that there were several things I have \na criticism of in the bill and things I would like to have seen in it, \nbut they are not there. But I also note that we are having trouble \nmaintaining Abrams fighting vehicles, maintaining tanks.\n  As we look at this bill, the $70 billion we are going to have for the \nwar, that is an emergency and it is appropriate, there is no question \nabout it. What is not appropriate in this bill--and this body passed 96 \nto 1--is the fact that we agreed in this body that whatever the \nearmarks were in the bill, there ought to be a scorecard on them, on \nwhether the earmarks met the mission of the Defense Department.\n  There are going to be a lot of earmarks that are good, but a lot of \nthem are stinky. There are 2,000 earmarks in the bill directed by \nMembers of Congress--somewhere around $8 billion--and a large portion \nof those don't have anything to do with the mission of the Defense \nDepartment, and they have everything to do with us failing to do the \nthings we should do in terms of prioritizing and making the hard \ndecisions in this country.\n  I am going to vote for the bill because of its importance for our \ncountry. But in this bill, you don't know who did the earmarks. They \nare very cleverly written. You cannot find out exactly what contractor \nthey are going to. You don't know who is responsible. They are not \nlisted. That is OK if we want to do things that way, but it is not OK \nif you are going to do that and not at least assess the effect of the \nearmarks.\n  We passed in this Chamber, 96 to 1, that we would, in fact, ask the \nDefense Department to assist in how effective the earmarks are in \naccomplishing their mission. My disappointment is, that is not in the \nbill. If out of that $5 billion to $8 billion worth of earmarks, $2 \nbillion or $3 billion is waste, think what we could have done for the \ndefense of this country. Think what we could have done for those who \nare depending on us and we cannot fully supply their needs, whether it \nis early childhood education, Head Start, or the AIDS drug assistance \nprogram, just to name a few.\n  We will try again next year. We will try to get the earmarks \npublished, out in the open, and into the sunlight, so the American \npeople can see what we are directing, to whom we are directing it, and \nwho is doing the directing. I will be back on every bill until we come \nclean with the American people on the political games we are playing \nwith earmarks. We either need to have the agencies say what they are \ndoing with them and whether they meet their mission or we need to be \nupfront on who is doing what, why, and what for.\n  I appreciate the hard work of the chairman and Senator Inouye in \nterms of bringing this bill to the floor. More importantly, I \nappreciate those who dedicate their lives to this country by becoming a \npart of our Armed Services and setting an example we could very well \nlearn from in this body when it comes to earmarks just by following \ntheir example of service, courage, and integrity.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for time off of \nSenator Inouye's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let me thank the chairman, Senator Stevens \nfrom Alaska, and his ranking member, the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. \nInouye, for their hard work on this Defense appropriations bill. As a \nmember of that subcommittee, I have been pleased to work with them and \ntheir very able and diligent staffs to shape a Defense appropriations \nbill that does indeed meet the needs of our times and provides the \nfunding resources our military needs in these very trying times.\n  Again, I express my support for the underlying bill, the Defense \nappropriations bill. Again, my gratitude goes to the Senator from \nAlaska and the Senator from Hawaii for all their hard work.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome the decision of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee conferees to support the Senate's request \nfor a new National Intelligence Estimate on conditions in Iraq.\n  Earlier this week, the American people were shocked to learn about an \nassessment from the intelligence community which unequivocally \nconcluded that the war in Iraq is creating a new generation of \nterrorists. It was especially shocking, given the administration's \nrepeated insistence that we are winning the war on terror and that \nAmerica is safer because of the war in Iraq. That 5-month-old \nassessment addressed the impact of the Iraq war on the global threat of \nterrorism, outside of Iraq's borders.\n  But what about Iraq itself? What is the collective assessment of the \nintelligence community about the prospects for success in Iraq versus \nthe likelihood of full-scale civil war? The President insists that we \nare winning in Iraq but, remarkably, the intelligence community has not \nprepared a National Intelligence Estimate on conditions inside Iraq for \nmore than 2 years. That must change.\n  America is in deep trouble in Iraq, and it's mystifying that an \nIntelligence estimate focusing on the internal situation in Iraq has \nnot been prepared since July 2004. We know that the President is \ndetermined to convince the American people that we are winning the war \nand that America is safer, but what does the intelligence community \nbelieve? The recent revelations about the April 6 estimate underscore \nthe value and importance of obtaining the collective wisdom of the \nintelligence community to inform our policy judgments and to ensure \nthat the American people have the facts, not just the political spin of \nthe White House.\n  Stopping the slide into full-scale civil war is our greatest \nchallenge and highest priority in Iraq. The continuing violence and \ndeath is ominous. The UN reports that more than 6,500 civilians were \nkilled in July and August alone. Militias are growing in strength and \ncontinue to operate outside the law. Death squads are rampant. Reports \nof torture in official detention centers remain widespread. Kidnappings \nare on the rise, and so are the numbers of Iraqis fleeing the violence.\n  More than 140,000 American troops are on the ground. It's essential \nthat we obtain--and obtain soon--a candid and comprehensive assessment \nfrom the intelligence community on whether Iraq is in or is descending \ninto civil war and what can be done to stop the sectarian violence that \nis spiraling out of control.\n  The stakes are enormously high for our troops and our national \nsecurity, and completing a new NIE on Iraq should be one of Director \nNegroponte's highest priorities.\n  After our Senate amendment requiring a new estimate was approved to \nthis bill on August 3, Director Negroponte agreed to ask the \nintelligence community to prepare it.\n  Certainly nobody has an interest in unnecessarily rushing the \nintelligence community. But it has been more than\n\n[[Page S10435]]\n\n2 years since an NIE on Iraq was prepared, and that's too long. It has \nbeen nearly 2 months since Mr. Negroponte announced his decision to ask \nthe intelligence community to prepare a new assessment, yet the the \nfirst step--determining the scope of the issues to be covered--is still \nnot finished.\n  With Iraq on the brink of a full-scale civil war, preparation of this \nintelligence assessment cannot be delayed any longer. With more than \n140,000 Americans under fire every hour of every day in Iraq, it's \nwrong to slow-roll this assessment. For the sake of our men and women \nin uniform, the intelligence community must move forward, and it must \nmove forward soon.\n  Earlier today I sent a letter to Mr. Negroponte with Senators \nRockefeller, Biden, Levin, Reid, and Reed urging him to move forward \nand indicating that preparation and completion of this intelligence \nassessment cannot be delayed any longer.\n  As the intelligence community finalizes the terms of reference for \nthe new Iraq National Intelligence Estimate, Mr. Negroponte should be \nmindful of the specific provisions in this conference agreement, which \nurge him to follow the parameters set out in the Senate amendment to \nthis bill. Under the amendment, the following issues would be included \nin the new National Intelligence estimate in Iraq:\n  The prospects for controlling severe sectarian violence that could \nlead to civil war; the prospects for reconciling Iraq's ethnic, \nreligious, and tribal divisions; an assessment of the extent to which \nmilitias are providing security and the extent to which the Government \nof Iraq has developed and implemented a credible plan to disarm, \ndemobilize, and reintegrate the militias into the government security \nforces and is working to obtain a political commitment to ban militias; \nan assessment of whether Iraq is succeeding in creating a stable and \neffective unity government, and the likelihood that the government will \naddress the concerns of the Sunni community; and the prospects for \neconomic reconstruction and the impact it will have on security and \nstability.\n  It is obviously important that we obtain an open and honest \nassessment from the Director of National Intelligence, particularly on \nthe question of civil war, and my colleagues and I look forward to such \nan assessment. It is also our view that an unclassified summary, \nconsistent with the protection of sources and methods, should be made \navailable when the estimate is completed.\n  We continue to believe the National Intelligence Estimate should be \nas thorough and comprehensive as possible. To this end, we would also \nbenefit significantly by having it include the following areas:\n\n       An assessment addressing the threat from violent extremist-\n     related terrorism, including al Qaeda, in and from Iraq, \n     including the extent to which terrorist actions in Iraq are \n     targeted at the United States presence there and the \n     likelihood that terrorist groups operating in Iraq will \n     target U.S. interests outside Iraq; an assessment of whether, \n     and in what ways, the large-scale presence of multinational \n     forces in Iraq helps or hinders the prospects for success in \n     Iraq; a description of the optimistic, most likely, and \n     pessimistic scenarios for the stability of Iraq through 2007; \n     and an assessment of the extent to which the situation in \n     Iraq is affecting our relations with Iran, Saudi Arabia, \n     Turkey, and other countries in the region.\n\n  The war in Iraq continues to be an immense strategic blunder for our \ncountry, and having the most thorough and comprehensive National \nIntelligence estimate possible will greatly inform the ongoing debate \nabout our options for the future.\n  A new National Intelligence estimate is long overdue. As John Adams \nsaid, ``Facts are stubborn things.'' It is abundantly clear that the \nfacts matter on Iraq. They mattered before the war and during the war, \nand they matter now, as we try to deal effectively with the continuing \nquagmire.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this conference agreement, and I look \nforward to obtaining the new National Intelligence estimate on Iraq and \nto obtaining it soon.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the letter to which I \nreferred printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                               September 28, 2006.\n     Ambassador John D. Negroponte,\n     Director of National Intelligence, Office of the Director of \n         National Intelligence, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Director Negroponte: We welcome your response to our \n     July 26 correspondence and our August 3 amendment to the \n     Department of Defense Appropriations bill for fiscal year \n     2007 requiring an updated National Intelligence Estimate on \n     Iraq. An NIE focusing on Iraq has not been prepared in more \n     than two years, and we welcome your August 4 announcement \n     that you will ask the intelligence community to prepare this \n     document.\n       As the intelligence community finalizes the terms of \n     reference for the new Iraq National Intelligence Estimate, we \n     draw your attention to a provision in the conference \n     agreement on the Department of Defense Appropriations bill \n     which urges you to follow the parameters set out in our \n     August 3 amendment on the NIE. Under the Senate amendment, \n     the following issues would be included:\n       The prospects for controlling severe sectarian violence \n     that could lead to civil war;\n       The prospects for Iraq's ethic, religious, and tribal \n     divisions;\n       An assessment of the extent to which militias are providing \n     security and the extent to which the Government of Iraq has \n     developed and implemented a credible plan to disarm and \n     demobilize and reintegrate the militias into the government \n     security forces and is working to obtain a political \n     commitment to ban militias;\n       An assessment of whether Iraq is succeeding in creating a \n     stable and effective unity government, and the likelihood \n     that the government will address the concerns of the Sunni \n     community;\n       The prospects for economic reconstruction and the impact it \n     will have on security and stability.\n       It's obviously important that we obtain an open and honest \n     assessment from the intelligence community, particularly on \n     the question of whether Iraq is in or is descending into \n     civil war, and we look forward to the assessment from the \n     intelligence community. It is also our view that an \n     unclassified summary of the judgments, consistent with the \n     protection of sources and methods, should be made available \n     when the NIE is completed.\n       Additionally, we continue to believe the NIE should be as \n     thorough and comprehensive as possible. To this end, we would \n     also benefit significantly by having the following areas \n     addressed in a new Iraq NIE:\n       An assessment addressing the threat from violent extremist-\n     related terrorism, including al Qaida, ill and from Iraq, \n     including the extent to which terrorist actions in Iraq are \n     targeted at the United States presence there and the \n     likelihood that terrorist groups operating in Iraq will \n     target U.S. interests outside Iraq;\n       An assessment of whether, and in what ways, the large-scale \n     presence of multinational forces in Iraq helps or hinders the \n     prospects for success in Iraq;\n       A description of the optimistic, most likely, and \n     pessimistic scenarios for the stability of Iraq through 2007;\n       An assessment of the extent to which the situation in Iraq \n     is affecting our relations with Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, \n     and other countries in the region.\n       The stakes are enormously high in Iraq, and having the most \n     thorough and comprehensive NIE possible will greatly inform \n     the debate about our options in Iraq.\n       We look forward to hearing from you about the final terms \n     of reference for the new Iraq NIE and to receiving the \n     updated NIE. Certainly nobody has an interest in \n     unnecessarily rushing the intelligence community. But it has \n     been more than two years since an NIE on Iraq was prepared \n     and nearly two months since you announced your decision to \n     ask the intelligence community to prepare a new assessment. \n     With more than 140,000 troops on the ground in Iraq, \n     preparation of this intelligence assessment cannot be delayed \n     any longer.\n           Sincerely,\n     John D. Rockefeller IV.\n     Joseph R. Biden, Jr.\n     Carl Levin.\n     Harry Reid.\n     Edward M. Kennedy.\n     Jack Reed.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate is poised to approve the fiscal \nyear 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations conference report. Like \npast Defense Appropriations bills, there are things in this bill that I \nsupport and there are others that I disagree with. Without taking much \nof the Senate's time today I want to mention one small but very \nimportant provision in this bill.\n  Section 9012 of the conference report states that no funds shall be \nmade available for the establishment of permanent U.S. military bases \nin Iraq or to exercise U.S. control over any oil resource of Iraq. This \nlanguage, which was sponsored by Senator Biden and which I strongly \nsupport, provides an important signal to the Iraqi people and to the \nsovereign government of Iraq that it is not the intent of the United \nStates to control or maintain a\n\n[[Page S10436]]\n\npermanent military presence in their country. It is especially \nimportant in light of the recent surveys which indicate that a \nsignificant majority of Iraqis want United States military forces to \nwithdraw from their country.\n  For many Vermonters and for people around the world who have concerns \nand suspicions about the Bush administration's intentions in Iraq, this \nmakes clear that regardless of the disagreements among us over the \ncontinued deployment of U.S. troops in Iraq, we agree that they are not \nthere to establish permanent bases or to control Iraqi oil resources.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on a related note, one portion of the \nmuch publicized National Intelligence Estimate that came out this week \nfailed to capture much attention. It was a segment that said, ``We \ncannot measure the extent of the spread [of jihadist terrorism] with \nprecision . . .'' This candid admission reflects just how difficult \ngood intelligence is to come by. It also reflects why it is so \nimportant that this bill permits the CIA interrogation program to \ncontinue--because it provides valuable intelligence.\n  Over the weekend, much was made about this selective leak of national \nsecurity information. Some of our colleagues pounced on the media \nreports to bolster their argument that we should pull out of Iraq, pull \nout now.\n  But whoever leaked this report somehow forgot to mention a key \nfinding of the intelligence community. As anyone who read the \ndeclassified report knows, the findings are clear: If we defeat the \nterrorists in Iraq, there will be fewer terrorists inspired to carry on \nthe fight elsewhere. But if we leave Iraq to the terrorists, it will \nonly inspire more terrorists to join the fight.\n  In other words, defeating terrorists in Iraq not only secures the new \ndemocracy there but prevents future attacks here.\n  The New York Times editorial board rightly pointed out that ``[t]he \ncurrent situation will get worse if American forces leave.''\n  Mr. President, it is a banner day when the New York Times editorial \nboard contradicts my colleagues across the aisle, and the Times is \ncertainly right, at least in this regard: a policy of retreat will not \nstop terrorists there--or prevent attacks here.\n  I have said it before, but it bears repeating. Terrorism against the \nUnited States didn't start on 9/11 or the day our troops entered \nBaghdad--But attacks here at home did stop when we started fighting al-\nQaida where they live rather than responding after they hit.\n  We don't need to guess what will happen if we leave Iraq to the \nterrorists. We already have a real-world example of what will happen. \nRecall that Afghanistan was a wholly owned subsidiary of al-Qaida \nbefore 9/11. It was from there that they planned and executed--with \nimpunity--attacks against the United States and our allies. Think what \nIraq would be like if we let al-Qaida take possession of the country--\nlike bin Laden wants us to do.\n  And remember what the 9/11 Commission concluded, and I quote: ``If, \nfor example, Iraq becomes a failed state, it will go to the top of the \nlist of places that are breeding grounds for attacks against Americans \nat home.''\n  Mr. President, we know what will happen if we leave Iraq before the \njob is finished. That is simply not in dispute. Remember, bin Laden \ndeclared that, for him, Iraq was the ``capital of the Caliphate.'' We \nmust not and we will not give him that victory.\n\n\n                          Ryan White CARE Act\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise again today to ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate pass S. 2823, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment \nModernization Act, and I will make the formal request in just a few \nmoments.\n  I want to make a few comments first in hopes that some who have a \nhold on this bill will come down and lodge the objection themselves. \nJust last week we requested the unanimous consent agreement to pass \nthis bipartisan, bicameral legislation as it passed out of the House \nEnergy and Commerce Committee last week. At 9:30 tonight it will pass \non the floor of the House, and I expect by significant margins. But \nfive Senators from three States are blocking a vote to create a more \nequitable program for providing life-sparing treatment for individuals \nsuffering from HIV and AIDS.\n  Now, 2 days ago I made this same request to pass this critical \nlegislation, and the five Senators who are holding up this legislation \nchose not to come to the floor to discuss their concerns or to debate \ntheir issues. Instead, the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Dayton, was \ngracious enough to notify us of his objection, even though he stated he \nwould vote for the bill.\n  So today I ask again the Senators from New York, New Jersey, and \nCalifornia, those who have holds on this critical legislation, to come \nto the floor themselves and lodge their objections to explain why their \nparochial interests should be permitted to deny lifesaving care to \npeople who don't live in their States.\n  Now, I have a chart here that shows the New York and New Jersey \nsituation. You can see that New York, under the current law, receives \n$509 per case above the national average. Under the reauthorization, \nthey would still receive $304 above the national average per case. And \nnot only that, at the end of the year, they have $29 million left over.\n  In New Jersey, they get $310 per case above the national average. \nNow, under the reauthorization, they would still get $88 more per case \nabove the national average, and they have a little slush fund at the \nend of the year: $17.7 million.\n  These States have simply raised objections about what funds they will \nreceive this year compared to last year. These States will still be \noverpaid per case, just no longer grossly overpaid. For example, New \nYork is paid $509 more per AIDS case, as I showed my colleagues, than \nthe national average and would get $304. They have been unable to spend \n$29 million in Ryan White funding. They can't spend the money they are \ntaking in now. Yet those States' Senators still want more at the \nexpense of many other States that are currently underfunded.\n  Now, these States have not objected to the underlying policies. \nAgain, I must emphasize that these couple of States have been grossly \noverpaid for years, receiving well over the national average per \npatient with HIV. Even under this new bill, they will continue to be \noverpaid, although not quite as much.\n  Now, California is a little different situation. When the law was \npassed last time, we put some provisions into law, and we set a \ndeadline for HIV/AIDS cases for fiscal year 2005 to have a conversion. \nNow, the Secretary opted to delay that until 2007 to give the States \nmore time, and the CDC in 2005 urged all the States to transition \nimmediately. California decided to transition in 2006. CDC offered \nresources and people in 2006 to help them make the transition. \nCalifornia declined.\n  There is a deadline. California will lose $74 million in 4 years \nunder the current law for not meeting the deadline. When we pass this \nbill, under the new law, California would gain $60 million over the 4 \nyears and have more time. So it is kind of a win-win situation for \nCalifornia. Under some of the formula, they were hoping, I think, to \ngain even more. But they can meet the deadline; extra help has been \noffered. So if they would take the extra help, they could meet that \ntimeline, and under this bill, they would gain $60 million over 4 years \ninstead of losing $74 million over that same 4 years by not complying \nwith the transition language.\n  This bill would ensure that every State in the Nation has the \nappropriate funding to care for their residents living with HIV and \nAIDS.\n  Let me show you another chart. On the left-hand side, the States in \nred will have losses under the current law: 100,000 Americans get left \nout. This will happen on September 30 unless we pass a bill. On \nSeptember 30, there will be huge penalties to these States. The bottom \nright shows the States that will gain under the reauthorization that we \nare doing, and you will notice that there are five States that will not \ngain, but only two of them are objecting. These five Senators who \ndidn't come to the floor 2 days ago still continue to obstruct the \nSenate from passing a bill that can save more than 100,000 lives, \nincluding the lives of a growing number of women and minorities who are \nafflicted by this devastating disease.\n  As you can see from this chart, without this new law, people across \nthe\n\n[[Page S10437]]\n\ncountry who are suffering from HIV and AIDS will be hurt unless we pass \nthe new bipartisan, bicameral bill. That means that we have worked on \nthis for a long period of time, and we have people from both sides of \nthe aisle in agreement. We even have people on both ends of the \nbuilding in agreement, and, in fact, the bill that the House is passing \ntonight is the same bill that we worked out and are ready to pass over \nhere.\n  So holding up passage of this new law is wrong. By doing so, these \nSenators are denying growing numbers of minorities and women living \nwith HIV and AIDS equal protection under the Ryan White CARE Act.\n  This chart shows Americans are at risk. More than half of the HIV/\nAIDS cases are not counted under the Federal law in the States that are \nmarked in red. Those are ones that are not getting half of the money \nthat they need right now, half that they ought to have if the bill was \nfair.\n  So we need to pass this bill. We need to pass this bill by September \n30. Let's see, today is the 28th. We only have 2 days to pass this \nbill. And if we don't pass the bill, a whole bunch of States are going \nto be penalized severely under the old law.\n  I have gotten letters from several of the Senators who are worried \nabout what is going to happen to their States under the old law come \njust 2 days from now. If the bill is not authorized by September 30, \nhundreds and thousands of people in the States and the District of \nColumbia will lose access to lifesaving services.\n  Therefore, Senators from three States are holding up a bill that \nwould help Connecticut, Georgia, Kentucky, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, \nDelaware, Illinois, Maine, Oregon, Washington State, California, \nHawaii, Massachusetts, Maryland, Montana, Rhode Island, Vermont, and \nthe District of Columbia. Hundreds of thousands of people living with \nHIV and AIDS who live in these States will be needlessly hurt if a few \nSenators continue obstructing good policy.\n\n  As you can see from the chart, more than half of the HIV/AIDS cases \nare not counted under current law. As we all know, the Ryan White \nProgram provides critical health care services for people who are \ninfected with HIV/AIDS. These individuals rely on this vital program \nfor drugs and other services. We need to pass this legislation so that \nwe can provide them with the treatment they desperately need.\n  I urge the Senators who are holding up this bill to stop playing the \nnumbers game so that Ryan White CARE Act funding can address the \nepidemic of today, not 2 days or 2 years ago.\n  The HIV/AIDS epidemic of today affects more women, more minorities, \nand more people in rural areas in the South than ever before. While we \nhave made significant progress in understanding and treating this \ndisease, there is still much more to do to ensure equitable treatment \nfor all Americans infected with HIV and AIDS. We must ensure that those \ninfected with HIV and living with AIDS will receive our support and our \ncompassion regardless of their race, regardless of their gender, \nregardless of where they live.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this key legislation and \nstop playing the numbers game so we can assist those with HIV in \nAmerica.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2823\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 580, S. 2823, the Ryan White \nAct. I ask unanimous consent the Enzi substitute at the desk be agreed \nto, the committee reported amendment as amended be agreed to, the bill \nas amended be read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want to \nsay that I thank the Senator for his courtesy and for warning me about \nhis intention here tonight. I salute him for his leadership on this \nlegislation, which I support, so I am in a bit of an awkward situation, \nas he has recognized. But I guess I would ask the chairman, if my \ninformation is correct, there are actually 14 States that would lose \nfunding under the revised formula.\n  As the chairman said the other day, there is a hold-harmless clause \nthat is in effect, as I understand, for 3 years, and this is a 5-year \nreauthorization, so at that point these other States would lose \nfunding.\n  Does the chairman find it surprising that Senators from those States \nare doing what I think I would do if I were in that situation? I am \ngrateful the formula adds money for Minnesota, but I find it \nunsurprising that they are doing what any of us I believe would do, \nwhich is to protect our States.\n  My second question to the chairman is: Given that this is a $12.2 \nbillion reauthorization over 5 years, what would it cost in additional \nauthorization to give these States over the next 5 years the same \namount of money as they receive presently?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his reluctant \nobjection, although it still counts as an objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Has the Senator from Minnesota objected?\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I am reserving the right to object. I \ndirected two questions to the chairman, if I may, Mr. President.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I will go ahead and answer the questions, \nthen, and hope this changes your mind on being the one willing to make \nthe objection.\n  Would I protect my State if my State were losing money? I think we \nare elected to the Senate by the people in our States, but our \nobligation is to the people of the United States. And were my State \ngrossly overpaid on an average, and I was still going to be grossly \noverpaid afterwards, and my State couldn't use the money each year that \nit received, I think I would have a terrible time trying to object to \nthis bill. I hope we do not play that kind of numbers game, we don't \nget that parochial on bills around here.\n  Another bill I have been working on is the Older Americans Act, and \nit has a formula in it. Again, there are States that lose under that \nbill. But there are people who have been willing to work out a formula \nlike we did on this. We must have run about 300 different programs \ntrying to come up with something as equitable as possible. We even put \nin the 3 years hold harmless for people who were being grossly \noverpaid.\n  I think we have come up with as reasonable a bill as we possibly can. \nWe need to get it passed, and we need to get it passed by September 30 \nso the penalties don't kick into effect for those States that have a \nbig penalty coming up and that are desperately in need of making sure \nthey get enough money to take care of the cases they presently have.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the chairman yield for a question?\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I haven't had my question answered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I have one more answer that I need to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has the floor. His \nunanimous consent request is pending.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. I will yield for some other questions as soon as I finish \nanswering this question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. There aren't 14 States that would lose money unless the new \nbill doesn't pass. There are only five States that will lose money \nunder the new bill, the bill we are trying to get passed by unanimous \nconsent--the bill that we are at least trying to be able to bring up by \nunanimous consent. We tried a number of different ways. There are just \nfive States that are involved in losing money. Of those five, three \nhave said we have to be fair. Two have said we don't care whether we \nare fair or not.\n  Mr. DAYTON. If I may direct a question again to the chairman, how \nmuch would it cost in addition to the $12.2 billion for this 5-year \nauthorization? What additional authorization would it cost to give \nthose five States the same level of funding over the next 5 years that \nthey would receive as of today?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I don't have that number. Like I say, we ran \nabout 300 different iterations of different formulas. I will get the \nSenator that number.\n  But there is 3 years hold harmless in this. You are talking about 5 \nyears hold harmless. Hold harmless means\n\n[[Page S10438]]\n\nthat the dollars don't follow the person, that the State gets the money \neven if they have run out of people with HIV/AIDS, and if there are \ndecreasing numbers of them they should not continue to get those \ndollars. What you are asking is we continue to give those dollars even \nif we run out of people. All we are trying to do with this bill is make \nsure the dollars follow the person. You get more people, you get more \nmoney. You get less people, you get less money. It is take care of the \npeople.\n  It is not an economic development bill.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I appreciate the answers of the chairman. \nI respect him very highly for what he has done. I must, however, object \non behalf of my colleagues whom I believe are doing properly what they \nmust and should do to protect their own States. So I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, it really strikes me strange, when we are \ntalking about protecting money from States that already have full \ntreatment programs, and people are dying across this country because \nthere is inequity in the funding for those States. If that is the basis \nfor an objection, that is an obscene objection.\n  We are talking about people dying who have no access to medicines, \nwho have no access to treatment, while we have--let me get to the \nspecifics--while we have in New York alone, last year--the city of New \nYork spent $9 million on hotel rooms averaging $329 a night to house \npeople. They spent money, $2.2 million, on people who were dead, paying \nfor rented rooms they weren't even in. And we are talking about \nobjecting to fair treatment and access to care for people who have none \nnow because we don't want to see the fluff associated with other \nprograms decline.\n  The President has asked us to pass this bill. On October 1, lots of \nchanges take place. They are going to impact lots of people in lots of \nStates.\n\n  I find it unconscionable that somebody would have somebody object for \nthem rather than to come down and defend their objection. If you object \nto making sure African-American women across this country have access \nto lifesaving drugs, you ought to come to the floor and say you object \nto that because that is what an objection means for this bill starting \nOctober 1. There is already a lack. There are people dying in three \nStates right now because they have waiting lists for drugs for HIV for \npeople who have no other resources to take care of themselves.\n  Last year I offered an amendment on this floor, fully paid for and \noffset, for $60 million for additional ADAP funds that would have taken \ncare of the very people who are going to suffer from this bill, and the \nvery same Senators who are blocking this bill voted against those funds \nfor those people who have no treatment today. There is something very \nwrong in the Senate when the leaders of the charge for this bill, with \nthe exception of Senator Kennedy who has done miraculous work with \nSenator Enzi--the leaders in the charge for getting this bill and \nmaking sure everybody has equal access to care for HIV in this country \nare four conservative Senators.\n  We ought to ask a question about that. Why are we down here fighting \nfor this? We believe in equal treatment. We believe in equal access. \nWhere are the people who claim all the time to defend that? Why aren't \nthey here on the floor of the Senate?\n  I want to make a couple of other points. The Labor-HHS bill that we \nare going to be voting on this fall has $1 billion in earmarks in it; \n$1 billion in earmarks. Most of it has zero, in comparison to saving \nsomebody's life, like ADAP drugs and access to treatment if you are \ninfected with HIV and you don't have any access to care whatsoever. We \ndon't see anybody volunteering to give up their earmarks.\n  Here is a stack of earmarks for New York State alone, last year in \nexcess of $1.5 billion--over 600 earmarks. Nobody volunteered to give \nup the earmarks, the special projects that politicians get benefits \nfrom that sometimes do good and sometimes don't do good--nobody offered \nto give those up to pay for this loss. We want to continue to do what \nwe are doing, having the privileges and prerogatives of a Senator or a \nCongressman to grease the skids of our own reelection with an earmark, \nbut we will not give some of that up to make sure somebody in a State \nthat is not having access, who is going to die in the next 3 months, \nhas access to lifesaving drugs.\n  That is an incrimination on this process. It is an incrimination on \nthis body. Shame on us if we allow this to continue to be held up.\n  New York State carried over $27 million. The Department of HHS--here \nis another. This past weekend, HHS spent $400,000 sending people--78 \nemployees--to Hollywood, FL, of which 2 out of the 3 days didn't have \nanything to do with the conference. It was a party. As a matter of \nfact, as a quote from the New York Times states, at the last AIDS \nconference in Toronto, 78 HHS employees went, and as the New York Times \nsaid, this was a star-studied rock concert, a circus-like atmosphere \nthat made it seem more like a convention and social gathering than a \nscientific meeting. For these and other reasons a number of leading \nscientists have stopped attending and some supporters claimed the \nquality of the presentations have declined at recent conferences.\n  We can find more money. We can find money from earmarks. We can find \nmoney from conferences. We can find money from waste, fraud, and abuse. \nWhat we cannot find is the integrity to treat everybody equally in this \ncountry because we want to protect the parochial interests of our city \nor our State. That is wrong.\n  It is wrong that they are not down here defending that immoral \nposition. I challenge them to come down and defend it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Enzi and Ranking Member \nKennedy for an incredible amount of work, not just within our committee \nbut in a bicameral way with the House. Seldom do we get the opportunity \nto come to the floor of the Senate fully knowing that the House is on \nboard to every word that is in a bill, which means even with the 2 days \nthat the chairman has suggested we have before this bill adversely \naffects thousands in this country, we could actually have it on the \nPresident's desk and signed. But we are tonight, at almost 9 o'clock, \nwith four Senators on the floor, finding absent the Senators who object \nto us bringing up this bill. Why would they object?\n  Senator Dayton said because they owe it to their States to get as \nmuch money as they possibly can and to not be equitable under a \ndistribution formula.\n  I tell you that could be the reason. But I think the reason they are \nnot here is because their position is indefensible; to allow us to \nbring this bill to the floor one would challenge them on why they take \nthe position that they do. Their position is indefensible because this \nformula is run on numbers.\n  It is very simple. The chairman stated it to the Senator from \nMinnesota very clearly. For every patient you have you get dollars to \nmake sure that you provide the services and the pharmaceuticals that \nare needed. If you don't have the people, if you don't have the \ninfected patients, you should not get the money. What is the fear? The \nfear is, they know they don't have the people. Therefore, they will not \nget the money. So why not have the debate? Stall and see what happens.\n  The chairman said there were a number of States--New York being the \nmost egregious--where they received $2,122 per infected patient. The \nnational average is $1,613. I represent the State of North Carolina. We \nhave one of the fastest growing populations of HIV-infected individuals \nin the United States. Today what does North Carolina receive--$1,029 \nper individual infected with HIV/AIDS. Can any Member who blocks this \ncome to the floor and tell me that is equitable? Can any Member come to \nthe floor and suggest to me that this funding, designed to provide the \ndrugs that these people need to live is equitable? That New York should \nget $2,122 per person but North Carolina should get $1,129 per person? \nCan they tell me that is equitable? It is not only not equitable, it is \nunjust. It is unfair. It is wrong.\n\n[[Page S10439]]\n\n  You know what, the people in North Carolina say: We are tired. It \ncan't happen anymore. You have to change it.\n  I have a State who, annually, has individuals on the ADAP waiting \nlist--individuals waiting in line to be eligible to get \npharmaceuticals, to stay alive. This is not the vision of America we \nhave been taught. We have been taught that we need to make sure that \nsafety net is there. But the argument tonight is that we are going to \nbe denied the safety net in some States so that others can keep feeding \nat the trough--whether they have the population or not.\n  The people in North Carolina are tired of watching their State \ncontribute the second highest percentage of dollars to the Ryan White \nProgram but getting less Federal funding than States who barely \ncontribute a dime on their own.\n  They are tired of seeing African-American women in the South of the \nUnited States 26 times more likely to be HIV-positive than a White \nwoman and to see States that deny them the ability to provide the drugs \nthat these women need. They are tired of hearing about HIV-positive \npeople in San Francisco and New York getting dog-walking services and \nmassages when some of my constituents can't even get HIV drugs.\n  They are tired of hearing terms such as ``double counting,'' ``hold \nharmless,'' ``duplication of names,'' ``grandfathered in.'' All of \nthose terms translate to one word: unequal.\n  What is so wrong with the concept that Ryan White dollars follow HIV-\ninfected individuals?\n  Recently, I had individuals in my office. They suggested that 3 years \nwas not enough time to account for the infected population, that in \nfact they are going to be penalized because they have more individuals \nwho are infected with HIV/AIDS than what we count today.\n  It is real simple. The chairman said 3 years hold harmless. They have \n3 years to produce those names to verify that they are eligible for the \nfunds, and if they don't do that then, in fact, that money goes \nelsewhere. So what was their argument? Three years is not enough time.\n  Every one of the individuals who is infected is enrolled in some type \nof program and service and receiving drugs and services. Clearly, if \nthey receive those drugs and services on a regular basis, it is easy to \naccount for who they are and where they are.\n  In fact, if they are not there, the last thing you want to do is have \na program that accounts by an individual's name. But, in fact, that is \nwhat we do with this formula.\n  Right now, the Federal Government is giving exotic fruit to \nCalifornia and New York, and North Carolina is getting rotten apples. \nThat is about the comparison. We allow them to have a Cadillac and, in \nfact, we don't even give those folks in North Carolina a car.\n  The transition that is going on in America is that the infected \npopulation is in rural America, and many of them are showing up in the \nsoutheastern part of the United States. They are not in urban areas; \nthey are not in what we consider title I or title II towns. We don't \nget the enhanced dollars because of the concentration in a big city. \nThey are at the end of a dirt road. They are 30 miles from an AIDS \nclinic.\n  When we look at how we service that newly infected population in the \nSouth, which is predominantly African-American women, it is not only \nwhere we get the money to supply the drug, it is where we get the money \nto provide the transportation so they can go to an AIDS clinic. Where \ndo we get the money to provide the rest of the service for somebody who \ndoesn't have a relationship with a health care professional? The \nclosest thing they get to primary care is the day they walk in and get \ntheir drugs and they get a ``quickie'' check up. Then it is another \nprocess of a bus or a van or a friend who takes them to get it. But \nwithout that extra bit, they would never get the drug if, in fact, we \ndidn't supply some type of transportation.\n  In 2000, North Carolina had 12,489 people living with HIV/AIDS. There \nare 6,000-plus infected people more today than that 2000 statistic. I \nknow how many there are in North Carolina because we keep their names. \nWe track the individuals.\n  We are not asking for more money than we have in infected patients. \nWe are asking for this formula to be fair.\n  Through December 2004, North Carolina was a State with the 14th \ngreatest number of AIDS cases in the Nation, and the highest ranking \nState--the only State in the top 17--without a title I city that had \nenhanced reimbursement you get because of the size of the city and the \ninfected population.\n  In 2004, 66.7 percent of people living with AIDS in North Carolina \nwere African American--the fifth highest rate in the Nation. The \nnational average in 2004 was 39.9, and ours is 66.7.\n  I would like to think there would be 100 Senators down here talking \nabout the outrage; that they would look at the racial disparity in \nthis, the regional disparity; and that they would be down here arguing \nthat this program has to be changed. It is not happening, and 72 \npercent of the new North Carolina cases in 2005 were minorities. It may \nbe that the 66.7 percent of the infected population is, in fact, the \nlow watermark, not the high watermark as we begin to see those new \ncases of minority individuals.\n  For those of us who are here arguing tonight that this should be \nchanged, we recognize the fact that women of color in the South are 26 \ntimes more likely to be HIV-positive than White females.\n  This is an alarming trend that this Nation ought to turn around. We \nhave a lot to do in 2 days--now a night and a day. We want to make that \nSeptember 30 deadline.\n  It is clear that individuals in New York want to maintain the $2,100 \nper case and not accept the $1,613 average. The individuals in New \nJersey want to keep their $1,923 and not settle for the $1,613 that is \nthe national average. They are willing to suggest that is an equitable \ntradeoff with North Carolina that gets $1,129 per individual infected \nby HIV.\n  It is time that we show the leadership that we have to point out to \npeople who are holding this up that we cannot let them hide behind some \ndefense that ``I can't lose for my State'' money that they cannot prove \ngoes in their State to save the lives of people who are dying in my \nState because they can't get the pharmaceutical products they need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Enzi, our chairman, for \nhis great leadership and persuasive remarks earlier on this important \nissue.\n  My good friend, Dr. Coburn, has personally treated people with AIDS \nand has dealt with women who have had babies with AIDS. It is a matter \ndeeply important to him.\n  Senator Burr is a force in our committee. He works extremely hard. \nHis remarks go to the core of what we are all about here. He explained \nit in great detail. I am so appreciative of that.\n  I will just say a few things that I believe are important.\n  Senator Dayton, I must tell you that my good friend Senator Enzi is a \nvery fair man. If the chairman were asked, Chairman Enzi, why should \nNew York give up anything? Why shouldn't they insist on keeping the \nspecial position they have?\n  Let me ask this question: How did New York get that special position? \nHow did it happen? They came to the Congress a number of years ago. \nThey said: We have an extraordinary problem in New York. Our problem is \ngreat. We have this growing problem with AIDS, and we need extra money.\n  The Nation said: We believe you are hurting, New York. We believe you \nhave a special problem, and we will give you special money, extra \nmoney. You will get more than the rest of the country because it \nappears that the disease is more centered there and is spreading most \nrapidly there.\n  That was a good and decent thing for the country to do. It made sense \nthat this bill passed. I am not disputing that. But I am telling you \nright now, as a representative of the people of the State of Alabama, \nhaving talked to the leadership that deals with AIDS in my State, they \nare really upset. They cannot imagine how it is possible that now my \nState and the entire Southern region is showing a faster increase in \nAIDS than any other region of the country--the South has the highest \nrate of increase of any region in the\n\n[[Page S10440]]\n\ncountry. I will show this chart. It is actually beginning to surge \nhere. It is a crisis in our State. Even this new bill, as Chairman Enzi \nsaid, still provides more money per patient for a big-city State than \nwe would get in Alabama, even though our AIDS rate increase is higher \nby far than the Northeast or other areas.\n  How can that be justified? I know the people of New York say that New \nYork City deserves more money to protect itself from terrorists because \nterrorists are more likely to attack New York. They complain about \nthis. But the truth is, they get a lot more money in New York for that \nprotection than the rest of the country gets. I think current \nlegislation will give them even more for it. Why? Because the terrorist \nthreat is more real. Well, the AIDS threat is real here; more real in \nAlabama. And it is falling on poor people and it is falling on the \nAfrican-American community and it is falling hardest on African-\nAmerican women.\n  Senator Burr said that, and that is an absolute fact. The numbers \nbear it out without any doubt whatsoever. I believe a fair proposal is \non the floor of the Senate. I believe if we had any pretense of passing \nlegislation that deals fairly and objectively with the deadly disease \nof AIDS, we need to pass this legislation. It is absolutely not right \nto continue this disproportionate shifting of revenue from States all \nover America to big cities that are getting almost twice as much in \nsome instances as the poorer States and the rural States. It is not \nright to continue that. We need to fix that.\n  The chairman didn't overreact. Maybe next time, if we can't get this \nbill passed, we ought to pass a bill that makes it completely level \nacross the board and not leave some of these States with a continued \nadvantage. They have had an advantage for years and years now. I \nsuggest that we need to work on that and work on it hard.\n  Let me point out again the yellow line which represents the increase \nin the South--far higher than the Northeast and the West. That is where \nthe big cities are that are getting the biggest amount of money per \npatient, not just more money total but more money per patient.\n  We have all read reports of abuses of those moneys and some of the \nworst things they are doing in some of those centers. Senator Coburn \nmentioned the great conferences they go to where they have rock \nconcerts and spend this money that they claim they do not have, I \nguess, to treat people who are sick.\n  Let's look at the next chart just to make one more point about what \nthis legislation that Chairman Enzi and the committee hammered out is \ntrying to do. There are 1.185 million Americans living with HIV/AIDS, \nand 250,000 of them do not know they are infected. One of the greatest \nthings we can do is to make sure that people who are infected with HIV/\nAIDS know it as soon as possible. Treatment will commence immediately. \nIt can mean years of extra life, years of extra healthy ability to live \na normal life if we diagnose them early.\n  This bill provides new moves toward early diagnosis, early detection, \nand early testing. It absolutely is the right thing to do.\n  I was in my home State talking to some of our AIDS people who work on \na daily basis. They told me about a lady who came in pregnant, and they \ndid a test on her. She was 7 months pregnant. She was positive for HIV. \nThat was a tragedy, of course. But that child, given the right \ntreatment, is almost certain to be born without AIDS because she was \ndiagnosed as having it before the child was born. Had she not been \ndiagnosed, there would have been a 50-50 chance that the child would \nhave been born with AIDS. What a tragedy which was averted in that \ninstance. They began to talk to her. They ended up talking to her \nboyfriend. He agreed to be tested. They found out that he was positive. \nHe didn't know that. Had he known that, he would never have infected \nthe lady. I am convinced of it. Most people are going to protect \nthemselves and their partners if they know they have AIDS.\n  There are a lot of reasons for early detection. One is that it will \nhelp reduce the spread of AIDS because most people would not want their \npartners to be infected. And it would allow them to get on medication \nat the earliest possible time. So we made some real progress in that \narea. It can save lives and money in the long run.\n\n  I salute the chairman. How the Senator has time to work all the bills \nhe is leading members on in the HELP committee, I do not know. It is a \ntremendous challenge and the Senator does it with good humor and \nconsistent efforts to do right thing.\n  The Senator is exactly right on this important issue. I thank the \nSenator for his leadership. We must pass this reform. We must have \nequity in distribution of the money. It absolutely needs to show a \nshift of resources to the most threatened area of our country--that is \nthe South, our poor, our African American community, and particularly, \nAfrican American women.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for his \nkind comments and even more so for his passion and understanding on \nthis issue. I thank the others who have spoken.\n  We had given those who are objecting to the Senate completing this \nbill an hour to state their case; no one showed up. We were pretty sure \nof that based on the fact they had one of the Members who is not \nrunning for office to be the one to object. They sent someone from a \nState that actually gains by having the bill completed. That tells \nsomething about how willing they are to defend the position they have \non this bill.\n  This bill is critical to people all over the United States. There are \nHIV/AIDS families in every single State asking Congress to pass this \nbill and to pass it immediately.\n  Thirteen States, on September 30, will have huge losses in revenue. \nWe are getting more calls, naturally.\n  This is not just a bill. This is not just policy. This is life and \ndeath to people across this country\n  We have heard people are on waiting lists that cannot get drugs \nbecause the money does not follow the person. The money goes to the \nStates that had the money before. This bill readjusts that so the \npeople who need the drugs get the drugs. It sounds like an American \nprinciple to me.\n  As I mentioned before, there are other bills we work on where we are \nchanging the formula. I have been very fortunate the people working \nwith those bills have said, yes, we have to be fair. We always \ntransition into these things. This is no exception. Three years of \nhold-harmless. That means they get the same amount of money whether \nthey deserve it or not for 3 years, while they count again to see if \nthey have more or less people affected.\n\n\n                          standards conversion\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I realize that Senator Enzi has been \nworking with Senator Kennedy and others to craft this underlying \nbipartisan, bicameral product. Already today, he has discussed how the \nbill will ensure more equitable treatment, target key resources, and \nsave lives through treatment. However, he has also mentioned that \nsomeone from California is holding up the bill, due to concerns about \nconverting their HIV system to standards created by the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention. I am curious about that, given that \nPennsylvania, like California, is also in the process of converting its \nsystem. How long have States under current law to change their system?\n  Mr. ENZI. The 2000 reauthorization stated that States need to have \nCDC accepted HIV data as early as 2005 but not later than 2007. \nTherefore, States have already had seven years to make this change.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. How many more years will California and Pennsylvania \nhave to make that change?\n  Mr. ENZI. Under the bipartisan, bicameral product, California and \nPennsylvania will have 4 more years to make the change. Thus, you both \nwill have had over a decade to convert your systems. However, in fiscal \nyear 2011, only CDC standards for HIV cases will be used for the \nfunding formula.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So, I understand that you have given States like my own \nPennsylvania more time to change their system, so that they don't have \nlosses just due to system issues when people still need care. What \nwould Pennsylvania and California lose if those States did not receive \nthe 4-year extension you are proposing?\n\n[[Page S10441]]\n\n  Mr. ENZI. According to a February 2006 report by the GAO, \nPennsylvania would lose $9 million and California would lose $18.5 \nmillion in 1 year. With this bill that allows those States to still \ncount the people that matter while the systems are transitioning, \nPennsylvania would instead gain $4.8 million and California would gain \n$15.4 million.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will CDC provide assistance to States that need to make \nthis change? How will the Federal Government assist?\n  Mr. ENZI. CDC has offered to provide assistance to States throughout \nthe process. In fact, I recently confirmed today that CDC has already \noffered California technical assistance--up to six staff for up to 6 \nmonths--to help them make this change. Further, given some confusion \nabout that technical assistance, I have asked CDC to send a letter to \nCalifornia, restating that they would provide that assistance.\n  Mr. President, Senator Hatch was the chairman of this committee when \nthe original Ryan White HIV/AIDS treatment bill went through. He is the \none that selected the name of Ryan White. He has an explanation of how \nthat came about and the differences this bill has made and the urgency \nwith which this needs to be done right now.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to support the effort to call up and \nimmediately adopt S. 2823, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment \nModernization Act.\n  Adoption of this legislation offers us the opportunity to make a \ndifference in the lives of the hundreds of thousands of people in the \nUnited States who are living with HIV/AIDS. We should not let this \nopportunity pass.\n  I am pleased to have joined HELP Committee Chairman Enzi and Ranking \nMinority Member Kennedy, Majority Leader Frist, and Senators DeWine and \nBurr in introducing this reauthorization bill.\n  As my colleagues are aware, I was the author of the original \nlegislation along with Senator Kennedy and we introduced the first bill \non this issue in the 101st Congress. The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS \nResources Emergency Act of 1990 was signed into public law on August \n18, 1990 and became--excluding Medicaid and Medicare--the United \nStates' largest Federally funded program for the care of those living \nwith HIV and AIDS. It was a lot of hard work. But it was a lot of hard \nwork for a very important cause.\n  Let us take a moment to remember one of the reasons why we did all \nthat hard work in the first place. His name was Ryan White. Ryan was \nborn in Kokomo, IN, in 1971. Three days after his birth, he was \ndiagnosed with severe hemophilia. Fortunately for Ryan and his parents, \nthere was a new blood-based product just approved by the Food and Drug \nAdministration called Factor VIII, which contains the clotting agent \nfound in blood.\n  While he was growing up, Ryan had many bleeds or hemorrhages in his \njoints which were very painful. A bleed occurs from a broken blood \nvessel or vein. Think of a water balloon. When the blood has nowhere to \ngo, it swells up in a joint and creates painful pressure. Twice a week, \nRyan would receive injections or IVs of Factor VIII, which clotted the \nblood and then broke it down.\n  In December of 1984, Ryan was battling severe pneumonia and had to \nhave surgery to have 2 inches of his left lung removed. Two hours after \nthe surgery, doctors told his mother that he had contracted AIDS as a \nresult of his biweekly treatment with Factor VIII. He was given 6 \nmonths to live.\n  Ryan White was a fighter. He was determined to continue at his school \nand live life normally. But in 1985, not many people knew the truth \nabout AIDS. Not very much was known about AIDS at all. Most of the so-\ncalled facts that people claimed to know were speculation. So Ryan \nfaced a lot of discrimination, mostly based on the unknown.\n  Ryan was soon expelled from his high school because of the supposed \nhealth risk to other students. His situation became one of the most \ncontroversial cases in North America, with AIDS activists lobbying to \nhave him reinstated while attempting to explain to the public that AIDS \ncannot be transmitted by casual contact.\n  After legal battles, Ryan and his mother settled with the school to \nhave separate restrooms and use disposable silverware from the \ncafeteria. He agreed to drink from separate water fountains and no \nlonger used the high school gymnasium.\n  But those concessions didn't stop much. Students vandalized his \nlocker. Some restaurants threw his dishes away after he left. A bullet \nwas even fired into his home.\n  Later, Ryan transferred to a different school where he was well-\nreceived by faculty and students who were fully educated into the \nnature of HIV. Ryan was a great student with an exceptional work ethic \nand perseverance. He was respected by his fellow students because of \nhis admirable traits. They understood he was a human being--just like \nthem, but living with a terrible disease.\n  Before he died on April 8, 1990, Ryan White worked to educate people \non the nature of HIV and AIDS, to show that it was not a lifestyle \ndisease and that, with a few precautions, it was safe to associate with \npeople who were HIV-positive. His character sought to overcome stigma. \nHe became an inspiration to patients and advocates throughout the \nUnited States and the rest of the world.\n\n  By the spring of 1990, over 128,000 people had been diagnosed with \nAIDS in the United States and 78,000 had died of the disease.\n  The Ryan White CARE Act was originally enacted in 1990 in response to \nthe need for HIV primary care and support services. At that time, the \nfocus of public policy was on research, public education, surveillance, \nand prevention. The CARE Act was the first approach developed to help \npeople with HIV and AIDS to obtain primary care and support services to \nsave and improve their lives. There is no doubt that the CARE Act has \nplayed a critical role in the Nation's response to the AIDS epidemic.\n  The CARE Act was reauthorized in 1996 and 2000 to address the fact \nthat the epidemic continued to spread and that primary care and support \nservices provided through the act were still vitally important to \npeople living with HIV and AIDS.\n  Today, more than 944,000 cases of AIDS have been reported to the \nCenters for Disease Control and prevention, the CDC. Nearly 530,000 \nmen, women, and children have died as the epidemic has spread over the \nlast 25 years to both new populations and new geographic areas.\n  The public health burden and the economic burden of the AIDS epidemic \nhave not been reduced since the CARE Act was passed. The continued need \nfor services grows faster than the resources available.\n  Steady expansion and shifted demographics of the epidemic and the \nincreasing survival rates for people living with AIDS have increased \nthe stress on local health care systems in some areas. This strain is \nfelt both in urban centers, where the epidemic continues to rage, and \nin smaller cities and rural areas, where the epidemic is expanding \nrapidly.\n  This reauthorization bill addresses those inequities and reevaluates \nfunding formulas so that money for the program follows the epidemic. It \nkeeps money for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program--known as ADAP--within \nADAP, and even grants States flexibility to transfer funds to ADAP when \nthey have demonstrated need. Currently, funds for the ADAP supplemental \npool are frequently dipped into for other purposes, resulting in \ninadequate funding and waiting lists. It also protects States and \neligible metropolitan areas from suffering catastrophic losses in \nfunding.\n  I know that it is never easy to revise a bill that contains funding \nformulas. No matter what changes we make, they will always raise issues \nand questions. But let us move beyond the narrow fight and work for the \ngreater good.\n  We have been talking a lot about numbers and codes and case counts \nand reporting data, but we need to remember that there are actual real \npeople being affected by this, real people who need our help. Hundreds \nof thousands of people continue to live affected with and die from this \ndisease, and we need to bring out all the tools within the Federal \narsenal to help fight for them.\n  As of December 31, 2005, the Utah Department of Health reported a \ntotal of 1,907 people living with HIV and AIDS\n\n[[Page S10442]]\n\nin the State of Utah. Many of these individuals rely on Title II \nfunding from the Ryan White Program to receive health care, vital \nmedications and support services.\n  These individuals are also counting on me to fight for their \ncontinued access to care and services that have such a big impact on \ntheir survival and quality of life. We in Congress are being counted on \nto work together on behalf of the nearly 1 million people living with \nHIV/AIDS in our country.\n  The last reauthorization period for the Ryan White Program expired in \n2005. It is incredibly important that we reauthorize the program again \nnow in order to continue providing the care that is so critical to \nthese populations and alleviate strain from shifts in the epidemic felt \nby health care providers.\n  There are real people counting on us. We need to move forward in \nreauthorizing the only Federal program that helps the neediest of \npeople living with this devastating disease. This bill extends the \navailability of vital services, and it includes changes that intend to \nfix discrepancies that have resulted in Ryan White funds not following \nthe epidemic.\n  This is a good bill and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. ENZI. I am very distressed. I have had a lot of success on other \nbills we are trying to get through. People have been willing to listen \nto reason and understand the urgency of a lot of the issues, \nparticularly in the health area, but also in the education, labor, and \npensions area.\n  As a committee, we work on these things across the aisle and across \nthe building. As a result, we have had 12 bills signed by the \nPresident. Of those 12 bills, we have only spent about 2 hours total in \nthe Senate debating them because we work across the aisle and across \nthe building. We work on important issues. We solve the parts we can \nand we bring them here. This is one of those where we thought we had \nthe parts solved that we could. There are a lot of moving parts to a \nlot of these things. We work to get as much consensus as we can, but \noccasionally we reach a sticking point like this.\n  I am really disappointed we have reached a sticking point like this \nwhere people are going to die. If, by tomorrow, we have not passed this \nbill and in case we go longer than tomorrow, I am going to ask the \nleader to file cloture on this bill so we can see if five Senators can \nhold up a Senate bill.\n  If we leave tomorrow or the next day, it won't ripen yet, but it can \nripen as soon as we can get back. We can spend the time debating it, \nand those States that are losing money on September 30, while they will \nnot be able to retrieve all the money they will lose, they will have \nsome breathing room for the future.\n  I am desperate. I usually do not have to do that sort of thing. I am \nwilling to do it on this bill. I am very distressed. Usually we are \nable to get agreement. We went a long ways toward giving concessions to \nthose States.\n  In all fairness, if you do not have the cases, you really should not \nhave the money tomorrow, let alone 3 more years. We have tried to be \nreasonable. We have tried to help out States. We have run a bunch of \nformulas to make it as fair as we possibly could and to protect the \nStates as much as we can, but it is time to be fair to the people with \nHIV/AIDS and to be fair to the families of people with HIV/AIDS.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a Washington Post article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 28, 2006]\n\n                 Lawmakers Argue Over AIDS Funding Bill\n\n                           (By Erica Werner)\n\n       Washington.--House members from rural areas and the South \n     clashed with big-city lawmakers Thursday over who should get \n     a bigger share of federal money to care for AIDS patients.\n       ``It's shameful and disgraceful,'' shouted Rep. Eliot \n     Engel, D-N.Y., denouncing amendments to the $2.1 billion Ryan \n     White CARE Act that could take millions of dollars out of New \n     York's health care coffers.\n       The HIV/AIDS epidemic is moving,'' countered Rep. Joe \n     Barton, R-Texas. ``This is a very fair compromise. It begins \n     to treat all states on an equal footing.''\n       The House was expected to vote on the bill later in the \n     evening. A two-thirds vote was needed for passage.\n       Even if it passes the House, the bill faces uncertain \n     prospects in the Senate before Congress recesses at the end \n     of the week to campaign for re-election. Senators from New \n     York, New Jersey and California are blocking it.\n       Supporters said the election-year updates were needed \n     because of how AIDS has changed since the Ryan White law \n     first passed in 1990. Once a big-city epidemic infecting \n     mostly gay white men, the disease is now prevalent in the \n     South and among minorities.\n       By some measures federal funding has not kept up, and \n     states like California, New York and New Jersey get more \n     money per patient than Alabama, Kentucky or North Carolina.\n       The Ryan White amendments, the first since 2000, make a \n     number of changes aiming to spread money more equally around \n     the country.\n       While current law only counts patients with full-blown \n     AIDS, the revision also would count patients with the HIV \n     virus who have not developed AIDS.\n       That change would favor parts of the country where the \n     disease is a newer phenomenon, which tend to be southern and \n     rural areas.\n       New York state stands to lose $100 million over the five \n     years of the bill. New Jersey would lose $70 million.\n       Alabama, by contrast, would get an increase from $11 \n     million a year to about $18 million a year.\n       ``The problem is that the population of those needing \n     services has grown, but the funding for Ryan White programs \n     has not grown with it,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif. \n     ``That means if we're going to give to some people who are \n     very deserving, we're going to take from others who are very \n     deserving.''\n       California and some other states are worried about a change \n     in the bill that mandates counting HIV patients by name \n     instead of codes. Some states used code-based systems out of \n     concern for patient privacy. California could lose an \n     estimated $50 million in the last year of the bill, when the \n     name-based system would take effect, because it won't be \n     prepared to make the transition.\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, the television, cable, and satellite \nindustries recently launched the ``Be the Boss of What Your Kids \nWatch'' campaign. This campaign, which is headed up by my good friend \nJack Valenti, educates parents about how to protect their children from \ninappropriate television programming.\n  When Senator Inouye and I first became co-chairmen of the Senate \nCommerce Committee, several groups and individuals approached us; they \nwere concerned about decency in media content. In November 2005, our \nCommittee began the process of bringing each of these groups together. \nWe convened an Open Forum on Decency and held hearings. In all, more \nthan 30 groups and individuals shared their concerns and insights with \nus.\n  The ``Be the Boss'' campaign is one noteworthy initiative which \ndeveloped from these efforts. Surveys show that only three percent of \nAmericans know how to use the V-chip, a feature in every television set \nwhich enables parents to block programs based on ratings. This $300 \nmillion ad campaign seeks to teach parents how to use this--and other--\nblocking technologies and will help them better monitor television \nprograms.\n  In July, Jack Valenti and Peggy Conlon, the president of the Ad \nCouncil, kicked off the ``Be the Boss'' campaign when they showed our \ncommittee their first two public service announcements. Thanks to these \nannouncements, and the campaign web site, www.thetvboss.org. parents \nnow have information about the V-chip, cable and satellite controls, \nand television ratings.\n  Earlier this week, kits containing information about this campaign \nwere delivered to every Member of Congress. I urge my colleagues to \nshare these valuable resources with their constituents, and I thank \nJack Valenti and his colleagues for their leadership on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/28/senate-section/article/S10443-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO SPECIAL AGENT JOHN BAILEY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to honor the life of Special Agent \nJohn Lawrence Bailey. More than 15 years ago, Special Agent Bailey gave \nhis life in the line of duty. Today, in a fitting memorial, law \nenforcement agents throughout Nevada enter the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation building in Las Vegas that bears his name.\n  John Bailey was an American success story. Born in 1942, he attended \nthe University of Pittsburgh on an athletic scholarship. Shortly after \nreceiving his degree, John enrolled in the United States Marine Corps. \nHe would answer his nation's call by joining thousands of young men who \nwent to Vietnam. There, John was awarded the Vietnam Campaign Medal, \nthe Vietnam Service Award, and a Bronze Star. After Vietnam, John \nentered Quantico and began his distinguished career with the FBI.\n  While John had numerous work accomplishments, those who knew him best \ncould say that he was most proud of his family. It is not easy being in \nFederal law enforcement, but his family was always supportive. Joined \nby his wife Beth and their two daughters, Amanda and Megan, the Baileys \ncame to Nevada in 1977.\n  On the morning of June 25, 1990, Special Agent Bailey found himself \nin the middle of an armed robbery in a bank. Instead of standing by in \nfear, John confronted the robbers and drew his weapon. The robbers \nquickly turned and Special Agent Bailey fired. The bullet missed one \nsuspect, but Agent Bailey was able to capture them and end the robbery. \nWhile securing the suspects, something distracted him. In that split \nsecond, a robber recovered his weapon and shot John. He died at the \nscene.\n  His heroism that day to save the lives of his fellow citizens was not \nout of the ordinary for those who knew John. As a 21 year veteran of \nthe FBI, John was a highly decorated agent. He was known throughout the \nNevada law enforcement community for his efforts to break up organized \ncrime in Las Vegas. His work even touched my life.\n  John Bailey was a good man and a friend. When I was the commissioner \nof the Nevada Gaming Control Board, I worked with John to clean up the \ngaming industry. It wasn't an easy task because organized crime had \ndeep roots in Las Vegas. Each day, I faced threats against my life and \nagainst my family. There were even attempts to bribe me. Special Agent \nBailey made the arrests on the gangsters who were after me. I will \nnever forget him.\n  For all these reasons, I was pleased that the FBI decided to name \ntheir building in Las Vegas after Special Agent Bailey. It is a fitting \ntribute for a fallen officer. Later this fall, the FBI will be moving \nto a new building in Las Vegas. It is important to the FBI--and to me \npersonally--that the new building at 1787 West Lake Mead Boulevard \ncontinue to carry the name of Special Agent John Bailey. Soon, I look \nforward to touring this new ``John Lawrence Bailey Memorial Building.''\n  I am pleased to have this opportunity to honor John before the \nSenate. With the dedication of the new FBI building. I am hopeful that \nfuture generations of law enforcement officers will be able to take a \nmoment to reflect on the life and accomplishments of this distinguished \nofficer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/28/senate-section/article/S10443-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NORTHEASTERN NEVADA HISTORICAL SOCIETY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the 50th anniversary of \nthe Northeastern Nevada Historical Society. This important event is a \ntestament to the hard work of many individuals across Nevada, and it is \nworthy of recognition today.\n  Since its founding in 1956, the Historical Society has grown from a \nmembership of 8 to include over 2,000 members this year. Throughout \nthis half century, the Historical Society has dedicated itself to the \npreservation of Nevada's heritage. Its collection of documents, \nartifacts, and art has become a valuable resource for genealogists, \nhistorians, Nevada residents, and visitors.\n  Today, almost any member of the public has access to the extensive \nresearch materials of the Northeastern Nevada Historical Society. Legal \ndocuments, personal papers, newspapers, maps, oral histories, family \nhistories, and municipal records combine with a library of more than \n2,200 books and 33,000 photographs to enhance the collection.\n  In 1968, the Northeastern Nevada Historical Society founded a museum \nin Elko. The Northeastern Nevada Museum houses the Historical Society's \ncollections and permanent displays as well as special exhibits. The \nmuseum has prospered through the years, adding exhibition space to \naccommodate an increasingly large collection and growing popularity \namong patrons. It is a source of pride for the entire Elko community.\n  The Historical Society's collections represent many different faces \nof Nevada. Exhibits on geology and natural history display the \nprehistory of Nevada. Another important exhibit is the treasure trove \nof artifacts from the Great Basin Indian tribes. History comes alive at \nthe museum through representations of the Pony Express, mining camps, \nthe California Trail, and the Basque and Chinese experience in the \nWest. The museum's collection extends into the 21st century to reflect \nthe well-preserved wilderness and contemporary art that define Nevada \ntoday.\n  The Historical Society has also reached out to the residents of \nnortheastern Nevada. They welcome school groups, sponsor speaker series \nand slide shows, and host local artists.

This past Monday, I took to this floor for the eighth \ntime to discuss global warming. My speech focused on the myths \nsurrounding global warming and how our national news media has \nembarrassed itself with a l00-year documented legacy of coverage on \nwhat turned out to be trendy climate science theories.\n  Over the last century, the media has flip-flopped between global \ncooling and warming scares. At the turn of the 20th century, the media \npeddled an upcoming ice age--and they said the world was coming to an \nend. Then in the 1930s, the alarm was raised about disaster from global \nwarming--and they said the world was coming to an end. Then in the \n1970s an alarm for another ice age was raised--and they said the world \nwas coming to an end. And now, today, we are back to fears of \ncatastrophic global warming--and again they are saying the world is \ncoming to an end.\n  Today I would like to share the fascinating events that have unfolded \nsince my floor speech on Monday.\n  This morning, CNN ran a segment criticizing my speech on global \nwarming and attempted to refute the scientific evidence I presented to \ncounter climate fears.\n  First off, CNN reporter Miles O'Brien inaccurately claimed I was \n``too busy'' to appear on his program this week to discuss my 50-minute \nfloor speech on global warming. But they were told I simply was not \navailable on Tuesday or Wednesday.\n  I did appear on another CNN program today--Thursday--which I hope \neveryone will watch. The segment airs tonight on CNN's Headline News at \n7 p.m. and repeats at 9 p.m. and midnight eastern.\n  Second, CNN's O'Brien falsely claimed that I was all ``alone on \nCapitol Hill'' when it comes to questioning global warming.\n  Mr. O'Brien is obviously not aware that the U.S. Senate has \noverwhelmingly rejected Kyoto-style carbon caps when it voted down the \nMcCain-Lieberman climate bill 60 to 28 last year--an even larger margin \nthan its rejection in 2003.\n  Third, CNN's O'Brien, claimed that my speech earlier contained errors \nregarding climate science. O'Brien said my claim that the Antarctic was \nactually cooling and gaining ice was incorrect. But both the journals \nScience and Nature have published studies recently finding--on \nbalance--Antarctica is both cooling and gaining ice.\n  CNN's O'Brien also criticized me for saying polar bears are thriving \nin the Arctic. But he ignored that the person I was quoting is \nintimately familiar with the health of polar bear populations. Let me \nrepeat what biologist Dr. Mitchell Taylor from the Arctic Government of \nNunavut, a territory of Canada, said recently: ``Of the 13 populations \nof polar bears in Canada, 11 are stable or increasing in number. They \nare not going extinct, or even appear to be affected at present.''\n  CNN's O'Brien also ignores the fact that in the Arctic, temperatures \nwere warmer in the 1930s than today.\n  O'Brien also claimed that the ``Hockey Stick'' temperature graph was \nsupported by most climate scientists despite the fact that the National \nAcademy of Sciences and many independent experts have made it clear \nthat the Hockey Stick's claim that the 1990s was the hottest decade of \nthe last 100 years was unsupportable.\n  So it seems my speech struck a nerve with the mainstream media. Their \nonly response was to cherry-pick the science in a failed attempt to \nrefute me.\n  It seems that it is business as usual for many of them. Sadly, it \nlooks like my challenge to the media to be objective and balanced has \nfallen on deaf ears.\n  Despite the traditional media's failed attempt to dismiss the science \nI presented to counter global warming alarmism, the American people \nbypassed the tired old traditional media by watching CSPAN or clicking \non the Drudge Report and reading the speech online.\n  From the flood of overwhelming positive feedback I received, I can \ntell you the American people responded enthusiastically to my message.\n  The central theme was not only one of thanks, but expressing \nfrustration with the major media outlets because they knew in their \nguts that what they have been hearing in the news was false and \nmisleading.\n  Here is a brief sampling:\n  Janet of Saugus, MA: ``Thank you Senator Inhofe. Finally someone with \nthe guts to stand up and call it what it is--a sham. I think you have \ntaken over Toby Keith's place as my favorite Oklahoman.''\n  Al of Clinton, CT: ``It's about time someone with a loud microphone \nspoke up on the global warming scam. You have courage--if only this \nmessage could get into the schools where kids are being brow-beaten \nwith the fear message almost daily.''\n\n  Kevin of Jacksonville, FL, writes: ``I'm so glad that we have leaders \nlike you who are willing to stand up against the onslaught of liberal \nmedia, Hollywood and the foolish elected officials on this topic. \nPlease keep up the fight.''\n  Steven of Phoenix, AZ, writes: ``As a scientist, I am extremely \npleased to see that there is at least one Member of Congress who \nrecognizes the global warming hysteria for what it is. I am extremely \nimpressed by the Senator's summary and wish he was running for \nPresident.''\n  Craig of Grand Rapids, MI, writes: ``As a meteorologist, I strongly \nagree with everything you said.''\n  My speech ignited an Internet firestorm; so much so, that my speech \nbecame the subject of a heated media controversy in New Zealand. \nHalfway across the globe, a top official from the New Zealand Climate \nScience Coalition challenging New Zealand's television station to \nbalance what he termed ``alarmist doomcasting'' and criticized them for \nfailing to report the views of scientists in their own country that I \ncited here in America.\n  As the controversy in New Zealand shows, global warming hysteria has \ncaptured more than just the American media.\n  I do have to give credit to one publication here in America, \nCongressional Quarterly, or CQ for short. On Tuesday, CQ's Toni Johnson \ntook the issues I raised seriously and followed up with phone calls to \nscientist-turned global warming pop star James Hansen's office. CQ \nwanted to ask Hansen about his partisan financial ties to the leftwing \nHeinz Foundation, whose money originated from the Heinz family ketchup \nfortune. But he was unavailable to respond to their questions, which is \nhighly unusual for a man who finds his way into the media on an almost \ndaily basis. Mr. Hansen is always available when he is peddling his \nincreasingly dire predictions of climate doom.\n  The reaction to my speech keeps coming in: Just this morning, the \nPittsburgh Tribune-Review newspaper wrote an editorial calling my \nspeech ``an unusual display of reason'' on the Senate floor.\n  I have been engaged in this debate for several years and believe \nthere is a growing backlash of Americans rejecting what they see as \nclimate scare tactics. And as a result, global warming alarmists are \nbecoming increasingly desperate.\n  Perhaps that explains why the very next day after I spoke on the \nfloor, ABC News's Bill Blakemore on ``Good Morning America'' \nprominently featured James Hansen touting future scary climate \nscenarios that could, might, possibly happen.\n\n[[Page S10445]]\n\n  The segment used all the well-worn tactics from the alarmist \nguidebook--warning of heat waves, wildfires, droughts, melting \nglaciers, mass extinctions unless mankind put itself on a starvation \nenergy diet and taxed emissions.\n  But that is no surprise--Blakemore was already on the record that \nthere was no scientific debate about manmade catastrophic global \nwarming.\n  You have to be a pretty poor investigator to believe that. Why would \n60 prominent scientists this last spring have written Canadian Prime \nMinister Harper that ``if, back in the mid-1990s, we knew what we know \ntoday about climate, Kyoto would almost certainly not exist, because we \nwould have concluded it was not necessary.''\n  I believe it is these kinds of stories which explain why the American \npublic is growing increasingly skeptical of the hype. Despite the \nenormous 2006 media campaign to instill fear into the public, the \nnumber of people who believe that weather naturally changes is \nincreasing.\n  A Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg poll in August found that most \nAmericans do not attribute the cause of recent severe weather events to \nglobal warming, and the portion of Americans who believe that climate \nchange is due to natural variability has increased over 50 percent in \nthe last 5 years. And that, my fellow Senators, is why the Hollywood \nelitists and the rest of the liberal climate alarmists are starting to \npanic.\n  I hope my other colleagues will join me on the floor and start \nspeaking out to debunk hysteria surrounding global warming. This issue \nis too important to our generation and future generations to allow \ndistortions and media propaganda to derail the economic health of our \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/28/senate-section/article/S10445-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10445-S10446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WASTEWATER TREATMENT WORKS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to discuss the urgent need \nfor this legislation. The Nation's wastewater treatment works--POTWs--\nprovide a vital service to our Nation. They ensure that municipal and \nindustrial waste is cleaned to a level safe enough to be released back \ninto the Nation's waterways.\n  After the tragic events of September 11, 2001, much more focus was \nplaced on the Nation's water and wastewater facilities. POTWs not only \nrelease treated effluent into the Nation's waters but also consist of \nmiles of pipes that run underground and are often large enough for \nsomeone to stand in. They are literally underground roadways.\n  In the 107th Congress, the House of Representatives passed by voice \nvote legislation--H.R. 5169--to provide POTWs with the resources they \nneeded to conduct vulnerability assessments and secure their \nfacilities. The bill, H.R. 866, was again introduced in the 108th \nCongress and passed by a vote of 413-2, with every Democrat who voted \nsupporting the bill. I was pleased to introduce the companion to this \nlegislation, S. 1039 with my colleague and then subcommittee Chairman, \nMike Crapo. Last year, despite reporting the bill on a bipartisan vote \nof 13 to 6, members of the Senate minority objected to Senate \nconsideration of S. 1039.\n  S. 2781 is a variation of S. 1039 with some important improvements, \nlike the addition of site security plans and a more streamlined \ngrantmaking progress. Senator Lincoln Chafee, chairman of the \nFisheries, Wildlife and Water Subcommittee and Senator Lisa Murkowski, \na distinguished member of the EPW Committee joined me in sponsoring S. \n2781.\n  Our bill passed the EPW Committee on a voice vote. Unfortunately, \nonce again, my colleague from Vermont has objected to consideration of \nwastewater security legislation by the full Senate.\n  My colleagues in the minority argue that my bill is insufficient \nbecause it does not impose on POTW's unfunded federal mandates and \nbecause it does not assume that local officials are ignoring the \nsecurity of their facilities.\n  POTWs are arms of local government. They are largely owned and \noperated by the Nation's cities and towns. In 1995 Congress passed the \nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act in which we pledged not to impose costly \nregulatory burdens on our partners in local government. Just as it is \nour obligation as U.S. Senators to serve the public good, preserve the \npublic trust and protect the citizenry, so it is the obligation of \nlocally elected, appointed and employed officials.\n  Why do so many of my colleagues assume that we at the Federal level \ncare more about the citizens of the Nation's towns than the locally \nelected officials do? Why do so many of them assume that they know more \nabout how to evacuate citizens, secure local treatment plants and \nprotect local citizens than the very people who live in those towns \nwhose jobs it is to protect them?\n  S. 2781 would simply provide towns with resources to conduct \nvulnerability assessments and to secure their facilities. It provides \nfunds to research the means to secure the collection systems that are \nmade up of the miles of underground pipes. There are logistical and \nfinancial problems with trying to secure these systems that need to be \naddressed, particularly before imposing an unfunded Federal mandate on \nthe Nation's towns. My bill would support the already ongoing \nactivities of many of the national wastewater associations and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, to develop assessment tools and \nindustry security standards as well as conduct security trainings. The \nnational water associations make up the Security Coordinating Council \nand regularly meet with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Agency \ncharged with overseeing security at POTWs. The SCC and EPA are \ndeveloping a sector security plan to, among other things, establish \nmeasures of security improvements.\n  My colleagues will argue that this is not enough. Local governments \ncannot be trusted to proceed on their own with a little Federal \nguidance because to date, they really have not done anything to secure \ntheir facilities. However, one need look no further than a March 2006 \nGAO report to see how much in fact they are doing. According to GAO, 74 \npercent of the largest 206 treatment works had completed or were in the \nprocess of completing a vulnerability assessment. Further, the majority \nof treatment works had made significant improvements to the physical \nsecurity of their facility. They did so after careful review of their \nindividual communities' needs. Most importantly, they have done so out \nof concern for their citizens, not in response to a Federal mandate.\n  My colleagues will also turn this discussion not into one about \nsecurity but one about chlorine. Chlorine is by far the most effective \ndisinfectant available and it is the least expensive. During these \ntimes of aging systems, growing Federal regulations and limited \nresources, cost is an important consideration. Washington, DC's \ntreatment works, Blue Plains, spent $12.5 million to change \ntechnologies. San Jose, CA, spent $5 million to switch from gaseous \nchlorine to sodium hypochlorite. The city of Wilmington, DE, spent \n$160,000 to switch. However, there is much more to their story than \nthat cost figure. Wilmington already had in place a sodium hypochlorite \nsystem that was serving as backup to its gaseous chlorine system. \nFurther, Wilmington will spend hundreds of thousands of dollars more \neach year in operations and maintenance costs.\n  There are other considerations that must be factored in as well, such \nas downstream effects of a chlorine alternative. For example, the \nswitch from chlorine to chloramines in Washington, DC's drinking water \nsystem was found to cause lead to leach out of service pipes and into \nthe faucets of homes and businesses. Thus, decisions about chlorine \nmust be fully evaluated and must be site-specific. Many POTWs are \nalready undergoing these evaluations. After careful review of cost, \ntechnical feasibility and safety considerations, and without the \npresence of a Federal mandate on technology, 116 of the 206 largest \nPOTWs do not use gaseous chlorine: According to the GAO report, another \n20 plan to switch to a technology other than chlorine. To sum, nearly \ntwo-thirds of the Nation's largest POTWs are not using or will soon \nstop using chlorine. Those who continue to use chlorine have taken \nsteps to ensure the chlorine is secure. My bill would provide POTWs who \ndecide for themselves to switch treatment technologies with grant money \nto make the switch. However, my bill maintains trust in local officials \nwho know best their water, the community and their security needs.\n\n[[Page S10446]]\n\n  Let me be clear. This is an important security bill and I regret that \nfor the second Congress in a row my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle are obstructing it. Members of the minority have criticized the \nchemical security legislation for not covering these facilities. This \nlegislation has basically passed the House of Representatives twice. \nThe minority party in the Senate is blocking this important security \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/28/senate-section/article/S10446-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO CONGRESSMAN JOEL T. BROYHILL\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding Virginian, and dear friend, the former 10th District \nCongressman, Joel T. Broyhill, who died this past weekend.\n  Congressman Broyhill was an outstanding public servant. He had a \ncertain ``joie de vivre'' that one does not often find--his presence, \nhis spirit would fill up a whole room. His sense of civic \nresponsibility--both through his service in the U.S. Army and as the \nRepresentative to Congress from Virginia's 10th District--was second to \nnone. And his devotion to his three daughters, stepdaughter, \ngrandchildren, and great-grandchildren was unmatched; they were the \njoys of his life.\n  A native of Hopewell, VA, Congressman Broyhill was born on November \n14, 1919. He attended Fork Union Military Academy and George Washington \nUniversity.\n  In 1942, he enlisted in the Army. He served as an officer in the \nEuropean Theater in the 106th Infantry Division and was taken prisoner \nin the Battle of the Bulge. After 6 months in German prison camps, he \nescaped and rejoined the advancing American forces. On November 1, \n1945, after 4 years of service, Congressman Broyhill was released from \nactive duty as a captain.\n  In 1952, at the age of 33, Broyhill was elected as a Republican from \nVirginia's newly created 10th District to the 83d Congress, by 322 \nvotes. Congressman Broyhill was reelected 10 times, serving 21 years in \nCongress, until December 1974.\n  Congressman Broyhill's prime source of political success was his \ndedication to constituent service. At the time of Congressman \nBroyhill's tenure in Congress, the 10th District contained more Federal \nemployees than any other district in the United States. In 1972, \nCongressman Broyhill estimated that he had aided more than 100,000 \ndistrict residents during his 20-plus years in office.\n  According to the 1974 Almanac of American Politics:\n\n       [t]here are few congressional offices in which the demand \n     for services is so high, given the number of Federal \n     employees in Broyhill's district; and there are few indeed \n     that take care of constituents' needs and complaints with \n     more efficiency.\n\n  The 10th District of Virginia was shaped and forever changed by \nCongressman Broyhill's initiatives in Congress. He laid the foundation \nfor major transportation projects, including the construction of \nInterstate 66, the Metrorail System, the Woodrow Wilson Bridge, and \nWashington Dulles International Airport.\n  The Almanac also describes Congressman Broyhill as one who ``should \nbe credited with voting his conscience.''\n  Even after he left Congress, Congressman Broyhill continued serving \nconstituents by maintaining an office to assist those with problems \nrelating to the federal government. In fact, my Senate office would \nreceive a call about once a month from the ``Broyhill Office'' asking \nus to follow up on a constituent inquiry.\n  In 1978, I was honored and proud to have my longtime friend come out \nof retirement to serve as General Chairman of my U.S. Senate campaign. \nIt was great to see him back on the political stage in Virginia. \nCongressman Broyhill's knowledge of the Commonwealth and of campaign \nstrategy were invaluable to me as he introduced a most interesting \ncouple to the political scene. Congressman Broyhill helped me to \nconvince my wife at the time, Elizabeth Taylor, that being a \ncandidate's spouse was the best role she could play. Many times he \naccompanied Elizabeth to campaign events when I was unable to attend. \nHe was an exemplary ambassador for my 1978 campaign.\n  Congressman Broyhill's ``house by the side of the road'' in Arlington \nwas never without yard signs during any election. As one of the first \nRepublicans elected in Virginia, he was a trailblazer and he helped \nevery Republican member of the Virginia congressional delegation--\nincluding its two current U.S. Senators--to be elected under the \nRepublican banner.\n  Congressman Broyhill was instrumental in building his father's real \nestate business, M.T. Broyhill & Sons. The company was started in \nHopewell, and the family later relocated to northern Virginia when \nCongressman Broyhill was growing up.\n  Congressman Broyhill and his wife Suzy were stalwarts of charitable \ngiving and have given both their time and resources to many \norganizations across the Commonwealth, and notably, to the Wolf Trap \nFoundation for the Performing Arts.\n  It is with a great sense of humility that we pay tribute today to the \nlife of our dear friend and dedicated public servant, Congressman Joel \nT. Broyhill. We offer our condolences to his three daughters, Nancy, \nJeanne and Jane Anne, his stepdaughter, Kimi, and his wife of 25 years, \nSuzy. He also has four grandchildren: Meredith, Maureen, Lindsay, and \nKathleen, and three great-grandchildren: Molly, Jack, and Kara.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/28/senate-section/article/S10446-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10446-S10447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                THAILAND\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I remain deeply troubled by the military \ncoup that occurred in Thailand on September 19. The forceful removal of \nThai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was an assault on the democratic \ninstitutions of that country and is a dangerous development for a key \nally in an increasingly important region. Now, almost 2 weeks after the \ncoup, it is apparent that the coup leaders had only a tentative plan \nfor transitioning back to democratic rule and that their rhetoric about \nrestoring democracy to Thailand may not be as sincere as some had \nhoped. As the military junta fumbles through its next steps, it is \ncritical that the United States show strong leadership in helping this \ncritical ally reinstitute a civilian democratic government and that it \ndo so immediately.\n  Mr. President, this coup is particularly troubling because it is a \nstep backward from almost a decade of relatively positive democratic \ndevelopments. During Thailand's last coup in February 1991, the \nmilitary overthrew Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan and a bloody \npower transfer followed, culminating in what Thais call ``Black May.'' \nThose events kicked off a national dialogue that resulted in the \nestablishment of a new constitution in 1997 that restored authority to \ncivilian democratic institutions, ultimately ushering in democratic \nelections in 2001 and 2005. Thaksin's party, Thai Rak Thai--``Thais \nlove Thai''--won both of those elections in landslide victories.\n  This recent coup rolls back these developments. There is no doubt \nthat Thailand was suffering from extreme political divisiveness during \nThaksin's tenure. When I met with him in Bangkok earlier this year, he \nwas in the throes of a political battle against a growing opposition \nmovement. He was also under fire for mishandling the insurgency in \nThailand's three southern-most provinces in which 1,700 people have \nbeen killed since January 2004. It was evident that his ability to \neffectively manage the Thai Government had been diminished.\n  But this hardly provides justification for a military junta to \noverthrow a popularly elected government and to discard the nation's \nconstitution. This new military junta, led by General Sonthi \nBoonyaratglin, and awkwardly self-titled the ``Council for Democratic \nReform Under Constitutional Monarchy'', is deeply troubling.\n  This coup is a significant setback for Thailand's democracy. While \nthe coup occurred in a matter of hours, it may take years before a new \ncivilian and democratic government restores full authority and \nlegitimacy in Bangkok. Unfortunately, this new military council has \nbanned political gatherings and has put some restrictions on the media. \nIt has disseminated a wide range of other decrees and rules, many of \nwhich have troubling consequences for freedom of expression and the \ndemocratic process. Given these early signs, we have no reason to \nbelieve that this council will be any different in nature\n\n[[Page S10447]]\n\nthan previous military juntas. Additionally, this coup could have \nnegative consequences for Thailand's simmering human rights problems \nand the insurgency in the south. The coup leaders have already stated \nthat they will focus on quelling a separatist insurgency in southern \nThailand. This is worrisome if the military council relies on a \nstrictly military approach to the unrest.\n  The coup is also bad for the region. Events in Thailand are sending \nthe wrong message to democracies throughout the region that are dealing \nwith legacies of military coups. Secretary Rice has dismissed the \nnotion that this could have a contagion effect throughout the region. \nWhile I hope this is true, we should not ignore the fact that a number \nof countries in Southeast Asia are still dealing with the legacies of \nmilitary dictatorships. Indonesia is recovering from years of \ndictatorial military rule, and the Republic of the Philippines is still \nworking to strengthen its democratic institutions and repair its recent \nhistory of military intervention. The coup is also, significantly, \ngoing to have a direct impact on Thailand's ability to serve as a \nbroker between Burma and the rest of the world.\n  Finally, it will have an impact on U.S. interests in the region. \nThailand is a critical strategic partner of the United States, and some \nmay be tempted to maintain warm relations with the Thai military. Our \nclose political and military relationship goes back decades and is a \nvital component of U.S. national security policies in the region. But \nthis friendship must take into consideration the dangerous behavior of \nthose who led this coup. We must resist the temptation to give the \nleaders of this coup a free pass. Instead, we must take strong action.\n  We need to signal a real sense of urgency to restoring legitimacy to \nthe democratic institutions within Thailand. It is imperative that the \nThai military restore the authority of democratic institutions in \nThailand expeditiously. President Bush needs to weigh in decisively. \nThe U.S. Government must signal that it will not accept this new \ninterim authority as the status quo and that the Thais must take \nimmediate actions to restore democracy to Thailand. There are four \nspecific things that must occur.\n  First, the United States must pressure the military council to \nschedule national elections immediately. General Sonthi has promised \nelections by October 2007. This is insufficient. Elections should be \nheld at the earliest possible date, understanding the logistical \nrequirements involved in preparing to hold a national election. This is \nessential and is the only way the military council can prove that it \ndoes intend to reintroduce democracy to Thailand.\n  Second, the administration must immediately put into place sanctions \nthat are required under U.S. law. This means cutting off military \nassistance now. As we learned in Indonesia, this in itself will send a \npowerful message to the Thai military that usurping democracy does not \npay. The administration would do itself a favor by making the \nconditions for reinstituting military-to-military relations clear from \nthe outset. Still, this must be a clean break and must be leveraged in \nthe future to help restore democracy.\n  Third, the United States must work vigorously with other key players \nin the region to create a united front of disapproval for the coup. The \nUnited States can't be alone in its criticisms or in applying pressure \non the Thai junta. Secretary Rice's use of the phrase ``U-Turn'' \ndoesn't cut it. We need a strong message that recognizes the grave \nnature of these developments. ASEAN members, in particular, have a \nstrong role to play. Thailand's neighbors and regional partners must \nspeak out about this coup in strong ways and must use their economic, \npolitical, and social leverage to help reinstall democracy in Thailand.\n  Finally, and until national elections can be carried out, the \nmilitary council must lift all restrictions on democratic parties, the \npress, and political leaders. This includes Thaksin supporters. Those \nwho broke the law under the Thaksin Government should be held \naccountable in the courts of law, not a military junta. Political \nopposition parties must be allowed to convene, and press freedoms must \nbe established.\n  Mr. President, I close by reiterating the concern I laid out at the \nbeginning of this statement. The military's end-run of the country's \ndemocratic institutions will undermine Thailand's important role \nthroughout the region and the world and will therefore harm our own \ncountry's national security interests in the region. Thailand is a \ncritical partner in the region and in the broader fight against \nterrorist networks. We need a strong, democratic Thailand to serve as \nour partner. We can't do this if this new military dictatorship derails \na democratic government. The United States and international community \nmust urge the Thai military to take the necessary action to restore \nThailand's democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/28/senate-section/article/S10447-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NUCLEAR MEDICINE WEEK\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise again this year to remind my \ncolleagues that October 1 to 7 is Nuclear Medicine Week. Nuclear \nMedicine Week is the first week in October every year and is an annual \ncelebration initiated by the Society of Nuclear Medicine. Each year, \nNuclear Medicine Week is celebrated internationally at hospitals, \nclinics, imaging centers, educational institutions, corporations, and \nmore.\n  I am particularly proud to note that the Society of Nuclear Medicine \nis headquartered in Reston, VA. The Society of Nuclear Medicine is an \ninternational scientific and professional organization of more than \n16,000 members dedicated to promoting the science, technology, and \npractical applications of nuclear medicine. I commend the society staff \nand its professional members for their outstanding work in the field of \nnuclear medicine and for their dedication to caring for people with \ncancer and other serious and life-threatening illnesses.\n  Some of the more frequently performed nuclear medicine procedures \ninclude bone scans to examine orthopedic injuries, fractures, tumors or \nunexplained bone pain; heart scans to identify normal or abnormal blood \nflow to the heart muscle, to measure heart function or to determine the \nexistence or extent of damage to the heart muscle after a heart attack; \nbreast scans that are used in conjunction with mammograms to detect and \nlocate cancerous tissue in the breasts; liver and gallbladder scans to \nevaluate liver and gallbladder function; cancer imaging to detect \ntumors; treatment of thyroid diseases and certain types of cancer; \nbrain imaging to investigate problems within the brain itself or in \nblood circulation to the brain; and renal imaging in children to \nexamine kidney function.\n  I thank all of those who serve in this very important medical field \nand join them in celebrating Nuclear Medicine Week during the first \nweek of October.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/28/senate-section/article/S10447-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10447-S10448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PARK B. SMITH\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the exceptional \ngenerosity and work of Park B. Smith and his wife, Linda Johnson Smith.\n  Park and I met through our mutual involvement in The Marine Corps--\nLaw Enforcement Foundation, an organization that believes in and \nsupports the potential of our youth. They provide scholarship bonds for \nchildren of active-duty Marines and Federal law enforcement personnel \nkilled in the line of duty. Park has become a good friend and someone \nwhom I admire.\n  Park, an alumnus of the College of the Holy Cross, and Linda have a \nstrong belief in the value of education and have exemplified this \ndedication. Through their generosity, the College of the Holy Cross has \nbeen able to continue to grow and build its community. It is for this \nreason that I would like to ask unanimous consent to have an article \nabout Park and Linda Smith from The Wall Street Journal printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the Wall Street Journal, Friday, Sept. 15, 2006]\n\n               Giving Back--Donor To Turn Wine Into Bread\n\n                            (By Kelly Crow)\n\n       Park B. Smith has written his share of million-dollar \n     checks to benefit his alma mater. Now, he has decided to \n     donate by turning over part of his prized wine collection to \n     a major auctioneer.\n\n[[Page S10448]]\n\n       On Nov. 18, Sotheby's in New York will auction the \n     equivalent of 14,000 bottles from Mr. Smith's private \n     collection--including 50 cases of coveted 1982 Mouton \n     Rothschild--in a sale estimated to bring in up to $4.8 \n     million. His proceeds will go to build new athletic \n     facilities at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, \n     Mass. He's also planning a $25,000-a-plate dinner at his New \n     York restaurant, Veritas, to benefit Holy Cross.\n       The Sotheby's auction represents a rare mix of beneficence \n     and big auctioneer. In a more typical charity wine auction, \n     nonprofits enlist local auctioneers to sell bottles donated \n     by wineries or collectors. This season brings a range of such \n     events: In Chicago, Hart Davis Hart Wine Co. is holding a \n     Sept. 28 auction at Tru restaurant ($1,500 a plate) to help \n     children with spina bifida. In Harrisburg, Pa., 600 people \n     will bid to benefit the Whitaker Center for Science and the \n     Arts. In California, Napa Valley winemaker John Schwartz, of \n     Amuse Bouche, says he gets 25 letters a week from charities \n     requesting wine. Mr. Schwartz is organizing his own Oct. 27 \n     wine auction, in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, to benefit a Cambodian \n     orphanage.\n       Mr. Smith, known in the home-furnishings industry for his \n     namesake line of draperies and bedspreads, says he hopes to \n     capitalize on the marketing muscle of Sotheby's to reach top \n     connoisseurs. He also moved the auction date up a year to \n     take advantage of the strong wine and art market. Mr. Smith \n     is betting a high-profile sale will bring high prices, but by \n     going with a big auctioneer he is also subject to its \n     seller's commission rates (20 percent is standard, though \n     Sotheby's says it will charge less because it's for a good \n     cause). And he'll have to pay higher capital-gains taxes, as \n     much as 28 percent, because the wine will be sold rather than \n     given outright.\n       Mr. Smith started drinking wine while serving in the \n     Marines (an early favorite was 89-cent bottles of Beaujolais) \n     and has since gained a reputation for collecting top wines. \n     One reason he isn't donating cash: His 65,000-bottle \n     Connecticut cellar is at capacity. ``I'm raising money for \n     Holy Cross but I'm also making more room,'' he says.\n       Mr. Smith, a 1954 graduate and trustee of the Jesuit \n     liberal-arts college, has given the school $20 million over \n     the years. Now he wants to fix its ``disgraceful'' field \n     house. Father Michael McFarland, college president, says he's \n     awed by Mr. Smith's generosity--and relieved he can accept \n     auction proceeds rather than thousands of bottles: ``We don't \n     even have a wine cellar--just a couple cases stuffed under a \n     sink.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/28/senate-section/article/S10448-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, in early August, I was unable to be in \nWashington for the cloture vote on the so-called trifecta bill, which \nso insidiously tried to hold hostage a necessary increase in the \nminimum wage and necessary extensions of tax credits important to \nAmerican families and business to an excessive and unjustifiable \nreduction in the estate tax paid by the richest families in our \ncountry. I want to make clear that I would not have voted to allow this \nbill to proceed and that my inability to cast a vote in no way undercut \nthe effort to stop this outrageous legislation. Since it was necessary \nfor proponents of the legislation to find 60 votes irrespective of the \nnumber of votes against cloture cast by those of us in opposition, the \nvery act of not voting for the cloture motion was, in effect, a vote \nagainst the motion.\n  At the time of the vote, I issued a press statement expressing my \ndisappointment over the Senate's failure to enact a minimum wage hike \nand my dismay at the Republican proponents' tactic of linking the wage \nhike to an estate tax giveaway that would have increased an already \nout-of-control Federal budget deficit. In that statement, I rejected \nthe Republicans proponents' hollow claim to favor a minimum wage \nincrease. In fact, they have actively opposed a minimum wage increase \nfor years; in this trifecta bill, they were using the wage hike only as \na cynical ploy to attract votes for the estate tax rollback.\n  In my statement, I noted that the failure of the trifecta bill, \nthough a victory for fiscal sanity, was no cause for rejoicing. An \ninappropriately low national minimum wage has been a big part of the \nproblem of working-family poverty for many years. It is a problem for \nworkers in Connecticut where the State minimum wage is higher, since a \nlow national minimum wage creates pressure for companies to move \nConnecticut jobs to low wage States. The minimum wage was last raised \nalmost 10 years ago. We need to act this year to pass a minimum wage \nincrease--without tying it to an excessive cut in the estate tax. It is \nalso essential that we pass the tax ``extenders'' which will support \nfamilies paying college tuition, promote work opportunities for low- \nincome Americans, and give incentives to businesses pursuing important \nresearch and development. These and other important tax extenders were \nalso taken hostage by the Republicans' irresponsible estate tax scheme.\n  I have cosponsored a separate bill that would raise the minimum wage \nand extend these important tax incentives for middle-class families and \nbusinesses. I will continue to work with my colleagues to accomplish \nthese goals without paying the high cost of excessive estate tax cuts \nto the wealthiest sliver of the population.\n  Mr. President, I also wish to express my support for the pension \nreform legislation which passed the Senate on August 2. Had I been \npresent, I would have voted in favor of the conference report.\n  While we all recognize that the legislation that passed was not \nperfect, it marked the end of a long and difficult legislative process \nthat necessarily involved a great deal of compromise on all sides. It \nrepresents a success in terms of bipartisan cooperation in the Senate, \nsomething we need to see much more of in the future so we can truly \nbegin to address many of the serious and complex problems our nation \nfaces.\n  Senate passage of the pension reform bill was the culmination of more \nthan a year of work by lawmakers concerned about record unfunded \nliabilities at the PBGC--which is supposed to be the bulwark against \npension collapse--as well as what had become a widespread epidemic of \nchronic underfunding of pension plans.\n  The legislation as passed by the House and Senate, and now signed by \nthe President, would require companies to fund 100 percent of their \nplan liabilities, up from 90 percent under current law. Those with \nfunding shortfalls generally would have 7 years to make up the \ndifference. Companies at risk of default would be subject to other \nrestrictions and would have to make accelerated contributions.\n  The legislation provides specific relief for financially troubled \nairlines, giving up to 17 years to fully fund their plans. Some \nairlines were given more relief than others, so there may be an effort \nto pass a technical corrections bill to address this issue.\n  Also included in the legislation are provisions aimed at encouraging \nworkers to make contributions to retirement savings plans, including \nallowing companies to automatically enroll employees in a 401(k). This \nwill accomplish a relatively simple but tremendously effective change \nto ensure that more Americans are saving for their retirement\n  The legislation also contains many other improvements and protections \nto the necessarily complex system we have constructed to address the \nretirement security of tens of millions of our citizens. The bill would \nprovide needed reforms to both single employer and multiemployer plans; \nto defined benefit as well as defined contribution plans; and to hybrid \n``cash balance'' plans. It also provides greater security to spouses \nwith respect to their share of a spouse's retirement plan after death \nor divorce.\n  Further, the bill includes tax incentives for charitable giving. Many \nof these incentives were in the CARE Act which I have sponsored in this \nas well as previous congresses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/28/senate-section/article/S10448-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10448-S10449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO JUDGE GLEN MORGAN WILLIAMS\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a wonderful \ngentleman and a respected judge who has served our country with \ndistinction and also helped start my legal career, which has ultimately \nled to where I stand today: Judge Glen Morgan Williams.\n  As a newly minted graduate fresh out of the University of Virginia \nLaw School, I had the honor of serving as a clerk to Judge Williams, an \nexperience that had a profound affect on me. I was privileged to see \nfirst hand how Judge Williams' legal knowledge and fairness--as a judge \non the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia--has \nserved the people of Virginia and America. I also had the unique \nprivilege of hearing his stories of life, his commonsense wisdom and \nspecial humor and laughs.\n  Prior to serving as a Federal judge, Glen Williams served with \ndistinction in the U.S. Navy during World War II.\n\n[[Page S10449]]\n\nJudge Williams served as a minesweeper in the Atlantic, Pacific and \nMediterranean theaters and was decorated for his service with the \nCommander's Citation. Judge Williams participated in the invasion of \nSouthern France and thereafter commanded the USS Seer in the Pacific \nuntil 1946.\n  Upon returning from the war, Judge Williams entered private law \npractice where he quickly became one of the leading trial lawyers in \nVirginia and one of the Nation's leading experts on Social Security, \nwhere he testified before Congress on Social Security reform.\n  Judge Williams began his tenure on the U.S. District Court for the \nWestern District of Virginia, serving as a magistrate from 1963 to \n1975.\n  On September 8, 1976, Judge Williams was nominated by President \nGerald R. Ford to serve as a judge on that distinguished court and \nultimately won Senate confirmation on September 17, 1976.\n  During his time on the court, Judge Williams has been instrumental in \nreestablishing the Big Stone Gap division of the court and the opening \nof the clerk's office down there in the far southwest part of Virginia.\n  During his 30 years of service on the bench, Judge Williams has \nwritten more than 300 published opinions in every area of Federal law. \nJudge Williams' opinions have been particularly influential in the coal \nmining industry weighing the rights of coal miners, operators and \nlandowners and interpreting the constitutionality of the Surface Mining \nControl and Reclamation Act.\n  Judge Williams' 30 years of service have been instrumental in shaping \njurisprudence in the Western District of Virginia and has been an \nadmired, outstanding and loved mentor for scores of Virginia lawyers \nwho have had the privilege of learning from his experience. Besides \nmyself, former clerks also include a member of the Virginia Supreme \nCourt and many of the best lawyers in Virginia and throughout the \ncountry.\n  I have the ability to speak today about this magnificent wonderful \ngentleman, lawyer and judge who has been so positively influential in \nmy life and career. On behalf of all his clerks and staff throughout \nthe years, I thank Judge Williams for his 30 years of exemplary service \nto our country on the Federal bench.\n  Moreover, I thank God for sending into our world and my life a \ncharacter of a man with truly unmatched wit and wisdom, the truly \nhonorable Glen M. Williams of Lee County, VA.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is my privilege today to speak in honor \nof a longtime servant to the Federal judiciary, the Honorable Glen \nMorgan Williams, U.S. District Judge for the Western District of \nVirginia.\n  I have been in the Senate now for 28 years. During that time, I have \nparticipated in the Senate's advice and consent process more than 2,000 \ntimes with respect to Federal judges. In fact, of all active Federal \njudges on the district court bench in Virginia, I have had the distinct \nprivilege of voting for every single one.\n  There are two judges whose chambers exist in Abingdon, VA, whose \nservice predates mine: Judge H. Emory Widener, Jr., and Judge Glen \nMorgan Williams. Judge Widener was confirmed to the district court in \n1969, and then to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in \n1972. Judge Williams received his first judicial appointment, that of \nMagistrate Judge for the U.S. District Court for the Western District \nof Virginia, in 1963. Following 12 years as a magistrate, Judge \nWilliams was nominated to be a district court judge by President Gerald \nR. Ford in 1976, and he was confirmed for this position by the Senate \non September 17, 1976. Both judges are distinguished fixtures in the \nVirginia legal community, admired and respected by all who are \nfortunate enough to know them.\n  Because this year marks the thirtieth year that Judge Williams has \nserved as a Federal district judge in the Western District, I join with \nmy colleague from Virginia, Senator George Allen, in commending this \nexceptional jurist for his efforts.\n  As a young man, Glen Williams answered his Nation's call to duty in \nWorld War II. Earning a commander's citation, Mr. Williams served with \ndistinction in the U.S. Navy from 1942 to 1946. Remarkably, his \nexperience included the Atlantic, Pacific, and Mediterranean theaters \nand the Allies' invasion of southern France.\n  Mr. Williams and I followed similar paths to our respective careers \nafter our naval tours in World War II; like me, he also received his \ntraining in law from the University of Virginia. Starting out as a sole \npractitioner after law school, Mr. Williams began his career in \ncivilian public service as a Commonwealth's Attorney, followed by a \nterm in the Virginia State Senate. During his career in private \npractice, he established himself as a leading expert on Social Security \nlaw, and Mr. Williams' testimony on this subject was sought by the \nCongress.\n  During his career on the bench, Judge Williams has produced more than \n300 published opinions on a number of matters of great importance for \nour country, and certainly for those who live and work in the coal-\nmining regions of Virginia's beautiful Western District. In fact, the \nU.S. Supreme Court cited Judge Williams' opinions with respect to the \nfunding of health care for beneficiaries of the United Mine Workers \nHealth and Retirement Funds in its interpretation of the Coal Act.\n  While Judge Williams assumed senior status in the Western District in \n1988, he remains active in both the Abingdon and Big Stone Gap \ndivisions through the present day. In particular, he is to be commended \nfor his diligence in reestablishing the Big Stone Gap division and for \nthe reopening of both the clerk's office and the courthouse in this \ndivision.\n  Judge Williams remains an asset for our Federal judicial system, for \nhis knowledge and insight as well as for his mentorship of the many \njudicial law clerks who have had the opportunity to work with him, \nincluding Senator Allen. In honor of his 30 years of service to our \nFederal judiciary as a Federal district court judge, I simply say to \nJudge Glen Williams, ``Well done, Your Honor.'' Your longevity and \ncommitment to our Constitution, to our third branch of government, and \nto those four words that are forever engraved into the marble at the \nUnited States Supreme Court--``Equal Justice Under Law''--remain the \nhallmarks of your remarkable career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/28/senate-section/article/S10449-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10449-S10450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING CAROLE GRUNBERG\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Today I honor Carole Grunberg for her years of service to \nme and to the Senate. Carole is retiring after serving as my \nlegislative director for more than 10 years. In total, she has 16 years \nof Senate service along with more than a decade in the House of \nRepresentatives. I want to take this opportunity to talk about Carole \nand how much I appreciate everything she has done for the Nation, the \nState of Oregon, and me.\n  When it comes to legislative directors, Carole was truly the gold \nstandard. Her skills and ability to get things done were unsurpassed. \nShe was a master at designing strategies to take a concept, develop it \ninto legislation, and guide it through Congress to become law. And she \npursued each of these efforts with passion and commitment until the \nlegislation made it into the statute books.\n  Known by many as one of this Nation's top ranked squash players, \nCarole brought that same competitive passion to the Senate's \ncompetitive marketplace of ideas and legislation. Keeping the Internet \nfree of discriminatory taxes, recognizing electronic signatures as \nlegally valid, protecting Oregon's vote by mail, retraining service \nworkers displaced by trade, and our ongoing effort to end secret holds \nare just a few examples of initiatives Carole made into her personal \nquests.\n  Carole also brought out the best in our entire legislative team, \nusing an approach that was part den mother and part drill sergeant. She \nproudly described our legislative staff as the best on Capitol Hill and \npushed them to meet that standard every day. But the same big, \ncompetitive heart that made Carole expect the best from herself and her \nstaff also filled her with enormous compassion and a burning desire for \njustice.\n  Carole always viewed the entire Wyden staff, from the most senior to \nthe newest intern, as part of one team--Team Wyden. And she \nsuccessfully marshaled all our staff in efforts ranging from shutting \ndown Admiral\n\n[[Page S10450]]\n\nPoindexter's Total Information Awareness Program, which basically would \nhave involved holding every American upside down and shaking them to \nsee if anything bad fell out, to crafting my fair flat tax bill to \nsimplify and reform the Tax Code.\n  Carole's team-building efforts extended well beyond the office. She \norganized and served as captain for a Wyden Team that ran the 195-mile \nrelay race from Mt. Hood to the Oregon coast. As Carole saw it, there \nis no better way to build camaraderie than to have a bunch of sweaty \nrunners crammed into a van together for 20 hours.\n  For someone who is used to spending her spare time running marathons \nand winning national championship squash tournaments, I don't see \nCarole's retirement as a glidepath to the rocking chair. She has got \ntoo much energy and too much passion to sit on the sidelines for long. \nI know that she and her long-time partner--and fellow Senate veteran--\nKate Cudlipp, will be making certain that her skills and energy are put \nto good use. And in whatever she chooses to do, I know she will \ncontinue to shine.\n  Again, I can't thank Carole enough for all she has done for me, my \nstaff, the State of Oregon, and the Nation. She will always be my dear \nfriend and a member of our Team Wyden family. I wish her all the best \nfor the next chapter of her life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/28/senate-section/article/S10450-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CHARLIE BATTERY\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I rise to thank Charlie Battery, 1st \nBattalion, 147th Field Artillery, and congratulate and welcome them \nhome after a year spent proudly serving their country in Iraq. Charlie \nBattery, based in Yankton, SD, has certainly earned this homecoming and \nthe gratitude of our Nation.\n  These brave soldiers have been away from their loved ones for over a \nyear, and they have accomplished an enormous amount in that time. \nCharlie Battery served commendably in some of the most dangerous areas \nof Iraq. They performed transition team missions with Iraqi police and \nconducted joint patrols that included route security, reconnaissance, \nrescue and recovery, and personal security detachment missions all over \nBaghdad.\n  The soldiers of Charlie Battery were not immune to the violence that \nhas plagued Iraq. On this day of celebration and reunion, let us \nremember those who were wounded and those who made the ultimate \nsacrifice protecting and serving our Nation, as well as the family \nmembers and friends they left behind. Those who gave their lives in \nIraq include SSG Greg Wagner, SFC Richard Schild, SSG Daniel Cuka and \nSGT. Allen Kokesh, Jr.\n  But let us also remember that these sacrifices were not in vain. \nCharlie Battery, 1st Battalion, 147th Field Artillery, trained more \nthan 1,000 Iraqi police and created stability in the southern and \neastern districts of Baghdad. Charlie Battery's efforts enabled a \ndistrict in the center of Baghdad to become the first to transition \nresponsibility of security to Iraqi police.

CASSIDY, MD\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I wish to honor and recognize \nthe immeasurable contribution Dr. James T. Cassidy has made to \npediatric medicine in Missouri and across the United States.\n  Born in 1930 in Oil City, PA, Dr. Cassidy received his both \nundergraduate and medical education at the University of Michigan. He \ncompleted 2 years of active duty in the U.S. Navy and 7 years in the \nNaval Reserve. He returned to the University of Michigan to complete \nhis residency in internal medicine and a rheumatology fellowship in the \nRackham Arthritis Research Unit under the mentorship of Dr. Roseman and \nDr. Johnson. He went on to the faculty in 1963 and worked his way up \nthe ranks becoming professor of internal medicine and pediatrics in \n1974. In 1984, he was recruited as professor and chair of pediatrics at \nCreighton University School of Medicine in Omaha, NE. Four years later \nhe came to the University of Missouri-Columbia as a professor in the \nDepartment of Child Health and Internal Medicine and chief of pediatric \nrheumatology. He became emeritus professor in 1996 and continued to \nstaff his arthritis clinics until this year. In 1991, Dr. Cassidy \npublished with Ross Petty, M.D., the first ``Textbook of Pediatric \nRheumatology,'' a textbook now in its fifth edition which remains the \nforemost authority in the field both nationally and internationally. He \nhas received many awards, including ACR Master and the ACR \nDistinguished Clinical Scholar Award from the American College of \nRheumatology.\n  I am particularly proud of his work in Missouri. As a professor in \nthe Department of Child Health and Internal Medicine at the University \nof Missouri-Columbia, Dr. Cassidy has inspired cutting-edge research \nand shared his limitless expertise in pediatric\n\n[[Page S10451]]\n\nrheumatology. Yet Dr. Cassidy has done more than just teach, write, and \nresearch. Through his efforts, the Missouri Department of Health \nestablished the Juvenile Arthritis Care Coordination Program in 1993 to \nhelp families obtain family-centered, community-based, coordinated care \nfor children diagnosed with juvenile arthritis. His efforts did not \nstop there.\n  Realizing that there were children in Southern Missouri who were too \npoor or too sick to travel to Columbia to receive treatment, Dr. \nCassidy and his wife Nan would get in their car every other week and \ndrive to a small clinic in Springfield, MO, and see as many as 25 young \nchildren suffering from juvenile arthritis. It didn't matter that they \ncouldn't pay, Dr. Cassidy insisted on finding a way to get the children \nthe treatments they needed. As one doctor said, ``Dr. Cassidy will go \nto any length to help a child.''\n  Dr. Cassidy's support extended to his patients' families as well. \n``He is an incredibly compassionate physician,'' said one mother, ``who \nensures that each family understands how juvenile arthritis affects \ntheir child and what parents can do to help their child lead normal and \nhealthy lives.'' Dr. Cassidy was instrumental in building a community \nof support across Missouri and the United States for families living \nwith juvenile arthritis. In 1980, it was through the encouragement and \nsupport of Dr. Cassidy that a mother of one of his patients and two \nother mothers from other States formed the American Juvenile Arthritis \nOrganization, AJAO, which eventually became a council of the Arthritis \nFoundation.\n  Dr. Cassidy was instrumental in organizing the first juvenile \narthritis educational conference for parents, children, and health \nprofessionals held in 1983 which became an annual national conference. \nHe felt education for families of children with arthritis was critical \nto their care and helped coordinate many Missouri regional conferences \nin St. Joseph, Kansas City, St. Louis, and Columbia.\n  Perhaps the best measure of Dr. Cassidy's legacy as a doctor comes \nfrom the praise and admiration of his patients. Twelve years ago, Dr. \nCassidy began treating two young sisters who suffered debilitating pain \nfrom juvenile arthritis. Throughout the years he persistently \nencouraged them, to their chagrin, to wear braces and take their \nmedicine. Recently, Dr. Cassidy received a letter from the girls. They \nare starting college as healthy, happy, young women--a circumstance \nvirtually unthinkable when Dr. Cassidy began his career. They thanked \nhim for supporting them and giving them the opportunity to live life as \nthey never thought they could.\n  Dr. Cassidy has led an extraordinary life in which he has practiced, \nresearched, and guided aspiring doctors for almost 50 years. He has \nimproved the understanding and awareness of pediatric rheumatology and \nchanged the lives of thousands of children. On behalf of the children \nand families in Missouri and across the country, is my pleasure and \nhonor to commemorate the distinguished career of Dr. Cassidy, a true \npioneer in the field of pediatric rheumatology.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/28/senate-section/article/S10451-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING CHARITIES FOR THE BLIND\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in recognizing Charities for the Blind, a nonprofit organization in \nsouthern California. This organization continues to make a positive \nimpact on the lives of individuals who are blind or visually impaired.\n  Charities for the Blind is an organization that provides computer \nadaptive technology and training to blind and visually impaired \nindividuals. The men and women who volunteer their time and energy to \nthis organization provide an important service to the people of \nSouthern California and our Nation.\n  Charities for the Blind was created by Craig Schneider in 2000 after \nhe suffered a complete loss of his vision. Craig Schneider is a general \nbuilding contractor who became blind after complications from radiation \ntreatments and exposure to radon gas. He found it difficult to adapt to \na visually impaired lifestyle. He took computer courses with the \nassistance of computer adaptive technology but found them difficult and \nfrustrating. Other students were similarly frustrated, and when some \nbegan to drop out of classes, he knew that he was not alone. After \nseeking assistance from State rehabilitation authorities and blind \ncharities, Craig Schneider recognized that there is an important need \namong the visually impaired that needed to be met.\n  According to the National Federation of the Blind, 70 percent of \nindividuals who live with blindness or a visual impairment are \nunemployed. This overwhelming number of individuals have the potential \nto live highly productive lives and gain meaningful employment. \nCharities for the Blind recognizes this need and works to assist \nindividuals with blindness and visual impairment, providing them with \ntools they need to overcome their disability.\n  In addition to providing training, counseling, and computer adaptive \nequipment to the visually impaired and blind, Charities for the Blind \nalso employs blind individuals directly. Craig Schneider has five \nemployees who work with him who are also blind, who help make Charities \nfor the Blind possible. Craig Schneider funds the organization from his \nprivate business, which allows him to pay for computers and equipment, \nemployees and technicians, and travel to and from people's homes to \nhelp train them in the use of adaptive equipment.\n  In its first year, Charities for the Blind gave away 12 computers. \nToday, the organization provides roughly 30 computers each month, with \na short yet successful history of meeting needs in the blind and \nvisually impaired community for individuals between the ages of 10 and \n96. Those who have received counseling and equipment from Charities for \nthe Blind have gained new levels of independence, and more and more \nblind and visually impaired individuals are being empowered and \nemployed each day.\n  Today I salute the dedication and service of Charities for the Blind. \nThis organization has recognized a tremendous need and works daily to \nhelp empower our Nation's blind and visually impaired. I applaud the \nwork and commitment Charities for the Blind has made in bettering the \nlives of many.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/28/senate-section/article/S10451-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10451-S10452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO EDGAR WAYBURN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that \ntoday I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting the incomparable Dr. \nEdgar Wayburn on his 100th birthday. To Californians and others across \nthe United States, Ed Wayburn is a living legacy and an environmental \nhero.\n  Ed Wayburn was born on September 17, 1906, in Macon, GA. He attended \nHarvard Medical School and moved to San Francisco in 1933 to start his \nmedical practice. He found northern California's natural beauty \nintoxicating and refers to the Sierra Nevada and Yosemite National Park \nas his ``first wilderness love.''\n  Within 6 years of moving to California, Ed joined the Sierra Club. \nAnd over the next 50 years, his love and passion for nature and \nconservation grew. He served five terms as the Sierra Club's elected \npresident.\n  Ed shared this love of nature with his wife Peggy Wayburn. Together \nthey traveled throughout Alaska and fought to protect natural areas in \nCalifornia and the West for over 50 years.\n  More than 100 million acres of natural beauty throughout California \nand Alaska have been protected today thanks to Ed's hard work, \nincluding northern California's Golden Gate National Recreation Area \nand Point Reyes National Seashore and Alaska's Denali and Glacier Bay \nNational Parks.\n  Dr. Wayburn is credited with saving more wilderness than any other \nperson alive today.\n  I always say that one of my proudest honors is the Edgar Wayburn \nAward presented to me by the Sierra Club. It is a frequent reminder of \nthe work Ed and I have done together. It is also a reminder of the \nimportant work which still remains to protect and preserve our natural \nsurroundings.\n  Without Ed's efforts over the past decades, I would not want to \nimagine what the American landscape would look like today. Ed's \nleadership and perseverance have ensured the preservation of precious \nopen space and wild areas for generations to come. His work will \ncontinue to be an inspiration\n\n[[Page S10452]]\n\nto countless environmental advocates and others working to effect \nchange. His work is certainly an inspiration to me.\n  I extend my most heartfelt wishes to Ed Wayburn for a very happy \n100th birthday. Thank you, Ed, for all you have done for the protection \nof our natural environment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/28/senate-section/article/S10452-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to commend the National \nWeather Service and the Billings, MT office.\n  This year Billings, MT, hosted the 13th national signature event \ncommemorating the Bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark Corps of \nDiscovery Exploration. The event at Pompeys Pillar was one of the most \nsuccessful signature events in the country, and I was proud to \nparticipate in the opening ceremonies.\n  A great deal of preparation and partnership went into the planning \nsurrounding those 4 days in July and the thousands of visitors expected \nto attend. Federal agencies stepped up to the table. Federal \npartnerships were key to this success. Specific concern centered on \narea wildfires already burning that had been started by lightning \nstrikes from afternoon and evening storms. The National Weather Service \ntook on major responsibility for these weather-related public safety \nissues.\n  On Saturday, July 22 and Sunday, July 23, late afternoon storms \naccompanied by upwards of 60-mph winds necessitated rapid evacuations \nof the public events at Pompeys Pillar. Efficient communication and \nclear direction from the National Weather Service, in coordination with \nthe Bureau of Land Management, provided safe passage out of Pompeys \nPillar in a swift and orderly fashion for the remaining public \nvisitors, volunteers, and employees on those days.\n  It is apparent that the storm's effect and damage could have easily \nbecome a larger story attributed to the Pompeys Pillar signature event. \nThat it was not is a testament to the science, technology, and public \nservice and dedication of your agency and of your employees. Thanks to \nall of you for what you do for Montana. It is a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/28/senate-section/article/S10452-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONGRATULATIONS TO SERGEANT LEIGH ANN HESTER\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like to recognize and \ncongratulate U.S. Army SGT Leigh Ann Hester, a recent recipient of the \nUnited Service Organization's `Service Member of the Year' Award. This \nhonor is presented annually to one enlisted member from each branch of \nthe Armed Forces and must be given to a soldier who demonstrates \nremarkable courage and skill, often risking their own lives to save the \nlives of others.\n  On March 20, 2005, Sergeant Leigh Ann Hester of the 617th Military \nPolice Company, a National Guard unit out of Richmond, KY, was \nescorting a convoy of 26 supply vehicles when they were suddenly \nambushed. According to military accounts of the firefight, about 40 \ninsurgents attacked the convoy as it was traveling south of Baghdad, \nlaunching their assault from trenches alongside the road using rifles, \nmachine guns, and rocketpropelled grenades. Despite being outnumbered \nfive to one and coming under heavy enemy fire, Sergeant Hester led her \nteam through the `kill zone' and into a flanking position, where she \nassaulted a trench line with grenades and M203 grenade-launcher rounds.\n  Her quick thinking saved the lives of numerous convoy members. When \nthe conflict ended, 27 insurgents were dead, 6 were wounded, and 1 was \ncaptured.\n  SGT Leigh Ann Hester is the first woman to receive the USO `Service \nMember of the Year' Award and the first woman in over 60 years to \nreceive the Silver Star--the Army's third highest award for valor in \ncombat.\n  SGT Hester was only 23 years old at the time of this encounter. She \nwas born in 1982 in Bowling Green, KY, later moved to Nashville, TN, \nand she joined the National Guard in April of 2001. As she continues \nthe legacy of military service in her family--her uncle, Carl \nSollinger, served honorably in Vietnam, and her grandfather, Oran \nSollinger, was awarded a Bronze Star for his valor in World War II--\nSergeant Hester intends to continue to serve our country by beginning a \ncareer in law enforcement.\n  On behalf of the people of Kentucky and the Senate, I thank SGT Leigh \nAnn Hester for her commitment to her country, community, and fellow \nsoldiers. It is my honor to recognize her today for her bravery and her \naccomplishments. My thoughts and prayers are always with her and all \nthe men and women who protect this Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/28/senate-section/article/S10452-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING SOUTH CAROLINA ORGANIZATIONS\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I wish to call attention to \nthe good work of the Columbia, SC, Urban League and the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, VA. On September 11, 2006, the Columbia Urban League \nand the VA cohosted a training seminar for church leaders in South \nCarolina to help address the growing population of troubled military \nveterans returning from combat zones. This Veterans Ministry Workshop \nwas led by a panel of 10 physicians from the Dorn VA Medical Center in \nColumbia, each of whom explained the various psychological challenges \nthat face veterans returning from conflict. The panelists discussed \nmethods for dealing with veterans' children and spouses while offering \npractical tips for church members to follow. Around 100 church leaders \nattended the event.\n  I salute the VA, the Columbia Urban League, and in particular its \npresident, Mr. James T. McLawhorn, for their initiative in organizing \nthe Veterans Ministry Workshop. It was Mr. McLawhorn, a member of the \nVA Advisory Committee on Minority Affairs, who originally proposed the \nidea in response to studies released by the Journal of the American \nMedical Association, JAMA. Without his leadership and the cooperation \nof VA officials on the ground in South Carolina, the Veterans Ministry \nWorkshop may have never happened. I am confident that the workshop will \nhave a tremendous impact on the veteran community in South Carolina, \nand I hope that the Columbia Urban League and VA will build on its \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/28/senate-section/article/S10452-4", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WHITE LAKE SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that \ntoday I publicly honor and congratulate White Lake School District on \nachieving blue ribbon status under the Federal No Child Left Behind \nAct. The prestigious blue ribbon designation is based on strong test \nscores and a myriad of other successes.\n  The White Lake School District is among only 250 entities to be \nrecognized nationwide so far this year. For public schools like White \nLake to qualify for blue ribbon status, they must meet State testing \nlevels or have a student body comprised of a high percentage of \neconomically disadvantaged students, yet demonstrate improvement. \nAchieving this goal is a wonderful accomplishment, and White Lake \nschools ought to be applauded.\n  This is not the first time White Lake schools have been honored. In \nboth the 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 school years, the district was named a \nDistinguished District, due to high scores on the DakotaSTEP \nachievement test. The U.S. Department of Education has also named White \nLake as a Title I Distinguished School. In order to apply to be a blue \nribbon school, the White Lake School District submitted a 27-page \napplication outlining their strategies and techniques for learning \nsuccess.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to have this opportunity to honor White \nLake School District. It is a privilege for me to share with my \ncolleagues the exemplary leadership and tireless commitment to \neducation that White Lake School District provides to its students. I \nstrongly commend the hard work and dedication that the faculty, \nadministrators, and staff devote to White Lake schools, and I am very \npleased that their hard work and the students' substantial efforts are \nbeing publicly honored and celebrated. On behalf of all South Dakotans, \nI would like to congratulate this extraordinary school system and wish \nthem continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/28/senate-section/article/S10452-5", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10452-S10453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BETTY J.

She has created a legacy that will \nreverberate in the city of Saginaw for many years to come, and her \ncommitment to serving the needy should serve as an example for us all.\n  Betty is survived by her husband of 42 years, Judge Martin, one son, \nBernard Smith Abernathy, one step-daughter, Joyce Ann Martin, and nine \ngrandchildren.

He early on saw the benefits of cooperatives so that small \nfarmers could add significant value to their products. He has embraced \nthe potential of biobased fuels as an innovative pathway to power \nproduction and transportation fuel needs. He has recognized that \nresponsible stewardship of the land should be a top priority for \nfarmers and ranchers, as clean water, energy conservation, and \nbiodiversity all enhance our society.\n  John is a tireless advocate for the future sustainability of the \nrural way of life. His leadership has shaped the next generation of \nrural citizens, serving as the president of Colorado 4-H Foundation, \nvice president of the Colorado Future Farmers of America, and as a \nboard member of the Colorado State University Board of Agriculture. His \nleadership in these organizations ensures that the traits that have \ncharacterized him, that of perseverance, dedication, and moral fiber, \nwill manifest themselves in future generations of agricultural \nleadership.\n  However, my deep respect for John Stencel isn't only based on his \ninvolvement with these organizations; it is based on the common values \nthat underlie those efforts and have driven his policies and agendas. \nMy respect is based on his commitment to sustain and strengthen family \nfarm and ranch agriculture, and to preserve the rural way of life we \nknow and love. These values are embodied by John Stencel.\n  John has been an influential and indispensable guide, and though he \nis retiring from his service to the Rocky Mountain Farmers Union, I \ntake comfort in the longevity of our friendship and his steadfast \nleadership for rural America, and I wish him nothing but the \nbest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/28/senate-section/article/S10453-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF JIMMY WILLIAMSON\n\n Mr. SHELBY.

Mr. President, today I honor William ``Bill'' \nChandler, a pillar of the Montgomery, AL community. Bill devoted 50 \nyears of his life to developing the YMCA in Montgomery and influencing \nthe lives of thousands of youth.\n  Bill, known as ``Mr. YMCA'' in Montgomery, was a father figure to \nmany young men and women in need of guidance. Bill believed that civic \neducation and open discussions were important to developing youth into \nproductive citizens. He was instrumental in creating and implementing \ninnumerable youth programs focused on leadership development including \nthe Alabama Youth Legislature, the YMCA Youth Conference on National \nAffairs, Lions International Youth Camp, and the Hi-Y and Tri-Hi-Y \nprograms. Without a doubt, many of Montgomery's, Alabama's, and the \nNation's leaders have been directly influenced by Mr. Chandler and the \nprograms he championed.\n  Mr. Chandler also proved himself to be an effective leader and \nbusinessman as president of the Montgomery YMCA. Under his leadership, \nMontgomery's single YMCA grew into the multiple branches operating \nacross the city. His commitment to service was also recognized when he \nwas chosen to serve as the president of Lion's Club International.\n  Mr. Chandler also served as an important leader in Alabama throughout \ntimes of racial tension in Montgomery and the State. He worked to open \nfacilities in all parts of the Montgomery community to serve people \nfrom all walks of life and was at the forefront of providing integrated \nservices. In 1983, when racial discord was near its boiling point in \nMontgomery, Mr. Chandler worked with community and civil rights leaders \nto develop the biracial Youth One Montgomery organization to allow \nBlack and White youth to conduct an open dialog and better understand \nthe issues surrounding race.\n  Bill Chandler, a graduate of Rice University and the University of \nGeorgia, served with distinction as an officer in the U.S. Navy during \nWorld War II. An accomplished athlete himself, Bill was also \nresponsible for the creation of a city sports league and the Jimmy \nHitchcock award to honor character in high school athletes.\n  Bill was an inspiration to many, and I am truly grateful for the \nendless contributions he made to the youth in Alabama. He was preceded \nin death by his wife, Martha Spidle Chandler and will be missed by his \nthree children, Carroll Chandler Phelps, Elizabeth Chandler Walston, \nand William Robert Chandler; his seven grandchildren; and his sister, \nEvelyn Chandler Berg. His dedication to community service will be \nremembered and shared by those whose lives he touched for generations \nto come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/28/senate-section/article/S10453-4", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10453-S10454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF HOLT INTERNATIONAL\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, in the mid 1950s, Harry and Bertha \nHolt of Eugene, OR, saw a film about children in Korean orphanages who \nwere in desperate need of help. Touched by what\n\n[[Page S10454]]\n\nthey saw, the Holts sent money and clothes to the orphanages, but they \nstill felt the need to do more.\n  As they thought and prayed about what to do, it dawned on the Holts \nthat what the children needed more than money and clothes were \nfamilies. So Harry and Bertha decided to provide that family. They \ndecided to adopt eight Korean children. No matter what roadblocks were \nplaced in the way of that decision--including the need to get Congress \nto pass a special law--the Holts persevered. Soon they were the parents \nof eight new sons and daughters.\n  The adoption was revolutionary. Previously, adoption was regarded as \nsomething to be kept secret. The Holts, however, proudly adopted \nchildren who were obviously not their birth children. In doing so, they \nshowed that a family's love is greater than barriers of race and \nnationality.\n  But the Holts story did not end with the adoption of their children. \nAs word spread about what they had done, others sought their advice and \nasked how they could adopt. Just 5 months after bringing his new family \nhome, Harry headed back to Korea to match other children with new \nfamilies. In 1956, financed almost entirely by Harry and Bertha's \npersonal funds, Holt International was born.\n  Fifty years have now passed since Holt International was officially \nincorporated. Harry and Bertha are no longer with us. But their dream \nlives on. Today, Holt is the Nation's largest adoption agency, having \nunited nearly 40,000 children with adoptive families in the United \nStates. It is simply impossible to calculate how much happiness and joy \nhave been brought into the life of those children and, in return, how \nmuch happiness and joy they have provided for their families.\n  As a U.S. Senator from Oregon, which continues to be home to the \nheadquarters of Holt International, and as the father of three adopted \nchildren, I am privileged to rise today to extend my congratulations--\nand I know the congratulations of the entire Senate--to Holt on the \noccasion of their 50th anniversary. I stand ready to help them in any \nway possible as they continue their inspiring mission in the years \nahead.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude with the eloquent words of Bertha \nHolt, who said, ``All children are beautiful when they are loved.'' May \nall children be as blessed as those adopted by the Holts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/28/senate-section/article/S10454-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO THOMAS R.

In his years in the Business and Human \nRelations Division, he has taught a variety of subjects ranging from \nstatistics, to marketing and human relations.\n  Throughout Mr. Etling's career, he has been honored with several \ndistinctions for his hard work and dedication in the classroom. During \nthe 2001-2002 academic year, he was selected as Adjunct Faculty Member \nof the Year. In 2004, Mr. Etling was named the Business Teacher of the \nYear, the first adjunct faculty member to be so honored.\n  Outside the classroom, Mr. Etling has continued to dedicate his time \nto serving the academic community. He has served on several committees, \nmost notably as a member of the Academic Council and the Assessment \nCommittee. Currently, he is working with the dean of the business \ndivision to develop a mentoring program to assist students who have the \nentrepreneurial spirit to help them develop their ideas. For this \nprogram, he has recruited a number of successful local business leaders \nand other faculty members. Mr. Etling looks forward to continuing to \nwork for the success of the students and the college.

STATEMENT ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 3963. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for improved access to cost-effective, quality physical \nmedicine and rehabilitation service under part B of the Medicare \nprogram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \nthe ``Access to Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Services \nImprovement Act of 2006.'' This bill would improve patient access to \nphysical medicine and rehabilitation services while also reducing \nMedicare costs.\n  As medicine has become increasingly specialized, the types of health \nprofessionals physicians employ to assist them in delivering high \nquality, cost-\n\n[[Page S10460]]\n\neffective healthcare has changed dramatically. While States have \ntypically kept up with these developments by creating regulatory \nmechanisms to ensure that these health professionals are properly \neducated and trained, the Medicare program has not kept pace. In fact, \na recent Medicare policy has actually turned back the clock on these \ninnovative ways of delivering care and this is having a negative affect \non not only the availability of services, but what Medicare pays for \nthese services.\n  We are all well aware of the struggles the Medicare program has had \ntrying to control spending for therapy services. In fact, we have had \nto impose a cap on beneficiary spending because it has gotten so out of \ncontrol. Unfortunately, in the midst of our efforts to control \naggregate spending on therapy services, the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, CMS, has adopted policies that will lead to higher \nper beneficiary expenditures and make it even more difficult for \nseniors to get the care they need.\n  Since late in 2005, CMS has been enforcing a policy, sometimes \nreferred to as the ``therapy incident-to'' rule, that prevents doctors \nfrom employing anyone other than a physical therapist to provide \nphysical medicine and rehabilitation services in their offices. \nFrankly, this policy ignores the fact that there are many State \nlicensed or certified health professionals who are qualified to offer \nidentical services at a lower cost to Medicare.\n  Many of us are familiar with the devastating affects breast cancer \nhas on millions of women and men each year. One of the consequences of \nbreast cancer treatment is a condition called lymphedema. This is a \ndebilitating and disfiguring swelling of the extremities that occurs \nfrom damage to the lymph nodes located in the arm pit. The only \neffective treatment for this condition is a specialized type of massage \nthat should only be delivered by a certified lymphedema therapist. Due \nto CMS' policy, over \\1/3\\ of the nationally certified lymphedema \ntherapists can no longer provide this service to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. Failure to treat lymphedema often results in long \nhospitals stays due to infection and can lead to amputation in the most \nextreme cases.\n  Prior to the adoption of the CMS rule, physicians had the freedom to \nchoose the State licensed or authorized health professional they \nthought most appropriate to help their Medicare patients recover from \ninjuries or debilitating conditions. I believe we should allow \nphysicians, not government bureaucrats, to decide which State licensed \nhealthcare professionals have the necessary education and training to \nprovide the most high quality, cost-effective physical medicine and \nrehabilitation services to their patients. Additionally, the health \nprofessionals often approved to perform services are not readily \navailable in many rural communities. This means patients must go \nwithout care or have to travel long distances to get services that were \npreviously available in their home towns. As Republican Co-Chair of the \nSenate Rural Health Caucus, I have consistently supported policies and \ninitiatives that help rural Medicare beneficiaries get and maintain \naccess to services in their own communities in a more effective and \nefficient way.\n  Finally, it is important to note that access to state licensed, \ncertified professionals will save the Medicare program money--not \nincrease costs. The CMS rule implemented last year will result in \nhigher Medicare expenditures than if the old policy had remained in \nplace. In fact, a recent Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, \nreport based on 2002 data showed that the most cost-effective place for \nMedicare beneficiaries to obtain physical therapy was in the \nphysician's office. After reviewing the legislation, I hope that my \ncolleagues will consider joining me in this important effort to restore \nphysician judgment, patient choice, and common sense to the Medicare \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3963\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the issuance of a commemorative \npostage stamp in honor of Senator Blanche Kelso Bruce; to the Committee \non Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the first African American to serve a full \nterm in the United States Senate represented my great State of \nMississippi.\n  Blanche Kelso Bruce was elected to the Senate in 1874 by the \nMississippi State Legislature where he served from 1875 until 1881.\n  On February 14, 1879, he broke a second barrier by becoming the first \nAfrican American to preside over a Senate session. He was a leader in \nthe nationwide fight for African American rights, fighting for \ndesegregation of the Army and protection of voting rights.\n  Blanche Kelso Bruce was born into slavery near Farmville, VA, on \nMarch 1, 1841, and spent his early years in Virginia and Missouri. He \nwas 20 years old when the Civil War broke out. He tried to enlist in \nthe Union Army but was rejected because of his race.\n  He then turned his attention to teaching and while in Missouri \norganized that State's first school for African Americans.\n  In 1869 he moved to Mississippi to become a planter on a cotton \nplantation, and the Magnolia State is where he became active in \nRepublican politics. He rose in Mississippi politics from membership on \nthe Mississippi Levee Board, as the sheriff and tax collector for \nBolivar County surrounding Cleveland, Mississippi, and as the Sergeant-\nat-Arms for the Mississippi State Senate. It was Blanche Kelso Bruce's \nperseverance, selfless public service and commitment to Mississippi \nthat led to the Mississippi State Legislature's election of him to \nserve in the U.S. Senate.\n  In the Senate, he served on the Pensions, Manufacturers, Education \nand Labor committees. He chaired the Committee on River Improvements \nand the Select Committee to Investigate the Freedman's Savings and \nTrust Company.\n  Senator Bruce left the Senate in 1881 and was appointed Registrar of \nthe Treasury by President James Garfield, a position he also held in \n1897. He subsequently received appointments from Presidents Chester \nArthur, Benjamin Harrison and William McKinley.\n  Senator Bruce joined the board of Howard University in Washington, \nD.C. where he received an honorary degree. He died in Washington on \nMarch 17, 1898, at the age of 57.\n  Four years ago, on September 17, 2002, in my position as Senate \nMajority Leader, I joined with Senator Chris Dodd in honoring this \nrevered adopted son of Mississippi by unveiling the portrait of Blanche \nKelso Bruce in the U.S. Capitol.\n  Today I rise to further honor this great statesman and pioneer by \nintroducing legislation to issue the Senator Blanche Kelso Bruce \ncommemorative postage stamp. Mississippi takes great pride in our \nleaders who often quietly, with little fanfare, blaze paths for the \nrest of the Nation to follow. Senator Blanche Kelso Bruce is one such \ngreat pioneer, and I call on my colleagues to join me in honoring him.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 3965. A bill to address the serious health care access barriers, \nand consequently higher incidences of disease, for low-income, \nuninsured populations; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Latina \nHealth Access Act. This important legislation addresses the serious \nhealth care access barriers, and consequently higher incidences of \ndisease and poorer health outcomes, for the Latina population in the \nUnited States.\n  The United States has witnessed a tremendous growth in the Latino \npopulation across the Nation. There are now 35 million Latinos residing \nin the U.S., and Latinas are more than half of the total Latino \npopulation--for a total of 18 million Latinas in the United States. In \nmy home State of California, 29 percent of the female population is \nLatina--this is approximately 5 million women. The number of Latinas is \nexpected to continue to grow, and it is estimated that by 2050, one out \nof every four women in the U.S. will be a Latina. Despite their growing \nnumbers, Latinas continue to disproportionately face serious health \nconcerns, including sexually transmitted diseases, diabetes, and \ncancer, which are otherwise preventable, or treatable, with adequate \nhealth access.\n  Latinas are particularly at risk for being uninsured. It is estimated \nthat 37 percent of Latinas are uninsured, almost double the rate of the \nnational average. This lack of adequate health care results in health \nproblems that could otherwise be prevented. For example, 1 in 12 \nLatinas will develop breast cancer nationwide. White women have the \nhighest rates of breast cancer; however, Latinas have among the lowest \nrates of breast cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment. As a result, \nLatinas are more likely to die from breast cancer than white women. \nAlso, the prevalence of diabetes is at least two to four times higher \namong Latinas than among white women. More than 25 percent of Latinas \naged 65 to 74 have Type II diabetes. All of these health problems would \nbe more effectively treated or prevented with adequate health care \ncoverage.\n  To address these health concerns, the Latina Health Access Act \nprovides a two-fold approach to dealing with this problem. First, the \nbill would provide greater health access to Latinas. Second, the bill \nwould provide educational outreach programs targeted at Latinas in \nregards to health care access.\n  The bill would create a program at the Department of Health and Human \nServices (HHS) that provides funding for high-performing hospitals and \ncommunity health centers targeted at serving the growing Latina \npopulation of the United States. Also, the bill would mandate that HHS \nprovide grants to various nonprofits, state or local governments that \nserve Latino communities, and lastly to women of color who seek to \ncreate diversity in the health care community. Finally, the bill would \ndirect HHS to provide $18 million for grants to fund research \ninstitutions so that they may conduct research on the health status of \nLatinas.\n  The Latina Health Access Act also focuses on educational outreach to \nthe Latina population. The bill would fund health education programs \ntargeted specifically to Latinas through community-centered \ninformational forums, public service announcements and media campaigns.\n  Adequate health access is the key to diagnosing and treating diseases \nbefore they become deadly and rampant. We need to strengthen our \nefforts to bring greater health access to the Latina population. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S10462]]\n\n                                S. 3965\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Latina Health Access Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) As of 2006, there are 18,000,000 Latinas residing in \n     the United States. The number of Latinas is expected to grow \n     considerably. It is estimated that by the year 2050, 1 out of \n     every 4 women in the United States will be a Latina.\n       (2) Latinas are particularly at risk for being uninsured. \n     37 percent of Latinas are uninsured, almost double the \n     national average.\n       (3) With respect to sexually transmitted diseases--\n       (A) the HIV infection rate is 7 times more for Latinas than \n     their white counterparts, and Latinas represent 18 percent of \n     new HIV infections among women;\n       (B) the AIDS case rate for Latinas is more than 5 times \n     more than the rate for white women;\n       (C) the rate of chlamydia for Latinas is 4 times more than \n     the rate for white women; and\n       (D) among Latinas, the gonorrhea incidence is nearly double \n     that of white women.\n       (4) With respect to cancer--\n       (A) The national incidence rate for cervical cancer in \n     Latinas over the age of 30 is nearly double that of non-\n     Latinas;\n       (B) 1 in 12 Latinas nationwide will develop breast cancer; \n     and\n       (C) while white women have the highest rates of breast \n     cancer, Latinas have among the lowest rates of breast cancer \n     screening, diagnosis and treatment and, as a result, are more \n     likely to die from breast cancer compared to white women.\n       (5) The prevalence of diabetes is at least 2 to 4 times \n     more among Latinas than among white women. More than 25 \n     percent of Latinas aged 65 to74 have Type II diabetes.\n       (6) Heart disease is the main cause of death for all women, \n     and heart disease risk and death rates are higher among \n     Latinas partly because of higher rates of obesity and \n     diabetes.\n       (7) Therefore, despite their growing numbers, Latinas \n     continue to face serious health concerns (including sexually \n     transmitted diseases, diabetes, and cancer) that are \n     otherwise preventable, or treatable, with adequate health \n     access.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide assistance to State and nongovernmental \nentities to initiate public awareness and outreach campaigns to reduce \nteenage pregnancies; to the Committee on Health, Education, and \nPensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I rise to reintroduce the HOPE \n(Hispanas Organized for Political Equality) Youth Pregnancy Prevention \nAct.\n  The United States has the highest rate of teen pregnancy in the \nWestern industrialized world, and the U.S. teen-pregnancy rate is \nnearly twice that of Canada and Great Britain. Although overall teen \npregnancy rates have decreased in recent years, the teen pregnancy \nrates for Hispanics and other ethnic and racial minority teens in the \nUnited States are significantly higher than the national average. For \nexample, 51 percent of Latina girls in the U.S. will become pregnant \nonce before the age 20.\n  The Latina population in the United States has grown tremendously. \nCurrently, there are approximately 18 million Latinas that reside in \nthe U.S. In my home State of California, 29 percent of all women are \nLatinas, this is approximately five million women. The number of \nLatinas is expected to continue to grow. It is estimated that by 2050, \none out of every four women in the U.S. will be a Latina. Despite their \ngrowing numbers, Latinas continue to face serious health care access \nbarriers and consequently higher incidences of teenage pregnancy.\n  To address the growing risk for many reproductive and other health \nconcerns that are otherwise preventable, the HOPE Youth Pregnancy \nPrevention Act would provide a comprehensive solution and the resources \nto help prevent teen pregnancy among at-risk and minority youth.\n  Specifically, the bill would provide grants to States, localities, \nand non-governmental organizations for teenage pregnancy prevention \nactivities targeted to areas with large ethnic minorities and other at-\nrisk youth. These grants could be used for a number of activities, \nincluding youth development, work-related interventions and other \neducational activities, parental involvement, teenage outreach and \nclinical services. The bill would authorize $30 million a year for five \nyears for these grants.\n  The bill would also provide grants to States and non-governmental \norganizations to establish multimedia public awareness campaigns to \ncombat teenage pregnancy. These campaigns would aim to prevent teen \npregnancy through TV, radio and print ads, billboards, posters, and the \nInternet.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce a bill \nthat will help inform the Congress and the American people about our \nNation's trade agreements.\n  The trade policy debate here in Washington is heated and polarized. \nSupporters of ``free trade'' often view trade agreements uncritically \nand without question while others are suspicious of any agreement that \nmakes it easier to trade with other countries. I believe that trade \npolicy decisions should be based on an understanding of the concrete \nresults of these agreements and the impact that they have on our \neconomy and the American people, rather than on preconceived notions.\n  My bill, the Trade Agreement Accountability Act, will inject factual \nanalysis in to this debate. The bill requires the International Trade \nCommission to report on the effects of every trade agreement we sign. \nThese reports will examine the good and the bad of every trade \nagreement after two years, after five years and then every five years \nafter it goes into effect. They will study the effect of each trade \nagreement on a sector-by-sector basis, and conduct an assessment and \nquantitative analysis of how each agreement is fostering economic \ngrowth, improving living standards and helping to create jobs.\n  In short, this bill will help educate policymakers and the American \npeople about this important debate. I hope that by evaluating the \nresults of past agreements, we will be able to better understand the \nconsequences of future ones.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3967\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to affirm the authority of the Comptroller General to \naudit and evaluate the programs, activities, and financial transactions \nof the intelligence community, and for other purposes; to the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to introduce ``The Intelligence \nCommunity Audit Act of 2006,'' with Senator Lautenberg which would \nreaffirm the Comptroller General of the United States and head of the \nGovernment Accountability Office's, GAO, authority to audit the \nfinancial transactions and evaluate the programs and activities of the \nintelligence community (IC). Representative Bennie Thompson, ranking \nmember of the House Homeland Security Committee, is introducing similar \nlegislation.\n  The bill Senator Lautenberg and I offer today is in keeping with \nlegislation introduced in 1987 by Senator John Glenn, the former \nchairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, to ensure more \neffective oversight of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the \nwake of the Iran-Contra scandal.\n\n[[Page S10464]]\n\n  The need for greater oversight and availability of information to \nappropriate congressional committees is not new. What is new is that \nCongress does not have the luxury of failure in this era of terrorism. \nFailure brings terrible consequence.\n  Since 9/11, effective oversight is needed now more than ever for two \nvery basic reasons: First, intelligence reforms have spawned new \nagencies with new intelligence functions demanding even more inter-\nagency cooperation. The Congress needs to ensure that these agencies \nhave the assets, resources, and capability to do their job in \nprotecting our national security. However, now the Congress cannot do \nits job properly, in part, because its key investigative arm, the \nGovernment Accountability Office, is not given adequate access to the \nintelligence community, led by the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI).\n  Moreover, intelligence oversight is no longer the sole purview of the \nSenate and House intelligence committees. Other committees have \njurisdiction over such departments as Homeland Security, State, \nDefense, Justice, Energy, and even Treasury and Commerce, which, in \nthis war on terrorism, have intelligence collection and sharing \nresponsibilities. Nor is the information necessary for these committees \nto exercise their oversight responsibilities restricted to the two \nintelligence committees as their organizing resolutions make clear. \nUnfortunately, the intelligence community stonewalls the GAO when \ncommittees of jurisdiction request that GAO investigate problems \ndespite the clear responsibility of Congress to ensure that these \nagencies are operating effectively to protect America.\n  This is not always the case. Some agencies recognize the valuable \ncontribution that GAO makes in improving the quality of our \nintelligence. As Lieutenant General Lew Allen, Jr., then Director of \nthe National Security Agency (NSA), observed in testimony before the \nSenate Select Committee To Study Governmental Operations With Respect \nTo Intelligence Activities, on October 29, 1975: ``Another feature of \ncongressional review is that since 1955 resident auditors of the \nGeneral Accounting Office have been assigned at the Agency to perform \non-site audits. Additional GAO auditors were cleared for access in \n1973, and GAO, in addition to this audit, is initiating a classified \nreview of our automatic data processing functions.'' Not surprisingly, \nthis outpost of the GAO still exists at the NSA.\n  Second, and equally important, is the inability of Congress to ensure \nthat unfettered intelligence collection does not trample civil \nliberties. New technologies and new personal information data bases \nthreaten our individual right to a secure private life, free from \nunlawful government invasion. The Congress must ensure that private \ninformation being collected by the intelligence community is not \nmisused and is secure.\n  Over 30 years ago, Senator Charles Percy urged Congress to ``act now \nto gain control over the Government's dangerously proliferating police, \ninvestigative, and intelligence activities.'' He noted that ``we find \nourselves threatened by the specter of a `watchdog' Government, \nbreeding a nation of snoopers.''\n  The privacy concerns expressed by our former colleague have become \nvastly more complicated. As I have noted, the institutional landscape \nhas become littered with new intelligence agencies with ever-increasing \ndemands and responsibilities on law enforcement at every level of \ngovernment since the establishment of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and the passage of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \nPrevention Act of 2004. They have the legitimate mission to protect the \ncountry against potential threats. Congress' role is to ensure that \ntheir mission remains legitimate.\n  The intelligence community today consists of 19 different agencies or \ncomponents: the Office of the Director of National Intelligence; \nCentral Intelligence Agency; Department of Defense; Defense \nIntelligence Agency; National Security Agency; Departments of the Army, \nNavy, Marine Corps, and Air Force; Department of State; Department of \nTreasury; Department of Energy; Department of Justice; Federal Bureau \nof Investigation; National Reconnaissance Office; National Geospatial-\nIntelligence Agency; Coast Guard; Department of Homeland Security, and \nthe Drug Enforcement Administration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a memorandum prepared by the \nCongressional Research Service, entitled ``Congressional Intelligence \nOversight,'' be included in the Record.\n  As both House Rule 48 and Senate Resolution 400 establishing the \nintelligence oversight committees state, ``Nothing in this [charter] \nshall be construed as amending, limiting, or otherwise changing the \nauthority of any standing committee of the [House/Senate] to obtain \nfull and prompt access to the product of the intelligence activities of \nany department or agency of the Government relevant to a matter \notherwise within the jurisdiction of such committee.''\n  Despite this clear and unambiguous statement, the ability of non-\nintelligence committees to obtain information, no matter how vital to \nimproving the security of our Nation, has been restricted by the \nvarious elements of the intelligence community.\n  Two recent incidents have made this situation disturbingly clear. At \na hearing entitled ``Access Delayed: Fixing the Security Clearance \nProcess, Part II,'' before the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \nManagement, the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia on \nwhich I serve as Ranking Member, on November 9, 2005, GAO was asked \nabout steps it would take to ensure that the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM), the Office of Management and Budget, and the \nintelligence community met the goals and objectives outlined in the OPM \nsecurity clearance strategic plan. Fixing the security clearance \nprocess, which is on GAO's high-risk list, is essential to our national \nsecurity. But as GAO observed in a written response to a question \nraised by Senator Voinovich, ``while we have the authority to do such \nwork, we lack the cooperation we need to get our job done in that \narea.'' The intelligence community is blocking GAO's work in this \nessential area.\n\n  A similar case arose in response to a GAO investigation for the \nSenate Homeland Security Committee and the House Government Reform \nCommittee on how agencies are sharing terrorism-related and sensitive \nbut unclassified information. The report, entitled ``Information \nSharing, the Federal Government Needs to Establish Policies and \nProcesses for Sharing Terrorism-Related and Sensitive but Unclassified \nInformation'' (GAO-06-385), was released in March 2006.\n  At a time when Congress is criticized by members of the 9-11 \nCommission for failing to implement its recommendations, we should \nremember that improving terrorism information sharing among agencies \nwas one of the critical recommendations of the 9-11 Commission. \nMoreover, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 \nmandated the sharing of terrorism information through the creation of \nan Information Sharing Environment. Yet, when asked by GAO for comments \non the GAO report, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence \nrefused, stating that ``the review of intelligence activities is beyond \nGAO's purview.''\n  However, as a Congressional Research Service memorandum entitled \n``Overview of `Classified' and `Sensitive but Unclassified' \nInformation,'' concludes, ``it appears that pseudo-classification \nmarkings have, in some instances, had the effect of deterring \ninformation sharing for homeland security.'' I ask unanimous consent \nthat the memo be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  Unfortunately I have more examples, that predate the post 9-11 \nreforms. Indeed, in July 2001, in testimony entitled ``Central \nIntelligence Agency, Observations on GAO Access to Information on CIA \nPrograms and Activities'' (GAO-01-975T) before the House Committee on \nGovernment Reform, the GAO noted, as a practical matter, ``our access \nis generally limited to obtaining information on threat assessments \nwhen the CIA does not perceives [sic] our audits as oversight of its \nactivities.'' I ask consent that this testimony also be printed \nfollowing my remarks.\n  It is inconceivable that the GAO--the audit arm of the U.S. \nCongress--has been unable to conduct evaluations of the CIA for over 40 \nyears.\n\n[[Page S10465]]\n\n  If the GAO had been able to conduct basic auditing functions of the \nCIA, perhaps some of the problems that were so clearly exposed \nfollowing the terrorist attacks in September 2001 would have been \nresolved. And yet, it is extraordinary that five years after 9-11 the \nsame problems persist.\n  Once more I refer to Senator Glenn's bill S. 1458, the ``General \nAccounting Office-Central Intelligence Agency Audit Act of 1987.'' On \nits introduction he said, ``in the long run, I believe carefully \ncontrolled GAO audits of CIA will lower the probability of future \nabuses of power, boost the credibility of CIA management, increase the \nessential public support the Agency's mission deserves, assist the \nCongress in conducting meaningful oversight, and in no way compromise \nthe CIA mission.'' Unfortunately, S. 1458 did not become law, and \nnearly 20 years later, the CIA's apparent management challenges led to \nthe creation of the Director of National Intelligence with the \nIntelligence Reform Act of 2004. If Senator Glenn's proposal made in \n1987 had been accepted, perhaps, again, some of the problems that \nbecame apparent with our intelligence agencies following 9-11 might \nnever have occurred.\n  I want to be clear that my legislation does not detract from the \nauthority of the intelligence committees. In fact, the language makes \nexplicit that the Comptroller General may conduct an audit or \nevaluation of intelligence sources and methods or covert actions only \nupon the request of the intelligence committees or at the request of \nthe congressional majority or minority leaders. The measure also \nprescribes for the security of the information collected by the \nComptroller General.\n  However, my bill reaffirms the authority of the Comptroller General \nto conduct audits and evaluations--other than those relating to sources \nand methods, or covert actions--relating to the management and \nadministration of elements of the intelligence community in areas such \nas strategic planning, financial management, information technology, \nhuman capital, knowledge management, information sharing, and change \nmanagement for other relevant committees of the Congress.\n  Attached is a detailed description of the legislation. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 14, 2006.\n     Subject: Congressional Oversight of Intelligence.\n     From: Alfred Cumming, Specialist in Intelligence and National \n         Security Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division.\n\n       This memorandum examines the intelligence oversight \n     structure established by Congress in the 1970s, including the \n     creation of the congressional select intelligence committees \n     by the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate, \n     respectively. It also looks at the intelligence oversight \n     role that Congress reserved for congressional committees \n     other than the intelligence committees; examines certain \n     existing statutory procedures that govern how the executive \n     branch is to keep the congressional intelligence committees \n     informed of U.S. intelligence activities; and looks at the \n     circumstances under which the two intelligence committees are \n     expected to keep congressional standing committees, as well \n     as both chambers, informed of intelligence activities.\n       If I can be of further assistance, please call at 707-7739.\n\n                               Background\n\n       In the wake of congressional investigations into \n     Intelligence Community activities in the mid-1970s, the U.S. \n     Senate in 1976 created a select committee on intelligence to \n     conduct more effective oversight on a continuing basis. The \n     U.S. House of Representatives established its own \n     intelligence oversight committee the following year.\n       Until the two intelligence committees were created, other \n     congressional standing committees--principally the Senate and \n     House Armed Services and Appropriations committees--shared \n     responsibility for overseeing the intelligence community. \n     Although willing to cede primary jurisdiction over the \n     Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to the two new select \n     intelligence committees, these congressional standing \n     committees wanted to retain jurisdiction over the \n     intelligence activities of the other departments and agencies \n     they oversaw. According to one observer, the standing \n     committees asserted their jurisdictional prerogatives for two \n     reasons--to protect ``turf,'' but also to provide ``a hedge \n     against the possibility that the newly launched experiment in \n     oversight might go badly.''\n\n             Intelligence Committees' Statutory Obligations\n\n       Under current statute, the President is required to ensure \n     that the congressional intelligence committees are kept \n     ``fully and currently informed'' of U.S. intelligence \n     activities, including any ``significant anticipated \n     intelligence activity, and the President and the intelligence \n     committees are to establish any procedures as may be \n     necessary to carry out these provisions.\n       The statute, however, stipulates that the intelligence \n     committees in turn are responsible for alerting the \n     respective chambers or congressional standing committees of \n     any intelligence activities requiring further attention. The \n     intelligence committees are to carry out this responsibility \n     in accordance with procedures established by the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, in consultation with the \n     Director of National Intelligence, in order to protect \n     against unauthorized disclosure of classified information, \n     and all information relating to sources and methods.\n       The statute stipulates that: ``each of the congressional \n     intelligence committees shall promptly call to the attention \n     of its respective House, or to any appropriate committee or \n     committees of its respective House, any matter relating to \n     intelligence activities requiring the attention of such House \n     or such committee or committees.''\n       This provision was included in statute after being \n     specifically requested in a letter from then Senate Foreign \n     Relations Chairman Frank Church and Ranking Minority Member \n     Jacob Javits in an Apr. 30, 1980 letter to then-intelligence \n     committee Chairman Birch Bayh and Vice Chairman Barry \n     Goldwater.\n\n          Intelligence Committee Obligations Under Resolution\n\n       In an apparent effort to address various concerns relating \n     to committee jurisdiction, the House of Representatives and \n     the Senate, in the resolutions establishing each of the \n     intelligence committees, included language preserving \n     oversight roles for those standing committees with \n     jurisdiction over matters affected by intelligence \n     activities.\n       Specifically, each intelligence committee's resolution \n     states that: ``Nothing in this [Charter] shall be construed \n     as prohibiting or otherwise restricting the authority of any \n     other committee to study and review any intelligence activity \n     to the extent that such activity directly affects a matter \n     otherwise within the jurisdiction of such committee.''\n       Both resolutions also stipulate that:\n       Nothing in this [charter] shall be construed as amending, \n     limiting, or otherwise changing the authority of any standing \n     committee of the [House/Senate] to obtain full and prompt \n     access to the product of the intelligence activities of any \n     department or agency of the Government relevant to a matter \n     otherwise within the jurisdiction of such committee.\n       Finally, both charters direct that each intelligence \n     committee alert the appropriate standing committees, or the \n     respective chambers, of any matter requiring attention. The \n     charters state:\n       The select committee, for the purposes of accountability to \n     the [House/Senate] shall make regular and periodic reports to \n     the [House/Senate] on the nature and extent of the \n     intelligence activities of the various departments and \n     agencies of the United States. Such committee shall promptly \n     call to the attention of the [House/Senate] or to any other \n     appropriate committee or committees of the [House/Senate] any \n     matters requiring the attention of the [House/Senate] or such \n     other appropriate committee or committees.\n\n                         Cross-over Membership\n\n       Both resolutions also direct that the membership of each \n     intelligence committee include members who serve on the four \n     standing committees that historically have been involved in \n     intelligence oversight. The respective resolutions designate \n     the following committees as falling in this category: \n     Appropriations, Armed Services, Judiciary, and the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee and the House International \n     Relations Committee.\n       Although each resolution directs that such cross-over \n     members be designated, neither specifies whether cross-over \n     members are to play any additional role beyond serving on the \n     intelligence committees. For example, neither resolution \n     outlines whether cross-over members are to inform colleagues \n     on standing committees they represent. Rather, each \n     resolution directs only that the ``intelligence committee'' \n     shall promptly call such matters to the attention of standing \n     committees and the respective chambers if the committees \n     determine that they require further attention by those \n     entities.\n\n                          Summary Conclusions\n\n       Although the President is statutorily obligated to keep the \n     congressional intelligence committees fully and currently \n     informed of intelligence activities, the statute obligates \n     the intelligence committees to inform the respective \n     chambers, or standing committees, of such activities, if \n     either of the two committees determine that further oversight \n     attention is required.\n       Further, resolutions establishing the two intelligence \n     committees make clear that the intelligence committees share \n     intelligence oversight responsibilities with other standing \n     committees, to the extent that certain intelligence \n     activities affect matters that fall under the jurisdiction of \n     a committee other than the intelligence committees.\n       Finally, the resolutions establishing the intelligence \n     committees provide for the designation of ``cross-over'' \n     members representing certain standing committees that\n\n[[Page S10466]]\n\n     played a role in intelligence oversight prior to the \n     establishment of the intelligence committees in the 1970s. \n     The resolutions, however, do not specify what role, if any, \n     these ``cross-over'' members play in keeping standing \n     committees on which they serve informed of certain \n     intelligence activities.

This memorandum provides a brief \n     introduction to, and overview of, two categories of such \n     information policy. The first category is demarcated largely \n     in a single policy instrument--a presidential executive \n     order--with a clear focus and in considerable detail: the \n     classification of national security information in terms of \n     three degrees of harm the disclosure of such information \n     could cause to the nation, resulting in Confidential, Secret, \n     and Top Secret designations. The second category is, by \n     contrast with the first, much broader in terms of the kinds \n     of information it covers, to the point of even being nebulous \n     in some instances, and is expressed in various instruments, \n     the majority of which are non-statutory: the marking of \n     sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information for protective \n     management, although its public disclosure may be permissible \n     pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). These two \n     categories are reviewed in the discussion set out below.\n\n\n                    Security Classified Information\n\n       Current security classification arrangements, prescribed by \n     an executive order of the President, trace their origins to a \n     March 1940 directive issued by President Franklin D. \n     Roosevelt as E.O. 8381. This development was probably \n     prompted somewhat by desires to clarify the authority of \n     civilian personnel in the national defense community to \n     classify information, to establish a broader basis for \n     protecting military information in view of growing global \n     hostilities, and to manage better a discretionary power \n     seemingly of increasing importance to the entire executive \n     branch. Prior to this 1940 order, information had been \n     designated officially secret by armed forces personnel \n     pursuant to Army and Navy general orders and regulations. The \n     first systematic procedures for the protection of national \n     defense information, devoid of special markings, were \n     established by War Department General Orders No. 3 of \n     February 1912. Records determined to be ``confidential'' were \n     to be kept under lock, ``accessible only to the officer to \n     whom intrusted.'' Serial numbers were issued for all such \n     ``confidential'' materials, with the numbers marked on the \n     documents, and lists of same kept at the offices from which \n     they emanated. With the enlargement of the armed forces after \n     the entry of the United States into World War I, the registry \n     system was abandoned and a tripartite system of \n     classification markings was inaugurated in November 1917 with \n     General Orders No. 64 of the General Headquarters of the \n     American Expeditionary Force.\n       The entry of the United States into World War II prompted \n     some additional arrangements for the protection of \n     information pertaining to the nation's security. Personnel \n     cleared to work on the Manhattan Project for the production \n     of the atomic bomb, for instance, in committing themselves \n     not to disclose protected information improperly, were \n     ``required to read and sign either the Espionage Act or a \n     special secrecy agreement,'' establishing their awareness of \n     their secrecy obligations and a fiduciary trust which, if \n     breached, constituted a basis for their dismissal.\n       A few years after the conclusion of World War II, President \n     Harry S. Truman, in February 1950, issued E.O. 10104, which, \n     while superseding E.O. 8381, basically reiterated its text, \n     but added a fourth Top Secret classification designation to \n     existing Restricted, Confidential, and Secret markings, \n     making American information security categories consistent \n     with those of our allies. At the time of the promulgation of \n     this order, however, plans were underway for a complete \n     overhaul of the classification program, which would result in \n     a dramatic change in policy.\n       E.O. 10290, issued in September 1951, introduced three \n     sweeping innovations in security classification policy. \n     First, the order indicated the Chief Executive was relying \n     upon ``the authority vested in me by the Constitution and \n     statutes, and as President of the United States'' in issuing \n     the directive. This formula appeared to strengthen the \n     President's discretion to make official secrecy policy: it \n     intertwined his responsibility as Commander in Chief with the \n     constitutional obligation to ``take care that the laws be \n     faithfully executed.'' Second, information was now classified \n     in the interest of ``national security,'' a somewhat new, but \n     nebulous, concept, which, in the view of some, conveyed more \n     latitude for the creation of official secrets. It replaced \n     the heretofore relied upon ``national defense'' standard for \n     classification. Third, the order extended classification \n     authority to nonmilitary entities throughout the executive \n     branch, to be exercised by, presumably, but not explicitly \n     limited to, those having some role in ``national \n     security'' policy.\n       The broad discretion to create official secrets granted by \n     E.G. 10290 engendered widespread criticism from the public \n     and the press. In response, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, \n     shortly after his election to office, instructed Attorney \n     General Herbert Brownell to review the order with a view to \n     revising or rescinding it. The subsequent recommendation was \n     for a new directive, which was issued in November 1953 as \n     E.O. 10501. It withdrew classification authority from 28 \n     entities, limited this discretion in 17 other units to the \n     agency head, returned to the ``national defense'' standard \n     for applying secrecy, eliminated the ``Restricted'' category, \n     which was the lowest level of protection, and explicitly \n     defined the remaining three classification areas to prevent \n     their indiscriminate use.\n       Thereafter, E.G. 10501, with slight amendment, prescribed \n     operative security classification policy and procedure for \n     the next two decades. Successor orders built on this reform. \n     These included E.O. 11652, issued by President Richard M. \n     Nixon in March 1972, followed by E.O. 12065, promulgated by \n     President Jimmy Carter in June 1978. For 30 years, these \n     classification directives narrowed the bases and discretion \n     for assigning official secrecy to executive branch documents \n     and materials. Then, in April 1982, this trend was reversed \n     with E.O. 12356, issued by President Ronald Reagan. This \n     order expanded the categories of classifiable information, \n     mandated that information falling within these categories be \n     classified, authorized the reclassification of previously \n     declassified documents, admonished classifiers to err on the \n     side of classification, and eliminated automatic \n     declassification arrangements.\n       President William Clinton returned security classification \n     policy and procedure to the reform trend of the Eisenhower, \n     Nixon, and Carter Administrations with E.O. 12958 in April \n     1995. Adding impetus to the development and issuance of the \n     new order were changing world conditions: the democratization \n     of many eastern European countries, the demise of the Soviet \n     Union, and the end of the Cold War. Accountability and cost \n     considerations were also significant influences. In 1985, the \n     temporary Department of Defense (DOD) Security Review \n     Commission, chaired by retired General Richard G. Stilwell, \n     declared that there were ``no verifiable figures as to the \n     amount of classified material produced in DOD and in defense \n     industry each year.'' Nonetheless, it concluded that ``too \n     much information appears to be classified and much at higher \n     levels than is warranted.'' In October 1993, the cost of the \n     security classification program became clearer when the \n     General Accounting Office (GAO) reported that it was ``able \n     to identify government-wide costs directly applicable to \n     national security information totaling over $350 million for \n     1992.'' After breaking this figure down--it included only $6 \n     million for declassification work--the report added that \n     ``the U.S. government also spends additional billions of \n     dollars annually to safeguard information, personnel, and \n     property.'' E.O. 12958 set limits for the duration of \n     classification, prohibited the reclassification of properly \n     declassified records, authorized government employees to \n     challenge the classification status of records, reestablished \n     the balancing test of E.O. 12065 weighing the need to protect \n     information vis-a-vis the public interest in its disclosure, \n     and created two review panels--one on classification and \n     declassification actions and one to advise on policy and \n     procedure.\n       Most recently, in March 2003, President George W. Bush \n     issued E.O. 13292, amending E.O. 12958. Among the changes \n     made by this order were adding infrastructure vulnerabilities \n     or capabilities, protection services relating to national \n     security, and weapons of mass destruction to the categories \n     of classifiable information; easing the reclassification of \n     declassified records; postponing the automatic \n     declassification of protected records 25 or more years old, \n     beginning in mid-April 2003 to the end of December 2006; \n     eliminating the requirement that agencies prepare plans for \n     declassifying records; and permitting the Director of Central \n     Intelligence to block declassification actions of the \n     Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel, unless \n     overruled by the President.\n       The security classification program has evolved during the \n     past 66 years. One may not agree with all of its rules and \n     requirements, but attention to detail in its policy and \n     procedure result in a significant management regime. The \n     operative executive order, as amended, defines its principal \n     terms. Those who are authorized to exercise original \n     classification authority are identified. Exclusive categories \n     of classifiable information are specified, as are the terms \n     of the duration of classification, as well as classification \n     prohibitions and limitations. Classified information is \n     required to be marked appropriately along with the identity \n     of the original classifier, the agency or office of origin, \n     and a date or event for declassification. Authorized holders \n     of classified information who believe that its protected \n     status is improper are ``encouraged and expected'' to \n     challenge that status through prescribed arrangements. \n     Mandatory declassification reviews are also authorized to \n     determine if protected records merit continued classification \n     at their present level, a lower level, or at all. \n     Unsuccessful classification challenges\n\n[[Page S10467]]\n\n     and mandatory declassification reviews are subject to review \n     by the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel. \n     General restrictions on access to classified information are \n     prescribed, as are distribution controls for classified \n     information. The Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) \n     within the National Archives and Records Administration \n     (NARA) is mandated to provide central management and \n     oversight of the security classification program. If the \n     director of this entity finds that a violation of the order \n     or its implementing directives has occurred, it must be \n     reported to the head of the agency or to the appropriate \n     senior agency official so that corrective steps, if \n     appropriate, may be taken.\n       While Congress, thus far, has elected not to create \n     statutorily mandated security classification policy and \n     procedures, the option to do so has been explored in the \n     past, and its legislative authority to do so has been \n     recognized by the Supreme Court. Congress, however, has \n     established protections for certain kinds of information--\n     such as Restricted Data in the Atomic Energy Acts of 1946 and \n     1954, and intelligence sources and methods in the National \n     Security Act of 1947--which have been realized through \n     security classification arrangements. It has acknowledged \n     properly applied security classification as a basis for \n     withholding records sought pursuant to the Freedom of \n     Information Act. Also, with a view to efficiency and economy, \n     as well as effective records management, committees of \n     Congress, on various occasions, have conducted oversight of \n     security classification policy and practice, and have been \n     assisted by GAO and CRS in this regard.\n\n\n                 Sensitive but Unclassified Information\n\n       The widespread existence and use of information control \n     markings other than those prescribed for the security \n     classification of information came to congressional attention \n     in March 1972 when a subcommittee of what is now the House \n     Committee on Government Reform launched the first oversight \n     hearings on the administration and operation of the Freedom \n     of Information Act (FOIA). Enacted in 1966, FOIA had become \n     operative in July 1967. In the early months of 1972, the \n     Nixon Administration was developing new security \n     classification policy and procedure, which would be \n     prescribed in E.O. 11652, issued in early March. Preparatory \n     to this hearing, the panel had surveyed the departments and \n     agencies in August 1971, asking, among other questions, \n     ``What legend is used by your agency to identify records \n     which are not classifiable under Executive Order 10501 [the \n     operative order at the time] but which are not to be made \n     available outside the government?'' Of 58 information control \n     markings identified in response to this question, the most \n     common were For Official Use Only (11 agencies); Limited \n     Official Use (nine agencies); Official Use Only (eight \n     agencies); Restricted Data (five agencies); Administratively \n     Restricted (four agencies); Formerly Restricted Data (four \n     agencies); and Nodis, or no dissemination (four agencies). \n     Seven other markings were used by two agencies in each case. \n     A CRS review of the agency responses to the control markings \n     question prompted the following observation.\n       Often no authority is cited for the establishment or origin \n     of these labels; even when some reference is provided it is a \n     handbook, manual, administrative order, or a circular but not \n     statutory authority. Exceptions to this are the Atomic Energy \n     Commission, the Defense Department and the Arms Control and \n     Disarmament Agency. These agencies cite the Atomic Energy \n     Act, N.A.T.O. related laws, and international agreements as a \n     basis for certain additional labels. The Arms Control and \n     Disarmament Agency acknowledged it honored and adopted State \n     and Defense Department labels.\n       Over three decades later, it appears that approximately the \n     same number of these information control markings are in use; \n     that the majority of them are administratively, not \n     statutorily, prescribed; and that many of them have an \n     inadequate management regime, particularly when compared with \n     the detailed arrangements which govern the management of \n     classified information. A recent press account illustrates \n     another problem. In late January 2005, GCN Update, the \n     online, electronic news service of Government Computer News, \n     reported that ``dozens of classified Homeland Security \n     Department documents'' had been accidently made available on \n     a public Internet site for several days due to an apparent \n     security glitch at the Department of Energy. Describing the \n     contents of the compromised materials and reactions to the \n     breach, the account stated the ``documents were marked `for \n     official use only,' the lowest secret-level classification.'' \n     The documents, of course, were not security classified, \n     because the marking cited is not authorized by E.O. 12958. \n     Interestingly, however, in view of the fact that this \n     misinterpretation appeared in a story to which three \n     reporters contributed, perhaps it reflects, to some extent, \n     the current confusion of these information control markings \n     with security classification designations.\n       Broadly considering the contemporary situation regarding \n     information control markings, a recent information security \n     report by the JASON Program Office of the MITRE Corporation \n     proffered the following assessment.\n       The status of sensitive information outside of the present \n     classification system is murkier than ever. ``Sensitive but \n     unclassified'' data is increasingly defined by the eye of the \n     beholder. Lacking in definition, it is correspondingly \n     lacking in policies and procedures for protecting (or not \n     protecting) it, and regarding how and by whom it is generated \n     and used.\n       A contemporaneous Heritage Foundation report appeared to \n     agree with this appraisal, saying:\n       The process for classifying secret information in the \n     federal government is disciplined and explicit. The same \n     cannot be said for unclassified but security-related \n     information for which there is no usable definition, no \n     common understanding about how to control it, no agreement on \n     what significance it has for U.S. national security, and no \n     means for adjudicating concerns regarding appropriate levels \n     of protection.\n       Concerning the current Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) \n     marking, a 2004 report by the Federal Research Division of \n     the Library of Congress commented that guidelines for its \n     use are needed, and noted that ``a uniform legal \n     definition or set of procedures applicable to all Federal \n     government agencies does not now exist.'' Indeed, the \n     report indicates that SBU has been utilized in different \n     contexts with little precision as to its scope or meaning, \n     and, to add a bit of chaos to an already confusing \n     situation, is ``often referred to as Sensitive Homeland \n     Security Information.\n       Assessments of the variety, management, and impact of \n     information control markings, other than those prescribed for \n     the classification of national security information, have \n     been conducted by CRS, GAO, and the National Security \n     Archive, a private sector research and resource center \n     located at The George Washington University. In March 2006, \n     GAO indicated that, in a recent survey, 26 federal agencies \n     reported using 56 different information control markings to \n     protect sensitive information other than classified national \n     security materia1. That same month, the National Security \n     Archive offered that, of 37 agencies surveyed, 24 used 28 \n     control markings based on internal policies, procedures, or \n     practices, and eight used 10 markings based on statutory \n     authority. These numbers are important in terms of the \n     variety of such markings. GAO explained this dimension of the \n     management problem.\n       [T]here are at least 13 agencies that use the designation \n     For Official Use Only [FOUO], but there are at least five \n     different definitions of FOUO. At least seven agencies or \n     agency components use the term Law Enforcement Sensitive \n     (LES), including the U.S. Marshals Service, the Department of \n     Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Commerce, and the \n     Office of Personnel Management (OPM). These agencies gave \n     differing definitions for the term. While DHS does not \n     formally define the designation, the Department of Commerce \n     defines it to include information pertaining to the \n     protection of senior government officials, and OPM defines it \n     as unclassified information used by law enforcement personnel \n     that requires protection against unauthorized disclosure to \n     protect the sources and methods of investigative activity, \n     evidence, and the integrity of pretrial investigative \n     reports.\n       Apart from the numbers, however, is another aspect of the \n     management problem, which GAO described in the following \n     terms.\n       There are no governmentwide policies or procedures that \n     describe the basis on which agencies should use most of these \n     sensitive but unclassified designations, explain what the \n     different designations mean across agencies, or ensure that \n     they will be used consistently from one agency to another. In \n     this absence, each agency determines what designations to \n     apply to the sensitive but unclassified information it \n     develops or shares.\n       These markings also have implications in another regard. \n     The importance of information sharing for combating terrorism \n     and realizing homeland security was emphasized by the \n     National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United \n     States. That the variously identified and marked forms of \n     sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information could be \n     problematic with regard to information sharing was recognized \n     by Congress when fashioning the Homeland Security Act of \n     2002. Section 892 of that statute specifically directed the \n     President to prescribe and implement procedures for the \n     sharing of information by relevant federal agencies, \n     including the accommodation of ``homeland security \n     information that is sensitive but unclassified.'' On July 29, \n     2003, the President assigned this responsibility largely to \n     the Secretary of Homeland Security. Nothing resulted. The \n     importance of information sharing was reinforced two years \n     later in the report of the Commission on the Intelligence \n     Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass \n     Destruction. Congress again responded by mandating the \n     creation of an Information Sharing Environment (ISE) when \n     legislating the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention \n     Act of 2004. Preparatory to implementing the ISE provisions, \n     the President issued a December 16, 2005, memorandum \n     recognizing the need for standardized procedures for SBU \n     information and directing department and agency officials to \n     take certain actions relative to that objective. In May 2006, \n     the newly appointed manager of the ISE agreed with a March \n     GAO assessment that, oftentimes, SBU information, designated \n     as such with some marking, was not being shared due to \n     concerns about the ability of recipients to adequately \n     protect it. In brief, it appears that pseudo-classification \n     markings have, in some instances, had the effect of deterring \n     information sharing for homeland security purposes.\n       Congressional overseers have probed executive use and \n     management of information\n\n[[Page S10468]]\n\n     control markings other than those prescribed for the \n     classification of national security information, and the \n     extent to which they result in ``pseudo-classification'' or a \n     form of overclassification. Relevant remedial legislation \n     proposed during the 109th Congress includes two bills (H.R. \n     2331 and H.R. 5112) containing sections which would require \n     the Archivist of the United States to prepare a detailed \n     report regarding the number, use, and management of these \n     information control markings and submit it to specified \n     congressional committees, and to promulgate regulations \n     banning the use of these markings and otherwise establish \n     standards for information control designations established by \n     statute or an executive order relating to the classification \n     of national security information. A section in the Department \n     of Homeland Security appropriations legislation (H.R. 5441), \n     as approved by the House, would require the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security to revise DHS MD (Management Directive) \n     11056 to include (1) provision that information that is three \n     years old and not incorporated in a current, active \n     transportation security directive or security plan shall be \n     determined automatically to be releasable unless, for each \n     specific document, the Secretary makes a written \n     determination that identifies a compelling reason why the \n     information must remain Sensitive Security Information (SSI); \n     (2) common and extensive examples of the individual \n     categories of SSI cited in order to minimize and standardize \n     judgment in the application of SSI marking; and (3) provision \n     that, in all judicial proceedings where the judge overseeing \n     the proceedings has adjudicated that a party needs to have \n     access to SSI, the party shall be deemed a covered person for \n     purposes of access to the SSI at issue in the case unless TSA \n     or DHS demonstrates a compelling reason why the specific \n     individual presents a risk of harm to the nation. A May 25, \n     2006, statement of administration policy on the bill strongly \n     opposed the section, saying it ``would jeopardize an \n     important program that protects Sensitive Security \n     Information (SSI) from public release by deeming it \n     automatically releaseable in three years, potentially \n     conflict with requirements of the Privacy and Freedom of \n     Information Acts, and negate statutory provisions providing \n     original jurisdiction for lawsuits challenging the \n     designation of SSI materials in the U.S. Courts of Appeals.'' \n     The statement further indicated that the section would create \n     a ``burdensome review process'' for the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security and ``would result in different statutory \n     requirements being applied to SSI programs administered by \n     the Departments of Homeland Security and Transportation.''\n       It is not anticipated that this memorandum will be updated \n     for reissuance.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Government Efficiency, Financial \n  Management and Intergovernmental Relations, and the Subcommittee on \n   National Security, Veterans Affairs, and International Relations, \n       Committee on Governmental Reform, House of Representatives\n\n                United States General Accounting Office\n\n                      CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY\n\n     Observations on GAO Access to Information on CIA Programs and \n                               Activities\n\n     Statement of Henry L.

Chairmen and Members of the Subcommittees:\n       We are pleased to be here to discuss the subject of access \n     by the General Accounting Office (GAO) to information from \n     the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Specifically, our \n     statement will provide some background on CIA and its \n     oversight mechanisms, our authority to review CIA programs, \n     and the history and status of GAO access to CIA information. \n     As requested, our remarks will focus on our relationship with \n     the CIA and not with other intelligence agencies. Our \n     comments are based upon our review of historic files, our \n     legal analysis, and our experiences dealing with the CIA over \n     the years.\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       Oversight of the CIA generally comes from two select \n     committees of Congress and the CIA's Inspector General. We \n     have broad authority to evaluate CIA programs. In reality, \n     however, we face both legal and practical limitations on our \n     ability to review these programs. For example, we have no \n     access to certain CIA ``unvouchered'' accounts and cannot \n     compel our access to foreign intelligence and \n     counterintelligence information. In addition, as a practical \n     matter, we are limited by the CIA's level of cooperation, \n     which has varied through the years. We have not actively \n     audited the CIA since the early 1960s, when we discontinued \n     such work because the CIA was not providing us with \n     sufficient access to information to perform our mission. The \n     issue has arisen since then from time to time as our work has \n     required some level of access to CIA programs and \n     information. However, given a lack of requests from the \n     Congress for us to do specific work at the CIA and our \n     limited resources, we have made a conscious decision not to \n     further pursue the issue.\n       Today, our dealings with the CIA are mostly limited to \n     requesting information that relates either to governmentwide \n     reviews or analyses of threats to U.S. national security on \n     which the CIA might have some information. The CIA either \n     provides us with the requested information, provides the \n     information with some restrictions, or does not provide the \n     information at all. In general, we are most successful at \n     getting access to CIA information when we request threat \n     assessments and the CIA does not perceive our audits as \n     oversight of its activities.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       As you know, the General Accounting Office is the \n     investigative arm of the Congress and is headed by the \n     Comptroller General of the United States--currently David M. \n     Walker. We support the Congress in meeting its constitutional \n     responsibilities and help improve the performance \n     and accountability of the federal government for the \n     American people. We examine the use of public funds, \n     evaluate federal programs and activities, and provide \n     analyses, options, recommendations, and other assistance \n     to help the Congress make effective oversight, policy, and \n     funding decisions. Almost 90 percent of our staff days are \n     in direct support of Congressional requestors, generally \n     on the behalf of committee chairmen or ranking members.\n       The U.S. Intelligence Community consists of those Executive \n     Branch agencies and organizations that work in concert to \n     carry out our nation's intelligence activities. The CIA is an \n     Intelligence Community agency established under the National \n     Security Act of 1947 to coordinate the intelligence \n     activities of several U.S. departments and agencies in the \n     interest of national security. Among other functions, the CIA \n     collects, produces, and disseminates foreign intelligence and \n     counterintelligence; conducts counterintelligence activities \n     abroad; collects, produces, and disseminates intelligence on \n     foreign aspects of narcotics production and trafficking; \n     conducts special activities approved by the President; and \n     conducts research, development, and procurement of technical \n     systems and devices.\n\n\n                      Oversight of CIA Activities\n\n       Currently, two congressional select committees and the \n     CIA's Inspector General oversee the CIA's activities. The \n     Senate Select Committee on Intelligence was established on \n     May 19, 1976, to oversee the activities of the Intelligence \n     Community. Its counterpart in the House of Representatives is \n     the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, \n     established on July 14, 1977. The CIA's Inspector General is \n     nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The \n     Office of the Inspector General was established by statute in \n     1989 and conducts inspections, investigations, and audits at \n     headquarters and in the field. The Inspector General reports \n     directly to the CIA Director. In addition, the President's \n     Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board assesses the quality, \n     quantity, and adequacy of intelligence activities. Within the \n     Board, there is an intelligence oversight committee that \n     prepares reports on intelligence activities that may be \n     unlawful or otherwise inappropriate. Finally, the Congress \n     can charter commissions to evaluate intelligence agencies \n     such as CIA. One such commission was the Commission on the \n     Roles and Capabilities of the United States Intelligence \n     Community, which issued a report in 1996.\n\n\n                 GAG's Authority to Review CIA Programs\n\n       Generally, we have broad authority to evaluate agency \n     programs and investigate matters related to the receipt, \n     disbursement, and use of public money. To carry out our audit \n     responsibilities, we have a statutory right of access to \n     agency records. Federal agencies are required to provide us \n     information about their duties, powers, activities, \n     organization, and financial transactions. This requirement \n     applies to all federal agencies, including the CIA. Our \n     access rights include the authority to file a civil action to \n     compel production of records, unless (a) the records relate \n     to activities the President has designated as foreign \n     intelligence or counterintelligence activities, (b) the \n     records are specifically exempt from disclosure by statute, \n     or (c) the records would be exempt from release under the \n     Freedom of Information Act because they are predecisional \n     memoranda or law enforcement records and the President or \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget certifies \n     that disclosure of the record could be expected to impair \n     substantially the operations of the government.\n       The National Security Act of 1947 charges the CIA Director \n     with protecting intelligence sources and methods from \n     unauthorized disclosure. In terms of our statutory access \n     authority, however, the law creates only one specific \n     exemption: the so-called ``unvouchered'' accounts. The \n     exemption pertains to expenditures of a confidential, \n     extraordinary, or emergency nature that are accounted for \n     solely on the certification of the Director. These \n     transactions are subject to review by the intelligence \n     committees. Amendments to the law require the President to \n     keep the intelligence committees fully and currently informed \n     of the intelligence activities of the United States. The CIA \n     has maintained that the Congress intended the intelligence \n     committees to be the exclusive means of oversight of the CIA, \n     effectively precluding oversight by us.\n       While we understand the role of the intelligence committees \n     and the need to protect intelligence sources and methods, we \n     also believe that our authorities are broad enough to cover \n     the management and administrative functions that the CIA \n     shares with all federal agencies.\n       We have summarized the statutes relevant to our \n     relationship with the CIA in an appendix attached to this \n     testimony.\n\n[[Page S10469]]\n\n                gao's access to the cia has been limited\n\n       We have not done audit work at the CIA for almost 40 years. \n     Currently, our access to the CIA is limited to requests for \n     information that relates either to governmentwide reviews or \n     programs for which the CIA might have relevant information. \n     In general, we have the most success obtaining access to CIA \n     information when we request threat assessments, and the CIA \n     does not perceive our audits as oversight of its activities.\n\n\n             gao access to cia has varied through the years\n\n       After the enactment of the National Security Act of 1947, \n     we began conducting financial transaction audits of vouchered \n     expenditures of the CIA. This effort continued into the early \n     1960s. In the late 1950s, we proposed to broaden its work at \n     the CIA to include an examination of the efficiency, economy, \n     and effectiveness of CIA programs. Although the CIA Director \n     agreed to our proposal to expand the scope of our work, he \n     placed a number of conditions on our access to information. \n     Nonetheless, in October 1959, we agreed to conduct program \n     review work with CIA-imposed restrictions on access.\n       Our attempt to conduct comprehensive program review work \n     continued until May 1961, when the Comptroller General \n     concluded that the CIA was not providing us with sufficient \n     access to the information necessary to conduct comprehensive \n     reviews of the CIA's programs and announced plans to \n     discontinue audit work there. After much discussion and \n     several exchanges of correspondence between GAO, the CIA, and \n     the cognizant congressional committees, the Chairman of the \n     House Armed Services Committee wrote to the Comptroller \n     General in July 1962 agreeing that, absent sufficient GAO \n     access to CIA information, GAO should withdraw from further \n     audit activities at the CIA. Thus, in 1962, we withdrew from \n     all audits of CIA activities.\n       The issue of our access has arisen periodically in the \n     intervening years as our work has required some level of \n     access to CIA programs and activities. In July 1975, \n     Comptroller General Elmer Staats testified on our \n     relationship with the intelligence community and cited \n     several cases where CIA had not provided us with the \n     requested information. In July 1987, Senator John Glenn \n     introduced a bill (S. 1458) in the 100th Congress to clarify \n     our audit authority to audit CIA programs and activities. In \n     1994, the CIA Director sought to further limit our audit work \n     of intelligence programs, including those at the Department \n     of Defense. We responded by writing to several key members of \n     the Congress, citing our concerns and seeking assistance. As \n     a result, we and the CIA began negotiations on a written \n     agreement to clarify our access and relationship. \n     Unfortunately, we were unable to reach any agreement with CIA \n     on this matter. Since then, GAO has limited its pursuit of \n     greater access because of limited demand for this work from \n     Congress, particularly from the intelligence committees. \n     Given a lack of Congressional requests and our limited \n     resources, we have made a conscious decision to deal with the \n     CIA on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\n               current access falls into three categories\n\n       Currently, the CIA responds to our requests for information \n     in three ways: it provides the information, it provides the \n     information or a part of it with some restriction, or it does \n     not provide the information at all. Examples of each of these \n     three situations, based on the experiences of our audit staff \n     in selected reviews in recent years, are listed below.\n       Sometimes the CIA straightforwardly fulfills our requests \n     for briefings or reports related to threat assessments. This \n     is especially true when we ask for threat briefings or the \n     CIA's assessments or opinions on an issue not involving CIA \n     operations.\n       For our review of the State Department's Anthrax \n     Vaccination Program for the Senate Foreign Relations and \n     House International Relations Committees, we requested a \n     meeting to discuss the CIA's perspective on a recent threat \n     assessment of chemical and biological threats to U.S. \n     interests overseas. The CIA agreed with our request, provided \n     a meeting within 2 weeks, and followed up with a written \n     statement.\n       While we were reviewing U.S. assistance to the Haitian \n     justice system and national police on behalf of the Senate \n     Foreign Relations and House International Relations \n     Committees, we requested a meeting to discuss the Haitian \n     justice system. The CIA agreed with our request and met with \n     our audit team within 3 weeks of our request.\n       For our review of chemical and biological terrorist threats \n     for the House Armed Services Committee, and subcommittees of \n     the House Government Reform Committee and the House Veterans \n     Affairs Committee, we requested meetings with CIA analysts on \n     their threat assessments on chemical and biological weapons. \n     The CIA cooperated and gave us access to documents and \n     analysts.\n       On several of our reviews of counterdrug programs for the \n     House Government Reform Committee and the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee we requested CIA assessments on the drug \n     threat and international activities. The CIA has provided us \n     with detailed briefings on drug cultivation, production, and \n     trafficking activities in advance of our field work overseas.\n       During our reviews of Balkan security issues and the Dayton \n     Peace Accords for the House Armed Services Committee and the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee, we asked the CIA for \n     threat assessments relevant to our review objectives. The CIA \n     provided us with appropriate briefings and agreed to provide \n     one of our staff members with access to regular intelligence \n     reports.\n       In some instances, the CIA provides information with \n     certain access restrictions or discusses an issue with us \n     without providing detailed data or documentation.\n       During our evaluation of equal employment opportunity and \n     disciplinary actions for a subcommittee of the House \n     Committee on the Post Office and Civil Service, the CIA \n     provided us with limited access to information. CIA officials \n     allowed us to review their personnel regulations and take \n     notes, but they did not allow us to review personnel folders \n     on individual disciplinary actions. This was in contrast to \n     the National Security Agency and Defense Intelligence Agency, \n     which gave us full access to personnel folders on individual \n     terminations and disciplinary actions.\n       For our review of the Department of Defense's efforts to \n     address the growing risk to U.S. electronic systems from \n     high-powered radio frequency weapons for the Joint Economic \n     Committee, the CIA limited our access to one meeting. \n     Although the technology associated with such systems was \n     discussed at the meeting, the CIA did not provide any \n     documentation on research being conducted by foreign nations.\n       On some of our audits related to national security issues, \n     the CIA provides us with limited access to its written threat \n     assessments and analyses, such as National Intelligence \n     Estimates. However, the CIA restricts our access to reading \n     the documents and taking notes at the CIA or other locations. \n     Examples include our readings of National Intelligence \n     Estimates related to our ongoing work evaluating federal \n     programs to combat terrorism.\n       In other cases, the CIA simply denies us access to the \n     information we requested. The CIA's refusals are not related \n     to the classification level of the material. Many of our \n     staff have the high-level security clearances and accesses \n     needed to review intelligence information. But the CIA \n     considers our requests as having some implication of \n     oversight and denies us access.\n       For our evaluation of national intelligence estimates \n     regarding missile threats for the House National Security \n     Committee, the CIA refused to meet with us to discuss the \n     general process and criteria for producing such estimates or \n     the specific estimates we were reviewing. In addition, \n     officials from the Departments of Defense, State, and Energy \n     told us that CIA had asked them not to cooperate with us.\n       During our examination of overseas arrests of terrorists \n     for the House Armed Services Committee and a subcommittee of \n     the House Government Reform Committee, the CIA refused to \n     meet with us to discuss intelligence issues related to such \n     arrests. The CIA's actions were in contrast to those of two \n     other departments that provided us full access to their staff \n     and files.\n       On our review of classified computer systems in the federal \n     government for a subcommittee of the House Government Reform \n     Committee, we requested basic information on the number and \n     nature of such systems. The CIA did not provide us with the \n     information, claiming that they would not be able to \n     participate in the review because the type of information is \n     under the purview of congressional entities charged with \n     overseeing the Intelligence Community.\n       For our review of the policies and procedures used by the \n     Executive Office of the President to acquire and safeguard \n     classified intelligence information, done for the House Rules \n     Committee, we asked to review CIA forms documenting that \n     personnel had been granted appropriate clearances. The CIA \n     declined our request, advising us that type of information we \n     were seeking came under the purview of congressional entities \n     charged with overseeing the intelligence community.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Our access to CIA information and programs has been limited \n     by both legal and practical factors. Through the years our \n     access has varied and we have not done detailed audit work at \n     CIA since the early 1960s. Today, our access is generally \n     limited to obtaining information on threat assessments when \n     the CIA does not perceives our audits as oversight of its \n     activities. We foresee no major change in our current access \n     without substantial support from Congress--the requestor of \n     the vast majority of our work. Congressional impetus for \n     change would have to include the support of the intelligence \n     committees, who have generally not requested GAG reviews or \n     evaluations of CIA activities. With such support, we could \n     evaluate some of the basic management functions at CIA that \n     we now evaluate throughout the federal government.\n       This concludes our testimony. We would be happy to answer \n     any questions you may have.\n       GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgment\n       For future questions about this testimony, please contact \n     Henry L.

Reviews are \n     based upon the initiative of the Comptroller General, an \n     order from either House of Congress, or a request from a \n     committee with jurisdiction.\n       31 U.S.C. 3523: This provision authorizes GAO to audit \n     financial transactions of each agency, except as specifically \n     provided by law.\n       31 U.S.C. 3524: This section authorizes GAO to audit \n     unvouchered accounts (i.e., those accounted for solely on the \n     certificate of an executive branch official). The President \n     may exempt sensitive foreign intelligence and \n     counterintelligence transactions. CIA expenditures on objects \n     of a confidential, extraordinary, or emergency nature under \n     50 U.S.C. 403j(b) are also exempt. Transactions in these \n     categories may be reviewed by the intelligence committees.\n\n\n                   gao's access-to-records authority\n\n       31 U.S.C. 716: GAO has a broad right of access to agency \n     records. Subsection 716(a) requires agencies to give GAO \n     information it requires about the ``duties, powers, \n     activities, organization, and financial transactions of the \n     agency.'' This provision gives GAO a generally unrestricted \n     right of access to agency records. GAO in turn is required to \n     maintain the same level of confidentiality for the \n     information as is required of the head of the agency from \n     which it is obtained.\n       Section 716 also gives GAO the authority to enforce its \n     requests for records by filing a civil action in federal \n     district court. Under the enforcement provisions in 31 U.S.C. \n     716(d)(1), GAO is precluded from bringing a civil action to \n     compel the production of a record if:\n       1. the record relates to activities the President \n     designates as foreign intelligence or counterintelligence \n     (see Executive Order No. 12333, defining these terms);\n       2. the record is specifically exempted from disclosure to \n     GAO by statute; or\n       3. the President or the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget certifies to the Comptroller General \n     and Congress that a record could be withheld under the \n     Freedom of Information Act exemptions in 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5) \n     or (7) (relating to deliberative process and law enforcement \n     information, respectively), and that disclosure of the \n     information reasonably could be expected to impair \n     substantially the operations of the government.\n       Although these exceptions do not restrict GAO's basic \n     rights of access under 31 U.S.C. 716(a), they do limit GAO's \n     ability to compel the production of particular records \n     through a court action.\n\n\n                        relevant cia legislation\n\n       The CIA has broad authority to protect intelligence-related \n     information but must keep the intelligence committees fully \n     and currently informed of the intelligence activities of the \n     United States.\n       50 U.S.C. 403-3(c)(6) and 403g: Section 403-3 requires the \n     Director of the CIA to protect ``intelligence sources and \n     methods from unauthorized disclosure. . . .'' Section 403g \n     exempts the CIA from laws ``which require the publication or \n     disclosure of the organization, functions, names, official \n     titles, salaries, or numbers of personnel employed by the \n     Agency. With the exception of unvouchered expenditures, CIA's \n     disclosure of information to GAO would be an authorized and \n     proper disclosure under 31 U.S.C. 716(a).\n       50 U.S.C. 403j: The CIA has broad discretion to use \n     appropriated funds for various purposes (e.g., personal \n     services, transportation, printing and binding, and purchases \n     of firearms) without regard to laws and regulations relating \n     to the expenditure of government funds. The statute also \n     authorizes the Director to establish an unvouchered account \n     for objects of a confidential, extraordinary, or emergency \n     nature. We recognize that the CIA's unvouchered account \n     authority constitutes an exception to GAO's audit and access \n     authority, but this account deals with only a portion of \n     CIA's funding activities.\n       50 U.S.C. 413: This section provides a method for \n     maintaining congressional oversight over intelligence \n     activities within the executive branch. The statute requires \n     the President to ensure that the intelligence committees (the \n     Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House \n     Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence are kept fully and \n     currently informed of U.S. intelligence activities.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                            Report Language\n\n       Section 1 of the Act provides that the Act may be cited as \n     the ``Intelligence Community Audit Act of 2006''.\n       Section 2(a) of the Act adds a new Section (3523a) to title \n     31, United States Code, with respect to the Comptroller \n     General's authority to audit or evaluate activities of the \n     intelligence community. New Section 3523a(b)(1) reaffirms \n     that the Comptroller General possesses, under his existing \n     statutory authority, the authority to perform audits and \n     evaluations of financial transactions, programs, and \n     activities of elements of the intelligence community and to \n     obtain access to records for the purposes of such audits and \n     evaluations. Such work could be done at the request of the \n     congressional intelligence committees or any committee of \n     jurisdiction of the House of Representatives or Senate \n     (including the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs of the Senate), or at the Comptroller \n     General's initiative, pursuant to the existing authorities \n     referenced in new Section 3523a(b)(1). New Section \n     3523a(b)(2) further provides that these audits and \n     evaluations under the Comptroller General's existing \n     authority may include, but are not limited to, matters \n     relating to the management and administration of elements of \n     the intelligence community in areas such as strategic \n     planning, financial management, information technology, human \n     capital, knowledge management, information sharing, and \n     change management. These audits and evaluations would be \n     accompanied by the safeguards that the Government \n     Accountability Office (GAO) has in place to protect \n     classified and other sensitive information, including \n     physical security arrangements, classification and \n     sensitivity reviews, and restricted distribution of certain \n     products.\n       This reaffirmation is designed to respond to Executive \n     Branch assertions that GAO does not have the authority to \n     review activities of the intelligence community. To the \n     contrary, GAO's current statutory audit and access \n     authorities permit it to evaluate a wide range of activities \n     in the intelligence community. To further ensure that GAO's \n     authorities are appropriately construed in the future, the \n     new Section 3523a(e), which is described below, makes clear \n     that nothing in this or any other provision of law shall be \n     construed as restricting or limiting the Comptroller \n     General's authority to audit and evaluate, or obtain access \n     to the records of, elements of the intelligence community \n     absent specific statutory language restricting or limiting \n     such audits, evaluations, or access to records.\n       New Section 3523a(c)(1) provides that Comptroller General \n     audits or evaluations of intelligence sources and methods, or \n     covert actions may be undertaken only upon the request of the \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate, or the \n     Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives, or the majority or the minority leader of \n     the Senate or the House of Representatives. This limitation \n     is intended to recognize the heightened sensitivity of audits \n     and evaluations relating to intelligence sources and methods, \n     or covert actions.\n       The new Section 3523a(c)(2)(A) provides that the results of \n     such audits or evaluations under Section 3523a(c) may be \n     disclosed only to the original requestor, the Director of \n     National Intelligence, and the head of the relevant element \n     of the intelligence community. Since the methods GAO uses to \n     communicate the results of its audits or evaluations vary, \n     this provision restricts the dissemination of GAO's findings \n     under Section 3523a(c), whether through testimony, oral \n     briefings, or written reports, to only the original \n     requestor, the Director of National Intelligence, and the \n     head of the relevant element of the intelligence \n     community. Similarly, under new Section 3523a(c)(2)(B), \n     the Comptroller General may only provide information \n     obtained in the course of such an audit or evaluation to \n     the original requestor, the Director of National \n     Intelligence, and the head of the relevant element of the \n     intelligence community.\n       The new Section 3523a(c)(3)(A) provides that \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Comptroller \n     General may inspect records of any element of the \n     intelligence community relating to intelligence sources and \n     methods, or covert actions in order to perform audits and \n     evaluations pursuant to Section 3523a(c). The Comptroller \n     General's access extends to any records which belong to, or \n     are in the possession and control of, the element of the \n     intelligence community regardless of who was the original \n     owner of such information. Under new Section 3523a(c)(3)(B), \n     the Comptroller General may enforce the access rights \n     provided under this subsection pursuant to section 716 of \n     title 31. However, before the Comptroller General files a \n     report pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 716(b)(1), the Comptroller \n     General must consult with the original requestor concerning \n     the Comptroller General's intent to file a report.\n       The new Section 3523a(c)(4) reiterates the Comptroller \n     General's obligations to protect the confidentiality of \n     information and adds special safeguards to protect records \n     and information obtained from elements of the intelligence \n     community for audits and evaluations performed under Section \n     3523a(c). For example, pursuant to new Section \n     3523a(c)(4)(B), the Comptroller General is to maintain on \n     site, in facilities furnished by the element of the \n     intelligence community subject to audit or evaluation, all \n     workpapers and records obtained for the audit or evaluation. \n     Under new Section 3523a(c)(4)(C), the Comptroller General is \n     directed, after consulting with the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the Senate and the Permanent Select Committee \n     on Intelligence of the House of Representatives, to establish \n     procedures to protect from unauthorized disclosure all \n     classified and other sensitive information furnished to the \n     Comptroller General under Section 3523a(c). Under new Section \n     3523a(c)(4)(D), prior to initiating an audit or evaluation \n     under Section 3523a(c), the Comptroller General shall provide \n     the Director of National Intelligence and the head of the \n     relevant element of the intelligence community with the name \n     of each officer and employee of the Government Accountability \n     Office who has obtained appropriate security clearances.\n\n[[Page S10471]]\n\n       The new Section 3523a(d) provides that elements of the \n     intelligence community shall cooperate fully with the \n     Comptroller General and provide timely responses to \n     Comptroller General requests for documentation and \n     information.\n       The new Section 3523a(e) makes clear that nothing in this \n     or any other provision of law shall be construed as \n     restricting or limiting the Comptroller General's authority \n     to audit and evaluate, or obtain access to the records of, \n     elements of the intelligence community absent specific \n     statutory language restricting or limiting such audits, \n     evaluations, or access to records.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 3968\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Toxic Substances Control Act to assess \nand reduce the levels of lead found in child-occupied facilities in the \nUnited States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Lead \nPoisoning Reduction Act of 2006. I am pleased that Senator Clinton is \njoining me in this effort.\n  Lead is a poison we have known about for a long time. Studies have \nlong linked lead exposure to learning disabilities, behavioral \nproblems, and, at very high levels, seizures, coma, and even death. \nLead is particularly damaging to children because their developing \nbrains are more susceptible to harm.\n  A study released last week found that children with even very low \nlevels of lead exposure have four times the risk of attention-deficit \nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD) than normal and that childhood lead \nexposure leads to 290,000 cases of ADHD.\n  The major source of lead exposure among U.S. children is lead-based \npaint. In 1978, the Consumer Product Safety Commission recognized this \nhazard and banned leaded paints. But today, 30 years later, about 24 \nmillion older homes, and millions of other buildings, have \ndeteriorating lead paint and elevated levels of lead-contaminated dust.\n  We know how children are typically exposed. We know what the health \neffects from exposure are. And we know how to fix the source of the \nexposure. The one thing we don't know how to do is reverse the brain \ndamage once it has occurred. So, otherwise healthy children wind up \nfacing a lifetime of disadvantage because we have failed to eradicate \nthis insidious problem.\n  Every day, millions of American parents drop their children off at \nchild care facilities on their way to work. Nearly 12 million children \nunder age 5 spend 40 hours a week in child care. And every day, many of \nthose children in older buildings may be exposed to lead poisoning.\n  While many child care facilities have taken steps to ensure sources \nof potential lead exposure are eliminated, too many operate in older \nbuildings that need repair or remodeling to ensure these sources are \ncontained. These facilities may be in wealthy communities, but more \noften than not, they are in poor communities where parents have few \nchoices for child care. I'm sure many of these facilities would fix the \nproblem if they only had the resources.\n  The Lead Poisoning Reduction Act protects our children in two ways.\n  First, the bill establishes a five-year, $42.6 million grant program \nto help communities reduce lead exposure in facilities such as day care \ncenters, Head Start centers, and kindergarten classrooms where young \nchildren spend a great deal of time. Communities\n\n[[Page S10472]]\n\ncould use the funds for testing, abatement, and communicating the risks \nof lead to children and parents.\n  Second, the bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency to \nestablish regulations to eliminate sources of lead exposure in child \ncare facilities, starting with new facilities in 18 months and all \nfacilities in five years.\n  It's a straightforward fix to a straightforward problem. I hope my \ncolleagues join me in helping to create lead-safe environments in all \nchild care facilities.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Obama, in \nsupport of the Lead Poisoning Reduction Act of 2006. This legislation \nwould close an important gap in primary prevention strategies by \nproviding critical resources to make all nonhome-based childcare \nfacilities and Head Start Programs lead-safe within 5 years.\n  Lead is highly toxic and continues to be a serious, persistent, and \nentirely preventable threat to the health and well-being of our \nchildren. Lead poisoning continues to pose an unacceptable \nenvironmental health risk to infants, children, and pregnant women in \nthe United States, particularly in minority and low-income communities. \nA CDC survey conducted between 1999 and 2002, estimated that 310,000 \nAmerican children under 6 were at risk for exposure to harmful lead \nlevels in United States. Childhood lead poisoning has been linked to \nimpaired growth and function of vital organs and problems with \nintellectual and behavioral development. A study from the New England \nJournal of Medicine also found that children suffered up to a 7.4-\npercent decrease in IQ at lead levels that CDC considers safe. At very \nhigh levels, lead poisoning can cause seizures, coma, and even death.\n  It is critical that we remove lead hazards where our children live, \nlearn, and play. We especially need to eliminate these risks and \nhazards that continue to persist in childcare facilities and schools. \nNearly 12 million children under age 5 spend 40 hours a week in \nchildcare. Lead paint in older buildings is a primary source of \nexposure, but significant lead exposure can also come from tap water. \nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates that about \n14,200 childcare facilities have considerable lead-based hazards \npresent. In addition, a recent report by the U.S. Government \nAccountability Office, GAO, identified significant, systemic problems \nwith the way in which the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, \nmonitors and regulates the levels of lead in our Nation's drinking \nwater, including a complete lack of reliable data on which to make \nassessments and decisions. The GAO study found that few schools and \nchildcare facilities nationwide have tested their water for lead, and \nno focal point exists at either the national or State level to collect \nand analyze test results. Few States have comprehensive programs to \ndetect and remediate lead in drinking water at schools and childcare \nfacilities. Only five States have required general lead testing for \nschools, and of those, only four require childcare facilities to test \nfor lead when obtaining or renewing their licenses. Almost half the \nStates reported having no lead efforts of any kind. State and local \nofficials need more information on the pervasiveness of lead \ncontamination to know how best to address the issue.\n  Each year in New York State an additional 10,000 children under the \nage of 6 years are newly identified as having elevated blood lead \nlevels, and over 200,000 children in New York have had documented lead \npoisoning between 1992 to 2004. Exposure to lead results in increased \nexpenses each year for New York in the form of special educational and \nother educational expenses, medical care for lead-poisoned children, \nand expenditures for delinquent youth and others needing special \nsupervision. It is estimated that these increased expenses, as well as \nlost earnings, exceed $4 billion annually. New York City and Rochester \nhave been at the forefront of grassroots efforts to combat lead \npoisoning, and this bill would provide important resources and \nincentives to implement their model programs nationwide.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. \n        Burr, and Ms. Murkowski):\n  S. 3972. A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to \nreduce funding shortfalls for the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram (SCHIP) for fiscal year 2007; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the ``Fiscal \nAccountability, Integrity and Responsibility in SCHIP'' or FAIR-SCHIP \nAct. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Johnny \nIsakson, R-GA, Senator Saxby Chambless, R-GA, Senator Richard Burr, R-\nNC and Senator Lisa Murkowski, R-AK. This legislation is a targeted one \nyear approach to addressing a looming problem in the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program (SCHIP).\n  According to estimates prepared by the Congressional Research \nService, as many as 17 States will run out of SCHIP funds in 2007. \nSeveral States will run shortfalls in the hundreds of millions of \ndollars. These shortfalls will result in States having to limit the \ncoverage available to low-income children. These shortfalls are deep \nand they will get deeper.\n  One of my principal objectives in the 110th Congress will be to \nreauthorize the SCHIP program. There are a number of compelling issues \nassociated with the SCHIP program that will require thoughtful review \nand discussion by Members of Congress.\n  Reauthorization will not be easy. Legislating on an issue as complex \nand sensitive as children's health care is never easy. However, if the \nCongress does not act to address some of these policies as well as the \nSCHIP formula, one thing is certain: The current State entitlement is \nnot sufficient, in the long term, to cover the costs of maintaining the \ncurrent level of coverage provided by the States.\n  I am aware of legislation introduced in the Senate and the House that \nwould simply appropriate additional funds to cover the SCHIP \nshortfalls. This is not a viable option.\n  If the Congress perpetuates a scenario where the SCHIP funding \nformula is not improved and other programmatic changes are not enacted, \nyet State SCHIP shortfalls covered year after year, there will be no \npractical difference between SCHIP, which is a capped allotment, and \nMedicaid, which is an open ended entitlement.\n  I do not believe there is majority support for turning the SCHIP \nprogram into an entitlement program. I am concerned what going down a \npath that essentially does treat SCHIP as a de facto entitlement \nprogram means for the long standing viability of SCHIP. Therefore, the \napproach envisioned in FAIR-SCHIP takes a balanced, moderate approach \nto addressing this issue.\n  FAIR-SCHIP recognizes that additional resources will be needed if \nStates are to be able to continue to provide the current level of \ncoverage for children.\n  FAIR-SCHIP also recognizes that funding under the SCHIP programs can \nbe more equitably distributed.\n  FAIR-SCHIP takes a moderate, balanced approach by appropriating \napproximately half of the estimated Fiscal Year 07 shortfall.\n  FAIR-SCHIP also includes a modest redistribution scenario that would \noccur in the second half of the fiscal year and only affect the 05 \nallotments of States which have a 200 percent surplus of SCHIP funds, \nrelative to their projected 07 spending.\n  FAIR-SCHIP is a fiscally sound, responsible approach to the issue of \nSCHIP shortfalls that will position the Congress to achieve important \nprogrammatic improvements in the 110th Congress, when the SCHIP program \nwill need to be reauthorized.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the approach envisioned by FAIR-\nSCHIP.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3972\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \ngrants to promote positive health behaviors in women and children; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today, \nentitled the ``Community Health Workers Act of 2006,'' would improve \naccess to health education and outreach services to women in medically \nunderserved areas, including the U.S. border region along New Mexico.\n  Lack of access to adequate health care and health education is a \nsignificant problem on the southern New Mexico border. While the access \nproblem is in part due to a lack of insurance, it is also attributable \nto non-financial barriers to access. These barriers include a shortage \nof physicians and other health professionals, and hospitals; inadequate \ntransportation; a shortage of bilingual health information and health \nproviders; and culturally insensitive systems of care.\n  This legislation would help to address the issue of access by \nproviding $15 million per year for a three year period in grants to \nState, local, and tribal organizations, including community health \ncenters and public health departments, for the purpose of hiring \ncommunity health workers to provide health education, outreach, and \nreferrals to women and families who otherwise would have little or no \ncontact with health care services.\n  Recognizing factors such as poverty and language and cultural \ndifferences that often serve as barriers to health care access in \nmedically underserved populations, community health workers are in a \nunique position to improve health outcomes and quality of care for \ngroups that have traditionally lacked access to adequate services. They \noften serve as ``community specialists'' and are members of the \ncommunities in which they work. As such they can effectively serve \nhard-to-reach populations.\n  A shining example of how community health workers serve their \ncommunities, a group of so-called ``promotoras'' in Dona Ana County \nwere quickly mobilized during a recent flood emergency in rural New \nMexico. These community health workers assisted in the disaster \nrecovery efforts by partnering with FEMA to find, inform and register \nflood victims for Federal disaster assistance. Their personal networks \nand knowledge of the local culture, language, needs, assets, and \nbarriers greatly enhanced FEMA's community outreach efforts. The \npromotoras of Dona Ana County demonstrate the important role community \nhealth workers could play in communities across the nation, including \nincreasing the effectiveness of new initiatives in homeland security \nand emergency preparedness, and in implementing risk communication \nstrategies.\n  The positive benefits of the community health worker model also have \nbeen documented in research studies. Research has shown that community \nhealth workers have been effective in increasing the utilization of \nhealth preventive services such as cancer screenings and medical follow \nup for elevated blood pressure and improving enrollment in publicly \nfunded health insurance programs. In the case of uninsured children, a \nstudy by Dr. Glenn Flores, ``Community-Based Case Management in \nInsuring Uninsured Latino Children,'' published in the December\n\n[[Page S10474]]\n\n2005 issue of Pediatrics found that uninsured children who received \ncommunity-based case management were eight times more likely to obtain \nhealth insurance coverage than other children involved in the study \nbecause case workers were employed to address typical barriers to \naccess, including insufficient knowledge about application processes \nand eligibility criteria, language barriers and family mobility issues, \namong others. This study confirms that community health workers could \nbe highly effective in reducing the numbers of uninsured children, \nespecially those who are at greatest risk for being uninsured. \nPreliminary investigation of a community health workers project in New \nMexico similarly suggests that community health workers could be useful \nin improving enrollment in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, SCHIP.\n  According to a 2003 Institute of Medicine, IOM, report entitled, \n``Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in \nHealthcare,'' community health workers offer promise as a community-\nbased resource to increase racial and ethnic minorities' access to \nhealth care and to serve as a liaison between healthcare providers and \nthe communities they serve.''\n  Although the community health worker model is valued in the New \nMexico border region as well as other parts of the country that \nencounter challenges of meeting the health care needs of medically \nunderserved populations, these programs often have difficulty securing \nadequate financial resources to maintain and expand upon their \nservices. As a result, many of these programs are significantly limited \nin their ability to meet the ongoing and emerging health demands of \ntheir communities.\n  The IOM report also noted that ``programs to support the use of \ncommunity health workers . . . especially among medically underserved \nand racial and ethnic minority populations, should be expanded, \nevaluated, and replicated.''\n  I am introducing this legislation to increase resources for a model \nthat has shown significant promise for increasing access to quality \nhealth care and health education for families in medically underserved \ncommunities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and Dr. Flores' \nstudy on community-based case management be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3975\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Community Health Workers Act \n     of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Chronic diseases, defined as any condition that \n     requires regular medical attention or medication, are the \n     leading cause of death and disability for women in the United \n     States across racial and ethnic groups.\n       (2) According to the National Vital Statistics Report of \n     2001, the 5 leading causes of death among Hispanic, American \n     Indian, and African-American women are heart disease, cancer, \n     diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, and unintentional \n     injuries.\n       (3) Unhealthy behaviors alone lead to more than 50 percent \n     of premature deaths in the United States.\n       (4) Poor diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use, and \n     alcohol and drug abuse are the health risk behaviors that \n     most often lead to disease, premature death, and disability, \n     and are particularly prevalent among many groups of minority \n     women.\n       (5) Over 60 percent of Hispanic and African-American women \n     are classified as overweight and over 30 percent are \n     classified as obese. Over 60 percent of American Indian women \n     are classified as obese.\n       (6) American Indian women have the highest mortality rates \n     related to alcohol and drug use of all women in the United \n     States.\n       (7) High poverty rates coupled with barriers to health \n     preventive services and medical care contribute to racial and \n     ethnic disparities in health factors, including premature \n     death, life expectancy, risk factors associated with major \n     diseases, and the extent and severity of illnesses.\n       (8) There is increasing evidence that early life \n     experiences are associated with adult chronic disease and \n     that prevention and intervention services provided within the \n     community and the home may lessen the impact of chronic \n     outcomes, while strengthening families and communities.\n       (9) Community health workers, who are primarily women, can \n     be a critical component in conducting health promotion and \n     disease prevention efforts in medically underserved \n     populations.\n       (10) Recognizing the difficult barriers confronting \n     medically underserved communities (poverty, geographic \n     isolation, language and cultural differences, lack of \n     transportation, low literacy, and lack of access to \n     services), community health workers are in a unique position \n     to reduce preventable morbidity and mortality, improve the \n     quality of life, and increase the utilization of available \n     preventive health services for community members.\n       (11) Research has shown that community health workers have \n     been effective in significantly increasing health insurance \n     coverage, screening and medical follow-up visits among \n     residents with limited access or underutilization of health \n     care services.\n       (12) States on the United States-Mexico border have high \n     percentages of impoverished and ethnic minority populations: \n     border States accommodate 60 percent of the total Hispanic \n     population and 23 percent of the total population below 200 \n     percent poverty in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Sachdeva, MD, PhD, MBA; Harriet Fernandez, \nBA; Patricia Francisco, BA; Beatriz Diaz, BA; Ana Milena Diaz, BA; and \n                       Iris Santos-Guerrero, BA)\n\n       Abstract. Background. Lack of health insurance adversely \n     affects children's health. Eight million U.S. children are \n     uninsured, with Latinos being the racial/ethnic group at \n     greatest risk for being uninsured. A randomized, controlled \n     trial comparing the effectiveness of various public insurance \n     strategies for insuring uninsured children has never been \n     conducted.\n       Objective. To evaluate whether case managers are more \n     effective than traditional methods in insuring uninsured \n     Latino children.\n       Design. Randomized, controlled trial conducted from May \n     2002 to August 2004.\n       Setting and Participants. A total of 275 uninsured Latino \n     children and their parents were recruited from urban \n     community sites in Boston.\n       Intervention. Uninsured children were assigned randomly to \n     an intervention group with trained case managers or a control \n     group that received traditional Medicaid and State Children's \n     Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) outreach and enrollment. \n     Case managers provided information on program eligibility, \n     helped families complete insurance applications, acted as a \n     family liaison with Medicaid/SCHIP, and assisted in \n     maintaining coverage.\n       Main Outcome Measures. Obtaining health insurance, coverage \n     continuity, the time to obtain coverage, and parental \n     satisfaction with the process of obtaining insurance for \n     children were assessed. Subjects were contacted monthly for 1 \n     year to monitor outcomes by a researcher blinded with respect \n     to group assignment.\n       Results. One hundred thirty-nine subjects were assigned \n     randomly to the intervention group and 136 to the control \n     group. Intervention group children were significantly more \n     likely to obtain health insurance (96% vs 57%) and had less \n     than 8 times the adjusted odds (odds ratio: 7.78; 95% \n     confidence interval: 5.20-11.64) of obtaining insurance. \n     Seventy-eight percent of intervention group children were \n     insured continuously, compared with 30% of control group \n     children. Intervention group children obtained insurance \n     significantly faster (mean: 87.5 vs 134.8 days), and their \n     parents were significantly more satisfied with the process of \n     obtaining insurance.\n       Conclusions. Community-based case managers are more \n     effective than traditional Medicaid/SCHIP outreach and \n     enrollment in insuring uninsured Latino children. Case \n     management may be a useful mechanism to reduce the number of \n     uninsured children, especially among high-risk populations. \n     Pediatrics 2005; 116:1433-11441; insurance, Latino, Medicaid, \n     medically uninsured, child health services, community health \n     services.\n       There were 8.4 million children without health insurance \n     coverage in the United States in 2003, equivalent to 11.4% of \n     children 0 to 17 years old. Latino children have the highest \n     risk of being uninsured of any racial/ethnic group of U.S. \n     children, with 21% of Latino children being uninsured, \n     compared with 7% of non-Latino white children, 14% of African \n     American children, and 12% of Asian/Pacific Islander \n     children. Other documented risk factors among children for \n     having no insurance include poverty and noncitizen status of \n     the parent and child.\n       Compared with children who have health insurance, uninsured \n     children have less access to health care, are less likely to \n     have a regular source of primary care, and use medical and \n     dental care less often. Uninsured children are significantly \n     more likely than insured children to be in poor or fair \n     health; to not have a regular physician or other medical \n     provider, to have made no medical visit in the past year, to \n     be immunized inadequately, to experience adverse hospital \n     outcomes as newborns, and to have higher mortality rates \n     associated with trauma and coarctation of the aorta.\n       To expand insurance coverage for uninsured children, \n     Congress enacted the State Children's Health Insurance \n     Program (SCHIP) in 1997. This program targets uninsured \n     children 4.5 months for control children (87.5  68 days \n     for the intervention group vs 134.8  102 days for \n     the control group; P < .0001).\n     Parental Satisfaction With the Process of Obtaining Insurance\n       Parents of children in the intervention group were \n     substantially more likely than parents of control group \n     children to report being very satisfied with the process of \n     obtaining health insurance for their child (80% vs 29%; P < \n     .0001) (Table 2). Conversely, control group parents were \n     considerably more likely than intervention group parents to \n     report being very dissatisfied (14% vs 1%; P < .0001) or \n     either dissatisfied or very dissatisfied (27% vs 3%; P < \n     .0001) with the process of obtaining the child's insurance. \n     Similar intergroup differences were observed when parental \n     satisfaction was examined with Likert scale scores (where 1 = \n     very satisfied and 5 = very dissatisfied); the mean \n     satisfaction score for intervention group parents was \n     significantly better than that for control group parents (1.3 \n     vs 2.4; P < .0001). These significant intergroup satisfaction \n     differences persisted when the analysis was restricted to \n     subjects who had obtained insurance; at the first follow-up \n     contact with parents of children who obtained insurance, 74% \n     of intervention group parents but only 24% of control group \n     parents reported being very satisfied with the process of \n     obtaining coverage for their children (P < .0001), and the \n     respective Likert scale satisfaction scores (mean \n      SD) were 1.19  0.46 vs 1.56 \n      0.72 (P < .0001).\n\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\n       Community-based case managers were found to be \n     substantially more effective in obtaining health insurance \n     for uninsured\n\n[[Page S10478]]\n\n     Latino children than traditional Medicaid and SCHIP outreach \n     and enrollment. In addition, compared with control group \n     children, children in the case management group obtained \n     insurance coverage sooner, were more likely to be insured \n     continuously during 1 year of follow-up, and had parents who \n     were much more satisfied with the process of obtaining \n     coverage for their children.\n       Several characteristics of the case management intervention \n     might account for its greater effectiveness in comparison \n     with traditional Medicaid and SCHIP outreach and enrollment. \n     First, case managers received training and focused their \n     efforts on addressing barriers to insuring uninsured children \n     that had been identified specifically by Latino families in \n     prior research, including lack of knowledge about the \n     application process and eligibility, language barriers, \n     immigration issues, income cutoff values and verification, \n     hassles, pending decisions, family mobility, misinformation \n     from insurance representatives, and system problems. Second, \n     case managers were active agents in the process of obtaining \n     insurance coverage for children, assisting parents with \n     application completion and acting as a family liaison and \n     advocate whenever complications or setbacks occurred; \n     traditional SCHIP and Medicaid outreach and enrollment tended \n     to be much more passive, with outreach being heavily reliant \n     on direct mailings, flyers, radio advertisements, and \n     toll-free telephone numbers, but frequently with little or \n     no assistance with the enrollment process. Third, the case \n     managers were all bilingual, bicultural Latinas, which \n     enhanced the cultural competency of the process and \n     eliminated the often considerable language barriers faced \n     by Latino parents seeking to insure their uninsured \n     children. Therefore, the evidence-based, customized, \n     active, culturally competent features in a community-based \n     setting distinguish this intervention from traditional \n     case management approaches and may account for its \n     effectiveness.\n       The success of the community-based case management \n     intervention is noteworthy, given a study population \n     characterized by multiple factors known to place children at \n     especially high risk for being uninsured. All intervention \n     group children were Latino, 69 percent lived in poverty, 96 \n     percent lived in families with incomes 200 percent \n     of the federal poverty threshold, only 10 percent of parents \n     were U.S. citizens, and one fifth of parents were unemployed. \n     These findings suggest that community-based case management \n     might prove especially useful in regions characterized by \n     large proportions of uninsured children who are Latino, poor, \n     immigrants, and have parents who are unemployed. Additional \n     research is needed to determine whether community-based case \n     managers would be equally effective in insuring uninsured \n     children from other racial/ethnic groups and socioeconomic \n     strata and those with parents who are primarily U.S. citizens \n     and employed.\n       The effectiveness of community-based case management \n     suggests that it could play an important role in states with \n     large proportions of uninsured Latino children. In Texas, for \n     example, where 21 percent of children (equivalent to 1.4 \n     million children) are uninsured and an estimated 56 percent \n     of uninsured children are Latino, community-based case \n     management potentially could insure >750000 uninsured \n     Latino children, assuming the 96 percent effectiveness of \n     case management observed in this study. The study findings \n     suggest that community-based case management has the \n     potential to be highly effective in reducing the number of \n     uninsured children even in states such as Texas where \n     children from undocumented families are not eligible for \n     insurance programs; community-based case management was \n     found to be more effective than traditional Medicaid and \n     SCHIP outreach and enrollment even after adjustment for \n     parental citizenship, and more than one half of all \n     uninsured U.S. children are eligible for Medicaid or \n     SCHIP. As demonstrated in our study, however, in states \n     with relatively small proportions of uninsured children, \n     such as Massachusetts, case management might prove to be \n     an important means of insuring the hardest-to-reach \n     populations of uninsured children who have continued to be \n     uninsured despite 7 years of SCHIP and Medicaid expansion, \n     such as Latinos, poor children, and those with noncitizen \n     parents. Our study findings may be of particular relevance \n     for states such as Florida, which, like Massachusetts, has \n     a SCHIP program (the Florida KidCare program) that covers \n     both citizen and qualified noncitizen children.\n       Certain limitations of this study should be noted. The case \n     management intervention was studied only among Latino \n     children; therefore, the results may not pertain to other \n     racial/ethnic groups. The Latino subgroups represented in the \n     study sample were typical of an urban area in the Northeast, \n     and the findings may not be generalizable to populations with \n     greater proportions of Mexican Americans, in other regions of \n     the country, or in rural or suburban areas. Because the study \n     aim was to determine the effectiveness of the case management \n     intervention, a cost analysis was not performed, and the \n     cost-effectiveness of the intervention could not be \n     determined. However, we did evaluate the feasibility of \n     conducting a cost-effectiveness analysis by collecting pilot \n     data on 10 consecutive families enrolled in the study. Pilot \n     data collected included the number of missed school days, the \n     number of missed work days, out-of-pocket expenses incurred \n     during a child's illness, the number of emergency department \n     and clinic visits, hospitalizations, and estimates of the \n     costs of implementing the program, including personnel \n     salaries and time spent implementing the intervention. These \n     pilot data suggest that a formal cost-effectiveness analysis \n     of the intervention is feasible for this population and could \n     be performed in future studies. Future cost-effectiveness \n     analyses of this intervention should consider comprehensive \n     evaluation of direct, indirect, and opportunity costs \n     associated with implementing the case management intervention \n     in other communities and populations.\n       It can be speculated that insuring children through \n     community-based case managers might have the potential to \n     contribute to the revitalization of impoverished Latino \n     communities. Case management not only could effectively \n     reduce the number of uninsured children in a community but \n     also might serve as a means of enhancing a community's \n     employment opportunities. The case managers could be trained \n     individuals from the community who serve their own community, \n     drawn from welfare-to-work and other local and state \n     employment programs. Part of each case manager's earnings, in \n     turn, might be spent at local businesses, resulting in a \n     ``triple effect'' of reducing the number of uninsured \n     children, increasing parental employment, and stimulating the \n     local economy. Under this scenario, SCHIP and Medicaid \n     programs could partner with state employment agencies to \n     train and to hire the community case managers. As an \n     intervention that is comprehensive, community-based, and \n     focused on the family, community-based case management \n     shares key features with several established family \n     support programs considered to be effective in improving \n     child health outcomes, such as Head Start and early \n     intervention programs for children with special health \n     care needs.\n\n\n                              conclusions\n\n       This randomized, controlled trial indicates that community-\n     based case managers are significantly more effective than \n     traditional SCHIP/Medicaid outreach and enrollment in \n     insuring uninsured Latino children. Community case management \n     seems to be a useful mechanism for reducing the number of \n     uninsured children, especially among children most at risk \n     for being uninsured.\n\n                            TABLE 1.--BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS OF STUDY PARTICIPANTS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                         Case management                Control\n                  Characteristic                   ------------------------------------------------------    P\n                                                             (n=139)                    (n=136)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChild's age, y, mean   SD.........................                  8.9   5.0                  8.9   4.9     .96\nParent's age, y, mean   SD........................                 36.7   9.1                 36.7   8.9     .98\nAnnual combined family income, median (range).....        $13,200 ($0-72,000)        $12,945 ($0-48,000)     .41\nAnnual combined family income, no.

Mr. President, we have had a long and full day today. I \nhave some remarks to make on a couple of bills, and then we will close \ndown, with a brief statement on what I see unfolding over the next \ncouple days.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has before it two very important bills \ndealing with critical foreign policy issues facing our Nation.\n  One of them is the Iran Freedom Support Act, H.R. 6198. This is a \nbipartisan bill which passed the House earlier today by voice vote. In \nother words, it was a noncontroversial bill in the House. It was \ncosponsored there by Congressman Tom Lantos, the ranking Democrat on \nthe Committee on International Relations, as well as by Congressman \nGary Ackerman, the ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on Middle East \nand Central Asia. The Iran Freedom Support Act is also strongly \nsupported by the Bush administration.\n  Enactment of this bill is time-sensitive because it will extend for \nanother 5 years the provisions of the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act, or \nbetter known here on the floor as ILSA. ILSA has been an important \nelement of the U.S. sanctions regime against Iran for the past 10 \nyears, and ILSA will expire tomorrow unless Congress acts to extend it.\n  Iran is continuing to defy the will of the international community by \npersisting with its efforts to produce nuclear weapons in violation of \ninternational nonproliferation norms. I could not think of a worse time \nthan now to allow ILSA to lapse; the signal this would send to Iran of \nU.S. irresolution and weakness would be terrible.\n  Just today, President Ahmadi-Nejad publicly declared that Iran will \nnot suspend its nuclear enrichment program, despite being called to do \nso by the United Nations Security Council. The U.N. is now poised to \nimpose multilateral sanctions on Iran if it continues to defy Security \nCouncil mandates. But if we allow ILSA to lapse, the Congress will be \nrelaxing U.S. sanctions on Iran at the very same time the rest of the \nworld is thinking about tightening sanctions.\n  This is not the kind of leadership I was elected to the Senate to \nprovide, and I think every Senator will have to lower their head in \nshame if the Senate fails to act tomorrow to extend ILSA.\n  H.R. 6198 has been cleared on our side of the aisle. We are ready to \npass it. We are ready to pass it tonight. I will not ask unanimous \nconsent to pass it tonight, however, because I understand it has not \nbeen cleared on the Democratic side of the aisle. I hope that does \nchange overnight, but whether it changes or not, I wish to serve notice \nto all Senators that tomorrow I will ask unanimous consent to pass H.R. \n6198, and I hope there will be no Member of this body who steps forward \nat that time to reward Iran's intransigence by blocking passage of this \nbipartisan legislation.\n  The second very important bill affecting our foreign policy that is \ntoday pending before the Senate is the United States-India Peaceful \nAtomic Energy Cooperation Act, S. 3709. This bill was reported by the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations on July 20 and has been pending before \nus since that time. It is strongly supported by Chairman Lugar and the \nranking Democrat of that committee, Senator Biden. Together they have \ndeveloped a managers' amendment that they both support and that they \nwould like the Senate to approve. The House companion measure has \nalready passed that body by a wide margin.\n  Enactment of this legislation is essential in order to begin a new \nera in relations between our Nation and India, the world's largest \ndemocracy. This legislation will enable us to commence cooperation with \nIndia in the area of civil nuclear energy, something that is today \ncontrary to U.S. law. We need to be able to do this to fulfill \ncommitments President Bush made to Prime Minister Singh of India on \nJuly 18 of last year. If we are unable to fulfill those commitments, \nthe disappointment in India will be such that United States-India \nrelations could be set back by many years, and the promise of a new era \nin relations that was born on July 18 of last year will be lost.\n  Like the Iran bill, the India legislation has been cleared on our \nside of the aisle. Republican Members of the Senate are ready to \napprove the managers' amendment to S. 3709 tonight, in its current \nform, with no further debate or amendment.\n  Regrettably, the same is not true on the other side of the aisle. \nSenate Democrats are not ready tonight to pass the managers' amendment \nto this legislation in its current form.\n  This is regrettable because if the Democrats would permit us to pass \nthe\n\n[[Page S10493]]\n\nbill tonight, we could send it to conference over the recess, where the \ndifferences between the House bill could be resolved, and we could be \nassured of sending this bill to the President before we adjourn.\n  I understand that the reason they are not prepared to pass the \nlegislation is because they have a large number of amendments they wish \nto offer. Some of these Democrat amendments are so-called killer \namendments which, if adopted, would simply make this legislation \nunacceptable to the Indian government. Others of the Democrat \namendments are not necessarily designed to kill the legislation, but \ntheir sheer volume will slow down this whole process considerably and \ncould, as a practical matter, make it impossible for the Senate to \nconsider this legislation this year.\n  I have worked with my colleague, Senator Reid, to come up with some \nsort of unanimous-consent agreement that would enable us to consider \nthis legislation in a reasonable period of time. We have not yet \nsucceeded, but I will keep trying. We need to bring this matter to a \nresolution before we recess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/28/senate-section/article/S10493-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE PLACED ON CALENDAR--H.R. 5132\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

I \nalso transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the \nDepartment of State with respect to the Agreement and bilateral \ninstruments. The bilateral instruments with three EU Member States, \nEstonia, Latvia, and Malta, take the form of comprehensive new \nextradition treaties, and therefore will be submitted individually.\n  A parallel agreement with the European Union on mutual legal \nassistance, together with bilateral instruments, will be transmitted to \nthe Senate separately.

For example, \nit requires replacing outdated lists of extraditable offenses included \nin 10 older bilateral treaties with the modern ``dual criminality'' \napproach, thereby enabling coverage of such newer offenses as money \nlaundering. Another important provision ensures that a U.S. extradition \nrequest is not disfavored by an EU Member State that receives a \ncompeting request for the person from another Member State pursuant to \nthe newly created European Arrest Warrant. Finally, the Extradition \nAgreement simplifies procedural requirements for preparing and \ntransmitting extradition documents, easing and speeding the current \nprocess.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Agreement and bilateral instruments.\n                                                        George W.

Mr. President, today we had a very busy day. We passed the \nMilitary Commissions Act, the Terrorist Tribunal Act, and also invoked \ncloture on the border fence bill, another very important piece of \nlegislation. This evening, we reached agreement to consider the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill conference report, and \ntomorrow morning at 10 o'clock the Senate will vote on that conference \nreport, and then we will resume the postcloture debate on the border \nfence bill.\n  I remind my colleagues to be prepared for a busy day tomorrow, with \nvotes throughout the day. Given the cloture vote this evening of 71 to \n28, I hope we can expedite the border fence bill and finish it at an \nearly hour tomorrow.\n  This is a very important bill that focuses on border security and \nborder security first, recognizing we have a lot more to do in the \nfuture, but it does give us that opportunity to address the fact that \nwe have millions of people coming across the U.S. border every year \nillegally, and we need to start the enforcement of that border and that \nborder security by a physical structure, UAVs, with cameras and \nsensors, specifically 700 miles of fence along that border.\n  Following that, we will have the cloture vote on the message on the \nChild Custody Act, a very important bill that addresses one of our \nmajor initiatives here; that is, to secure America's values and look at \nthe issue of a young girl being taken for an abortion across State \nlines without parental permission. It is common sense. We passed it on \nthe floor of the Senate not too long ago, and this is an amended \nversion that came over from the House, and now is the time for us to \npass it once again.\n\n  Beyond that, we have a number of other outstanding items that will \nneed to be addressed before the recess. As we speak, issues surrounding \nour ports, again another part of that major thematic for this month of \nsecuring our homeland as we work on border security and funding the war \non terror and giving our Government, our military, and our CIA the \ntools that we need to carry out this war on terror for our ports.\n  Our port security has to be addressed. It is being addressed in \nconference. Conferees were appointed by the House earlier tonight and \nthat conference met tonight, so I am very hopeful that we will be able \nto address port security over the next 24, 36 hours.\n  In addition, we have nominations of the various judges that we need \nto consider before we leave. We have a treaty, U.S.-U.K. extradition \nthat we need to address before we leave. There are other cleared items, \nincluding a large energy package. All of these are being held up \ntonight by the other side of the aisle, but I am very hopeful that we \nwill be able to address these issues over the course of the next day or \nso.\n  If we are unable to complete all of our work tomorrow, Senators can \nexpect a Saturday session. It is clear, as I set out really 2 weeks \nago, that we have a large agenda. We are moving along very, very well, \nmaking real progress, as shown by the six votes that we had over the \ncourse of the day. But we have a lot more to do, and we will stay until \nwe finish that work either late tomorrow or into Saturday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/28/senate-section/article/S10494-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
