Mr. President, in a moment we will begin consideration of \nthe Homeland Security appropriations bill. Yesterday, all first-degree \namendments to the bill were required to be filed at the desk. There \nappear to be about 100 that were filed. Although I hope the Senators \nwill not feel compelled to call up many of these amendments, we have \n100. Hopefully we can narrow those down. The chairman and ranking \nmember will do so over the course of the day.\n  We will finish the bill this week. Therefore, Members should contact \nthe two managers to schedule consideration of their amendments. At the \ncurrent time, we have three amendments pending, one dealing with \nveterans health funding and two relating to the homeland grant formula. \nWe hope to shortly work out time agreements on these and vote with \nrespect to at least a couple of these amendments. Therefore, there is a \nchance for a vote prior to our policy luncheons today. We will alert \nMembers as we come to an agreement on the starting times. We will \ncontinue to vote throughout the day on amendments. Senators can expect \na busy day.\n  Yesterday, we came in for a 3-week block. It will be a very busy 3 \nweeks before our August recess. We need to continue to address the \nappropriations measures. Prior to the July Fourth recess, we finished \nsome appropriations in a very positive way. We continue with Homeland \nSecurity, and we have a number of other legislative priorities. We need \nto make the most of this legislative period as we work together to \ncomplete all of the work that is ahead of us.\n  We are likely to have a nominee for the Supreme Court sometime in the \nnear future, and much of September, I suspect, will be focused on that, \nwhich again establishes a sense of urgency for addressing the very \nimportant issues of the business that is before the Senate over the \nnext 3 weeks. I will be talking to the Democrat leader over the course \nof the day in terms of working through the specifics of that schedule.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/12/senate-section/article/S8091-7", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8091-S8092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATION PROCESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will take a moment now to speak briefly \nabout the confirmation process, the upcoming confirmation process of \nthe new Supreme Court Justice. This morning, the Democrat leader and I \nand the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee had a \ndiscussion with the President of the United States which continues the \nconsulting process which I would say, at least as we get started, is \nbeing conducted in an unprecedented way.\n  Over the last few months, this Senate has made considerable progress \nwith judicial nominations. We have confirmed six of the President's \nappellate court nominees and four district court nominees. I am very \npleased with this progress. Indeed, this is real progress, especially \nwhen you consider each of the appeals court nominees were blocked. \nThose same people were blocked in the last Congress. That is real \nprogress, working in a bipartisan way for the American people.\n  Now we will be able to continue that progress. To do so, we must \nplace principle before partisan politics, and we\n\n[[Page S8092]]\n\nmust place results before rhetoric. That is the challenge to the \nSenate. Above all, we need to fulfill our constitutional duty as \nSenators.\n  Since Justice O'Connor announced her retirement now 11 days ago, the \nSupreme Court nomination has garnered a lot of attention in Washington, \nin the press, among our colleagues, and indeed all across America. As \nthe President considers her replacement, many Senators have been \ntalking about the issue of consultation. This raises some important \nquestions: Is the President obligated to consult with Senators about a \nparticular nominee? And if so, to what extent?\n  Under the Constitution, the President is not obligated to consult \nwith Senators before making a nomination. In fact, he is not obligated \nto consult with anyone. Indeed, the consultation is a courtesy, it is \nnot a constitutional mandate. The Constitution plainly states in \narticle II that the President shall nominate and the Senate shall \nprovide advice and consent. That is it. Yet this White House has \nwelcomed suggestions from Senators.\n  On the very same day we departed for our recess, on the same day \nJustice O'Connor announced her retirement, the President personally \nengaged in the consultation process. He called Senator Reid and myself, \nthe two leaders of the Senate. He called the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, Senators Specter and Leahy. Since \nthen, the President and the White House have continued to consult in an \nunprecedented manner and a very inclusive manner. For example, while in \nEurope at the G-8 summit with the President, White House Chief of Staff \nAndy Card made time to call a number of Senators, including Senators \nDurbin, Schumer, Kennedy, and Senator Ben Nelson. In the last few \nweeks, White House counsel Harriet Miers met one-on-one with the \nDemocrat leader, with myself, with Senator Leahy, and with Senator \nSpecter. She has called a number of other Senators to discuss the \nSupreme Court vacancy specifically.\n  All together, the White House has reached out to more than 60 \nSenators, including more than half of the Democratic caucus and every \nsingle member of the Judiciary Committee. This consultation process is \nwell underway and, as I mentioned earlier, continued again bright and \nearly this morning when the President invited the four of us to \nbreakfast, the two leaders and the two leaders of the Judiciary \nCommittee, the chairman and ranking member. That meeting was \nproductive. We freely exchanged views on the nomination process and \nwhat to expect. We discussed the type of nominee the President may want \nto consider. It was in a good spirit, bipartisan, working together, \neveryone stressing the importance of, once the nomination is made, \nhaving a process that would play out and have that nominee in place by \nOctober 3.\n  I do commend the President for taking all of these steps. He is not \nobligated to consult before selecting a Supreme Court nominee, but he \nis choosing to consult. He is reaching out in this inclusive and \nbipartisan manner. It is a manner that is unprecedented.\n  I understand the White House will continue to consult after the \nnomination is made. Despite this effort by the President, I am \nconcerned that no amount of consultation will be sufficient for a few \nof our colleagues in this Senate, and statements will continue to be \nmade. I say that because conomination rather than consultation may be \ntheir ultimate goal. Some Senators may prefer to choose the nominee for \nthe President, but that is not the way the system works. That is not \nthe way the Constitution works.\n  The President has the power to nominate, and the Senate offers advice \nand consent. Again, consultation does not mean conomination; \nconsultation is a courtesy of the President. It works two ways. If he \nextends it to us, as he has, we should extend it to him.\n  As we look ahead, most Senators face a relatively new challenge in a \nSupreme Court nomination. We talked about it this morning at breakfast. \nMore than half of us in this Senate were not here 11 years ago when the \nSenate last confirmed a Supreme Court nominee. But I am confident we \nwill rise to the occasion. We should work together to ensure that the \nnomination process is fair, dignified, and respectful, and we should \nmake sure that a new Justice is confirmed before the Supreme Court \nbegins its new term on October 3.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/12/senate-section/article/S8092-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8092-S8093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I was listening to our majority leader's \nwords on consultation and the process thus far. I will make a couple of \npoints.\n  The first is that we are off to a good start. I certainly agree with \nthe majority leader. The phone calls that have been made and this \nmorning's meeting with Senators Frist, Reid, Specter, and Leahy are a \ngood first start. That is how it should be. But simply phone calls or \nmeetings, if they are devoid of substance, are not going to lead to \nreal consultation.\n  I certainly agree with the majority leader's point. The Senate is not \na conominee. It is the President who has to do the nominating. The way \nconsultation has successfully worked in the past is for the President \nto quietly, privately, offer some of the names he is considering to \nthose on both sides of the aisle and get opinions about those names: \nHow would this one fare? How would that one fare? Would this one cause \na fight? How about that one?\n  It is not that we would be conominators at all. Consultation is that. \nThe President is the nominator, and a good consultation means that \nnominator discusses who he is thinking of nominating, takes the \ntemperature, if you will, of the Senate, particularly of the other \nparty, to see if a consensus nominee could come about. Thus far, \nneither the President nor any of the people working for him--I had one \ncall with Andrew Card, the Chief of Staff--has offered a single name. \nFrom what I understand this morning, the President did not offer a \nsingle name.\n  So we are off to a good first start. Make no mistake about it--it is \na first start to begin the consultation process. But the consultation \nprocess, for it to work, is not going to be, Okay, who do you think is \na good name, and that is that and we do not have a back and forth. In \nfact, for consultation to work--and we all want it to work--the \nPresident should suggest some names and get the opinion of those in the \nSenate.\n  This is how it worked with President Clinton. It was not simply that \nPresident Clinton called up Orrin Hatch and said, Give me some names, \nand didn't have a discussion. President Clinton bounced off names. In \nOrrin Hatch's book, he states that one of the names offered who \nPresident Clinton very much wanted to nominate was Bruce Babbitt, the \nformer Interior Secretary and Governor of Arizona. While Orrin Hatch \ndid not state how he would vote--and I have talked to Orrin a little \nabout this--he said: I think Babbitt would cause a big fight. And \nwisely, President Clinton did not offer his name. So that is how the \nconsultation process, to be successful, ought to go.\n\n  In my call with Andrew Card, I told him something I have said \nrepeatedly. And I think I speak for just about every member of this \ncaucus on this side of the aisle. We do not want a fight. We certainly \ndo not relish a fight. We would much prefer a consensus nominee. \nFurthermore, we know that nominee is not going to be a liberal or even \na moderate. It is likely to be a conservative. But our view is--again, \nthis time I am speaking for myself, but I think a lot of my colleagues \nshare this view--our view is very simple: that nominee, though \nconservative, will interpret law, not make it; will be thoughtful, will \nbe pragmatic, will understand the other point of view. If that happens, \nI think we can have a process that works well.\n  So in summary, Mr. President, the consultation we have had is great. \nThe number of phone calls may exceed any others that have been named. \nBut so far, at least according to my phone call and the ones of many of \nmy colleagues with whom I have talked, and from what I have been told \nabout the meeting this morning, we have not gotten into the real nitty-\ngritty of consultation--not co-nomination, absolutely not. The \nPresident is the nominator. But the nitty-gritty means offering some \nnames. The President offers some names and gets the opinion before he\n\n[[Page S8093]]\n\nmakes his decision--and the decision, of course, by the Constitution is \nsolely his--as to whether that nominee would get broad acceptance or \nwhether that nominee is likely to cause quite a stir in the Senate.\n  Let us hope this is not the end of the consultation process but the \nbeginning. Let us hope there will be that kind of dialog. I reiterate \nmy call to the President to have a summit, to call a good number of \nDemocrats and Republicans together for a day at Camp David or an \nevening or dinner at the White House and have a real back-and-forth \nwhere we roll up our sleeves and really get into a serious, detailed \ndiscussion of how we all feel. Who will benefit if that happens? Who \nwill benefit if there is real consultation? Certainly the President, \ncertainly the Senate, certainly the Supreme Court, but, most of all, \ncertainly the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/12/senate-section/article/S8093-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to call up amendment No. 1215.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That amendment is currently \npending.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is offered on behalf of the Senator \nfrom Texas, Mr. Cornyn, and myself. It is identical to the Homeland \nSecurity FORWARD Funding Act of 2005. That is S. 1013.\n\n  I am very pleased to be joined not only by my colleague from Texas \nbut, as well, by Senators Boxer, Hutchison, Kerry, Martinez, Schumer, \nClinton, Corzine, Kennedy, Lautenberg, and Nelson of Florida. And, Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Mikulski to the list \nof cosponsors.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, a great deal has been said about how \nhomeland security dollars should be allocated. I think it is pretty \nclear that the American people, and certainly major opinionmakers such \nas major newspaper editorials, major mayors and major Governors, \nbelieve it is time our Nation adopt risk-based analysis to guide \ncritical resource allocation of homeland security efforts.\n  This legislation will do exactly that. The Cornyn-Feinstein amendment \nis extremely simple in approach. Its key language, which appears at its \nbeginning, is clear. Let me quote it:\n\n       The Secretary [of Homeland Security] shall ensure that \n     homeland security grants are allocated based on an assessment \n     of threat, vulnerability, and consequence to the maximum \n     extent practicable.\n\n  This legislation will ensure that these priorities are set, and set \naccording to analysis of risk and threat.\n  This bill accomplishes this through five basic mechanisms.\n  First, the law requires the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to allocate grants based on risk. The legislation will mandate \nthat funding decisions be designed according to an assessment of risk. \nThis is a key element of the law, which makes this clear in its very \nfirst section, entitled ``Risk-Based Funding For Homeland Security,'' \nwhich reads--and I want to repeat it--\n\n       The Secretary [of Homeland Security] shall ensure that \n     covered grants are allocated based on an assessment of \n     threat, vulnerability, and consequence to the maximum extent \n     possible.\n\n  The bill defines ``covered grants'' as including the four major first \nresponder grant programs administered by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. That is: First, the State Homeland Security Grant Program; \nsecond, the Urban Area Security Initiative; third, the Law Enforcement \nTerrorism Prevention Program; and, fourth, the Citizens Corps Program.\n  In addition to these four core grant programs, the legislation also \ncovers grants ``provided by the Department for improving homeland \nsecurity,'' including grants for seaport and airport security.\n  The bottom line is that if Federal funds are going to be distributed \nto improve first responders' ability to ``prevent, prepare for, respond \nto, or mitigate threatened or actual terrorist attacks,'' those funds \nshould be distributed in accordance with a risk-based analysis. Al-\nQaida and its allies do not attack based on a formula. This bill \nrejects the formula approach in favor of a framework that is flexible \nand risk focused.\n  Second, the legislation requires that covered grants be designed to \nmeet ``essential capabilities.'' ``Essential capabilities'' is a \nconcept defined in this law. It is what we get for the money spent: The \nability to meet the risk by reducing vulnerability to attack and \ndiminishing the consequences by effective response.\n  Third, the bill requires States to quickly pass on Federal funds to \nwhere they are needed. States should not hold Federal funds back from \nwhere they are most needed. This bill will ensure that States quickly \nand effectively move the funds through to the location.\n  And, fourth, the bill addresses the small State minimum issue. The \nunderlying bill requires each State to get .75 percent of the grant \nfunding. Now, what does that mean? That means that 37.5 percent of the \nfunds go on a formula basis to areas that might not have risk, threat, \nor vulnerability. For instance, under the current appropriations bill, \nof the $1.918 billion appropriated, $548 million is taken right off the \ntop, allocated to States regardless of whether they are vulnerable, \nwhether they have risk, or whether they have threat. Thus, that $548 \nmillion is not available to meet risk.\n  This legislation will significantly reduce this large set-aside. It \nwill reduce it from 37.5 percent to the .25 percent. Now, I must admit \nI am uncomfortable even with the .25 percent minimum and would prefer \nto eliminate any impediment to risk-based funding. I believe it is the \nright thing to do. I would believe this regardless of what State I came \nfrom. We set up a huge Department of Homeland Security and have given \nthem the basis and the ability to do the analyses that are required and \nthe intelligence that has moved in to determine what is vulnerable, \nwhere it is, where the threats are, and what the risks are. And these \nare going to be ever changing. But I understand the realities of the \nSenate, so we decided to track what the President requested in his \nbudget.\n\n  In this post-Cold-War world of asymmetric threat, there are two \nfundamental understandings which apply to efforts to make our Nation \nmore secure against a terrorist attack.\n  The first understanding is that predicting what terrorists will do \nrequires risk analysis. It is an uncomfortable fact that even with the \nbest intelligence we will never know exactly how, when, and where \nterrorists will strike. The best we can do is to adequately assess \nrisks and threats and make predictions.\n  The second understanding is that our defense resources are not \ninfinite. The sum total of money, time, and personnel that can be \ndevoted to homeland security is limited.\n  Together these two understandings define the task for our Nation: We \nmust accurately assess the risks of an array of possible terrorist \nattacks, measure the vulnerability of all of these possible targets, \nand then divide up resources based on that assessment,\n\n[[Page S8094]]\n\nnot based on some arbitrary formula that will exist regardless of what \nkind of threat or vulnerability may emerge in the future.\n  The 9/11 Commission agrees with us, finding that ``nothing has been \nharder for officials--executive or legislative--than to set priorities, \nmaking hard choices in allocating limited resources.'' The Commission \nconcluded:\n\n       Homeland security assistance should be based strictly on an \n     assessment of risks and vulnerabilities.\n\n  The Cornyn-Feinstein amendment is the only amendment that clearly \ndoes what the 9/11 Commission has recommended.\n  The New York Times has agreed. In an editorial entitled ``Real \nSecurity, or Politics as Usual?'' the Times wrote:\n\n       Defending places where the terrorist threat is greatest is \n     not parochialism; it is defending America.\n\n  We think that last week's tragic events in London underscore the \npoint. The effectiveness of the British first response to these \nterrible attacks illustrates that they put their resources where the \nrisks were: In London, not in some remote community, but where they \nknew the terrorists were most likely to attack.\n  Despite all recommendations, we find again and again that scarce \nresources are allocated based on factors unrelated to real security. \nFor instance, a small State minimum in the Collins amendment is \ndesigned to ensure that every State gets a substantial portion of \nscarce resources, regardless of the measure of risk or vulnerability. \nAs a result, a State such as Wyoming gets $27.80 per capita in funding, \nwhile New York and California get $15.54 and $8.05, respectively.\n  The problem is not just in Congress. For example, a recent Department \nof Homeland Security inspector general report found that in the \ncritical area of port security, grants are ``not well coordinated with \nthe Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection.'' The result: \n``funding of projects with low [risk and vulnerability] scores.''\n  Now, this is the IG of Homeland Security who is saying projects with \nlow risk and vulnerability scores are currently being funded. Frankly \nand candidly, that is just plain wrong. It is a waste of money, and I \nthink, to an extent, it enables--well, it really is a kind of deception \nbecause unless you can put your money where the intelligence indicates \nand the assessments indicate there is threat and risk, you are not \nprotecting America.\n  A recently issued joint report from the Center for Security Studies \nand the Heritage Foundation found that there is:\n\n     no funding formula that is based on risk analysis and \n     divorces from politics . . . [w]ith only limited resources \n     available to achieve the almost limitless goal of protecting \n     the entire United States . . . it is critical that we set \n     priorities.\n\n  That is what we are trying to do here. This amendment, and the bill \nupon which it is based, builds on efforts last year by Representatives \nCox and Turner, the chair and ranking member respectively of the other \nbody's Homeland Security Committee. That effort passed the House of \nRepresentatives as part of the intelligence reform bill but was dropped \nat conference. Our amendment is similar to this House bill.\n  I understand and appreciate the efforts made by Senators Collins and \nLieberman to craft the bill now before us. I applaud their leadership \nin this area. The Collins-Lieberman bill, while it purports to be risk \nbased, is actually not. It incorporates complex formulae with a \npreordained list of factors which approximate what is believed to be \nthe risk. Candidly, I don't think that works for the following reasons.\n  First, the key to responding to al-Qaida and similar organizations is \nflexibility. It is not a frozen formula. Al-Qaida doesn't make \ndecisions based on formula. While today it may seem obvious that mass \ntransit or ports are obvious targets, tomorrow they may not be. \nHopefully our intelligence community will be increasingly able to \nferret out our terrorist adversaries and our analysts will be better at \nunderstanding and predicting their behavior. What are today's targets \ncould change and change yet again. Building a formula mechanism based \non our best guess about what al-Qaida will do is simply not good \npolicy.\n  Secondly, we created the Department of Homeland Security primarily to \ndo exactly what this legislation calls for. The first mission statement \nfor the Department stated:\n\n       [The Department will] identify and understand threats, \n     assess vulnerabilities, determine potential impacts, and \n     disseminate timely information to our homeland security \n     partners and the American public.\n\n  This is what the Department is supposed to do. It cannot be done by \narbitrary formula. It can only be done listening to intelligence \nanalysts, engaging in flexible interpretation, and being willing to \nmove the money where the risks show up to be. That is important to do, \nand it should be important whether you are from a small State, a \nmiddle-sized State, or a large State. The money should go where the \nproblems are.\n  This is exactly what President Bush said in announcing the creation \nof the Department. He stated:\n\n       This new department will bring together the best \n     intelligence information about our vulnerabilities to \n     terrorist attack so that we can act quickly to protect \n     America.\n\n  He didn't talk about an arbitrary formula. He said, the Department \nwill bring together the best intelligence information so that \nflexibility becomes the watchword of the day, and money can go where it \nis truly needed.\n  Senator Lieberman was a leader in this effort, and we all worked with \nhim to create the Department of Homeland Security. In my view, the \nbiggest selling point for this new Department was, as the President \nsaid, that for the first time, we would have a place in the Government \nthat would map threats against vulnerability and thus allocate our \ndefenses in an effective, efficient way. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity can be seen as a department of risk analysis. That is what it \nshould be doing. So it is ironic that having provided the authority and \nresponsibility to do this, the Congress then handcuffs the Secretary by \nrestricting these resources based on geography, politics, and parochial \ninterests. Let's let the Secretary do the job we gave him.\n  Third, in addition to creating the Department of Homeland Security, \nthe Congress, again with the leadership of Senators Collins and \nLieberman, reorganized the intelligence community. The purpose of this \ntask was to ensure that the most important ingredient in risk \nanalysis--good intelligence--was enough to keep America safe. So there \nis an irony that having gone to such trouble to improve the \nintelligence community, we are prepared to pass legislation which for a \nlarge percentage of funds will make intelligence irrelevant. All they \nneed is a map, a census, and a list of important places in each State. \nThat makes no sense to me.\n  I mentioned the difference in funding levels and amounts subject to \nrisk. Last week the Congressional Research Service issued an analysis \nof the underlying appropriations bill, the Collins amendment, and the \nCornyn-Feinstein amendment. The results are startling. If we assume \nthat the base amount of Homeland Security grant funding contained in \nthe appropriations bill becomes law, that means the total amount \navailable for these programs will be $1.918 billion. The underlying \nbill would allocate a considerable amount under the existing small \nState minimum framework, $579.2 million, leaving $1.3 billion to be \nallocated through a risk assessment process.\n\n  If the Collins-Lieberman amendment is adopted, $762 million will be \nallocated according to the formula--not based on risk, not based on \nthreat, not based on risk analysis, not based on vulnerability, but \nsimply on population and geographical distribution. That leaves even \nless to be allocated based on risk, only $1.155 billion. In other \nwords, the Collins-Lieberman amendment reduces the risk-based funding \nin the underlying bill by nearly $150 million. If this amendment is \nadopted, only $251.2 million will be allocated based on the .25 small \nState minimum, leaving $1.66 billion for risk-based allocation.\n  Here is the bottom line: Put another way, under the underlying bill, \nonly 70 percent of available funds are allocated based on risk. If the \nCollins-Lieberman approach is adopted, that drops to 60 percent; under \nthe approach embodied in Cornyn-Feinstein, 87 percent of funding to \nrisk. So between the two amendments, our amendment, 87 percent of \nfunding to risk, Collins-\n\n[[Page S8095]]\n\nLieberman, 60 percent, and the underlying bill, 70 percent. The choice \nis clear.\n  What is the bottom line? The bottom line is, our Nation faces danger. \nWe have a limited amount of resources available to defend ourselves. \nThose resources must and should be targeted. They should be targeted to \nwhere they can do the most good and where the risk actually is. That is \nthe simple question which faces us today. How can we best protect our \ncountry? I believe the best way to protect America is to let the \nSecretary of Homeland Security do the job we appointed him to do: match \nresources to risk, using the best available intelligence analysis. That \nis the only way to safety. That is the only way to reassure our people, \nshould there be a catastrophic event, that we have put the money in the \nright places. Any arbitrary formula doesn't do this.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter from the High \nThreat Joint Working Group on Homeland Security. This is a group of \nlarge cities that has banded together. The letter is in support of our \namendment. It is the city of Anaheim in California; city of Baltimore \nin Maryland; city of Baton Rouge in Louisiana; city of Boston in \nMassachusetts; the city of Charlotte in North Carolina; the city of \nChicago in Illinois; the city of Cleveland in Ohio; the city of \nColumbus in Ohio; the city of Dallas in Texas; Jacksonville in Florida; \nthe city of Kansas City, MO; the city of Long Beach, CA; Los Angeles, \nCA; Miami, FL; New York in New York; Newark in New Jersey; Oakland in \nCalifornia; Philadelphia in Pennsylvania; city of San Diego in \nCalifornia; the city of San Francisco in California; the city of San \nJose in California; and the city of Santa Ana.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         High-Threat City Joint Working Group on Homeland \n           Security,\n                                                    July 11, 2005.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader. U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader and Minority Leader: As cities on the \n     front line of the war on terrorism, we are writing to express \n     our support for S. 1013, the ``Homeland Security FORWARD \n     Funding Act of 2005'', introduced by Senators Feinstein and \n     Cornyn, which targets first responder funds to areas of \n     highest risk and highest threat throughout the nation and to \n     support homeland security funding for state and local \n     governments at least at last year's level. The recent events \n     in London underline the importance of homeland funding for \n     state and local governments.\n       The Feinstein-Cornyn legislation most closely tracks the \n     recommendations of both the 9/11 Commission and the \n     Administration in supporting the principle that homeland \n     security funds should be allocated solely on the basis of \n     risk of terrorism. According to the Congressional Research \n     Service, S. 1013 would increase the amount of money \n     distributed on threat to 87% of the funds, compared to only \n     60% distributed based on threat under S. 21.\n       S. 1013 also maintains the critical partnership between the \n     federal government, states and the nation's highest risk \n     areas by maintaining the Urban Area Security Initiative \n     (UASI) program. These UASI regions have for several years \n     been aggressively working to implement comprehensive plans \n     for terrorism prevention and preparedness approved by their \n     States and DHS. Maintaining the UASI program will preserve \n     and sustain the substantial planning, long-term projects, and \n     regional decision-making processes underway.\n       The homeland security bill as reported by the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee would cut homeland security funding \n     to state and local governments by almost a half billion \n     dollars, $467 million less than FY 05. Please restore this \n     funding.\n       We again commend you on your efforts to increase the amount \n     of homeland security funds distributed based on threat, \n     vulnerability, and consequences of a terrorist attack.\n           Sincerely,\n       City of Anaheim, California.\n       City of Baltimore, Maryland.\n       City of Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\n       City of Boston, Massachusetts.\n       City of Charlotte, North Carolina.\n       City of Chicago, Illinois.\n       City of Cleveland, Ohio.\n       City of Columbus, Ohio.\n       City of Dallas, Texas.\n       City of Jacksonville, Florida.\n       City of Kansas City, Missouri.\n       City of Long Beach, California.\n       City of Los Angeles, California.\n       City of Miami, Florida.\n       City of New York, New York.\n       City of Newark, New Jersey.\n       City of Oakland, California.\n       City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n       City of San Diego, California.\n       City of San Francisco, California.\n       City of San Jose, California.\n       City of Santa Ana, California.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I also ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a \nletter addressed to Senator Cornyn and me, signed by Governor Rick \nPerry of Texas and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California. What \nthey ask is that we follow the 9/11 Commission report recommendation to \nbetter allocate Federal resources based on vulnerability.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 12, 2005.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein and Senator Cornyn:  We are writing \n     to thank you for your leadership in working to assure that \n     Department of Homeland Security (DHS) counterterrorism grant \n     programs recognize the homeland security needs of the United \n     States. Any effective strategy to secure our nation must \n     apply risk-based analyses to manage the threat from \n     terrorism. We believe that the Homeland Security FORWARD \n     Funding Act of 2005 will provide much needed changes to these \n     programs by better recognizing the risks and vulnerabilities \n     faced by larger states such as California and Texas.\n       We support the efforts of your bill to build a coordinated \n     and comprehensive system to maximize the use of federal \n     resources and to provide clear lines of authority and \n     communication. Your bill will further the efforts of DHS, \n     cities, counties and state agencies as they continue to work \n     together to detect, deter and respond to terrorism. \n     Specifically, we appreciate the following provisions of the \n     bill:\n       Follows the 9/11 Commission Report recommendation to better \n     allocate federal resources based on vulnerabilities;\n       Analyzes risks, threats, vulnerability, and consequences \n     related to potential terrorist attacks; current programs do \n     not give full consideration to our states' urban population \n     centers, numerous critical infrastructure assets, hundreds of \n     miles of coastland, maritime ports, and large international \n     borders;\n       Reduces the ``small state'' minimum from 0.75% to 0.25%, \n     providing each state a baseline award while allocating an \n     increased level of funds based on risk; the current base + \n     per capita method allocates a disproportionate share of funds \n     to states with small populations;\n       Continues the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program \n     and exempts the program from the base percentage, allocating \n     all funds based on risk;\n       Continues the central role of states, building on existing \n     systems that effectively coordinate planning efforts and \n     insure accountability;\n       Allows for limited regional applications from existing UASI \n     cities or other urban areas with at least a population of at \n     least 500,000; and\n       Recognizes the importance of national standards for \n     evaluating the ``essential capabilities'' needed by state and \n     local governments to respond to threats.\n       Your continued support for improving the nation's ability \n     to detect and deter and coordinate responses to terrorist \n     events is appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n     Rick Perry,\n       Governor of Texas.\n     Arnold Schwarzenegger,\n       Governor of California.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \nfrom the mayor of San Francisco, Gavin Newsom, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Office of the Mayor,\n\n\n                               City & County of San Francisco,\n\n                                  San Francisco, CA, May 11, 2005.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I want to commend you for your \n     continued leadership on homeland security and express the \n     City's support for your ``Homeland Security FORWARD Funding \n     Act of 2005'', which prioritizes threat and risk and improves \n     the ability of local first responders to deter, prevent and \n     respond to terrorism.\n       Your proposal goes the furthest in supporting both the 9/11 \n     and Administration's principle that homeland security funds \n     should be allocated on the basis of risk of terrorism. The \n     bill corrects the major formula imbalance that exists in \n     current law by reducing the current mandatory state minimums \n     from 0.75 percent to 0.25 percent. The current inequity has \n     resulted in, since 9/11, California receiving $5 per capita \n     compared to Wyoming collecting $38 per capita.\n       Your bill also reaffirms the federal government's critical \n     partnership with the nation's areas that are at highest risk \n     of terrorist attack by grandfathering existing high-threat\n\n[[Page S8096]]\n\n     regions under the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI). The \n     City and County of San Francisco has proudly, under its UASI \n     grant, aggressively been leading the Bay Area in a ten county \n     regional plan to help protect and strengthen the region \n     against terrorist attacks.\n       I want to again express my deep appreciation for you and \n     your staffs outreach to San Francisco and other stakeholders \n     throughout California who are on the front lines of the war \n     on terrorism. Thank you for your important efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Gavin Newsom,\n                                                            Mayor.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Mayor \nRichard Daley of Chicago be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Office of the Mayor,\n\n\n                                              City of Chicago,\n\n                                       Chicago, IL, June 28, 2005.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     Hon. Diane Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Cornyn and Feinstein: I am writing to applaud \n     your collective efforts to develop the Homeland Security \n     FORWARD Funding Act of 2005. As a high threat urban area, and \n     a UASI grantee, the Chicago region is on the front lines of \n     our country's war on terrorism and I believe that this \n     legislation begins to more appropriately target first \n     responder funds to areas of highest risk and highest threat \n     throughout the nation.\n       Your proposal most closely tracks the recommendations of \n     the 9/11 Commission that call for funding to be distributed \n     based on risk. By reducing the small state minimum from .75 \n     percent in current law to .25 percent, your proposal more \n     equitably distributes critical funds to states and localities \n     that are truly at the highest risk of terrorism. Your \n     legislation also recognizes the importance of the work that \n     has been done at the state and local government level since \n     September 11, 2001, by reaffirming the regional approach to \n     terrorism preparedness and prevention and grandfathering \n     existing UASIs. The City of Chicago has worked closely with \n     our regional partners and the State of Illinois to develop a \n     coordinated homeland security plan and we welcome the \n     opportunity to build on that plan.\n       I again thank you for your bipartisan leadership in \n     developing this important legislation and look forward to \n     working with you in the future to move this bill forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Richard M. Daley,\n                                                            Mayor.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the League \nof California Cities be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  League of California Cities,\n\n                                      Sacramento, CA, May 4, 2005.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to express the League \n     of California Cities' (League) support and appreciation for \n     your leadership on homeland security legislation that would \n     allocate homeland security grants on the basis of risk of \n     terrorism. Your staff's work with our Washington staff is \n     very encouraging and we hope to continue this partnership.\n       California cities, together with the State and other \n     stakeholders throughout California, have advocated in favor \n     of bringing down the mandatory state minimums. Your draft \n     bill significantly corrects the major formula imbalance that \n     exists in current law by reducing the current state minimums \n     from 0.75% to 0.25%. We would ask that you consider going the \n     extra step and remove minimums altogether, but if there must \n     be a State minimum, we urge that your bill keep it as small \n     as possible. In addition, your bill clarifies the regional \n     approach taken in both the pending Senate and House bills (S. \n     21 and H.R. 1544).\n       California cities are on the front lines of the war on \n     terrorism and your legislation is very important to us. We \n     look forward to continuing to work closely with you as you \n     finalize your proposal, as well as providing support for your \n     legislation upon introduction. Thank you for your important \n     efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Christopher McKenzie.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Laura \nMiller, the mayor of Dallas, TX, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               City of Dallas,\n\n                                          Dallas, TX, May 5, 2005.\n     Senator John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: I would like to thank you for your \n     work to improve Homeland Security programs. This legislation \n     you are introducing addresses many of the City of Dallas' \n     concerns with the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) and \n     Homeland Security Grant programs. I am appreciative of your \n     effort to include certain measures that will allow the city \n     to receive an equitable share of Homeland Security funding \n     and spend it as we see appropriate. Your legislation is the \n     one which directs maximum funding to states and regions based \n     on risk. This change is critical.\n       The Dallas UASI has received approximately $35 million in \n     the last three years from the UASI program. This funding has \n     been used to enhance the metro area's first responder \n     capabilities to protect our citizens and critical \n     infrastructure. Unlike other proposed legislation, this new \n     bill allows for cities that are currently receiving Homeland \n     Security funds through the UASI program to be grandfathered \n     for future UASI funding. There are no provisions in the \n     legislation before the House or Senate to maintain current \n     UASI planning and the city greatly appreciates your concern \n     for our needs. The other bills could require a complete \n     revision of the approaches and strategies we have adopted.\n       Your proposal gives local governments a degree certainty \n     and ensures that we can make long-term plans. It also \n     includes provisions to ensure that state money will be passed \n     down to local governments quickly and efficiently. Your \n     legislation is the only measure that ensures that federal \n     funds reach first responders more expeditiously.\n       Thank you for your work this important legislation and for \n     including these important provisions. It will help the City \n     of Dallas and the nation as a whole to prepare.\n       Cordially,\n                                                     Laura Miller,\n                                                            Mayor.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the mayor \nof Long Beach, CA, Beverly O'Neill, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           City of Long Beach,\n\n                                    Long Beach, CA, June 28, 2005.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the City of Long \n     Beach, I am pleased to support your Homeland Security FORWARD \n     Funding Act of 2005 (S. 1013). This bill would target scarce \n     Homeland Security dollars to areas of highest threat and \n     need, rather than maintaining the current system that \n     allocates dollars through a non-risk based minimum guarantee \n     formula. This legislation will truly benefit urban areas, \n     such as the City of Long Beach, that have a high terrorist \n     risk by targeting federal funds to help mitigate potential \n     threats.\n       The House has passed the Cox-Thompson Bill (H.R. 1544), \n     which is similar to S. 1013. While the City of Long Beach \n     supports the direction of H.R. 1544, we believe your \n     legislation is superior because it addresses two critical \n     local concerns.\n       First, under the Cox-Thompson definition of an eligible \n     funding region, effective and proven governance structures \n     such as the Long Beach Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) \n     would no longer be eligible for federal Homeland Security \n     Funds. The member cities that comprise the Long Beach UASI \n     are Long Beach, Bellflower, Carson, Compton, Hawaiian \n     Gardens, Lakewood, Paramount, and Signal Hill, as well as the \n     County of Los Angeles. Long Beach is regarded as a model \n     because it has formed an effective partnership with its other \n     UASI member cities to implement the Department of Homeland \n     Security's regional approach to security needs. Under the \n     Cox-Thompson definition, this proven governance structure \n     would not be large enough to qualify for funding. Senate Bill \n     1013 would grandfather-in existing UASI structures, allowing \n     our effective model to continue to qualify for Homeland \n     Security funding.\n       Second, the Cox-Thompson bill would require a local match \n     of 25 percent after the first two grant years. This would \n     create a tremendous burden on cities across the nation that \n     are already struggling with difficult financial \n     circumstances. By directing cities to become more secure \n     while only providing 75 percent of the resources, the Federal \n     government would be creating an unfunded mandate that cities \n     would not be able to meet without reducing core services to \n     their communities. Long Beach already devotes more than 60 \n     percent of its General Fund budget to public safety such as \n     Police and Fire first response, which helps contribute to \n     national Homeland Security goals. Senate Bill 1013 would \n     ensure that Homeland Security funding remains 100 percent \n     grants, and that cities would not have to sacrifice local \n     service to their communities in order to fund national \n     Homeland Security needs.\n       Finally, Long Beach is concerned with the dwindling \n     Homeland Security resources dedicated to state and local \n     governments. Funding for state and local agencies through the \n     Office of State and Local Government Coordination and \n     Preparedness (SLGCP) decreased this year for the second \n     straight year by 10.5 percent or $420 million. Over the past \n     two years, there has been an overall decrease of 15 percent \n     and $627 million. Last year, the Long Beach UASI experienced \n     a 40 percent decrease in UASI funding from $12 million to \n     $7.3 million.\n       For the next fiscal year, both the Senate and House \n     Appropriations Committees are contemplating reduced funding \n     on the premise that state and local governments\n\n[[Page S8097]]\n\n     have not spent prior year's funding. The Senate \n     Appropriations Committee recommends reducing funding by 12.5 \n     percent, while the House Appropriations Committee recommends \n     reducing funding by 7.5 percent. Many of the delays In \n     spending are not due to lack of need; rather they are due to \n     the multi-leveled approval process, the time-consuming \n     purchasing requirements, and the low-supply of sought-after \n     equipment and other delays. For example, the Long Beach UASI \n     received its UASI 05 allocation in December, yet as of the \n     end of June, the authority to begin spending it has not yet \n     been received.\n       In regards to funding, one of the City's biggest issues is \n     providing Homeland Security resources for staff, particularly \n     to support training requirements, exercise requirements, \n     planning requirements, inventory management, as well as \n     enhanced capabilities. To put this into perspective, the \n     recent interagency security exercise, Operation Lead Shield, \n     cost Long Beach approximately $100,000 in non-UASI refundable \n     staffing costs. Costs for ongoing maintenance will also \n     become a growing concern as the contracts that were funded \n     for the life of a particular grant are now coming to a close \n     with the costs being born by the City's General Fund.\n       We applaud you and your colleagues for proposing bold new \n     changes to how Homeland Security funds are distributed. \n     Senate Bill 1013 provides a rational blueprint for the \n     effective risk-based distribution of Homeland Security \n     dollars, while remaining cognizant of the needs of cities \n     that rely on this important grant program. We hope you are \n     also able to protect the current level of funding for these \n     important programs, and work on the funding issues mentioned \n     above.\n           Cordially,\n                                                  Beverly O'Neill,\n                                                            Mayor.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. All these letters are in support of this amendment \nwhich earmarks money based on intelligence analysis of risk and threat.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, just to bring my colleagues up to speed as \nto what the hoped-for game plan is, there has now been agreement \nreached between the parties which will allow us at 11:30 to turn from \nthe debate on the formula proposal, offered by Senators Collins and \nFeinstein, to the issue of the veterans amendment offered by Senator \nReid on behalf of Senator Murray. We will debate that for half an hour \nequally divided. Then we will vote on that at 12:00. Then we will \nreturn to the debate on the Collins amendment and the Feinstein \namendment, and that debate will continue, so that the entire debate \nwill encompass approximately 3 hours which would mean it would wrap up \nsomewhere around 3:30, 3:45. At that point, there will be a window \nbecause we can't have a vote then due to outside circumstances. So \nthere will be a window of an hour, an hour and 45 minutes, during which \nMembers can bring amendments forward or, if they wish, during the \ndebate time maybe come and be recognized to set these amendments aside \nfor purposes of offering amendments.\n  In any event, there will be hopefully two votes occurring somewhere \naround 5 o'clock. This evening there is a joint Senate event for \nfamilies. That is where we stand. We haven't reached that agreement \nyet.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for a question, it is my \nunderstanding we are working on a unanimous consent request, and we \nhope to get it agreed to momentarily. To reiterate for my side of the \naisle and yours, if you have a pending amendment on this bill, there is \na window from about 3:30, 3:45 until 5 o'clock, if the UC is adopted, \nto come to the floor and speak to your amendment and have it pending or \nat least considered.\n  I think what I am hearing from the chairman is what we would give as \nadvice to all, and that is waiting until tomorrow or the next day is \nnot the wisest course. There are too many pending amendments, and there \nis a lot to be done on this bill. This bill is urgent and is a \npriority. I think that is good advice to both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think the assistant Democratic leader's counsel is very \nappropriate and hopefully will be listened to.\n  The debate we have is a large State/small State debate over a \nformula. This is authorizing language being put on an appropriations \nbill, which we in the Appropriations Committee try to avoid. As a \npractical matter, this bill allocates funds. I hope Members will take a \nlook at the allocation we did in this bill because this program has not \nbeen authorized.\n  Our theory in this allocation process was to have a threat-based \nallocation. I feel very strongly that this whole bill has been \nredirected with the work of Senator Byrd--I note that this is his \nbelief also--we reworked the bill to be a threat-based bill. We did it \nin the area of border security, weapons of mass destruction, and we did \nit in the area of this formula. We protected and grandfathered all the \nStates so the States going through upgrades of trying to get their \nfirst responder house in order will not see a devastating cut in what \nthey are receiving. Everything over the grandfathered amount \nessentially moves on the basis of threat. So the actual appropriation \nin the bill falls about halfway between the two theories being put \nforward here by the competing interests relative to how this formula \nshould be designed on the authorizing side. I just note that for my \ncolleagues' edification.\n  At this time, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 11:30 today \nthe Senate resume consideration of the Reid for Murray amendment \nregarding veterans health; provided further, that the time until 12 \nnoon be equally divided in the usual form, and that at noon the Senate \nproceed to a vote in relationship to the Murray amendment, with no \nsecond degrees in order prior to the vote. I further ask that the \npending Feinstein-Cornyn amendment be modified in order to become a \nfirst-degree amendment. I further ask that the time for Senator \nFeinstein's statement until 11:30 be divided equally between Senator \nFeinstein or her designee, and Senator Collins or her designee to \ndebate the Collins and Feinstein amendments concurrently; provided \nfurther, that at 2:15, there be an additional 90 minutes divided as \nstated above; finally, I ask that at 5 p.m. today the Senate proceed to \na vote in relation to the Collins amendment, to be followed by a vote \nin relation to the Feinstein amendment, with no amendments in order to \neither amendment prior to the votes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I don't \nobject, I only make two points, and one perhaps the Senator from \nCalifornia can help us clarify. Again, that is reiterating what the \nchairman has said. We urge Members who have pending amendments to be \nhere in the neighborhood of 3:30 or 3:45 to call up their amendment and \nmake sure they are pending on the bill, so we can keep this moving \nalong. This is a very important bill. It is all the more compelling \nbecause of the events of last week.\n  Second, relating to the Senator from New Jersey and how his time is \ngoing to be credited to this unanimous consent request, it is my \nunderstanding that the Senator from California has said that the time \nused by the Senator from New Jersey was to be taken from the time \nallocated to her amendment with Senator Cornyn; is that correct?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Otherwise, I have no objection to this unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senators. ]\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to voice strong \nopposition to the amendment being offered by Senator Collins to this \nHomeland Security appropriations bill. It is the wrong approach at a \ncritical time in the war on terror. Need any of us here be reminded \nthat it wasn't Portsmouth, England, that was attacked last week? I will \ntell you that the odds are that it won't be Portsmouth, ME, that is \ngoing to be under terrorist threats or that it compares in any way to \nthe most inviting targets in the country--one of which is in the State \nof New Jersey,\n\n[[Page S8098]]\n\nwhere 12 million people could be killed if there is a raid on the \nchemical plant that is very close to the New York border and within our \nState.\n  Mr. President, I am a member of the Homeland Security Committee. For \nthe record, the Collins legislation didn't pass without dissent in the \ncommittee. I strongly opposed the Collins bill offered by the chairman \nin committee, and I strongly oppose it here as an amendment to this \nappropriations bill.\n  The Collins amendment flies in the face of the recommendations of the \n9/11 Commission. Everybody says they worked hard. As a matter of fact, \nSenator Collins was a leader in getting the legislation done to reform \nthe intelligence operation. I commend her for that. But they are very \nclear in the 9/11 Commission report that distribution should be made on \nthe basis of risk. And it also, by the way, defies the wishes of \nPresident Bush and Secretary Chertoff.\n  The Commission stated in no uncertain terms that homeland security \nfunding should be allocated on the basis of risk, not political pork.\n  Unlike the Collins amendment, the underlying appropriations bill and \nthe Feinstein amendment move toward the goal of more risk-based \nfunding.\n  I salute the senior Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, and \nthe ranking member, Senator Byrd, for their efforts to move us toward \nmore risk-based funding in this appropriations bill. Their bill greatly \nimproves the confusing status quo by allocating 70 percent of homeland \nsecurity funding based on risk and threat. Very frankly, we ought to be \nat 100 percent, if we were consistent with the report produced by the \n9/11 Commission. I checked this again directly with former Governor \nKean from New Jersey. He reaffirmed his belief that you ought to put \nthe money where the risk is. But the Collins amendment before us today \nis a step backward, not forward. The Collins amendment would change the \nappropriations bill by reducing the amount of risk-based funding to \njust 60 percent.\n  This is an affront to the 9/11 Commission. What they said about how \nhomeland security funds should be distributed is clearly stated here. \nTheir recommendation No. 25 said this:\n\n       Homeland security assistance should be based strictly on an \n     assessment of risks and vulnerabilities.\n       Federal homeland security assistance should not remain a \n     program for general revenue sharing.\n\n  That is clear. They went on to make the point in very blunt language:\n\n       Congress should not use this money as pork barrel.\n\n  It is not just the 9/11 Commission that said that. Homeland Security \nSecretary Michael Chertoff has stated numerous times the need for \nhomeland security funding should be based more on risks, threats, and \nvulnerabilities.\n  This past Sunday on ``Meet the Press,'' Secretary Chertoff said:\n\n       We have to be risk-based in our funding.\n\n  He went on to define ``risk-based'' funding this way:\n\n       It means we look not at the question of political \n     jurisdiction, we look at where the consequences would be \n     catastrophic, where the vulnerabilities would be, where the \n     threats are.\n\n  He is right. We need to protect our Nation where the risks and \nvulnerabilities are. If we want to peel off pork, then we have to go to \nsome other bill to do it. I am not saying these are casual programs \nthat are being funded by a reduction in risk-based grants, but it is \nthe wrong thing at the wrong time, and everybody knows that. We are all \nin a semistate of shock as a result of the bombing in London.\n  Mr. President, 700 of my fellow New Jerseyans lost their lives on \nSeptember 11, 2001. Families, in many cases, are ruined forever, with \nthe lack of a daddy, a husband, a brother, a sister or a mother.\n  Throughout that tragic day, people in northern New Jersey could see \nthe smoke rising from the Trade Center, where many of our friends, \nneighbors, and loved ones worked. It could be seen from my house. The \nNew York-New Jersey region bore the brunt of the attacks on 9/11, and \nit continues to be the area of our Nation that is most at risk. But I \ndon't plead for this on a parochial basis. I plead for it for the \nsafety of our country as a whole.\n  In fact, the FBI determined that the 2-mile stretch in New Jersey, \nbetween the Port of Newark and Newark Airport, is the most at-risk area \nin the country for a terrorist attack.\n  The New York Times recently reported that an attack on just one \nparticular chemical plant in this area could kill or harm millions of \npeople.\n  I ask my colleagues to think about that. With the potential loss of \nlife in the millions, this is no time for putting parochial interests \nbefore the security of the Nation.\n  The tragic attacks in London only reinforce the need to protect the \nhigh-threat areas. As I said earlier, it is not Portsmouth, England, or \nPortsmouth, ME, that was attacked. That is not where the principal \nfocus of the terrorist is. We have to protect our entire country, but \nthere ought to be a system of priority that says this is the most \nimportant area. We should not casually dismiss an area that is one of \nthe largest population centers of our country or of the world, in fact.\n  Mr. President, I pose the question: How can we, in the wake of the \nLondon attacks, with all of the alerts that we have around the country, \nnow move to take funding away from where the threats are? It makes no \nsense. We ought to have more funding, not less, and we ought to have it \ndirectly aimed at the area of highest risk.\n  Under the amendment proposed by the Senator from Maine, 40 percent of \nhomeland security funds will be distributed not based on risk, but \nsimply distributed to every State and territory, regardless of the \nrisks they face. The Congressional Research Service has analyzed how \nthe Collins legislation would change the amount of funding going out \nbased on risk under this bill. They concluded that the Collins approach \nwould reduce risk-based funding by over $183 million--$183.53 million--\ncompared to the underlying appropriations bill.\n  It is absolutely critical that the Senate reject the Collins \namendment. In the wake of the London attacks, we need to show the \nAmerican people we are serious about protecting the country and not \njust interested in another back-home project.\n  In addition to opposing the amendment, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Feinstein-Cornyn-Lautenberg amendment. Our amendment moves \nus much closer to the goal of risk-based funding as called for by the \n9/11 Commission and the President of the United States.\n  The issue before us is bigger than politics. We are talking about the \nbest way to protect fellow Americans from another terrorist attack but \nalso, in protecting our ability to function in the event of an attack, \nmaking sure we have the communications link and the transportation \nlink. We ought to make certain that we pay attention to securing those \nareas that are most likely to be inviting targets for terrorism. This \nis not about regional rivalries. It is about protecting our most \nvulnerable communities.\n  With our votes on these two amendments, we are going to decide \nwhether we are going to follow the guidance of the 9/11 Commission or \nsimply ignore their recommendations. I do not know how we do that. It \nis fairly simple. I urge my colleagues to reject the Collins approach \nand support the Feinstein-Cornyn-Lautenberg amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time? The Senator from \nMaine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator \nCornyn, who is the prime cosponsor of the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia, wishes to go next. If he is not going to go next, I will be \nhappy to speak on my time. But it was my understanding he wanted to \nspeak first.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I may respond.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator for her courtesy. It is my \nunderstanding we have 45 minutes this afternoon at 2:15 and Senator \nCornyn will lead off at 2:15. I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \nthat clarification.\n  Mr. President, the Collins-Lieberman amendment has picked up a number \nof cosponsors, so I want to bring my colleagues up to date by reading \nthe full list of the cosponsors of the Collins-\n\n[[Page S8099]]\n\nLieberman amendment. They are as follows: Senators Voinovich, DeWine, \nCoburn, Akaka, Carper, Salazar, Coleman, Ben Nelson, Pryor, Snowe, and \nDayton. I ask unanimous consent that all of those cosponsors be added \nto the Collins-Lieberman amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, my friend from California, as well as the \nSenator from New Jersey, have both referred to a memo the Congressional \nResearch Service put together for Senator Lautenberg. First, let me say \nI have not seen this memo despite my staff repeatedly requesting a copy \nfrom Senator Lautenberg's office. The memo appears to have been widely \ndistributed to the press but, unfortunately, the Senator has chosen not \nto share it with the two sponsors of the amendment.\n  Why would that be? Perhaps it is because the last time my colleague \nfrom New Jersey asked CRS to put together a memo attacking S. 21, we \nquickly discovered it was based on fatally flawed assumptions.\n  The memo purported to show that S. 21 would lead to less risk-based \nfunding than under current law, but that was just plain wrong. And CRS, \nonce the analysts talked with my staff, agreed they had made a mistake. \nIn fact, CRS issued the memo I hold in my hand correcting the flawed \nconclusions of the Lautenberg memo.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the CRS analysis be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     To: Honorable Susan M. Collins, Attention: Michael Bopp\n     From: David C. Huckabee, 7-7877, Specialist in American \n         National Government Government and Finance Division\n     Subject: Homeland Security Minimum Allocation Comparisons: \n         Figures From FY 2005 Appropriation Act, and S. 21, As \n         Reported\n       This memorandum responds to your request for a comparison \n     of S. 21, as reported, and the FY 2005 Department of Homeland \n     Security (DHS) appropriations act with regard to the \n     allocation of funds in three homeland security assistance \n     programs: the State Homeland Security Grant program (SHSG); \n     the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program (LETPP); and \n     the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) grant program.\n       You asked for comparisons of percentage change figures \n     between funds that were guaranteed to be distributed to the \n     50 states, the District of Columbia, and specified U.S. \n     possessions. For the purpose of this analysis I used the \n     $2.303 billion that DHS distributed in FY 2005 using the \n     rules in place for that year, and procedures included in S. \n     21, as reported. Comparisons of funding to jurisdictions in \n     FY 2005, and what would occur if S. 21 (as reported) were \n     enacted, are complicated by several factors:\n       S. 21's guaranteed minimum funding to states (0.55% of the \n     total) is computed on a larger base ($2.303 billion, the \n     entire aggregate appropriation for SHSG, LETPP, and UASI) as \n     compared to the FY 2005 appropriation where states' 0.75% \n     base is applied to $1.448 billion (after excluding UASI \n     funds), and;\n       The FY 2005 appropriation act required DHS to allocate all \n     the funds remaining after the required mininl.um percentages \n     were distributed among the states and territories (excluding \n     VASI funds) in the same manner as in FY 2004, i.e., by \n     population.\n       The addition of the population distribution requirement in \n     FY 2005 increased state ``guaranteed minimum'' funds for that \n     fiscal year. If the S. 21 distribution formula were to be \n     adopted and appropriations remain at the FY 2005 level for \n     the SHSG, LETPP, and UASI programs in FY 2006, ``guaranteed'' \n     funding would decline by 39% (from $1.488 billion to $906 \n     million), and risk-based funding would increase by 71% (from \n     $815 million to nearly $1.4 billion).\n\nTABLE 1.

The earlier CRS analysis \n     had compared funding levels required in authorizing \n     legislation. Thus the FY 2005 appropriation language \n     requiring DHS to do a population-based distribution of the \n     remaining funds after each state received its 0.75% base \n     amount was not included in the analysis.\n       The FY 2005 DHS appropriations act required all SHSG and \n     LETPP funds to be distributed by a combination of a \n     guaranteed base, with the remaining funds allocated by \n     population. Thus, no SHSG or LETPP funds were available to be \n     allocated by risk in FY 2005 (or any other method DHS could \n     have chosen to use) because the PATRIOT act does not specify \n     how remaining funds will be distributed.\n       If the funding formula is not changed for FY 2006, and the \n     DHS appropriations act omits the requirement that ``formula-\n     based and law enforcement terrorism prevention grants . . . \n     shall be allocated in the same manner as fiscal year 2004,'' \n     funds guaranteed to states in 2006 would only include the \n     PATRIOT Act minimums.\n       I trust that memorandum will meet your needs in this \n     matter. Please feel free to call me if I can further assist \n     you.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as I understand it, the latest CRS \nanalysis--as I understand it from press accounts since, again, the \nSenator has not been willing to share it with my office--is once again \nflawed. It does not take into account the sliding scale minimum \nallocation that is included in the Collins-Lieberman amendment.\n  This sliding scale minimum distributes 10.7 percent of the funds in \nour bill based on population and population density. Those are two risk \nfactors that are used by the Department of Homeland Security to \ndistribute risk-based funds.\n  I note, because I want to give credit where credit is due, that the \nproposal for this sliding scale minimum came from our colleague, a \nsenior member of the committee, Senator Levin of Michigan.\n  Let's look at the real numbers. The fact is there is a doubling in \nthe amount of money that is based on risk under our amendment. The \nlegislation before us emphasizes risk-based funding and doubles the \namount of money compared to current law that would be allocated based \non risk.\n  The Committee on Homeland Security has done a great deal of work on \nthis formula. I think we see today the problems that occur when we try \nto write a formula not in committee, not based on careful hearings, \ninput from all interested parties, two markups, 3 years of \ndeliberations by the committee, but instead try to cobble together an \namendment on the Senate floor.\n  I have heard again today the comparison that Wyoming gets more money \non a per capita basis. The Senator from California, my friend and \ncolleague, made that argument. Over and over again we hear the argument \nthat homeland security dollars are unfairly allocated because less \npopulous States generally get more per capita than more populous \nStates. But the truth is, that argument does not hold water.\n  What is the point of that argument? That homeland security dollars \nshould be distributed on a per capita basis rather than risk and a \nminimum free each State? The fact is, risk-based allocations lead to \nper capita disparities as well.\n  Let's take the District of Columbia as an example. I think every \nsingle Member of this distinguished body would agree that the District \nof Columbia, despite its relatively small population, is an extremely \nhigh-risk area. In fact, the District of Columbia gets by far the most \non a per capita basis, nearly $217 per resident, because it is a small \npopulation, high-risk area.\n  Taken to its logical conclusion, the argument of these advocates is \nfewer dollars to the national capital region. The fact is, distributing \nfunds based on risk does not necessarily lessen the per capita \ndisparities among recipients.\n  We took a look at the distribution of fiscal year 2005 urban area \nsecurity initiative funds which are allocated based on risk. What we \nfound were the same or even greater levels of per capita disparities \ncompared to an analysis of the urban areas and State grant funds \ncombined. For example, Boston received nearly $48 per capita, where \nHouston, with over three times the population, received under $10 per \nperson. Los Angeles received about $18 per capita; Pittsburgh, $29.\n  The point is, moving from a formula to a risk-based distribution does \nnot necessarily bridge those per capita divides.\n  Second, let's look at what this is really all about. Under S. 21, the\n\n[[Page S8100]]\n\namount the small States would be guaranteed beyond their per capita \nshares amounts to less than 3 percent of the funds that are allocated--\n3 percent. Let's use the real example.\n  S. 21 would authorize $2.9 billion for homeland security grants. The \ntotal that small States are guaranteed in excess of their per capita \nshare is just $85.4 million out of that $2.9 billion. Here is the chart \nthat demonstrates what this allocation is all about.\n  In contrast, the 19 most populous States receive some $619 million in \nguaranteed funds under the bill, seven times more than the less \npopulous States are guaranteed beyond their per capita share.\n  In short, we are not talking about a major redistribution of homeland \nsecurity dollars.\n  The fact is also that the potential of terrorist attacks against \nrural targets is increasingly recognized as a national security threat. \nI quoted yesterday the Harvard study that talked about rural areas \nfacing unique and profound homeland security challenges. Bioterrorism, \nan attack on our food supply, where would those most likely occur? The \nfood supply is outside our urban areas. A great many power grids, water \nsupplies, nuclear plants--all of those are outside of urban areas.\n  Likewise, a report from the RAND Corporation, prepared for the \nNational Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, assessed \nhow prepared State and local law enforcement is. It noted that homeland \nsecurity experts and first responders have cautioned against an \noveremphasis on improving the preparedness of large cities to the \nexclusion of small communities or rural areas.\n  The report recognized that much of our Nation's infrastructure and \npotential high-value targets is located in rural areas.\n  The Department of Homeland Security said that it is well known that \nterrorists choose to live and train in small and rural communities.\n  Communities that my friends from California and New Jersey would say \nare at no risk, they are low risk, they should not receive risk money. \nThese small and rural communities are where the terrorists live, train, \nand hide.\n  That is why law enforcement has overwhelmingly endorsed the Collins-\nLieberman amendment. We have letters from the National Troopers \nCoalition, the Grand Lodge Fraternal Order of Police, the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations, the International Union of Police \nAssociations, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the \nUnited Federation of Police Officers, the International Brotherhood of \nPolice Officers, the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement \nExecutives, the International Association of Fire Chiefs.\n  All of these groups representing law enforcement and representing our \nfirefighters are endorsing the approach taken in the Collins-Lieberman \namendment. One reason they do is for the first time we are going to \nhave standards, we are going to tie spending to standards, and we \nrecognize that the first responders in each and every State deserve our \nsupport.\n  We need to bring every State up to a minimum level of preparedness, \nand we are not there now. That is why the National Governors \nAssociation and the National Emergency Management Association strongly \nendorse our approach.\n  Over and over again we hear from these organizations that the funding \nformula proposed in the Collins-Lieberman amendment ``promotes a better \nlevel of preparedness and brings some predictability to States for \nplanning purposes.'' That is from the National Troopers Coalition.\n  The Fraternal Order of Police says our legislation--this is the \nCollins-Lieberman legislation--recognizes the fact that the majority of \nFederal funds have been previously directed toward recovery response \noperations, too often at the expense of the efforts to prevent future \nattacks. Ensuring that all communities achieve and maintain the \nappropriate response-and-recover capacity for terrorist incidents is a \ncritical component. However, it is the goal of law enforcement to \nensure that we never have a terrorist incident to respond or recover \nfrom. We want to stop the attack before it even occurs.\n  Those are important advantages of the Collins-Lieberman approach. The \naccountability measures in our bill are absolutely critical and are \nmissing from the Feinstein-Cornyn-Lautenberg approach.\n  We know there has been wasteful funding. We cannot tolerate \ninappropriate and wasteful spending of critical homeland security \nfunds. That is why we have strong accountability measures in the \nCollins-Lieberman proposal, measures that are lacking completely from \nthe alternative put before us today. These accountability measures will \nensure that no longer will homeland security funds be spent to purchase \nair-conditioned garbage trucks in the State of New Jersey--that is the \nkind of wasteful spending that we want to guard against--or leather \njackets for the District of Columbia. Instead, spending would be tied \nto achieving essential capabilities for our first responders to meet \nnational preparedness goals.\n  This is a carefully thought out bill. It is a comprehensive bill. It \nreflects many hearings and input from the first responder community.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator \nfrom New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will be very brief. We just heard a \nreference to an investment made by the city of Newark. Newark Airport \nand the Port of Newark have been identified as the two most dangerous \nmiles for a terrorist attack in the United States, and they chose to \nuse the money to make sure their access ways would be clear of debris. \nThat was their choice. We are not going to talk about what any other \nState does with their money. That is not the argument. The argument is, \nwhat is the truth? The truth is, CRS, in a phone call just now, for the \ninformation of the Senator from Maine, confirmed exactly what they gave \nus as being correct. Under the Collins amendment, they come down with a \nconclusion that the percentage allotted for the risk would be 60 \npercent, and the percentage allotted for a guarantee, 40 percent. That \nis not what we are going into. Anything that we try to do to confuse \nthe figures to say that oh, no, in fact we are getting more, well, New \nJersey may get a couple more dollars under the Collins formula, but we \nhave to look at where the bulk of the danger is to our country.\n  Sure, rural States are entitled to be protected, but that is not done \nat the expense of having the most inviting targets in the country not \nget more money to protect themselves.\n  The Senator from Maine asked for it. We are going to send over for \nher review the report from CRS, and we have clarified a couple of \nthings. But at 60/40, we are far worse off than we were when we left \nthe committee, and I do not understand why that is. Perhaps the Senator \nfrom Maine does not see threats in the country in the same way that the \n9/11 Commission or the Secretary of Homeland Security does. Dismiss \nthat and make sure that everybody gets a little bit of the pie, that is \nnot where we are.\n  This is the second front in a war against terrorism, and we ought to \nmake sure we put plenty of funding here. We spend over $200 billion a \nyear in maintaining our fighting force in Iraq, and I want to do it as \nwell as anybody else, but we sure do not say we ought to distribute \nfunds throughout the Army, whether they are based in Georgia or some \nother State. No, we want to take care of them in the area where the \nrisk is greatest, and that is the same thing we ought to be doing, and \nnot trifling with this and trying to defend the numbers as not really \nsaying what they say.\n  They say what they say, and I ask unanimous consent that the report \nfrom CRS be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S8101]]\n\n\n\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 8, 2005.\n\n\n                               memorandum\n\n     To: Honorable Frank Lautenberg, Attention: David Garten.\n     From: Shawn Reese, Analyst in American National Government, \n         Government and Finance Division.\n     Subject: ``Guaranteed'' Base Homeland Security Grant Amounts \n         in S. 21 and Senate Reported H.R. 2360.\n\n       This memorandum responds to your request for information on \n     homeland security grant base amounts that would be \n     distributed in FY2006 to the states, U.S. possessions, and \n     territories (``guaranteed amounts'') in S. 21, as reported by \n     the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \n     Committee on May 24, 2005, and H.R. 2360, as reported by the \n     Senate Appropriations Committee on June 16, 2005. \n     Specifically, you requested a chart (see Table 1) that \n     depicts allocations to the states, U.S. possessions, and \n     territories assuming an appropriation of $1.918 billion, the \n     amount recommended by the Senate Appropriations Committee in \n     H.R. 2360, and you requested the percent of funds that S. 21 \n     and H.R. 2360 would allocate for such base amounts, as well \n     as the percent that would remain to be allocated through risk \n     assessments conducted by the Department of Homeland Security \n     Secretary. The first column of Table 1 depicts S. 21 base \n     amount allocations, and the second column depicts H.R. 2360 \n     allocations. Additionally, you requested a third column to \n     the chart depicting a 0.25% guaranteed base.\n       H.R. 2360. Of the $1.918 billion appropriated in H.R. 2360 \n     ($1.518 billion for state and local grants and $400 million \n     for law enforcement terrorism prevention grants), $580 \n     million would be distributed through the same distribution \n     process applied in FY2005. From the total of $580 million, \n     each state, DC, and Puerto Rico would receive $10.86 million, \n     and each U.S. possession and territory $3.62 million. After \n     the distributions, roughly $1.3 billion would be available to \n     be distributed through the risk assessment process.\n       S. 21. The bill would allow states, U.S. possessions, and \n     territories to select either of two options that yields the \n     highest funding level. First, funds would be divided among \n     the states, the District of Columbia (DC), and U.S. \n     possessions and territories as follows: Puerto Rico and \n     specified U.S. possessions and territories 0.055%; these \n     total 28.62%. Second, states could alternatively choose to \n     receive an amount based on a ``sliding scale baseline \n     allocation'' calculated by multiplying 0.001 times (1) a \n     state's population ratio and (2) a state's population density \n     ratio. After the funds are distributed ($763 million as shown \n     in Table 1), the remainder is distributed through the risk \n     assessment process, with a maximum of 50% to be distributed \n     to high-threat urban areas, and the remainder to the states.\n       I trust that this memorandum meets your needs; please \n     contact me if you need further information.\n\n  TABLE 1.--S. 21 AND

calculations based on formulas in S. 21 and Senate reported\n  H.R. 2360.\n \n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We will see that the Senator from Maine gets a copy \nimmediately.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Senator from New Jersey is mistaken \nin saying this bill provides less risk-based assistance than the \nlegislation reported from the committee in April. It does not. The \nSenator is in error. It is exactly the same as the committee-reported \nbill, which was reported without dissent on a voice vote.\n  The fact is, the Collins-Lieberman amendment doubles the funds that \nwould be distributed based on threat, risk, and consequences while \nmaintaining a predictable and meaningful level of funding for each \nState.\n  For the Nation to be prepared, all States must achieve a baseline \nlevel of essential capabilities. The Federal Government is a partner \nwith our State and local governments and with our 9 million first \nresponders in this regard. Unfortunately, what we are seeing today is a \nregrettable and corrosive argument that is pitting urban centers \nagainst rural States. Our bill does not do that. We have carefully \ncrafted a compromise that ensures that every State receives a baseline \nlevel in order to recognize that every State has homeland security \nneeds and vulnerabilities and that first responders throughout the \ncountry need to be properly equipped, trained, and supported.\n  We know the terrorists traveled through, trained in, and stayed in \nrural States. Two of them left from my home State of Portland, ME, to \nbegin their journey of devastation and death on September 11. A \npredictable stream of funding is essential to achieving the goals, but \nthe fact is, S. 21 doubles the amount of money for risk-based funding \ncompared to the current law. If one looks at this chart, the Senator \nfrom New Jersey repeatedly ignores the 10.7-percent distribution, which \nwas Senator Levin's proposal, which means that risk-based factors \naccount for more than 70 percent of the funding. That is more than \ndouble what is involved in current law.\n  So we have doubled the amount of money that would be allocated based \non risk factors while maintaining a steady, predictable base line \nfunding so that all States can achieve a level of preparedness. Again, \nthe Senator from New Jersey----\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I will be happy to yield once I conclude my explanation.\n  The Senator from New Jersey again ignores the amount of money in this \nbill that would go to the law enforcement terrorism prevention program, \nwhich would be authorized for the first time in this legislation. \nPrevention takes a back seat to responding to a terrorist attack, and \nthat is why virtually every police association in this country has \nendorsed the Collins-Lieberman bill, virtually every one, because of \nour emphasis on prevention as well.\n  The National Association of Police Organizations wrote: Unlike other \nhomeland security grant proposals, S. 21 ensures that the prevention of \nterrorist attacks, not just response efforts, receives a significant \nshare of homeland security funds.\n  I would be happy to yield to the Senator from New Jersey on his time \nor on the time of Senator Feinstein.\n  I yield the floor but reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Feinstein \namendment which is a sensible and vital reform of the way our homeland \nsecurity dollars are distributed.\n  The 9/11 Commission wrote in its report that:\n\n       Homeland security assistance should be based strictly on an \n     assessment of risks and vulnerabilities.\n\n  All communities, large and small, need to be prepared for the worst. \nHowever, with limited and, frankly, inadequate resources, we have to \nmake\n\n[[Page S8102]]\n\nchoices about how to prioritize homeland security spending.\n  The 9/11 Commission stated in its report:\n\n       Federal homeland security assistance should not remain a \n     program for general revenue sharing. It should supplement \n     state and local resources based on the risks or \n     vulnerabilities that merit additional support.\n\n  That is exactly what the Feinstein amendment does. It requires \nhomeland security grants to be allocated based on an assessment of \nthreat, vulnerability, and impact on the Nation.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, under the Feinstein \namendment, 87 percent of homeland security spending would be based on \nrisk.\n  Today, by comparison, fully 37.5 percent of homeland security funds \nare allocated for distribution before any risk analysis is done.\n  A Washington Post editorial of May 17 asked the question:\n\n       What, exactly are Federal ``first responder'' grants \n     supposed to do? Are they intended to give extra financial \n     help to firefighters and police officers who work in places \n     where the risk of a terrorist attack is highest? Or are they \n     meant to spread Federal pork evenly around the country?\n\n  This is not an attempt, however, to deny any Federal homeland \nsecurity funding to those areas that we know are the least likely to be \ntargets.\n  Under the Feinstein amendment, $251 million in Federal homeland \nsecurity aid would still be spread evenly across the States.\n  However, the vast majority of funding--over $1.6 billion--would be \nallocated based on actual risk.\n  In practical terms, the amendment will guarantee $300 million more \nthan the underlying bill for high-risk areas.\n  It means that cities like Boston, with its dense concentration of \nhigh-risk targets, will get the support it needs and deserves.\n  The city is a major financial hub with more than 130,000 people \nemployed in the securities, banking and insurance sectors. Any \ninterruption in the ability of these industries to function would \nundoubtedly reverberate far beyond the city, and be felt across the \nNation.\n  The city was also a major part of the high-tech boom years of the \n1990s. Today, it remains one of the Nation's most innovative high-tech \ncorridors. It employs over 100,000 professionals whose inventiveness is \nnot limited to the city, but is a major component of the Nation's \neconomic recovery.\n  The $7 billion tourism industry is also a major driver of economic \ngrowth. September 11 had an acute impact on Boston's ability to attract \nvisitors. Undoubtedly, if another attack were to happen, a similar \nchilling affect would occur.\n  The danger is not theoretical. In 2001, an Algerian citizen, who \nlater joined al-Qaida entered Boston as a stowaway on an Algerian gas \ntanker.\n  Security experts said that if the tanker's hull and cargo tanks had \nbeen successfully breached, the result could have been a disastrous \nfire in the port of Boston.\n  Another key aspect of the Feinstein amendment is its preservation of \nthe Urban Area Security Initiative, which has funded preparedness and \nprevention efforts in 56 of the most likely target regions that are \nhome to more than 75 million people.\n  Yesterday, the mayors of 22 cities, including Boston, wrote the \ndistinguished majority and minority leaders expressing their support \nfor the Feinstein amendment. They wrote:\n\n       It maintains the critical partnership between the Federal \n     government, States and the Nation's highest risk areas by \n     maintaining the Urban Area Security Initiative program. These \n     Urban Area Security Initiative regions have for several years \n     been aggressively working to implement comprehensive plans \n     for terrorism prevention and preparedness approved by their \n     States and the Department of Homeland Security. Maintaining \n     the Urban Area Security Initiative program will preserve and \n     sustain the substantial planning, long-term projects, and \n     regional decision-making processes underway.\n\n  Without the Feinstein amendment, we could see a funding cut in the \nUrban Area Security Initiative.\n  We all agree that every community in America deserves to receive its \nfair share of Federal homeland security assistance. No community should \nbe left unprotected. But it makes no sense to use limited resources to \nprovide maximum preparedness in the least at-risk communities, when we \nstill have not yet achieved even the minimum level of preparedness in \nour most high-risk areas. The Feinstein amendment reflects that obvious \npriority for communities across the country, and I urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Collins amendment \nto the Homeland Security appropriations bill before this body. I want \nto thank Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee \nChairwoman Collins and Ranking Member Lieberman for the diligent and \nconsiderate effort they have made to bring this legislation forward.\n  Also, I would like to thank Jeffrey Highley, a civil engineering \nfellow in my office, for all of his hard work on this issue. He has \nbeen a valuable asset to my office.\n  I know there will always be more that we can do to prepare for and \nprevent against the threats to our security. Yet the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill before this body continues to reduce the level of \nState funding that began as a response to an attack on our Nation.\n  That is why this amendment is so necessary. It restores threat-based \nfunding to the level States received in 2004 and increases the amount \nin the underlying bill by more than $1 billion. Furthermore, it \nprovides a smart and responsible approach to funding.\n  In order for our State and local emergency response teams to plan a \nlong-term strategy of preparedness, they need to have a level of \npredictable funding. States are required to submit plans to DHS 3 years \nin advance. This amendment will establish a fair and stable funding \nformula that States such as Arkansas can use to plan ahead.\n  Furthermore, this amendment will ensure that critical prevention \nefforts receive funding. The National Association of Police \nOrganizations agrees, ``[this amendment] ensures that the prevention of \nterrorist attacks--not just response efforts--receive a significant \nshare of the homeland security funds.''\n  I know there are some in Congress who believe that the funding \nformula for homeland security grants should solely reflect perceived \nthreat and risk. While I understand these concerns, I respectfully \ndisagree with my colleagues on the merits of their arguments.\n  Conventional wisdom might suggest that another terrorist attack will \ninvolve a target-rich environment--a big bustling city with skyscrapers \nand millions of people. Conventional wisdom suggests that terrorists \nmight strike at a location or at a symbol that personifies America. I \nsay, however, that to only rely on conventional wisdom sets ourselves \nup for unforeseen but certain tragedy down the road.\n  I ask my colleagues: Four years ago could we have fathomed 19 \nterrorists hijacking American airliners with box cutters no less? Could \nwe have fathomed these hijackers using those airliners to conduct \nsuicide missions? Could we have fathomed watching as two airplanes \nstruck the World Trade Center and yet another crashing into the \nPentagon?\n  And as you ponder those questions, I also ask: Just 1 month after \nthat, as America was pulling itself out of the ashes, still recovering \nfrom the horrific acts of September 11, 2001, did anyone foresee an \nenvelope being sent to Senator Tom Daschle's office that would cause \nthe largest biological attack on American soil and effectively shut \ndown the Senate Hart Building for several months?\n  We look back at these events now in hindsight and I think we have \nlearned a lot about our enemy and what it will take for us to both win \nthe war on terror and defend our homeland.\n  But let us remember: we must be prepared for the next terrorist \nattack, not the last. And that terrorist attack could come in many \nshapes and sizes.\n  I understand how some might think that big cities on the east and \nwest coasts are those most vulnerable, most at risk for another \nhorrific attempt. But I think it is obtuse to write off a large section \nof this country because of conventional wisdom.\n  I think it is naive to believe terrorists would never strike at our \nheartland, that they would not attempt to attack our food supply or our \nnuclear and chemical plants located in both large and small States.\n\n[[Page S8103]]\n\n  I think it is shortsighted to think that the next attack will be \nsimilar to the first and to prepare with such narrow vision.\n  In order for America to be protected from terrorism, we need all \nparts of the country to be prepared.\n  Local and State entities and first responders across the Nation have \nworked doggedly to make our Nation safer, and they have. Our civilian \nauthorities must be able to respond to whatever may confront them in \nthe future. But how can they properly respond when they are not given \nadequate resources?\n  With the amendment offered by Senators Collins and Lieberman, State \nhomeland security will be based on the essential capabilities necessary \nto prepare for potential terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other \nemergencies--no matter where they might occur.\n  September 11 made us acutely aware that there are vulnerabilities in \nour homeland but it also made us acutely aware of the need of genuine \npartnerships that involve all segments of our communities and all \nlevels of government--we all have a role in keeping our community safe.\n  So I submit that part of our job of the Federal Government must be to \nensure that local governments are given the resources to protect their \ncitizenry and that we all share the responsibilities for homeland \nsecurity wisely and fairly.\n  This is why I urge my colleagues from States small and large to \nsupport the Collins amendment. It strikes a fair balance between the \ncritical need to provide a baseline of protection and providing risk-\nbased funding.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, While I support the underlying amendment \nand hope my colleagues will support it, I rise to strongly object to a \nprovision in this amendment which lies within the jurisdiction of the \nSenate Finance Committee. Section 1808 requires the Bureau of Customs \nand Border Patrol to conduct a study on the screening of municipal \nwaste. The Bureau is then required to ban the importation of such waste \n6 months after the report is submitted unless certain certifications \nare made.\n  I have been in consultation with the Office of the United States \nTrade Representative and believe that this provision raises serious \ninternational trade concerns. In fact, this provision could violate \ntrade responsibilities under both the World Trade Organization and the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement. If that is the case, our exporters \nare likely to face retaliation. I don't want that to happen. \nFurthermore, it could also provoke similar restrictive actions by our \ntrading partners against U.S. waste exports. According to the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, approximately 250 U.S. companies in \nover 30 States sent hazardous waste shipments to Canada in 2003 alone.\n  I am especially disappointed that this provision was reported out by \nthe Committee on Homeland Security. Last year we engaged in significant \ndebate regarding appropriate jurisdictional responsibilities of each \ncommittee. The Senate determined that provisions relating to Customs \nand border protection and international trade clearly lie within the \njurisdiction of the Finance Committee.\n  Just a cursory reading of the scope of the Finance Committee's \njurisdiction under Rule 25 of the Standing Rules of the Senate provides \nthat:\n\n       The following standing committees shall be appointed at the \n     commencement of each Congress, and shall continue and have \n     the power to act until their successors are appointed, with \n     leave to report by bill or otherwise on matters within their \n     respective jurisdictions:\n       Committee on Finance, to which committee shall be referred \n     all proposed legislation, messages, petitions, memorials, and \n     other matters relating to the following subjects: Customs, \n     collection districts, and ports of entry and delivery; \n     reciprocal trade agreements; revenue measures generally; and \n     tariffs and import quotas, and matters related thereto.\n  An elaboration of the scope of the Finance Committee's jurisdiction \ncan be found on our web site where it is clearly explained that:\n\n       The Senate Finance Committee's jurisdiction is defined by \n     subject matter--not by agency or Department.\n       As a consequence of the committee's broad subject matter \n     jurisdiction, the Finance Committee has sole or shared \n     jurisdiction over the activities of numerous agencies and \n     offices: the Office of the United States Trade \n     Representative; the Department of Agriculture Foreign \n     Agricultural Service on matters relating to foreign barriers \n     to U.S. agriculture goods; numerous divisions within the \n     Department of Commerce; and Broad Jurisdiction over the \n     Department of Homeland Security.\n\n  This provision of this amendment clearly falls within the \njurisdiction of the Finance Committee. And there is a reason for \ncommittee jurisdiction. We need to ensure that those committees with \nappropriate expertise have an opportunity to weigh the implications of \nthese provisions before they become law. Otherwise, we end up exactly \nwhere we are today--exposing our exporters to unnecessary trade \nretaliation due to ill conceived and short-sighted provisions.\n  I urge the conferees to reject this provision during conference \nconsideration.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nrisk-based homeland security funding. This concept is as urgent as it \nis simple.\n  Homeland security grants related to terrorism prevention and \nterrorism preparedness should be allocated based strictly on an \nassessment of risk, threat, and vulnerabilities.\n  The best approach is to ensure that all homeland security funds are \nallocated to States based on the vulnerabilities of each State. Earlier \nthis year, Senator Lautenberg and I introduced a bill to ensure that \nthe distribution of Homeland Security funds would be 100-percent risk \nbased. This is the right way to ensure that our homeland is truly \nprotected. It is not an issue of believing that larger, more populous \nStates deserve more funding; it is simply a question of believing that \nthe places with the greatest need deserve the most resources.\n  The Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill on the Senate \nfloor includes a 70-percent risk-based formula that would ensure that \n$1.3 billion in funding would be allocated based on risk. Senators \nFeinstein and Cornyn have proposed an amendment to improve this and \nensure that 87 percent of the funds--$1.9 billion--would be allocated \nbased on risk. While I would still prefer 100 percent, I support the \nFeinstein-Cornyn amendment.\n  New Jersey and the rest of the country will be much safer under the \nFeinstein-Cornyn proposal than under the Collins-Lieberman amendment, \nwhich would only allocate 60 percent of the funds based on risk. Under \nthe Collins-Lieberman amendment, all of the homeland security grant \nmoney would be combined into one fund; of that, 40 percent would be \nallocated as guaranteed funding for the States and would be distributed \neither on the basis of .55 percent per State or on a sliding scale \nbaseline allocation, which would be determined by a State's population \nand population density. Even given the enhanced funding allowance for \ndensely populated States, New Jersey and other high-risk States would \nstill fair worse under the Collins-Lieberman amendment. That is because \nthe amendment combines all funding sources into one fund and allocates \ntoo much funding, 40 percent of the total allocation, as minimum, \nguaranteed grants to each State. Under a more risk-based formula, New \nJersey would receive greater homeland security funds to handle the \nsubstantial risks that face my State.\n  Mr. President, those of us who live in high-risk areas are acutely \naware of the threat of terrorism. But protecting our homeland is not \nsomething that can, or should, be looked at as an exclusively ``local'' \nissue. Experts throughout the Nation support a risk-based approach. \nProtecting America, in the places where we are most vulnerable, in \nplaces where we know that terrorist want to inflict the greatest harm, \nis in fact a national issue--which is why the 9/11 Commission \nrecommended pure risk-based allocation.\n  To quote the Commission:\n\n       Homeland security assistance should be based strictly on an \n     assessment of risks and vulnerabilities. . . . [F]ederal \n     homeland security assistance should not remain a program for \n     general revenue sharing. It should supplement state and local \n     resources based on the risks or vulnerabilities that merit \n     additional support. Congress should not use this money as a \n     pork barrel.\n\n  Mr. President, one of the reasons this is such a national priority is \nbecause of the economic issues at stake. An attack on our Nation's \neconomic assets, our capital markets, or our financial institutions \nwould have a ripple effect\n\n[[Page S8104]]\n\nthroughout the country and have a serious long-term effect on our \nNation's economy.\n  Protecting these assets has to be part of our national strategic \nconsiderations. In my State, New Jersey, we have many such targets. We \nhave areas like the Port Newark. Eighty percent of the cargo containers \nthat come into the east coast arrive at that port.\n  Then there is the 2-mile stretch, from the port to Newark Airport, a \nstretch of terrain the FBI has called the ``most dangerous 2 miles in \nAmerica.''\n  And Mr. President, Newark Airport is not only the busiest airport in \nthe tristate area, it is, depending on the time of year, the third or \nfourth busiest airport in America. A terrorist attack on Newark \nAirport, or on any of these other possible targets, would have a wide-\nranging, long-term effect on our national economy. Protecting these \ncritical national assets must be a national priority.\n  Regrettably, the current homeland security grant system results in \nfunding allocations that fail to adequately consider the risk, \nvulnerability and threats posed to specific communities. And that is \njust plain wrong.\n  To understand why, we need to look at the practical realities of \nhomeland security.\n  My home State of New Jersey is on the front lines of terrorism. We \nlost 700 people on September 11, 2001. Two of the 9/11 terrorists were \nbased in New Jersey and the anthrax that hit this institution \noriginated in New Jersey.\n  In addition to Port Newark and Newark Airport, the Ports of \nPhiladelphia and Camden are critical vulnerabilities.\n  New Jersey is home to rail lines, bridges, and tunnels to New York \nCity, as well as chemical plants and nuclear facilities.\n  Atlantic City has the second highest concentration of casinos in the \ncountry.\n  Wall Street and other financial services firms house important front \nand back office operations, including clearance and settlement \nservices, and other operations essential to functioning of America's \ncapital markets in Newark, Jersey City, and Hoboken.\n  To underscore those risks, in the summer of 2004 Newark was one of \nthree locations--including New York City and Washington, DC--that was \nput on Orange Alert for a possible terrorist attack as intelligence \nsuggested that the Prudential building in downtown Newark could be a \ntarget.\n  And Mr. President, the costs associated with protecting Newark during \nthat period of heightened security alert were very real.\n  Last year wasn't the first time that New Jersey has incurred \nsubstantial costs because of its unique vulnerability.\n  The post office in Hamilton, NJ, where the anthrax was sent, has had \nto be cleaned up. The costs are expected to be $72 million for \ndecontamination and $27 million for the refurbishment of the facility.\n  Yet despite these growing threats to New Jersey--from anthrax to the \nOrange Alert, and the ever-expanding costs associated with protecting \nthe most densely populated State in the country, remarkably homeland \nsecurity grants to New Jersey were cut in 2005.\n  Funding was reduced from $93 million in 2004 to $61 million in 2005. \nNewark has seen a 17-percent reduction in funds, from $14.9 million to \n$12.4 million. And, incredibly, Jersey City's homeland security funds \nhave dropped by 60 percent, from $17 million in 2004 to $6.7 million in \n2005.\n  These cuts leave New Jersey--home of countless businesses and people \nthat keep our economic engine moving; home of one of the most active \nand exposed ports in the country; home of one of the busiest airports \nin America; home of our Nation's new Homeland Security Secretary--36th \nin the Nation in per capita homeland security funding.\n  That, Mr. President, is a travesty.\n  We must allocate assistance to cities, municipalities and communities \naccording to risk and vulnerability.\n  Mr. President, it is hard for the people of New Jersey to live \nthrough what they have and then see cuts in homeland security. This is \nan extremely important issue to them and they want and expect change.\n  I am not seeking to deprive other parts of the country of the \nhomeland security funding they need. But I believe that we must leave \nit to the Department of Homeland Security to make the determination of \nwhat States should receive funding based on need, vulnerabilities, and \nthreats.\n  The Department of Homeland Security was created to stop terrorism. It \nis responsible for analyzing intelligence on threats to our Nation and \nfor protecting our people and our infrastructure.\n  Mr. President, directing our homeland security funding toward those \nareas that are most at risk is especially critical in times of \nshrinking budgets. And let me note that the President understands the \nneed for risk-based funding and suggested an approach similar to the \nFeinstein-Cornyn amendment in his budget for 2006 when he proposed the \nallocation of $251 million to each State and $1.7 billion, or 87 \npercent of total funds, for higher risk areas based upon need.\n  By passing the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment, we will continue the \ncritical work of post-9/11 reform that included the creation of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security itself, the establishment of the 9/11 \nCommission, and the passage of the intelligence reform bill.\n  Mr. President, we need to deal with homeland security as we do \nnational security. That means directing our resources toward making us \nsafer by targeting need, vulnerability, and threat to address the \nNation's homeland security funding needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, how much do I have remaining this \nmorning?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 4 minutes 10 \nseconds remaining. The Senator from Maine has 14 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield, then, to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I had asked to be yielded to for a \nquestion, but if there is no yielding, if the time is charged to me, I \ndo not need consent from anybody. If it is our time, we are going to \nuse it.\n  I thank the Senator from Maine but would say no thank you, and I will \ntake this brief minute because what we are looking at is what has \npassed through the committee and what is actually on the floor as an \nappropriations bill.\n  Under the appropriations bill--this is CRS--it very simply says \n$1.338 billion for the underlying bill creates a shortage for the risk-\nbased of $183.53 million. We can turn the table, we can play with the \nnumbers, but we are looking at an appropriations bill. And if we do not \nbelieve CRS, then I do not know to whom we ought to turn for advice and \nfor understanding.\n  When the Senator from Maine suggests that my numbers are incorrect, \ndo not take my numbers, please. Just take CRS and see what they say. It \nmakes it all very clear. It is a 60/40 relationship, far different than \nthat which we intended when the amendment passed the committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will use the time, if I might, then. The \ndistinguished chairman of Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nmentioned something which affected me a little bit, and I would like to \nrespond to it respectfully, that our amendment was cobbled together on \nthe Senate floor. I point out that our amendment was introduced as a \nbill on May 12. I also point out that prior to that we worked on this \namendment for at least 6 months with high-risk areas, with cities, with \nStates, and with law enforcement.\n  This amendment is born in the belief that just as terrorists in Great \nBritain did not go to Stratford-on-Avon, they went to London; just as \n9/11 did not take place in Milpitas, CA, it took place in the financial \ncenter of America; and just as the bombers in Spain did not go to a \nrural Spanish community, they went to Madrid.\n\n[[Page S8105]]\n\n  Now, I can only use my experience as a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee to say whether it is advisable to have a fixed formula or \nadvisable to give those people who have access to all of the \nintelligence--intelligence from CIA, intelligence from counterterrorism \npeople, intelligence from the FBI, and all of those who do the risk \nanalysis, whether they should have the flexibility to determine where \nthe moneys go. From my perspective, that is the way to go. From my \nperspective, America is best protected if we give the people with the \nknowledge and the intelligence the maximum flexibility to allocate \nfunds based on quality of grants to areas that are likely targets. \nNothing can change my mind on this. If you review intelligence, you get \nan idea of what might be a target and what is not a target.\n\n  That is just today. It could change in 6 months. It could change in 2 \nyears. There are many of us who believe we are in this war, this \nasymmetric, terrible, non-state-actor war, for a long period of time. \nFor me, just as you would give the Joint Chiefs of Staff the ability to \nmount a battle plan, I think we should give Homeland Security the \nability to mount the risk analysis that enables the distribution of \ngrants in the most effective way.\n  We have tried to do this in our bill. The underlying bill has 70 \npercent of the funds based on risk; the Collins-Lieberman amendment, 60 \npercent on risk; and Feinstein-Cornyn, 87.5 percent on risk.\n  The choice is clear. People who believe differently will vote \ndifferently. There is always a question because we know the composition \nof this body, we know the number of small States, and we know the \nlikelihood that people are going to vote their State. I say to them, \nwhether they do the best thing, if something happens and people look \nback as to how the money was allocated, I would much prefer to be able \nto say that the best experts we have have made the decisions on the \nallocation of funds, rather than that I would doing it on any other \nbasis, whether that basis is population, whether it is geography, \nwhether it is based on whether you produce food or whether you produce \nhigh tech or anything else. The money must go where the threat and risk \nis, the money must go where the vulnerabilities in the eyes of the \nterrorists are, and no formula can know where those vulnerabilities \nare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has 14 minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, before the Senator from California leaves \nthe floor, let me say I admire the Senator from California, who is one \nof the most careful, thorough Members of this body.\n  The point that I was trying to make, and perhaps not as artfully as I \nshould have, is that the Homeland Security Committee has held extensive \nhearings on the Homeland Security Grant Program. I am not aware of \nother committees in the Senate having done that. We have held extensive \nhearings over 3 years. We drafted a bipartisan bill. We received input \nfrom a number of groups. We have had two different markups, and the \nbill was reported unanimously last year, with only Senator Lautenberg \nin dissent this year. So our bill has had a great deal of \nconsideration. That was the only point I was trying to make.\n  As the Senator knows, I have a great deal of admiration for what a \ncareful legislator she is.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I might say, Mr. President, I have great \nadmiration for the Senator from Maine in the way she has conducted \nherself and the leadership she has shown.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me clear up a couple of \nmisperceptions surrounding this debate. First of all, this debate is \nnot about big States versus small States, although it certainly sounds \nthat way.\n  Our amendment, for example, is cosponsored by both Senators from Ohio \nand, in fact, was heavily influenced by and contributed to by the \nSenator from Michigan, Mr. Levin. I ask unanimous consent he be added \nas a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. One reason our amendment bridges the small State-big \nState divide is that unlike the alternative amendment, the underlying \nbill, or current law, our amendment breaks away from a one-size-fits-\nall approach by establishing this sliding scale minimum allocation. \nDoes a more populous State require more funds to achieve adequate \nlevels of preparedness and prevention? The answer is yes, which is why \nthe 19 most populous and densely populated States would get a higher \nbaseline allocation than the .55 percent that other States would \nachieve. That includes the State of New Jersey, I would note, which \nreceives considerably more.\n  Second, the underlying bill is not a middle point between the \namendment that Senator Lieberman and I have offered and the Feinstein-\nCornyn amendment. In fact, the underlying bill in our amendment \nincludes substantially the same type of baseline allocation for most \nStates. The difference is that under our amendment, the 19 most \npopulous and densely populated States would receive a greater baseline \nallocation.\n  If you take into account the sliding scale minimum, which neither of \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle have taken into account when \nthey look at our bill, our amendment and the underlying bill allocates \nsubstantially the same amount of funds based on risk.\n  When we talk about the significance of preventing the next terrorist \nattack, it is important to note that terrorists have been proven to use \nstaging areas away from the most obvious targets. So while New York \nCity, Los Angeles, and Washington, DC, are clearly targets, let us not \nforget that opportunities to catch terrorists, to stop them, exist in \nplaces such as Portland, ME; Norman, OK; and Norcross, GA.\n\n  As a recent publication of the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice notes:\n\n       Several of the terrorists involved in the September 11 \n     attacks had routine encounters with State and local law \n     enforcement officials in the weeks and months prior to the \n     attack. If State, tribal and local law enforcement officers \n     are adequately equipped and trained, they can be invaluable \n     assets in efforts to identify and apprehend suspected \n     terrorists before they strike.\n\n  Let's again look at some of the facts. As the 9/11 Commission report \nnotes, terrorists trained and operated in different parts of the \ncountry to prepare for and carry out the September 11 attacks. For \nexample, two of the terrorists were pilots and visited the flight \nschool in Norman, OK. Norman is also where Moussaoui and another \nterrorist resided while attending school. Two of the terrorists stayed \nin Georgia, visiting such small communities as Norcross and Decatur \nbefore living in Stone Mountain, GA.\n  Although the 9/11 Commission found no explanation for these travels, \nthe terrorists' mobility reveals an unpredictable pattern that shows \nthat their presence was not confined to large cities. Over and over \nagain, if you look at the list from the 9/11 Commission, you will see \nthat the terrorists trained and lived in rural America, in small \ncommunities. As I have said earlier, this issue is very real to us from \nthe Northeast, from the State of Maine in particular, because two of \nthe terrorists started their day on 9/11 from the Portland, ME, \nairport.\n  Over and over again, we have seen, from law enforcement, warnings \nthat we need to pay attention to prevention, and that is exactly what \nthis bill does. Local police departments and sheriff's offices provide \nthe bulk of law enforcement services to rural communities, and they are \nseverely constrained by a lack of resources. That is why so many law \nenforcement groups have endorsed the Collins-Lieberman proposal.\n  There are other challenges; for example, to our food supply. But I \nsee the Senator from Connecticut is now on the floor, so I yield to him \nthe remaining time before we return to the Reid amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nMaine. I regret I had other commitments that did not allow me to join \nwith her in defense of our very worthy amendment. I look forward to \nbeing back here at 2:15 when we return to it.\n  Yesterday, I explained why I believe that our amendment is the right \nthing to do. It is balanced. It increases the funding based on risk to \nthose areas\n\n[[Page S8106]]\n\nthat have been deemed to be highest risk. But it recognizes a reality \nthat terrorists strike at vulnerable targets. Because they struck \nWashington and New York on September 11, 2001, doesn't mean that they \nare not going to strike smaller areas of our country, less populated, \nin the years ahead. In fact, one of the great fears people have had is \nof a coordinated series of terrorist attacks on public places outside \nof large urban areas.\n  The fact is, those places in America need to have some support from \nus as well for their first responders and to serve also as first \npreventers. That is exactly what our amendment does.\n  The amendment introduced by the Senators from California and Texas \nwould all but eliminate the minimum amount of Homeland Security funding \nguaranteed to each State and would give the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity almost unfettered discretion over more than 90 percent of \nHomeland Security grant funds. This amendment that Senator Collins and \nI have introduced dedicates significantly more funding to purely risk-\nbased grants than has been the case in previous years. Under our \namendment, it is fair to say that everybody gets more support to \nprotect their citizens against the terrorist threat, including those \nareas that are deemed to be the highest risk, but at the same time we, \nin the Collins-Lieberman amendment, strike a judicious balance that \nwould allow each State to achieve basic preparedness.\n  Further, substantial reductions in the minimum would make it more \ndifficult for States to achieve those essential capabilities, as \noutlined in the National Preparedness Goals that the Department of \nHomeland Security has set out for our Nation.\n  I want to very briefly outline, in the minute or two left before we \ngo to another matter, several reasons why I think we should stick with \nthe balanced approach in S. 21, which is the Collins-Lieberman \namendment that came out of the Homeland Security Committee with \noverwhelming bipartisan support--only one vote against it. While there \nis a need for more risk-based funding, risk-based methodology is an \nart, not a science. The bottom line is that while we think we know \nwhere terrorists wish to attack based on past experience, the fact is \nwe don't know for sure. They strike hard targets, they strike soft \ntargets.\n  Risk-based methodology is an art the Department of Homeland Security \nis still struggling to develop. So let's not talk about it as if it is \nscience. It is prediction. It is a probability. If we focus all of our \nfunding on where those probabilities lead, it will leave most of the \ncountry undefended.\n\n  Terrorists have demonstrated a willingness to attack a wide variety \nof targets in a wide variety of places. In 2001, a plot was uncovered \nby intelligence agencies to attack an American school in Singapore. In \n2002, in Bali, terrorists targeted a discotheque. In 2003, terrorists \nstruck a residential compound in Riyadh. In 2004, terrorists targeted a \nschool in Beslan, Russia. Most of these may not have been considered to \nbe high-risk areas, but nonetheless they were targets of terrorists.\n  Our own distinguished FBI Director Bob Mueller has said America is \nawash in desirable targets for the terrorists throughout this country. \nFunding provided to States outside of the so-called high-risk areas \ncould well be the key to preventing an attack in another State, which I \nwill speak to later in the day.\n  The Collins-Lieberman amendment will assure that every State can \nachieve the level of preparedness the Department of Homeland Security \nhas defined for the Nation. It will be a predictable, reliable stream \nof funding. The bottom line is more States have more to gain from our \namendment in defense of our homeland security.\n  I thank the Chair. Noting the hour, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1129\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 12 \no'clock will be equally divided in the usual form for debate on the \nMurray amendment.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, would you state the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 30 minutes \nof debate on the amendment offered by Senator Reid on behalf of Senator \nMurray of Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators \nCorzine, Dayton, Conrad, Bingaman, and Salazar to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago the Senate came together, not \nas Republicans and Democrats, but as Americans, to do what is right for \nour Nation's veterans. By a vote of 96-0, we all agreed to increase \nveterans funding by $1.5 billion. We agreed to fill the appalling \nshortfall the VA faces this year by agreeing to that amendment for $1.5 \nbillion. It was a very clear message that we will be there for the \npeople who have served our country. I was very proud of the Senate when \nwe passed that amendment to do the right thing.\n  Shortly following that unanimous vote, the majority leader stood on \nthe Senate floor and moved to have the Senate yield to the House of \nRepresentatives' lower figure of $975 million. That would have gone \nagainst what this Senate had just agreed to. That proposal by the \nmajority leader also went against what the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee had agreed to earlier that very same day. On a bipartisan and \nunanimous basis, the Senate Appropriations Committee members reaffirmed \nthat the Senate should approve the full $1.5 billion in immediate \nfunding for the VA. The Appropriations Committee and the full Senate \nunanimously agreed that America's veterans deserve the full $1.5 \nbillion for this fiscal year. Then there was an attempt to accept a \nlower number.\n  We need to make sure in this Senate there is no backtracking and that \nveterans in this country who have served us honorably do not get \nshortchanged. To make it clear to our Nation's veterans and to the \nAmerican public, I am here with my colleague Senator Akaka and others \nin the Senate, offering an amendment that clears up this confusion. It \nclearly says the Senate stands firmly behind our unanimous vote of $1.5 \nbillion in emergency spending for veterans health care.\n  If we backtrack, if we walk away from the $1.5 billion we promised \nthis year for our veterans, our men and women who have served this \ncountry honorably will be hurt. If we yield to the House's $975 \nmillion, the VA hiring freeze will remain in place. That means no new \nmental health specialists will be hired to help our veterans who are \ndealing with posttraumatic stress disorder.\n  If any of my colleagues went home as I did last week and talked to \nreturning soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan, they will know as I do \nthat these mental health specialists are absolutely needed for our men \nand women who are serving America today.\n  If we yield to the House's $975 million, the VA will not be able to \nbuild any of the new clinics our veterans have been promised. That \nmeans inconvenience and less access to care for the people who have \nsacrificed for our country. That is not what we promised our veterans. \nThis is a critical priority.\n  We have a huge problem right now in this fiscal year 2005. Secretary \nNicholson has made it very clear that the VA is at least $1 billion \nshort this year. My colleagues know I have been here since the \nbeginning of the year warning that this problem goes much deeper. Go \nout to any of your VA facilities and talk to any veterans who are \ntrying to get access and Members will know as I do that veterans are \nwaiting today 3 years for surgery.\n  The Associated Press reported in the papers today that the Army \nNational Guard is having trouble recruiting the soldiers it needs.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [From the Associated Press]\n\n              National Guard Misses Recruiting Goal Again\n\n       Washington (AP).--The Army National Guard, a cornerstone of \n     the U.S. force in Iraq, missed its recruiting goal for at \n     least the ninth straight month in June and is nearly 19,000 \n     soldiers below its authorized strength, military officials \n     said Monday.\n       The Army Guard was seeking 5,032 new soldiers in June but \n     signed up only 4,337, a 14% shortfall, according to \n     statistics released Monday by the Pentagon. It is more than \n     10,000 soldiers behind its year-to-date goal of\n\n[[Page S8107]]\n\n     almost 45,000 recruits, and has missed its recruiting target \n     during at least 17 of the last 18 months.\n       ``The recruiting environment remains difficult in terms of \n     economic conditions and alternatives,'' the Army said in a \n     statement released Monday. ``We are concerned about meeting \n     the fiscal year 2005 recruiting missions, but we are \n     confident that our recruiting initiatives will take hold and \n     the American public will respond.''\n       Jack Harrison, a spokesman for the National Guard Bureau, \n     said that despite the shortfall, the service is still able to \n     meet its commitments to the Pentagon as well as to state \n     governors, who call on the Guard during disasters and other \n     emergencies.\n       Some governors have complained about shortages of troops \n     and equipment in their Guard units, prompting the Guard to \n     set a goal of keeping half of each state's Guard forces at \n     home at any given time.\n       The Pentagon has already significantly reduced its use of \n     all Guard and reserve forces in the last two years. In April \n     2003, during the height of the Iraq invasion, some 224,000 of \n     them across all the services were mobilized for all federal \n     missions both at home and overseas; that figure now stands at \n     138,000, according to Pentagon statistics.\n       Harrison acknowledged the heavy use of the Guard in \n     missions in Iraq and Afghanistan has affected recruiting \n     efforts, but noted that the service is ahead of its goals in \n     retaining soldiers who have the option to get out.\n       ``We have folks that are coming back from long periods of \n     time in Iraq and Afghanistan who are reenlisting,'' he said.\n       Guard troops make up more than one-third of the soldiers in \n     Iraq, numbering six brigades plus a division headquarters. In \n     the next rotation of troops, to take place over the next two \n     years, the Guard's portion of the total force in Iraq is \n     expected to drop substantially as newly reorganized active-\n     duty Army units come online and take up more duties there, \n     officials said.\n       In total, the Army Guard has about 331,000 soldiers, 94.5% \n     of its authorized strength of 350,000, officials said.\n       Pentagon spokeswoman Lt. Col. Ellen Krenke said the Army \n     Guard last made its monthly goal in September 2004, when it \n     exceeded its target by 27 recruits. The last time it made its \n     goal before that was December 2003.\n       Harrison, however, said the Army Guard had not met its \n     monthly recruiting goal for 20 straight months, since October \n     2003. Officials could not immediately explain the \n     discrepancy. The Army Guard also missed its annual recruiting \n     goals for 2003 and 2004, Krenke said. The entire Army is \n     suffering from recruiting problems, but the other components \n     of the service--the active-duty force and the Reserve--made \n     their goals for June. Both, however, remain well behind their \n     annual goals, which they measure from October 2004 to \n     September 2005.\n       The regular Army has recruited 47,121 soldiers, or 86% of \n     its goal of 54,935 for this point in the year. It is trying \n     to reach 80,000 by the end of September. Officials are \n     becoming less hopeful they will make it, even though the \n     summer is considered the high season for recruiting, as \n     recent high school graduates look for jobs.\n       To deal with the problem, the Army has increased the number \n     of recruiters in its ranks, and augmented incentives for \n     those signing up.\n       ``We think these adjustments will begin to take hold in the \n     upcoming months,'' the Army statement said.\n       The Army Reserve has recruited 15,540 soldiers, or 79% of \n     its goal of 19,753 at this point in the year.\n       All three components of the Army are ahead on their efforts \n     to retain current soldiers. Officials credit that to a desire \n     on the part of the troops to finish the mission of making \n     Iraq a stable democracy.\n       The only other arm of the military that missed its June \n     recruiting goal was the Navy Reserve, which fell 8% short and \n     remains the same percentage behind its annual goal of 8,733 \n     recruits. The active Navy, Air Force and Marines made their \n     monthly goals, and are at or ahead of their year-to-date \n     targets, the Pentagon said.\n       The Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve and Marine Corps \n     Reserve made their June goals; of those, the Air Force \n     Reserve and Marine Reserve are at or ahead of their year-to-\n     date goals. The Air National Guard is 17% behind its year-to-\n     date goal of 7,619 recruits.\n       The Air Force and Navy are seeing far less action in Iraq \n     and Afghanistan than their counterparts in the ground combat \n     forces of the Army and Marines, who have suffered most of the \n     casualties.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, that article states:\n\n       The Army National Guard . . . missed its recruiting goal \n     for at least the ninth straight month in June and is nearly \n     19,000 soldiers below its authorized strength, military \n     officials said Monday.\n\n  Further, the Army Guard:\n\n      . . . is more than 10,000 soldiers behind its year-to-date \n     goal of almost 45,000 recruits and has missed its recruiting \n     target during at least 17 of the last 18 months.\n\n  Many factors, as we all know, affect recruiting, but how we care for \nour veterans is absolutely one of them. As George Washington said:\n\n       The willingness with which our young people are likely to \n     serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly \n     proportional as to how they perceive the Veterans of earlier \n     wars were treated and appreciated by their country.\n\n  That was George Washington back in 1789. It is still true today.\n  We need to show our veterans--today's veterans and those considering \nmilitary service--we will be there for them. If the Senate retreats \nfrom what we agreed to 2 weeks ago, it will tell potential recruits the \nVA will have a hiring freeze and the VA will not have new clinics and \nwe will not be there for them. That is the wrong message to send.\n  The Senate agreed our veterans need $1.5 billion. We agreed on a \nbipartisan basis. I am offering this amendment today to make sure there \nis no backtracking and that our veterans get the help they need, they \ndeserve, and they were promised. This is a basic American issue we can \nand must all support.\n  If Members vote for this amendment, we are giving the VA money to \nlift the hiring freeze to hire the medical staff it needs and to open \nnew clinics. We are telling today's soldiers and tomorrow's recruits we \nwill be there for them. But if members choose to vote against my \namendment, they are simply voting to keep their local VA hospital \noverwhelmed and understaffed, telling veterans in your State that they \nwill not get the new clinics they were promised. This vote will send a \nstrong message to today's veterans and tomorrow's recruits.\n  This Senate needs to make sure we will show those who serve our \ncountry that we will be there for them just as they have been there for \nus.\n  My colleague from Hawaii is here. He has been a tremendous advocate \nfor veterans. I thank him for all his work.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I thank my colleague for her efforts today.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to once again address the tremendous \nfunding crisis in the VA. I thank my colleague, the Democratic leader, \nSenator Reid, for his determination at this time to ensure that $1.5 \nbillion is provided without delay. Again, I thank my colleague Senator \nMurray for her efforts as a member of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  While we have consensus in both bodies of Congress that VA is facing \na tremendous funding shortfall this year, we are lacking consensus on \nhow much should be provided this year. The Senate clearly believes that \n$1.5 billion is needed.\n  The House, on the other hand, has taken the administration's view \nthat only $975 million is needed.\n  While I am delighted that the administration has admitted that there \nis a shortfall, I don't believe that we can now put our faith in their \nestimate of what VA needs.\n  As I said last night, judging by the supplemental sent forward by the \nPresident, VA officials are less than generous and, frankly, less than \naccurate.\n  The $975 million now proposed by the administration--and carried \nforward by the House--falls way short of addressing all of VA's \nproblems. Just examine one part of their estimate--their new costs \nassociated with returning service members.\n  VA now believes that 103,000 more veterans will be treated this year. \nThe cost of treating this kind of patient is $5,437 a year--as \ndocumented by VA data.\n  Yet, the administration wants to now convince Congress that, in fact, \nthe cost of treating a patient is less than half of this amount. Again, \nusing VA data, the cost of caring for an additional 103,000 returning \nveterans is $560 million and not the $273 million suggested by the \nadministration. And other key programs such as readjustment counseling \nand dental care were ignored by the House in the VA supplemental.\n  It is imperative that the Senate again send the House a message that \nwe intend to provide adequate funds.\n  The Senate has already spoken in a clear and bipartisan manner on \nthis issue.\n  Given the House's work to provide less than the full amount needed, \nit is clear that we have more work to do for this year. This amendment \nreiterates that point.\n\n[[Page S8108]]\n\n  The battle for next year's funding will be upon on us shortly, but we \nneed to shore up hospital and clinic operations today.\n  I am hopeful that we all learned a clear lesson from this experience, \nthat talking with health care providers in VA hospitals and with the \nveterans service organizations is invaluable. They told us what was \nreally going on months ago. They are continuing their call for full \nfunding for VA now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized for the time in opposition.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Is there a time limit?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each side controls 15 minutes. There is 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining controlled by the Senator from Washington and 14 \nminutes remaining controlled by the majority leader.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I commend Senator Murray, Senator \nAkaka, and all Members who have worked together with Senator Feinstein \nand myself on this veterans issue.\n  I spent last Thursday with Veterans' Administration Secretary \nNicholson. I am very pleased Secretary Nicholson has done so much to \naddress this issue once he determined from an audit of the agency that \nwe were not going to get through 2005 for the Veterans' Administration \nwithout taking from maintenance funds and other funds to cover our \noperating expenditures. The Secretary could have tried to put this \nBand-Aid on, but he did not. Secretary Nicholson came right out and \nsaid we do not have enough for 2005. We have models that show us what \nthe growth rate for service in the Veterans' Administration would be. \nThe models show about 2.3 percent. That has been the norm throughout \nthe last number of years. But in fact the growth rate is 5 percent. So \nSecretary Nicholson, Josh Bolton, at the Office of Management and \nBudget, and the President himself said we are not going to put a Band-\nAid on the Veterans' Administration.\n  Senator Murray saw this coming early on. She did believe there were \nmore veterans coming into the system from what she was hearing in the \nfield, and the Veterans' Administration at that time did not see the \nmodel that was not working. But when they did, they stepped up to the \nplate. They have now come back with numbers that are higher than the \n$975 million that has been put in an emergency appropriation on the \nHouse side just for 2005. Now, our $1.5 billion that I intend to \nsupport is to be spent this year or going into next year if necessary. \nI am going to support this amendment and, in fact, Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor of the Murray amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHINSON. I do want to say we are continuing to push the ball, \nbut this is not where I want it to end. What I hope we would be able to \ndo, once we talk in a little more detail to the Veterans' \nAdministration Secretary and to Mr. Bolton at the OMB, is to go ahead \nand pass the emergency supplemental for 2005 that will be more than \n$975 million, probably more in the range of $1.2 billion or $1.27 \nbillion for 2005, and then come in with another supplemental from OMB \nto the budget that we would put into our 2006 appropriation, because \nSenator Feinstein and I are the chairman and ranking member of Veterans \nAppropriations. Senator Murray sits on that committee as well. And we \nwant to do 2006 the right way. We already, through the cooperation of \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the ranking member, \nSenator Cochran and Senator Byrd, added $1.3 billion to what was in the \nPresident's original request. I believe the President will agree to \ncome in with another add to that of $1.6 billion or so. So I think if \nwe can continue to work together as we have been, we will have a more \ndefinitive answer, but I do not think we ought to stop with what \nSenator Murray is trying to do until we do come to the agreement to \nsolve this problem both for 2005 and for 2006 in the most responsible \nway.\n\n  So I am very happy to cosponsor the amendment knowing we hopefully \nwill finish the emergency supplemental before this bill actually makes \nit to the President. That would be the goal of all of us, I believe--to \nhave the emergency for 2005 passed this week or at the earliest \npossible moment and send it to the President so that money becomes \navailable.\n  In the meantime, I know the Veterans' Administration is not turning \nanyone away. They are not stopping any dirt from flying for the clinics \nthat are in the process of being built and the hospitals that are on \nthe drawing boards. I know the sincerity of Secretary Nicholson, having \ntraveled with him on Thursday and seeing how much he cares about our \nveterans getting the best care. This is a decorated Vietnam war \nveteran. He is a man who graduated from West Point and knows the \nveterans community very well.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I am very appreciative of Senator Murray \nbringing this matter to everyone's attention. With Senator Akaka, we \nall serve on the Veterans' Affairs Committee as well as the Veterans \nAppropriations Committee. And speaking of that, Senator Craig, the \nchairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, has been a real leader \nhere as well in trying to work this through. I think all of us intend \nto work on a bipartisan basis, Senator Feinstein and myself on the \nappropriations side, Senator Craig and Senator Akaka on the Veterans' \nCommittee side, Senator Murray as the leader in bringing this to \neveryone's attention before it became a fact.\n  I think we have the nucleus here, working with the administration, to \ndo the right thing and to do it in the right way. I think Secretary \nNicholson is to be commended for stepping up to the plate and working \nwith Josh Bolton to do that right thing. There will be no dollar, no \ndime spared in treating our veterans. It is a part of our war on \nterror, to make sure those coming home do have the care and service \nthey need. In this war we are seeing many more injuries. That is one of \nthe reasons the tables were skewed, the models that have been used for \nthe future. We have fewer deaths in this kind of conflict on a normal \nbasis, but we have more injuries. And that means we are going to have \nto take care of these people because they have been taking care of us. \nWe intend to do that and we need to do it on a bipartisan basis. I \nthank Senator Murray, Senator Akaka, Senator Craig, and Senator \nFeinstein for taking the lead on the Senate side, working with the \nadministration, and I think the veterans can be assured the right thing \nwill be done and this is one more step to make that happen.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from \nWashington for raising this issue again. Before the Fourth of July \nrecess, the Senate passed this amendment 96 to 0 showing this body's \nunited commitment to our Nation's veterans.\n  We worked hard with our colleagues across the aisle to ensure that \nthe Veterans' Administration's shortfall in Fiscal Year 2005 was \naddressed by passing a $1.5 billion emergency supplemental.\n  I was disappointed that the House of Representatives did not follow \nour lead and instead passed a nonemergency $975 million supplemental \nappropriations.\n  I understand that the administration will be submitting a Budget \namendment, shortly to address the Fiscal Year 2006 needs of the \nVeterans' Administration and I look forward to working with Chairman \nHutchison to ensure that adequate resources are available for veterans \nhealth care next year.\n  In the meantime, I would urge my colleagues to support the Murray \namendment which addresses this year's shortfall and reaffirms our \ncommitment to our veterans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington controls 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much does the other side control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would ask if the other side would mind, \nif they have no other speakers, yielding Senator Durbin 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nof their time or if they want to continue.\n  Mrs. HUTCHINSON. I would give some time away, but I would like to be\n\n[[Page S8109]]\n\nable to respond. I don't know, because I haven't been on the floor, \nwhat the Senator's comments are going to be. If I could reserve a \ncouple of minutes also for rebuttal if I need to, the other side is \nwelcome to go forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Illinois \nis recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Texas, she will not have to \nrebut any of these remarks because we agree completely. The good thing \nis we are talking about money for the Veterans' Administration. This is \nnot a hard call. We have veterans returning who need help. Millions of \nAmericans have been promised they will have a helping hand once they \nserve our country and need assistance in the VA system, and so we try \nto guess how many dollars will be needed to meet that obligation. It is \na very tough calculation, tougher still because we have soldiers coming \nback from Iraq and Afghanistan and other places who are seriously \nwounded, as the Senator from Texas has just mentioned, and they, of \ncourse, are our high priority.\n  Senator Murray came to the floor months ago and said the \nadministration is not making an appropriate calculation of how much \nmoney this is going to cost. We are going to end up having more \nveterans needing assistance than money to take care of them. For a long \ntime she was a lonely voice, offering amendments to appropriations \nbills that were being defeated. It turns out 2 or 3 weeks ago she was \nproven right and the Veterans' Administration came forward and said, We \nneed more money; we don't have enough.\n  The most positive thing that occurred was immediately Senator Larry \nCraig, the Republican chairman of the committee, and Senator Murray \ncame together and said, Now let's deal with this on a bipartisan basis, \nand the Senate did, putting $1.5 billion in emergency funding for the \nVeterans' Administration.\n  That is the good news. The bad news is the message did not get across \nthe Rotunda to the House. They decided they were going to cut that \namount to $900 million, almost in half.\n  You think to yourself: What are they doing here? Aren't they hearing \nthe same things we are hearing? The Veterans' Administration needs the \nmoney, the veterans need the money.\n  So our message is not just to the veterans that we stand behind you. \nOur message is to the House of Representatives: Stand behind us, join \nus in the battle for $1.5 billion to make sure we keep our promise to \nveterans.\n  What we are doing, when we are not debating this, is the Homeland \nSecurity bill in light of terrorism and threats to the United States. \nAs Senator Stabenow of Michigan has said, we need to be prepared and \nprotected both at home and around the world. If we are going to be \nprotected, we need the best military in the world with our support. \nThis money for the Veterans' Administration keeps that promise to our \nsoldiers and to our veterans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague from Illinois, and I also thank my \ncolleague from Texas.\n  Mr. President, I saw the Washington Post article yesterday on ``VA \nHospital in Texas Fights to Stay Open.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 11, 2005]\n\n                VA Hospital in Texas Fights to Stay Open\n\n                           (By Sylvia Moreno)\n\n       Waco, TX.--Building 7 on the campus of the Veterans Affairs \n     Medical Center here is called Blind Rehab, a special unit for \n     aging vets who have macular degeneration or diabetes-induced \n     vision problems.\n       But this past year, Blind Rehab began to see a new type of \n     patient: veterans barely past their 20th birthdays, blinded \n     by gunshot wounds and bombs in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n       ``These soldiers now have flak jackets and armor that \n     protect their bodies and keep them alive, but we see \n     traumatic limb injuries and traumatic head injuries,'' said \n     Stan Poel, chief of Blind Rehabilitation Services at the Waco \n     hospital. ``Those are the things that are presenting a \n     challenge to the VA.''\n       These are also the kinds of patients the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs now projects will flood an already overtaxed \n     and underfunded health care system that treated more than 5 \n     million veterans last year.\n       ``Our number one priority is returning service members from \n     the combat theater . . . and to provide world-class health \n     care to veterans, as well as benefits,'' Veterans Affairs \n     Secretary Jim Nicholson said after a tour late last week of \n     the 127-acre Waco campus, whose neighbors to the west include \n     the huge Army base of Fort Hood, with 41,000 soldiers, and \n     President Bush's ranch in Crawford.\n       ``The increase in demand for our services from what we \n     projected is up 126 percent,'' he said. ``We have to \n     obviously be prepared to ramp up.''\n       The-Waco hospital, with its well-kept pre- World War II \n     red-brick, red-roof-tiled buildings, has provided health care \n     for veterans in central Texas for 73 years. Now it is on the \n     chopping block, scheduled along with 17 other VA hospitals to \n     be closed or downsized as part of an agency plan to \n     restructure the health care system. A 1999 government study \n     found the VA was spending $1 million a day on buildings it \n     did not need, and in 2003 a government commission recommended \n     closing older, underused hospitals, including the one in \n     Waco. The Waco facility is part of the Central Texas Veterans \n     Health Care System, which also includes a hospital in Temple \n     and outpatient clinics in Austin and five other communities.\n       For the past two years, Waco officials, residents and \n     veterans groups have been fighting back, emphasizing the \n     importance of the facility's specialized blind \n     rehabilitation, psychiatric and post-traumatic stress \n     disorder units; the large and aging veteran population (Texas \n     has the third-largest population of veterans in the country \n     with 1.7 million, a third of whom received VA health care \n     last year); and, now, the wave of veterans from the wars in \n     Afghanistan and Iraq who will need its services.\n       ``They guaranteed so many years ago that they will take \n     care of [veterans], and I would say they're pretty much going \n     back on their word,'' said Ron Peterson, 35, an engineer \n     with the 91st Engineer Battalion, 1st Cavalry Division at \n     Fort Hood. Peterson used a day off last week to provide a \n     motorcycle escort for Nicholson's visit to Waco and to \n     register his support for keeping the hospital there open.\n       Peterson was deployed to Iraq from January 2004 to this \n     February. He was wounded twice, receiving the Bronze Star, \n     two Purple Hearts and an Army Commendation Medal for valor in \n     combat\n       ``They're not ready for everybody coming back,'' Peterson \n     said. ``They're trying to shut everything down and they're \n     going to need PTSD units. The guys aren't seeing the things \n     they saw in Vietnam, but they're seeing a lot of stuff.''\n       This year, the post-traumatic stress disorder in-patient \n     unit in Waco has seen more than 75 new cases of veterans from \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom. The 15-bed blind rehab unit, which \n     has helped 106 blind veterans this year learn skills such as \n     how to use a walking cane, cook and negotiate e-mail, has a \n     wait list of 73.\n       ``This is the best PTSD facility in the union, and these \n     [guys] are trying to close it down,'' said Bill Mahon, a \n     Vietnam War veteran and the McLennan County veterans service \n     officer. In the past two years, Mahon has organized several \n     motorcycle rides to the gate of Bush's nearby ranch to \n     protest the proposed closing. ``This is not their hospital; \n     it's our hospital.''\n       Nationwide this fiscal year, 250,000 new patients--40 \n     percent of them veterans from Afghanistan and Iraq and 60 \n     percent of them veterans from other eras--have entered the VA \n     health care system, Nicholson said.\n       As Congress works to eliminate an emergency funding \n     shortfall this year of at least $1 billion and a projected \n     shortage in the VA health care budget of more than $1 billion \n     in the coming fiscal year, VA hospitals have felt the impact \n     nationwide.\n       According to documents released at recent meetings of the \n     House and Senate Veterans Affairs committees, the VA hospital \n     in White River Junction, Vt., was forced to shut its \n     operating rooms temporarily because of a lack of maintenance \n     funds to repair a broken heating, ventilation and air \n     conditioning system. Hospitals in Arkansas, Oklahoma, \n     Mississippi, Louisiana and eastern Texas stopped scheduling a \n     appointments for many veterans. The VA medical center in San \n     Diego, with a waiting list of 750 veterans, diverted $3.5 \n     million in maintenance funds to partially cover operating \n     expenses and delayed filling 131 vacancies for three months \n     to cover operating expenses. The Portland, Ore., hospital \n     delayed non-emergency surgery for at least six months, and \n     7,000 veterans who use the VA facility in Bay Pines, Fla., \n     are waiting longer than 30 days for a primary care \n     appointment.\n       ``I'm going to go to a civilian doctor rather than wait 70 \n     to 90 days,'' Douglas McKee, 63, of Chilton, Tex., said as he \n     left the Waco facility on Thursday afternoon. McKee, who said \n     he was disabled by a mine explosion in Vietnam while serving \n     with the 173rd Airborne Brigade, had just learned that his \n     regular doctor was on duty in Iraq and that he could not get \n     an appointment with a new physician until mid-October. He \n     would also have to wait for some of his prescription refills, \n     he said.\n       ``We laid our life on the line and then got blowed up and \n     then you come here and you get turned away. That ain't \n     fair,'' said McKee, who suffers from a variety of ailments \n     and uses a walker to get around. ``And then they got all the \n     kids coming back from Iraq.''\n\n[[Page S8110]]\n\n       Nicholson assured hospital employees and veterans gathered \n     for his visit that no decision had been made about the \n     facility's fate and that he had ``no predispositions about \n     this at all.''\n       Nicholson, who visited the facility at the request of Sen. \n     Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.), said he was concerned about \n     the 300,000 square feet of vacant space at the Waco VA. A \n     local advisory group suggested filling the space with \n     nonprofit organizations such as the Salvation Army, which \n     could tailor their services to veterans' needs.\n       Nicholson will make his decision about the Waco VA early \n     next year, including a proposal to transfer its psychiatric \n     and post-traumatic stress disorder services to Austin and \n     Temple. He warned those gathered that his visit should not be \n     interpreted as ``an interception of the process.'' And he \n     complimented the hospital for its track record. ``This is the \n     way the American people want veterans to be taken care of,'' \n     he said.\n       As for the hospital's fate, Nicholson said, ``the binding \n     question is what's going to be the best for our vets? . . . \n     They did what was best for us and for our country.''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I know the Senator from Texas was there and was quite \nstartled to hear about the blind rehab unit at the Veterans Affairs \nMedical Center in Texas and how they have been serving older veterans, \nbut in fact this year they are begining to see a new type of patient--\nveterans in their early 20s with macular degeneration or diabetes-\ninduced vision problems. I think it goes to the point of exactly why we \nare seeing such a tremendous shortfall in the VA today--because of the \ntypes of injuries our returning soldiers are having.\n  I welcome my colleague's cosponsorship, and I agree we do need to \nlook at 2006. We will work with her and the VA Secretary and all \nSenators on making up the shortfall. But we are here today with the \nMurray amendment because there has been some confusion in the Senate \nabout how much aid we are going to send to the Veterans Department. We \nhave heard a lot of numbers thrown around and a lot of discussion, but \nI think why I am here today and why it is so critical is because in the \nearly morning hours just before our July 4 recess, some Senate leaders \nmoved we lay down in deference to the House of Representatives' lower \nnumber.\n  I think in the Senate we need to say there is no confusion. On a \nunanimous vote we supported $1.5 billion. The Appropriations Committee, \nhours after the House tried to limit funding for veterans, unanimously \naffirmed our support for $1.5 billion and now the Senate has an \nopportunity before us to tell our veterans we will do all we can, all \nwe promised, to support and care for them when they return home.\n  Make no mistake, this Department needs the money. Even before the \ndramatic, unconscionable shortfall at the Department was revealed, \nveterans around the country were facing long lines and crumbling \nfacilities. We know the promised clinics are not there, and we know the \nsoldiers returning with posttraumatic syndrome are not being served. \nThe money is critical. I ask the Senate this morning to say we are \nsticking with the $1.5 billion shortfall.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Feinstein be \nadded as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield the \nremainder of our time to Senator Murray.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a total of 2 minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague from Texas.\n  I remind all of our colleagues we should not be nickling and diming \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs today. For all of us who have been \nout on the ground visiting our VA clinics, talking to our soldiers who \nare returning, it is very clear this war has created a need and demand \nfor us to be there. When we call up our soldiers, we promise them we \nwill be there for health care. It is not right that we sit in hearings \nand community meetings as I did last week and hear veterans saying: I \nfinally gave up; I went and paid for health care out of my own pocket. \nThat is not what we promised them and that is not a way to get new \nsoldiers which we obviously need to do today.\n  A train wreck is coming in 2006. I will work with all of my \ncolleagues. I know the administration is looking at sending over a \nbudget amendment and I agree we need to find the money. But for right \nnow we need to pass an emergency supplemental. This Senate has gone on \nrecord in the full Appropriations Committee and in this full body and \nwe should have no backtracking. That is why we are voting on this \namendment today, once again, to reaffirm our commitment and tell all \nthe men and women who have served us both in this war and in previous \nwars that we will be there for them.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from Texas has 30 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not been ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. The yeas and nays are \nordered.\n  All time having expired, the hour of 12 o'clock having arrived, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the Murray amendment. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.

Mr. President, President Bush met this morning with the \nleaders of the Senate and the Judiciary Committee, and I am sure we all \nhave the same questions. Was this really the first step in a serious \nconsultation process that will be meaningful and will continue in the \ndays and weeks ahead? Will the process result in an effort to select \nnominees who can bring\n\n[[Page S8111]]\n\nthe Nation and the Senate together instead of further dividing us?\n  I sincerely hope the answer to those questions is ``yes.'' \nConsultation is more than a process, it's about an outcome. I hope we \nare not just going through the motions. That will be up to the \nPresident. True consultation is not a one-sided conversation. The \nPresident must share his thoughts with all of us as well. I firmly \nbelieve the Nation wants and needs us to proceed in good faith and with \nopen minds. The conditions are right for serious cooperation between \nthe Senate and the executive, whom the Framers of the Constitution made \n``jointly'' responsible for assuring the quality and independence of \nthe Federal judiciary.\n  The President has won a second term and does not have to run again. \nHe is freer to carry out his desire to be a uniter, not a divider, \ndespite the pleas from the fringes of the party he leads.\n  Notwithstanding the constant clamor from the right, the public \nobviously does not support extreme right-wing positions on key court-\nrelated issues. Most Americans opposed the effort by some in Congress \nto order the courts to intrude into private medical decisions in the \nSchiavo case. Most Americans also rejected the idea that 200 years of \nSenate history should be reversed in order to give a narrow Senate \nmajority the absolute power to approve extreme judges.\n  Our constituents wonder why we seem to spend so much time shouting \nangrily at one another. ``Washington'' has lost the respect of many \nAmericans because of the atmosphere of confrontation and conflict that \npervades Congress and the executive branch. They much prefer us to \nspend more time and thought on finding common ground. They know that \ntheir families, their local governments, their schools, and their own \nbusinesses, could not function if they operated in the kind of hostile, \npolarized environment that often seems to prevail on issues here.\n  Since the selection of judges is an area where the constitutional \nFramers placed the decision in the hands of the Senate and the \nPresident, we have a special obligation to make choices and take \npositions that facilitate cooperation and consensus, and avoid choices \nand positions that provoke confrontation and conflict.\n  History demonstrates that the Senate and the President can work \ntogether on judicial nominations, especially Supreme Court justices. \nMany of us have been here for the nominations of numerous new \nJustices--in my case 18 of them. On 13 of those, there was a consensus, \nwith close to 90 percent more of the Senators voting for confirmation. \nOn 5, there was a unanimous vote in the Senate.\n  It is not difficult to achieve that kind of consensus. We know what \nthe Court needs and what the country expects. Nominees should be \nexcellent lawyers who respect the Constitution, understand the law, and \nunderstand and respect the vital role of the judiciary in our \nGovernment. Most of the public do not want judges whose goal is to \nadvance a result-oriented agenda, or to take the law on detours of \ntheir own. They want judges who proceed from the basic principles that \nunite us, as reflected in the Constitution and in two centuries of our \nshared history.\n  Most Americans would agree with Chief Justice John Marshall that to \nkeep the Constitution relevant and responsive, judges have to be \nwilling to look at it not as an inflexible and technical ``legal \ncode,'' but as a document that sets forth ``great outlines'' and \nimportant goals, with the details to be filled in later, by Congress \nand the Courts. Certainly, when the Framers wrote the copyright clause \nof the Constitution, they never contemplated computer downloading, but \ntheir objective in that clause is something on which laws and legal \ndecisions can build.\n  Of course, in the minds of most Americans, what defines this country, \nand about which our courts must be deeply concerned about is our rights \nand liberties. That is what our ancestors fought for two centuries ago. \nThat is why the Framers spent so much of their time and effort on a \ngovernmental structure and a bill of rights establishing and protecting \nour freedoms--both freedoms to and freedoms from. That is why we fought \na civil war to expand freedom. That is why our ancestors came to these \nshores in the 1800's 1900's why people everywhere still want to come \nhere. There is no freer place in the world, and we must find judges who \nagree that their first obligation is to keep it that way: to safeguard \nthose freedoms.\n  Our judges must therefore be aware of freedom's history, so that they \nknow what happens when we are tempted to dilute bedrock rights and \nliberties by subordinating them to short-term political expediency. The \nnotorious ``Palmer raids'' after World War I, the internment of \nJapanese Americans during World War II, and the McCarthy era during the \ncold war are obvious examples of past abuses of which Supreme Court \nnominees should be well aware.\n  Next only to protection of their freedoms, Americans expect and want \nfairness. That means the rights and freedoms we cherish must be \napplicable to all--rich and poor, popular and unpopular, powerful and \npowerless--especially the poor, the unpopular and the powerless who may \nhave no other recourse. That is what makes America very special among \nall the nations of the world. Courts cannot cure all the ills of \nsociety, but a court system that purports to provide legal remedies for \nlegal wrongs must make those remedies real. It cannot be credible if it \nerects impenetrable barriers of money, process, or theory that deprive \na right of any meaningful reality.\n  The American people understand that our system of checks and balances \nis a cornerstone of our basic rights and liberties. They want us to \nmake sure that the judges we confirm will not permit unconstrained \nExecutive power to usurp legislative power or judicial power. They \ncertainly do not want the Congress or the President to control or \ninterfere with the judiciary. They surely want an independent \njudiciary.\n  We can look deeper into each of these general principles on which \nthere is a national consensus, and find areas of agreement and \ndisagreement, but they are clearly a guide for choosing a Supreme Court \nnominee who can achieve a broad consensus in Congress and the country.\n  We cannot do so if we adopt an ideological standard promoted by a \nnarrow group as the first principle of the process. It makes no sense \nto delegate the process to groups or their supporters within the \ngovernment whose personal goal is to limit the range of nominees to \nthose who will advance their own ideological agenda.\n  Clearly, the choice is the President's. We can help him if he chooses \nthe route of cooperation and consensus. Hopefully, he will not follow \nthe advice of those who want to pick fights instead of picking judges.\n  I would like to see a wide open process that begins with a search for \nRepublicans in all walks of legal life--not just judges--selected for \nthe quality of their minds and their commitment to the law, rather than \nfor their adherence to extreme ideologies. I am confident such a search \nwould produce a wide range of eligible candidates who might be able to \ngain a consensus in the legal profession, among the American people and \nwith the Senate.\n  President Bush has a unique opportunity to unite us, not divide us. \nHe has an extraordinary chance to do so with this nomination and \nperhaps other Supreme Court nominations to come. If he does, American \npeople and American history will thank him.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/12/senate-section/article/S8111-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 90 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Collins and Feinstein amendments.\n  Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I yield myself 20 minutes from the time allocated for the \nproponents of the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment.\n\n[[Page S8112]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent--I think Senator Feinstein has \nagreed--that I be given 10 minutes immediately after the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, in the debate on the competing amendments, \nthe Collins-Lieberman amendment and the Cornyn-Feinstein amendment, \nbefore I get into the body of my remarks, I want to address some \ncriticism that was lodged at the Cornyn-Feinstein amendment. I believe \nreference was made to the amendment as being ``cobbled together.''\n  I point out to my colleagues that the amendment of Senator Feinstein \nand myself was not a cobbled-together proposal. Our work was based on \nwork already done in the House of Representatives and in this body as \nwell. We have also worked with a number of cities and States. In fact, \nour language is precisely the same, or I should say based on \nCongressman Chris Cox's legislation, H.R. 1544, which passed in the \nHouse 409 to 10, hardly indicative of an amendment that was cobbled \ntogether.\n  The question really is, Who should make the decision on how to \nallocate homeland security dollars? There has been a lot of discussion \nabout how much money should be distributed as a minimum amount and how \nmuch should be distributed based on risk. I ask my colleagues to \nconsider in this war on terror who should make the decisions on how \nbest to allocate resources. Should Congress divvy up the pie and decide \nto distribute money based on how many pieces of pie ought to be cut up, \nor should those who have access to the intelligence, who know about \nrisk and how best to allocate our resources to address that risk be the \nones to make that distribution?\n  In our military and national defense, Congress provides for adequate \ntraining and equipment for the Department of Defense and then empowers \nthe Department to allocate the resources where it believes they will be \nthe most effective.\n  I suggest to my colleagues that in the war on terror, the rules \nshould be no different. We should empower the Department of Homeland \nSecurity with the similar flexibility to respond and marshal resources \nas needed.\n  Finally, just by way of preliminary remarks, this morning Senator \nFeinstein offered a letter for the Record from a number of high-threat \ncities that support the Cornyn-Feinstein amendment. There have been \nseveral additions to the list of cities, including Atlanta, Buffalo, \nHouston, San Antonio, Seattle, and Toledo. I ask that this updated \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    July 11, 2005.\n     Re high-threat cities joint working group on homeland \n         security.\n\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader and Minority Leader: As cities on the \n     front line of the war on terrorism, we are writing to express \n     our support for the amendment offered by Senators Feinstein \n     and Cornyn to incorporate S. 1013, the ``Homeland Security \n     FORWARD Funding Act of 2005, into the FY2006 Homeland \n     Security Appropriations bill. The Feinstein-Cornyn approach \n     best targets first responder funds to areas of highest risk \n     and highest threat throughout the nation. We also write to \n     support homeland security funding for state and local \n     governments at least at last year's levels. The recent events \n     in London underline the importance of homeland funding for \n     state and local governments.\n       The Statement of Administration Policy (SAP) issued today, \n     in addressing State and Local Programs, urges Congress to \n     take further steps to increase the share of State grants that \n     can be targeted to where they are needed most, consistent \n     with the President's request. The Statement further notes, \n     when referring to Potential Amendments, that the \n     Administration ``supports efforts to allocate a greater share \n     of homeland security grants based on risk and would be \n     opposed to any amendment that would . . . cap funding for \n     high-threat cities while not providing flexibility to \n     distribute over 90 percent of grant funds on the basis of \n     risk, as proposed in the President's Budget.'' The Feinstein-\n     Cornyn Amendment clearly meets these standards, and the \n     alternative Collins Amendment incorporating S. 21 does not.\n       The Feinstein-Cornyn Amendment most closely tracks the \n     recommendations of both the 9/11 Commission and the \n     Administration in supporting the principle that homeland \n     security funds should be allocated solely on the basis of \n     risk of terrorism. According to the Congressional Research \n     Service, the Feinstein-Cornyn Amendment would distribute 87 \n     percent of state and local homeland security funds based on \n     threat, compared to only 60 percent distributed based on \n     threat under the Collins Amendment.\n       The Feinstein-Cornyn Amendment also preserves the critical \n     partnership between the federal government, states and the \n     nation's highest risk areas by maintaining the Urban Area \n     Security Initiative (UASI) program. These UASI regions have \n     for several years been aggressively working to implement \n     comprehensive plans for terrorism prevention and preparedness \n     approved by their States and DHS. Maintaining the UASI \n     program will preserve and sustain the substantial planning, \n     longterm projects, and regional decision-making processes \n     underway. The Collins Amendment would cap the amount of funds \n     that can go to high-threat cities at 30 percent of the total \n     amount of state and local homeland funding. This cap would \n     restrict the high-threat program to a lesser amount than \n     appropriated in previous years.\n       The homeland security bill as reported by the Senate \n     Appropriations committee would cut homeland security funding \n     to state and local governments by almost a half billion \n     dollars, $467 million less than FY2005. Please restore this \n     funding.\n       We again commend you on your efforts to increase the amount \n     of homeland security funds distributed based on threat, \n     vulnerability, and consequences of a terrorist attack.\n           Sincerely,\n       City of Anaheim, California, City of Atlanta, Georgia, City \n     of Baltimore, Maryland, City of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, City \n     of Boston, Massachusetts, City of Buffalo, New York, City of \n     Charlotte, North Carolina, City of Chicago, --Illinois, City \n     of Cleveland, Ohio, City of Columbus, Ohio;\n       City of Dallas, Texas, City of Denver, Colorado, City of \n     Jacksonville, Florida, City of Kansas City, Missouri, City of \n     Long Beach, California, City of Los Angeles, California, City \n     of Miami, Florida, City of New York, New York, City of \n     Newark, New Jersey, City of Oakland, California;\n       City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, City of Sacramento, \n     California, City of San Antonio, Texas, City of San Diego, \n     California, City of San Francisco, California, City of San \n     Jose, California, City of Santa Ana, California. City of \n     Seattle, Washington, City of Toledo, Ohio.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Finally, by way of preliminary remarks, I have in my hand \na letter written by the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, Michael Chertoff, dated July 12, 2005, where Secretary \nChertoff writes to express his concern with regard to amendments that \nmay be offered to change the first responder grant funding formula. \nSecretary Chertoff says that he welcomes the efforts by Congress to \nensure that more homeland security dollars are distributed on the basis \nof risk, which is precisely what the amendment Senator Feinstein and I \nhave offered does.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record at the \nclose of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. I rise to join the Senator from California, Mrs. \nFeinstein, and other distinguished colleagues in urging support for the \namendment that we have offered. I am compelled to bring this issue to \nthe Senate's attention because I think it is imperative that we \neffectively and efficiently protect our most vulnerable assets and \npopulation centers, as this amendment is calculated to do. I am \ngrateful for the opportunity to have this debate, and I certainly want \nto acknowledge the outstanding work that Senator Collins and Senator \nLieberman have done on homeland security issues generally.\n  However, the amendment that Senator Feinstein and I offer takes a \ndifferent approach than the one they have taken. I submit their \namendment, as embodied in S. 21, does not achieve the level of risk-\nbased funding necessary to most effectively spend our homeland security \ndollars.\n  We have said it often on the Senate floor and elsewhere that 9/11 has \nchanged everything. The attacks of that day were unprecedented in our \nhistory, and they brought home the need for similarly unprecedented \nsecurity measures. In an effort to respond quickly to the devastation \nthat day wrought in our country, the Federal\n\n[[Page S8113]]\n\nGovernment created a system that worked to raise overall national \nemergency preparedness to ensure that we would better guard against \nanother such terrorist attack in the future.\n  So we embarked on shoring up our airline, transportation, border, and \nport security. We worked to protect our critical infrastructure, to \nprotect our cyber security, our agriculture and food supply systems. \nBut taxpayer dollars are not limitless. Nor do any one of us want to \nlive in a lockdown that would be tantamount to a police state. Rather, \nin this free society in which we live, Congress must work to ensure \nthat every penny allocated for our homeland security efforts must be \ndirected where it will do the most good.\n  It is imperative that we guard the places across our Nation where \nterrorists may strike and where such strikes could do the most harm to \nour people, to our Government, and to our economy. I believe this is \nthe most responsible way to prepare for any future terrorist attack.\n  In addition to the important efforts we are undertaking with regard \nto collecting and analyzing intelligence, we must take the fight on the \noffensive where the terrorists work, train, and recruit rather than on \nour homeland. We need to have a system that will protect our most \nvulnerable population centers and that recognizes the need to protect \nthe critical infrastructure and vital components of our national \neconomy.\n  I am reminded of a tour that I took recently of several Texas \nseaports. I visited with port directors, industry leaders, and \nemergency responders in and around the ports of Houston, Beaumont, and \nCorpus Christi. These kinds of facilities and the communities that \nsurround them have enormous security needs, and the consequences of a \nsuccessful terrorist attack on any of these facilities would be \ndevastating, not just to these local communities but to the economic \nengine that runs this whole country.\n  The ripples of a successful attack to any one of these areas would \nreach well into the interior of our country. We should protect our \npopulation centers, but we must also realize that when it comes to \nprotecting our economy and vulnerable critical infrastructure, it is \nnecessary to protect the vital components of these systems and not just \nthe population centers. We must take further steps to secure our \nagricultural and food production systems and protect the ports that \nship products in and out of this country. I believe the amendment \noffered by Senator Feinstein and myself maximizes this kind of \nflexibility and this kind of protection.\n  This amendment would require that the Federal Department of Homeland \nSecurity funds be allocated to States according to a risk-based \nassessment. It is vital that we better allocate our limited resources \nto the vulnerable places in the country that we most need to protect \nand that these funds be distributed in an efficient and timely manner.\n  Senator Feinstein and I have evaluated the 9/11 Commission's \nrecommendations that call for allocation of money based on \nvulnerabilities. Our legislation provides for a distribution formula \nfor homeland security grants based upon three main criteria: threat, \nvulnerability, and consequence. This requires States to quickly pass on \nFederal funds to where they are most needed. This proposal is inspired \nby the hard work and examination done on this issue by our colleagues \nin the House of Representatives and in the Senate.\n\n  We have also taken input from stakeholders in our respective States \nand from across the country. It is our hope and intention that by \nintroducing this amendment we can contribute and enrich the public \ndiscourse on this critical issue and help move the Nation toward a more \nrational and effective distribution of our homeland security resources.\n  Key provisions of this amendment provide establishing a first \nresponder grant board consisting of the Department of Homeland Security \nleadership that will rank and prioritize grant applications based on \nthreat and vulnerability, enabling a region that encompasses more than \none State to apply for funds. The money would still pass through the \nStates but would go to the region to better enable coordination and \nplanning.\n  This amendment would provide greater flexibility in using the funds, \nallowing the State to use them for other hazards consistent with \nfederally established capability standards. And it allows States to \nretain authority to administer grant programs, but there are penalties \nfor States that do not pass funds to local governments within 45 days. \nIf a State fails to pass the funds through, local governments may \npetition the Department of Homeland Security directly to receive those \nfunds.\n  In addition to trying to implement a system that was recommended by \nthe 9/11 Commission, Senator Feinstein and I have proposed an amendment \nthat honors the requests of the administration as reflected in the \nfiscal year 2006 Presidential budget, which calls for awarding funds to \nmeet national preparedness goals and priorities rather than on mandated \nformulas that bear little relation to need and risk.\n  It is my concern that our colleagues' alternative approach places too \nhigh a priority on providing steady streams of Federal assistance to \neach State to provide for possible terrorist attacks, with not enough \nregard to a risk-based consideration. With their proposal, States \ncontinue to receive a significant minimum amount, and other States with \ngreater populations and population density get an additional amount. \nThe result, though, is that just over half of the remaining funds are \ndistributed based on risk.\n  Can the taxpayers afford to keep up that level of support for every \nState without regard to risk factors as being the predominant concern? \nCan we afford providing this level of support to every State at the \nexpense of those communities that are most at risk, regardless of \nwhether they happen to be resident in a large State or a small State?\n  I assert that continuing to spread homeland security funds throughout \nthe Nation without regard to actual risk would be an inefficient \napproach and would ignore much of what I believe we have learned as \npart of our efforts to assess our vulnerabilities since the attacks of \nSeptember 11.\n  As we have recently learned from the tragic events in London, terror \nstill has the ability and the strength to strike. The effectiveness of \nour continued vigilance and preparedness relies heavily on the \nefficient spending of our limited homeland security dollars.\n  Let me say in closing, at least for this portion of my remarks, I \nbelieve Chairman Gregg, the chairman of the Homeland Security \nAppropriations Committee, and the entire subcommittee have done a very \ngood job trying to address the concerns I have laid out and that \nSenator Feinstein and I have addressed, our concerns that these funds \nbe primarily allocated on the basis of risk. But I believe we can do \nbetter. I believe we can and should do better, and I believe the \noptimal formula which provides every State with access to homeland \nsecurity grant funds but which optimizes the receipt and delivery of \nthose funds based on risk, threat, and consequence is the preferable \nway to go. I urge my colleagues to support the Feinstein-Cornyn \namendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                U.S. Department of\n\n\n                                            Homeland Security,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 2005.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: As the Senate prepares to debate the FY 2006 \n     Homeland Security Appropriations Act (H.R. 2360), I write to \n     express my concern regarding amendments that may be offered \n     to change the first responder grant funding formula. The \n     Department welcomes the efforts by Congress to ensure that \n     more homeland security dollars are distributed based on risk. \n     The Department of Homeland Security strongly supports \n     authorizing legislation that would distribute Federal \n     homeland security grant funds based on risk and need (the \n     delta between the level of capabilities possessed by a \n     particular jurisdiction and the level set by the National \n     Preparedness Goal) according to the President's budget \n     request, rather than on static and arbitrary minimums.\n       The Administration strongly believes that Federal homeland \n     security funds should be distributed to our first responders \n     based on risk and need. Since the tragic events of September \n     11, 2001, we have distributed billions of dollars to our \n     Nation's first responders to prevent and respond to major \n     events. For the Department's primary State assistance \n     program--the State Homeland Security Grant Program--we have \n     complied with Congressional direction to distribute grants \n     according to a formula authorized in the USA PATRIOT Act, \n     which divides nearly half the\n\n[[Page S8114]]\n\n     funds evenly among all states. We have also complied with \n     Congressional direction to allocate the remaining funds based \n     on population. As we know through experience, however, the \n     threat posed by terrorists and others that would do us harm \n     is ever changing. We, therefore, must not continue to base \n     the distribution of limited homeland security funds on such a \n     static, inflexible formula.\n       Instead, the Administration strongly supports a methodology \n     that distributes the greatest amount of funds based on risk \n     and need. This is consistent with the President's budget \n     request for Fiscal Years 2005 and 2006, which supported \n     distributing nearly 90 percent of DHS' homeland security \n     grant programs according to risk and need. We also believe it \n     is important for the Administration and Congress to retain \n     the ability to adjust the balance of state and regional \n     grants each year. Such an approach would still provide a \n     minimum funding level for each state, recognizing that each \n     state has unmet homeland security capabilities. For these \n     reasons, the Administration would oppose amendments that \n     would add new bureaucratic requirements and cap funding for \n     high-threat cities while not providing enough flexibility to \n     distribute over 90 percent of grant funds on the basis of \n     risk.\n       Further, with the development and implementation of the \n     Interim National Preparedness Goal and the accompanying \n     National Planning Guidance, we now have the requisite tools \n     and resources to make more informed decisions on how to focus \n     our finite resources. In coordination with other Federal \n     agencies, DHS has identified the 36 capabilities that are \n     critical to preventing another terrorist attack and, if an \n     attack does occur, to respond and recover in a manner that \n     minimizes loss of life and other damage. We must focus our \n     state and local preparedness efforts on building those \n     capabilities to the right level and in the right places. \n     Funding our first responders based on risk and need gives us \n     the flexibility to ensure our finite resources are allocated \n     in a prioritized and objective manner.\n       The Department would appreciate your support of legislation \n     consistent with these principles, and looks forward to \n     working with you to ensure that communities across the \n     country improve their preparedness to prevent, respond to, \n     and recover from terrorism and other major incidents.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                 Michael Chertoff.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the Senator from \nNew York is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nFeinstein-Cornyn amendment or the Cornyn-Feinstein amendment, whichever \nit may be, because it would distribute a greater percentage of first \nresponder money to areas that need it the most.\n  First, I thank my colleagues, Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman, \nfor their leadership. They have been at the forefront of saying that we \nneeded a new formula. I think all of us in this area agree. I know they \nare trying their best to balance the interests of smaller States and \nlarger States, an issue in this Republic since it was founded in 1789. \nWhile I do not agree with the way they came out, I have a great deal of \nrespect for their efforts to be fair. If I were from a smaller State, \nwho knows, maybe I would be supporting that formula. I hope not, but \nthat might be the case.\n  But the reason I feel so strongly about the Feinstein-Cornyn \namendment is this: The war on terror is a war we probably faced before \n9/11, but we probably only realized we were fighting a full-fledged war \nafter 9/11. The war on terror is a serious one, and I have said time \nand time again we have to make this a two-front war--a good war on \noffense, which you fight overseas, and a good war on defense, which you \nfight here at home.\n  Unfortunately, because of technology, small groups of bad people can \nhit any place at any time. Technology allows them to do this. So every \none of our citizens is on the front line.\n  I understand that a Senator from Wyoming or a Senator from Maine or a \nSenator from Connecticut believes, correctly--or a Senator from \nGeorgia, a middle-size State--believes that their people are on the \nfront line. But I have to tell you that you have to live in New York to \nunderstand the difference. It is theoretically possible, of course, \nthat terrorists could hit us everywhere, as I said. But it is not \neverywhere that has been subject to two devastating terrorist attacks. \nIt is not everywhere where 100 members of the police force are \noverseas, on their own, trying to figure out intelligence to thwart an \nattack on our dear city. It is not everywhere, where every bridge in \nNew York, every major bridge, has two police officers at one end and \ntwo police officers at the other end, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n  It is not that the other areas are any less careful; it is just the \nthreat and danger is greatest to us. So it seems patently unfair to say \nthat States that might have a threat but do not have as large, as \ntangible, as repeated a threat--week after week, month after month--\nshould actually get more money on a per capita basis than States such \nas New York or California or Texas, which are much more on the front \nlines simply because they have large agglomerations of people. We all \nknow that is where the terrorists want to hit. They want to try to hurt \nas many people as they can, and our larger cities and larger \nmetropolitan areas have those concentrations.\n  You do not read in the newspapers and when we have our intelligence \nbriefings up in 407, when you ask what names have been named, you don't \nhear the smaller cities. You only hear a handful of names, over and \nover again. They are not the smaller cities. They are not the smaller \nStates. They are the New Yorks and the Los Angeleses and the \nWashingtons and the Miamis.\n  I hope my colleagues in this case would rise to the occasion. Again, \nI understand that every State has needs. As I said, how can I be sure \nthat if I were from a small State I would not want to favor a formula \nthat had more for the small States? But in New York City, we would like \nto get a lot of corn subsidies or oil subsidies, but we don't have much \ncorn or oil. This provision is aimed at threat. It is not something \ngood to have, it is something bad to have, but it is only fair and it \nis only right that we make this as threat- based as possible.\n  The great irony is that at the very time when the administration, \nunder Mr. Chertoff's leadership, has made pledges that their \ndiscretionary dollars, which is now 60 percent, would be threat-based, \nwe in the Senate are making the formula less threat-based. The great \nirony is that, if we gave 100 percent of the money to the \nadministration, the areas under the greatest threat would do better \nthan under this proposal. That often doesn't happen when you are from \nNew York City, but this is the case right now.\n  I hope we rise to the occasion. To have Wyoming get $38.31 per capita \nwhile New York gets only $5.47 per capita doesn't look like a formula \nbased on threat but looks like a formula based on politics, to me. So \nwe can change this around. The Cornyn-Feinstein bill does not go all \nthe way to make it totally threat-based, but at least it restores some \nof the balance and makes it fair. I hope my colleagues will rise to the \noccasion and support a bill that we all know is ultimately the right \nthing to do. Support the Cornyn-Feinstein amendment which will give the \nareas under the greatest threat the greatest amount of dollars.\n\n  I yield the remaining time to my colleague from California, who \ngenerously ceded to me the 10 minutes I was granted.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you. We reserve the remainder of that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut, who \nis the chief cosponsor of the Collins-Lieberman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this is an important debate. I wish to \ngive a little background to it because there is a sense in which what \nis said up here is a contest between the Collins-Lieberman amendment \nand the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment. Both of these amendments are \namendments to the underlying bill. It is in that sense I urge my \ncolleagues to consider the Collins-Lieberman amendment first.\n  There is some history to this amendment. It just didn't arise up in \nresponse to this Homeland Security appropriations bill, but from our \ncommittee; Senator Collins is the chair and I am the ranking Democrat \non the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. This is \nthe committee from which the Department of Homeland Security emerged as \nan entity to be adopted by the Congress and signed and implemented by \nthe President.\n  We have been concerned about these homeland security grants because, \nif I am correct, we had some testimony that there was not another grant \nprogram of this size, over $1 billion--over\n\n[[Page S8115]]\n\n$2 billion, actually, last year--that did not have an authorization, \nthat just sort of was in the air.\n  We wanted to create an authorization for it. We also wanted to create \nsome accountability. This is a lot of money. We, as Senator Collins has \nindicated, create a series of auditing and review processes to make \nsure the people's money is well spent so we do not find the kind of \nwastefulness of which Senator Collins has given examples. So that is \nthe first thing. The bill, S. 21, that passed our committee \noverwhelmingly--as a matter of fact, I believe it passed on a unanimous \nvoice vote, bipartisan obviously--becomes this amendment, so it creates \nan authorization.\n  Second, it creates a formula. Because the formula has been changing \nfrom year to year at the judgment of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and the administration, it doesn't give a predictable flow of \nfunds to the local communities that are trying to prepare themselves to \nprotect us from a terrorist attack, which could occur anywhere in this \ncountry.\n  The second part of it is, how do you allocate the money in the \nformula? That is what now is at issue between the two amendments that \nare being debated, the Collins-Lieberman and the Cornyn-Feinstein \namendment.\n  Senator Collins and I very strongly believe that our amendment, the \ncommittee proposal, is balanced. The choice seems to be, do you \nallocate based totally on risk assessments or do you allocate based on \nrisk assessments and then give some minimum amount to every State in \nthe country because we are not sure where the terrorists are going to \nstrike next?\n  My friends who are supporting the other amendment sometimes have \nseemed to describe what is at issue here as a choice between a \ncongressionally mandated, politically inspired--some dare use the word \npork barrel formula--on the one hand and an intelligence-driven, pure \nrisk-based approach determined by the Department of Homeland Security \non the other hand. Not true. In fact, contrary to what my friend from \nNew York, Senator Schumer, just said, it is not really a battle between \nbig States and small States. It is a much more complicated but very \ncrucial argument here as to how you assess risk in an age of terrorism, \npost-9/11, when our homeland was struck and 3,000 people were killed.\n  Sometimes my friends supporting the Cornyn-Feinstein amendment speak \nabout risk assessment as if it were pure science, as if it were an \nexercise that was 100 percent predictable, as if one could say 2 plus 2 \nequals 4. That is right, you can say that: 2 plus 2 equals 4. You \ncannot make that same kind of certain conclusion about risk assessments \nregarding where terrorists will strike. The fact is, forgive me--maybe \ndon't forgive me--terrorists are inherently irrational, insane, crazy, \ninhumane. So how could we predict where they are going to strike next?\n  We understand one of the factors they consider is the visibility of \nan attack. Presumably that is one of the reasons why they struck on \nSeptember 11 in New York and in Washington. But that is not the only \nmotivation they have. Their motivation is to create panic and fear in \nour society.\n  In fact, they have not always struck major population centers. \nRemember the disco attacks in Bali, a resort area. Why was that done? \nThere are westerners gathered there, and it was done to terrify people \nin an area where they would not expect to be attacked. What about the \nschool in Beslam, Russia? That was not a major population center. That \nwas carried out in a community similar to thousands of communities \nacross America for the psychological impact as well as the brutal \neffect on the children who were there.\n  When we talk about risk analysis, it is not a certainty. It is an \neducated guess about where the terrorists are going to strike next. The \nmost likely guess, an educated guess about where they will strike in \nthe United States.\n  But does that justify not continuing to fund the Homeland Security \ngrants, the local law enforcement personnel all across America in other \nmedium-sized cities and small cities? What about the risk everyone \ntalks about of attacking our food supply or poisoning our water supply? \nThat risk is not in the cities designated, according to the \nconventional risk analysis, as high risk.\n  The 9/11 Commission said our failure to be better prepared for \nSeptember 11, our failure to do more to prevent it was what they \ndescribed as a ``failure of imagination.'' What did they mean? We could \nnot imagine that people would do what the terrorists did on September \n11. And they were right. Therefore, as we think about how best to \nprotect America, we have to put ourselves in the perverse and hateful \nheads of terrorists. There is all too much of a plausibility that \nterrorists want to strike not just the major population centers but \nsmaller towns, places where people congregate. Want to create real \npanic in the United States? Do something like that.\n  For us to assume, based on essentially an educated guess that is risk \nanalysis, that all the communities around the country that need our \nhelp should not get some amount of help seems to me to be without \nfoundation.\n  Senator Collins was very compelling yesterday when she said also that \nif we take the September 11 attacks and look at places around America \nwhere those 19 terrorists gained access to the United States--Portland, \nME, for instance; they took off from Portland to head to New York; the \nsmall towns where they trained in flying planes, where they acquired \nequipment to carry out their deadly deeds--we need to provide the kind \nof support that the Collins-Lieberman amendment provides to law \nenforcement officers all across America, the 700,000, God bless them, \nout there risking their lives every day for us.\n  They are the first responders. But they are also the first \npreventers, the ones whose eyes and ears are all across America. They \nsee that piece of evidence that makes them suspicious; that can be the \nthread that will unravel the next terrorist plot, even one targeted \ntoward one of the areas that is higher risk according to these risk \nassessments.\n  Senator Collins and I tried to balance this. We have deferred to the \ncurrent risk analysis. We give effectively 60 percent and as high as 70 \npercent when we follow our sliding scale of money under this grant \nprogram to higher risk analyzed places in America. But the rest deserve \nsome support, too. The rest merit some protection, as well. Bob \nMueller, the FBI Director, said America is awash in targets. America is \nawash in possible vulnerable targets for terrorists--and they are all \nover America. We want to respond in a positive way and work to protect \nall of America.\n  This chart is a map of the United States of America. It is a \ncomparison of the impact of the Collins-Lieberman amendment compared to \nthe Feinstein-Cornyn amendment. All the States in green would get more \nfunds under the Collins-Lieberman amendment than under the Feinstein-\nCornyn amendment. The big States would also do fine. They get that \nextra money because of risk analysis. And we defer to that, but we do \nnot yield totally to it.\n  Incidentally, we have some big States that receive more money under \nour proposal than under the other, including Texas, Florida, Michigan, \nand Ohio. Senator Levin will explain why, coming from Michigan, he \nstrongly supports this amendment. I hope Members will keep this chart \nin mind when voting.\n  The second point, I go back to what I said at the beginning. This is \nan amendment to the underlying Homeland Security appropriations bill. \nIn addition to the argument about risk and the formula, there is a \ndifference of opinion about money. We have all been talking about this \nwith an intensity after the dreadful attacks in London last week. The \ncurrent appropriations bill would cut funding in these grant categories \nfrom $2.3 billion down to $1.9 billion. Senator Collins and I and \nmembers of our committee believe that is not enough.\n  I say again what I have said before: We have the best military in the \nworld for a lot of reasons, one of which is we have had the guts to \ninvest in that military, to spend the money on it. We will only have \nthe best homeland defense if we similarly invest. This amendment would \nraise the authorization level up to $2.9 billion. That is the least we \ncan do to support our local and State efforts, our first responders and \nfirst preventers.\n  I hope, as our colleagues come to vote on these two amendments at 5 \no'clock, they will understand not only the differences in the approach \non risk\n\n[[Page S8116]]\n\nformula, but the differences between our amendment and the underlying \nappropriations bill.\n  In the moment or two remaining, I will speak a little bit about how \nthe Collins-Lieberman amendment improves on H.R. 2360, the underlying \nbill. We provide States with predictable funding over time. The \nappropriations bill adopts a different formula this year than last year \nand may adopt another formula next year. That does not help our local \nfirst responders, preventers, Homeland Security agencies in planning \nand protecting America.\n\n  Second, our amendment includes a sliding-scale baseline different \nfrom the Appropriations Committee proposal that provides additional \nguaranteed funds to the largest and most densely populated States.\n  Third, the amendment provides an overall framework for how Homeland \nSecurity funds are to be distributed.\n  Fourth, there are accountability measures designed to ensure that the \ngrant money is spent properly and effectively. There are no \naccountability measures in the Appropriations Committee bill. \nIncidentally, there is no dollar number in the Cornyn-Feinstein \namendment as compared to our $2.9 billion and the Appropriations \nCommittee's $1.9 billion.\n  Finally, fifth, our amendment does improve the grants process itself \ncompared to the underlying bill. The Collins-Lieberman amendment does \nnot just establish a formula, it includes measures to streamline and \nimprove the Homeland Security grants process. That includes provisions \non applications, planning, and reporting measures to encourage regional \ncoordination, so important in protecting our people from terrorism.\n  We establish a list of essential capabilities for all jurisdictions \nso that the Homeland Security Department and the localities understand \nwhat capabilities the experts feel they should develop in the local \nareas to be prepared to prevent, and God forbid, if an attack occurs, \nto respond to a terrorist attack. And it creates an interagency \ncommittee to find ways to eliminate redundant and duplicative \nrequirements for the Homeland Security grants across the Federal \nGovernment.\n  In short, our amendment takes a far more comprehensive approach to \nthe first responder grants than the underlying bill. On that basis \nalone, not to mention the fairness of our formula, I urge my colleagues \nto support the Collins-Lieberman amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida, Mr. Martinez.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nFeinstein-Cornyn amendment to the fiscal year 2006 Department of \nHomeland Security appropriations bill.\n  The concept of this amendment is simple--to direct homeland security \ndollars to the areas where the threat of attack is greatest.\n  It was no accident that when the terrorists attacked our Nation on \nthat September morning they chose to strike at our two most powerful \ncities, our center for capitalism and commerce, New York, and our \ncenter of Government, Washington.\n  Since that fateful day, we have been fortifying our Nation in order \nto prevent another attack--and so far we have succeeded--but we must \nremain vigilant.\n  And just last week London was hit by a string of deadly terrorist \nbombings, another heinous and despicable act performed by outlaws too \nweak to show their face and too naive to know that this recent attack \nwill only strengthen our resolve to hunt and destroy terrorists and \ntheir sympathizers wherever they lie. My heart goes out to our allies \nand friends in Great Britain and I know all of my colleagues join me in \nexpressing our sympathy and solidarity with the British people.\n  It was no accident that when the terrorists attacked our Nation on \nSeptember 11, 2001, they picked powerful, high-profile, and heavily \ntrafficked targets.\n  Terrorists target areas where they can inflict the most damage and \nget the most attention, and for those reasons they focus on urban \ncenters, areas of national importance, areas that are highly populated.\n  But if you include the interests of a region--be they tourist \nattractions, amusements parks or resorts, at anyone time there can be \nmillions of visitors.\n  For instance, Orange County, FL, is one of the top vacation \ndestinations in the world. In 2003 the region played host to over 45 \nmillion visitors.\n  On March 18, 2003, the Federal Aviation Administration imposed a no-\nfly zone over the Walt Disney World Resort area--because, according to \nan FAA spokesperson: ``The Disney parks are a potential target of \nsymbolic value . . .'' Florida is also home to 14 deepwater ports, many \nof which are nationally significant and critically important parts of \nour country's shipping infrastructure.\n  For example, at the Port of Miami nearly 4 million cruise passengers \npassed through the Port and over 9 million tons of cargo transited \nthrough the seaport. This combination of cruise and cargo activities \nsupported approximately 98,000 jobs, and has an economic impact in \nMiami-Dade County of over $12 billion.\n  The Port of Tampa had over 800,000 cruise passengers and handles \nnearly 50 million tons per year, or half of the State's total seaborne \ncargo tonnage. The Port of Tampa is also the largest economic engine in \nwest central Florida.\n  Again, these examples highlight the issues associated with regional \ninflux.\n  The whole State of Florida, in fact, now plays host to 77 million \ntourists a year. That is on top of our 17 million person population.\n  We cannot overstate the importance of regional concepts and that \nmodels created by this amendment will encourage funding to be spent not \nonly on our major cities, but also on those regional centers that \nrequire certain protections.\n  One more point. In a letter. In a letter dated today from Homeland \nSecurity Secretary Michael Chertoff, he writes:\n\n       Funding our first responders based on risk and need gives \n     us the flexibility to ensure our finite resources are \n     allocated in a prioritized and objective manner.\n\n  Secretary Chertoff adds:\n\n       The Department of Homeland Security strongly supports \n     authorization language that would distribute Federal homeland \n     security grant funds based on risk and need, rather than on \n     static and arbitrary minimums.\n\n  This amendment, the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment, meets Secretary \nChertoff's desire, and that is to require the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to allocate grants to States based primarily on threat \nassessment and vulnerability. I believe that kind of discretion to the \nSecretary of Homeland Security will only enhance his ability to keep \nour country safe and to respond to the areas of most critical and \nimmediate need and concern.\n  As a Congress, we must be prudent in appropriating funds to meet our \nessential capabilities. The ability to meet the risk to our Nation by \nreducing our vulnerability to attack is essential to our success in \ndefending America in this war on terror.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nimportant amendment. It is currently a time in which we have been \nreminded by the events of last week of the importance that we must \nplace on our homeland security, on the security of our Nation in order \nthat we might be able to forestall any future terrorist designs upon \nour Nation.\n  I believe the people of Florida will be best served by an approach \nthat bases the decision on the Department of Homeland Security of where \nthe grants may go on the risk and the perceived assessment of that risk \nand not on some static formula.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the remainder of my time back to \nthe Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, at this time I would like to yield up to \n10 minutes to the Senator from Michigan. I thank the Senator from \nMichigan for his many contributions to this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. Let me thank our chairman, Senator \nCollins, for all the work she has put in on\n\n[[Page S8117]]\n\nthis bill. It is a vast improvement over the formula and over the \nproposal of the administration, which came to us and which was worked \non very hard by Senator Collins, Senator Lieberman, and others on the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. What we will be \nvoting on at 5 o'clock will be two amendments. The first amendment will \nbe the Collins-Lieberman amendment, which is a significant improvement, \nit seems to me, from the vantage point of almost every State over the \nadministration proposal. It is that amendment that I want to talk about \nand which I am proud to cosponsor.\n  For the past 3 years, the State homeland security grant program has \ndistributed funds using a funding formula that arbitrarily sets aside a \nlarge portion of the funds to be divided equally among the States \nregardless of need. This formula disadvantages States with high \npopulations. While other Federal grant programs provide a minimum State \nfunding level to ensure funds reach all areas of the country, the State \nminimum formula which has been used to allocate State homeland security \nprogram funds in the underlying bill and which was in the \nadministration's proposal--let me correct that--in the underlying bill, \nthe underlying bill is unusually high. The underlying bill basically is \na .75 percent minimum guarantee, which is similar to the one which has \nbeen in effect until now, and this is an unusually high minimum formula \nwhen compared to other formulas in other bills. The most common minimum \nformula in most programs is .5, one-half of 1 percent.\n  The .25 percent minimum is more common than the .75 percent minimum. \nYet in the bill before us--and I misspoke before when I said the \nadministration's proposal. In the appropriations bill before us it is \neffectively a .75 percent minimum guarantee, which is significantly \nhigher than most of the kinds of guarantees which have existed in \nprograms similar to this where .5, half of a percent, is the most \ncommon formula and, in fact, one-quarter of 1 percent, or .25, is more \ncommon than the .75, or three-quarters of 1 percent, which is \neffectively the minimum guarantee in the Appropriations Committee's \nreport.\n  We have been working hard to come up with a more equitable formula. \nWe worked very hard, as the Presiding Officer knows, in the committee \non which both of us serve. It is a very difficult issue to reach a \nconsensus, and yet we came to a very near consensus in committee. It \nwasn't unanimous, but it was close to unanimous in committee because of \nthe hard work particularly of our chairman and our ranking member to \ncome up with a formula which would try to treat all of our States \nequitably.\n  We did a number of things, but perhaps the most significant addition \nwe made to what has been the practice is that we added a new option \nbasically for high population or high population density States so that \nthey could choose in effect either between the minimum formula of .55 \npercent, which is in the Collins-Lieberman amendment, or select another \nformula which is based more on population and population density. \nAlmost all of our States--not quite all but almost all of our States--\nas a result of that option that is built into the Collins-Lieberman \namendment do better than they do under the bill which is pending before \nus.\n  The underlying appropriations bill that provides funding for homeland \nsecurity grants provides that each State and territory shall receive \nthe same dollar amount for the State minimum as was distributed in \nfiscal year 2005, and that is what essentially leads to the conclusion \nthat that would be a .75 percent base State funding formula that \narbitrarily sets aside a large portion of funds to be divided equally \namong the States regardless of need.\n\n  The authorizing committee--it is a key point here--the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee is the authorizing \ncommittee--after holding hearings and going through a markup passed \nthis compromise formula language which is in the Collins-Lieberman \namendment before us, which would allow States to choose either the .55 \npercent of the total amount appropriated for the threat-based homeland \nsecurity grant program or--and this is the addition which is so \ncritical to so many of our States--a minimum amount based on a State's \nrelative population and population density. This option for States will \nprovide additional guaranteed funds to the largest and most densely \npopulated States. The remainder of the total funds, approximately 60 \npercent, would go to the States and regions based purely on risk and \nthreat assessment by the Department of Homeland Security using factors \nset forth in the amendment--and that is another important point--that \nthe factors for the Homeland Security Department to consider are set \nforth in the amendment. And then up to half of the remaining funds \ncould be allocated in the discretion of the Department to metropolitan \nareas.\n  The amendment sets some guidance, in other words, on the factors to \nbe considered in allocating risk-based funding.\n  Mr. President, this amendment that is before us represents a \ncompromise. It is a compromise that has the support of small States and \nmany of our largest States and our most populated States. Perhaps not \nall of them, although I believe by any measure, by any measure, the \nCollins-Lieberman amendment before us advantages even the most \npopulated States compared to the bill that it seeks to amend.\n  There will be a later amendment that will be voted upon that from the \nperspective of a number of States would be an improvement over Collins-\nLieberman, but that is not what people have to vote on, as to whether \nthey support Collins-Lieberman or the Feinstein amendment. People could \nvote for both amendments. It is not one amendment substituting for the \nother. This is not a decision as to which is better, vote only for one. \nFrom the perspective of some States both of the amendments would be an \nimprovement over the underlying bill.\n  The reason I am cosponsoring the Collins-Lieberman amendment is I \nbelieve it is the result of a carefully crafted compromise which adds a \nnumber of critical factors that do not exist in the way funds have been \ndistributed up to now. The addition of the option for the population \ndensity factor is a significant improvement over the underlying bill \nwhich basically reflects the way funds have been apportioned to now. \nAnd the fact that there are also factors which are laid out in the bill \nto be considered by the Department means that all of us can see when it \ncomes to the discretionary decisions by the Department the factors that \nthe Department is to take into account when apportioning those funds. \nThese are significant improvements in the underlying bill, I believe, \nfor almost every State here. I repeat, the fact that an amendment that \nwe will be voting on subsequently may be better even from the \nperspective of a number of States should not cause people to vote no on \nthe Collins-Lieberman amendment, which from the perspective, I believe, \nof almost every State is an improvement on the underlying bill which is \nbefore us.\n  So I commend the Senator from Maine and the Senator from Connecticut \nfor working so hard to try to find a bipartisan approach, an approach \nwhich has great equity in it for all of our States greater than, \nsurely, the present status quo, which needs to be changed but which I \nam afraid would be perpetuated if we simply adopt the Appropriations \nCommittee proposal and if we defeat the Collins-Lieberman amendment. I \nhope that amendment will be greeted with strong support on the floor \nbecause it does represent an improvement from the perspective of almost \nall if not all States over the underlying status quo.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 17 minutes 26 seconds remaining.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I think this small chart describes both amendments. \nThe underlying appropriations bill has $1.39 billion. That is 70 \npercent of the money. Under the Collins-Lieberman amendment, $1.155 \nbillion is based on risk. That is 60 percent. And under the Feinstein-\nCornyn amendment, $1.667 billion is based on risk. That is 87 percent. \nThe source is the Congressional Research Service. The Congressional \nResearch Service was called again this morning. They stand by these \nfigures.\n\n[[Page S8118]]\n\n  Now, let me quickly bring to your attention the position of the \nadministration. The position of the administration is set out in a \nletter of July 12 signed by Michael Chertoff to Members of the Senate. \nLet me just read a few parts.\n\n       The administration strongly believes that Federal homeland \n     security funds should be distributed to our first responders \n     based on risk and need.\n       The Administration would oppose amendments that would add \n     new bureaucratic requirements and cap funding for high threat \n     cities while not providing enough flexibility to distribute \n     over 90 percent of grant funds on the basis of risk.\n       The administration's position is 90 percent of grant funds \n     should be distributed on the basis of risk. The closest \n     amendment to that is Feinstein-Cornyn at 87 percent of grant \n     funds distributed on the basis of risk.\n\n  And here is the reason that DHS gives.\n\n       DHS is identifying 36 capabilities that are critical to \n     preventing another terrorist attack and, if an attack does \n     occur, to respond and recover in a manner that minimizes loss \n     of life and other damages. We must focus our State and local \n     preparedness efforts on building those capabilities to the \n     right level and in the right places. Funding our first \n     responders based on risk and need gives us the flexibility to \n     ensure our finite resources are allocated in a prioritized \n     and objective manner.\n\n  Mr. President, I could not agree with that more. That is why we feel \nso strongly about our amendment. You have to send the money where the \nneed is.\n  You have to send the money where the anticipation is that there might \nbe an attack, where the intelligence says--not this body; we don't \nknow--this Nation is vulnerable. What Senator Cornyn and I have tried \nto do is see that there is enough flexibility to get enough of that \nmoney out there. The President has set the standard at 90 percent. Our \nbill comes to 87 percent.\n  Unlike the Collins-Lieberman amendment, the Cornyn-Feinstein \namendment retains the high-threat cities' Urban Area Security \nInitiative Program. This program and these regions--some 50 cities--\nhave for several years been aggressively working to implement \ncomprehensive plans. They remain intact, unless the Secretary of \nHomeland Security decides to the contrary. I included in the Record \npreviously the letter from them containing 30 of the cities.\n  It is actually true this body can vote yes on both amendments. But my \nview is this: We are spending billions and billions on intelligence. We \nare beefing up every aspect of intelligence, creating new entities, \nimproving interfacing, giving this huge new Department of Homeland \nSecurity all kinds of analysis responsibility. But we are also giving \nthem a formula by which they have to allocate the money. That makes no \nsense at all. Let them do it on the basis of risk. Let them do it on \nthe basis of threat and vulnerability. Let them move money around as \nthe need indicates.\n  I don't believe there is anyone in this body who is prescient enough \nto know where al-Qaida or Gama'a al-Islamiyya or any other group might \nattack the United States next. One thing we do know, there are \nterrorist cells in this country, and they are geographically spread \nacross the country. There is no question about that. So why shouldn't \nthe money be based on risk and threat?\n  This amendment does that: 87 percent of the funds, $1.667 billion, \nbased on risk. The administration's standard is 90 percent. Our \namendment comes closest to that standard.\n  Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from California and the Chair.\n  I want to clear up some of the confusion that took place this morning \nin our debate over these amendments on homeland security funding. \nFirst, I want to make it absolutely clear that we have checked \ncontinuously with the CRS. Their report sent to me about the effects of \nthe amendment proposed by Senators Collins and Lieberman to this \nappropriations bill is absolutely accurate. They confirm that the ratio \nof funds directed to the high-risk areas is at 60 percent and the other \ndistribution is 40 percent. So we take it away from the highest risk \nareas. The Senator from Maine earlier suggested that CRS has somehow \ndisavowed their memo. That is not so. Again, we have talked to CRS \nrecently and have been assured that the memo sent to me is valid and \naccurate.\n  The CRS memo sent to me summarizes how much money the Collins \namendment would direct to risk and how much to State guarantees. In a \nnutshell, the report finds that the Collins-Lieberman amendment would \nonly provide 60 percent of the funding based on risk. The CRS report \ngoes on to explain that the underlying appropriations bill would \nprovide 70 percent of the funding on a risk basis. CRS reports this is \na difference of over $183 million. That is over $183 million that \nSecretary Chertoff wanted to send to the highest risk places.\n  We don't want to tie the Secretary's hands. The administration has \nbeen very clear about what they want. They want to put the money where \nthe risk is. That is what makes the most sense.\n  I have said in the past we are the second theater of war to Iraq \nbecause we know that at any time our enemies could attack, and they are \nnot telling us when or where. The fact is, we are all under the \nmisgiving that what happened in London and what happened at the World \nTrade Center and what happened in Madrid could happen here. How dare we \nsay: No, we have to distribute around to other places. Everybody wants \nto protect their constituents, small towns, large cities, whatever it \nis. I don't blame people for that. But when you have a plague in an \narea, you give the vaccine, if you have it, to the people who live in \nthat area. When you have an attack on the water, you send the ships to \nthe area. Why in the world are we deciding here and now that we \nshouldn't give the money to the areas of highest risk?\n\n  In my State, a place called South Carney, NJ has a significant \nchemical manufacturing and distribution operation. If that was attacked \nand those chemicals were released into the air, we could see 12 million \npeople die. We saw the terrible events in London. It has been said that \na couple seconds either way could have created a much higher casualty \nfigure.\n  Today you heard from the Senator from California that Secretary \nChertoff wrote a letter to all Senators. I repeat:\n\n       The administration strongly believes that Federal Homeland \n     Security funds should be distributed to our first responders \n     based on risk and need.\n\n  You have heard again that Secretary Chertoff wants the flexibility to \ndistribute up to 90 percent of the funds based on risk. Ninety percent \nis a lot different than a mere 60 percent.\n  We can't legislate risk. It is that simple. We need to leave this to \nthe experts. Secretary Chertoff is developing analytical tools to \ntarget areas of risk and vulnerability. We confirmed him almost \nunanimously. Now we should let him do the job he has been selected to \ndo.\n  The 9/11 Commission was adamant that we must distribute homeland \nsecurity money based on risk. I have talked to former Governor Tom \nKean, a distinguished public servant and head of the Commission, about \nthis subject. He continues to demand that we move toward risk-based \nfunding. I remind the Senate that Secretary Ridge, before Secretary \nChertoff, supported full funding to go to the areas of highest risk.\n  There was an arduous effort put into the creation of an intelligence \nreform bill, led by Senators Collins and Senator Lieberman. I say to \nthem: Let's help the administration target real areas of risk and \nvulnerability. Let's make sure we understand that the authorization for \nthe bill was at $2.9 billion, around that, and the appropriations bill \nis at $1.9 billion. So on the surface it does look like there is more \ncoming to everybody. But it is not true. The fact is, we should not be \ntaking money away from the highest risk areas and dividing it based \nsimply on population.\n  I hope we will approve the Feinstein amendment and reject the Collins \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, would the Chair inform me how much time \nis left on the Collins-Lieberman amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 18 minutes 51 seconds.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Nebraska, who has played a\n\n[[Page S8119]]\n\nvery important role in crafting this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from \nMaine for the opportunity to rise in support of the Collins amendment \ntoday. I am also a cosponsor of the bill she and Senator Lieberman have \nintroduced, S. 21, the Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act of 2005. \nEach year since the attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center, \nmany of us have come to the floor to remind our colleagues that \nterrorism is not only a threat faced by States with large urban \npopulations but also States with large rural populations. Since \nSeptember 11, States and communities of all sizes have made great \nstrides in preparing for another possible terrorist attack.\n  Based on the National Strategy for Homeland Security's principle of \nshared responsibility, Federal, State, and local governments, together \nwith the private sector and the American people, work in partnership to \nensure our first responders are well equipped and well trained. States \nand local governments are responsible for preparing and implementing \nmultiyear plans to ensure our Nation's first responders receive the \nequipment and training they require. This year we turn our attention to \nthe fiscal year 2006 Homeland Security appropriations bill following \nthe devastating terrorist attack on our closest ally in the global war \non terrorism. The coordinated attacks in London last week remind us \nthat Islamic totalitarianism is still a threat to our democratic values \nand ideals and not solely confined to the borders of Iraq or the Middle \nEast. The bombings on the subway and bus lines in London underscore the \nfact that terrorists will attempt to attack us when they choose, how \nthey choose, and where they choose. And because terror can strike us \nanywhere, it is vitally important that our first responders have the \nfunding they need in order to prepare for most, if not every, imagined \nthreat.\n  Each year we look for better ways to provide homeland security \nfunding for States, be they large or small. The amendment offered by my \ncolleague from Maine would achieve something that has not happened yet \nwith respect to first responder funding. It would provide much needed \npredictability for our first responder planners. Because there has \nnever been an authorization for this funding, each year, these programs \nare subject to great debate and amendments on the Senate floor, leaving \nour city and State officials without any sort of certainty in their \npreparedness planning. In the years since the attacks of September 11, \n2001, the Federal Government has provided States with a share of \navailable homeland security funds through the State Homeland Security \nGrant Program, SHSGP. This program has been the primary source of \ncoordinated funding for first responders, allowing States and local \ngovernments to build a base capacity by funding essential prevention, \npreparedness, response, and recovery capabilities. In past years, \nStates have been guaranteed a minimum of .75 percent of these funds.\n  The Collins amendment would modify the State funding program in three \nprimary ways. First, it would combine three programs into one larger \npot of funding. The SHSGP, with the Law Enforcement Terrorism and \nPrevention Program and the Urban Area Security Initiative, would now \nbecome one pool of money to be shared among the States. Second, it \nwould authorize $2.9 billion in total funding for the three programs. \nThis is important because the trend has clearly been to decrease this \namount. Last year's bill included $2.7 billion in first responder \nfunding, and this year's underlying Senate bill only includes $1.9 \nbillion for these programs.\n  Third, it would set the funding formula so that each State would be \nguaranteed a minimum level of funding, .55 percent of the total funding \nof the program. The remainder of the funds would be distributed based \non risk. This guaranteed funding stream is critical for all of our \nsmaller States. For many of our States, this guaranteed minimum will be \nmost, if not all, of our first responder funding. I am not advocating \nthat homeland security funds be diverted from high risk areas. But, \nrather, I am saying that rural and smaller States also need assistance \nin securing their communities and preparing for a possible attack. \nStates set their own priorities when it comes to preparing for \nterrorist attacks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield 30 more seconds to the Senator.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, our amendment would give the \nsmaller States the ability to have continuity and predictability in \nbudgeting for their plans. I think it suffices to say that our country \nis only as safe as our weakest vulnerability. We need to make sure \nevery part of the country is prepared, regardless of location or size. \nThe citizens of America expect that everything possible is being done \nto prevent another terrorist attack, and they expect that if another \ntragedy were to occur, the response and recovery will be immediate, \nwell coordinated, and well trained.\n  The Collins amendment will strengthen regional efforts and increase \nevery State's ability to protect both its urban and rural critical \ninfrastructure. Whether it is the protection of an urban shopping mall \nor the prevention of a rural bioterrorism incident that would affect \nour food and water supply, these infrastructures in every State must be \nprotected. I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 12 minutes 42 seconds.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield myself 9 minutes.\n  Let me make some concluding remarks about the impact of the amendment \noffered by our colleagues, Senator Feinstein and Senator Cornyn. The \nfact is that the amendment would decimate the predictable funding \nlevels for States. The minimum in the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment is \nonly .25. It is simply too low to support the efforts by States to have \na predictable base level of funding each year to fund multiyear \nprojects, such as creating interoperable communications networks, first \nresponder training programs, or the agriterrorism project that the \nMidwestern Governors are eager to establish.\n  I will give you a couple of examples of what the differences would \nmean. Assuming the Senate bill's appropriation level under our \namendment, the State of Georgia could plan on receiving a base amount \nof $15.3 million. Under the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment, Georgia would \nbe assured of getting only $2.4 million as a minimum allocation.\n  Under our amendment, North Carolina would receive a base of a little \nover $15 million. But under Feinstein-Cornyn, the State could only \ncount on $2.4 million.\n  Under our amendment, Florida would receive a base amount of more than \n$30 million because of the sliding scale minimum. But under the \nFeinstein-Cornyn amendment, Florida would only get $2.4 million.\n  Furthermore, the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment's lack of predictable \nfunding inhibits the ability of States to plan. Both our colleagues' \namendment and the Collins-Lieberman amendment would require States to \nsubmit 3-year State homeland security plans. Yet, the Feinstein-Cornyn \namendment does not provide a predictable base, so such plans would not \nbe a fruitful exercise.\n  For example, the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment requires that the State \nplan include ``a prioritization of needs based on threat, \nvulnerability, and consequence assessment, and a description of how the \nState intends to address such needs at the city, county, regional, \ntribal, and interstate level.''\n  I simply fail to see how a State could satisfy these ambitious \nrequirements without any assurances that it would receive a significant \nbase amount of funding. Because our amendment provides States with that \npredictable, substantial base allocation, the 3-year plans would \nactually become useful roadmaps and would allow for more efficient \nexpenditure of homeland security funds. That is why our amendment is \nstrongly supported over the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment by the National \nGovernors Association.\n\n[[Page S8120]]\n\n  Mr. President, the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment shortchanges funding \ndedicated to the prevention of terrorism attacks. It simply does not \nprovide the kind of assured funding needed for law enforcement to help \ndetect and prevent attacks before they occur. Indeed, it takes \nsignificant steps backward from what Senators Gregg and Byrd have \nincluded in the underlying bill.\n  The underlying bill appropriates $400 million for the Law Enforcement \nTerrorism Prevention Program, which provides funds for police, \nsheriffs, and other law enforcement personnel to stop terrorist \nactivity before it occurs. By contrast, the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment \nactually swallows up the existing law enforcement terrorism prevention \nprogram, without ensuring any funds whatsoever--any funds whatsoever--\nfor our police, sheriffs, and other law enforcement personnel.\n  In other words, all of the funding under the Feinstein-Cornyn \namendment could be used to prepare to respond to terrorist attacks, \nleaving efforts to prevent such attacks entirely up to our States and \ncommunities.\n  In sharp contrast, the Collins-Lieberman amendment would formally \nauthorize the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program and ensure \nthat prevention efforts are adequately protected by treating them as a \nseparate program with different allowable uses than response efforts. \nThat is why the law enforcement community has overwhelmingly endorsed \nour amendment.\n  The Collins-Lieberman amendment enjoys the support of the National \nTroopers Coalition, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations, the International Union of Police \nAssociations, the Association of Chiefs of Police, and the list goes on \nand on, including the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, the \nNational Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, and the \nNational Emergency Management Association.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters from these and other \norganizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Letters of Support for S. 21\n\n\n                                  National Troopers Coalition,\n\n                                      Green Bay, WI, June 9, 2005.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     Chair, Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, \n         U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Collins: On behalf of the 40,000 state \n     troopers and highway patrol men and women represented by the \n     National Troopers Coalition (NTC), I would like to express \n     our support of S. 21. ``The Homeland Security Grant \n     Enhancement Act of 2005.''\n       By bringing together existing programs and initiatives \n     addressing homeland security, this legislation will help \n     streamline and rationalize the process by which grants are \n     made to individual cities and metropolitan regions based on \n     relative threat, vulnerability, and consequences faced by an \n     area from a terrorist attack.\n       As a nationwide organization, the NTC feels the funding \n     formula proposed in this bill promotes a better level of \n     preparedness and brings some predictability to states for \n     planning purposes. In addition, S. 21 adopts new \n     accountability measures to ensure homeland security grants \n     are used effectively and appropriately.\n       We appreciate your leadership and support of the law \n     enforcement community, and would like to offer any assistance \n     we can provide for the successful passage of S. 21.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Casey Perry,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Fraternal Order of Police,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 21, 2005.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security and \n         Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Chairman and Senator Lieberman: I am writing to \n     advise you of the position of the Fraternal Order of Police \n     on S. 21, the ``Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act,'' \n     which was favorably reported by the Committee on Homeland \n     Security and Governmental Affairs in May of this year.\n       Almost four years have passed since the terrorist attacks \n     on New York and northern Virginia, and at that time it has \n     become clear that the current system of distributing Federal \n     homeland security grants needs to be reformed. Under the \n     current system, not enough of those funds are being targeted \n     to our Nation's primary goal-preventing future terrorist \n     attacks. Your legislation recognizes the fact that the \n     majority of Federal funds have been directed toward \n     ``recovery and response'' operations, too often at the \n     expense of efforts to prevent future attacks. The Homeland \n     Security Advisory Committee (HSAC) Task Force on State and \n     Local Homeland Security Funding reached this conclusion in \n     its final report, issued last June:\n       The Task Force found that the vast majority of funds \n     received thus far by State, county, municipal and tribal \n     governments have been spent on emergency response equipment \n     and related training. . . However, the Task Force also notes \n     that the loss of life, human suffering, social instability, \n     and financial repercussions that would result from a \n     successful terrorist attack mandates that State, county, \n     municipal and tribal governments take aggressive, objectively \n     measurable, and well planned steps to prevent such an attack \n     from occurring. . . Accordingly, the Task Force strongly \n     recommends that State and local governments consider \n     allocating these and future resources to enhance the ability \n     of State, county, municipal and tribal governments to detect \n     and prevent future acts of terrorism.\n       The Fraternal Order of Police strongly agrees with the \n     findings of the Task Force and believes that the best way to \n     ensure that these resources are used for prevention is the \n     authorization of the current Law Enforcement Terrorism \n     Prevention Program (LETPP), which is designed to assist law \n     enforcement agencies in developing the capabilities to \n     detect, deter, disrupt, and prevent acts of terrorism. The \n     LETPP allows Federal funds to be used by State and local \n     governments to improve information sharing to preempt \n     terrorist attacks, harden targets to reduce their \n     vulnerability to attack, enhance interoperable communication \n     systems, and to support overtime expenses related to the \n     homeland security plan.\n       Your legislation is the only bill which formally authorizes \n     this important program. The reported version of S. 21 would \n     allow up to 25 percent of the authorized level of all grant \n     funds to be used for the LETPP, a level which we strongly \n     urge you to consider making the minimum, rather than the \n     maximum, authorized level. This would be consistent both with \n     the needs of the law enforcement community that is working \n     every hour of every day to prevent the next terrorist attack \n     from occurring and with the final recommendations of the \n     HSAC's Task Force on State and Local Homeland Security \n     Funding.\n       Ensuring that all communities achieve and maintain the \n     appropriate response and recover capacity for terrorist \n     incidents is, and always will be, a critical component of any \n     homeland security plan. However, it is the goal of law \n     enforcement to ensure that we never have a terrorist incident \n     to respond to or recovery from--we want to stop the attack \n     before it ever occurs. For this reason, we need a greater \n     focus on prevention than is currently the case when \n     allocating Federal homeland security funds. We believe that \n     the authorization of the LETPP is the best way to achieve \n     this goal and the F.O.P. strongly supports your efforts in \n     this regard.\n       I look forward to S. 21 being considered on the floor and \n     ultimately reconciled with similar legislation that passed \n     the House of Representatives with our support in early May. \n     On behalf of the more than 321,000 members of the Fraternal \n     Order of Police, I want to thank you for reaching out to the \n     F.O.P. to seek our input on this bill and for recognizing the \n     critical role that law enforcement plays in securing our \n     homeland. We appreciate your leadership on this issue and \n     look forward to working with you to enact meaningful grant \n     reform at the Department of Homeland Security. If I can be of \n     any further help, please do not hesitate to contact me or \n     Executive Director Jim Pasco through our Washington office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Chuck Canterbury,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                of Police Organizations, Inc.,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 31, 2005.\n     Re: S. 21, the Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act of \n         2005\n\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Association of \n     Police Organizations (``NAPO'') representing more than \n     235,000 law enforcement officers throughout the United \n     States, I am writing to ask you to cosponsor S. 21, the \n     Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act of 2005. This \n     legislation will reform the homeland security grant system to \n     make it more effective, efficient, and accountable. It will \n     also ensure a significant role for state and local law \n     enforcement in preventing the next terrorist attack.\n       Sponsored by Senators Collins and Lieberman, S. 21 was \n     reported out of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental \n     Affairs Committee on April 13, 2005 and is expected to be \n     considered by the full Senate in the next few weeks. S. 21 \n     ensures that law enforcement will have a seat at the table \n     when homeland security resource allocation decisions are \n     being made.\n       Unlike other homeland security grant proposed, S. 21 \n     ensures that the prevention of terrorist attacks--not just \n     response effects--received a significant share of the \n     homeland security funds. Under S. 21, up to 25% of the \n     homeland security grant funding will be used for law \n     enforcement terrorism prevention purposes, including \n     information sharing, target hardening, threat recognition, \n     terrorist\n\n[[Page S8121]]\n\n     intervention activities, interoperable communication, and \n     overtime expenses occurred in support of federal agencies for \n     increased border security and training.\n       S. 21 will also foster the development and enforcement of \n     voluntary consensus standards to improve the safety of first \n     respondent equipment and encourage the expansion of the SAVER \n     program, which provide first respondent with ``consumer \n     report'' type information on the performance of various \n     brands of equipment relied on by law enforcement officers \n     every day.\n       We need to be sure that state and local enforcement are \n     properly supported, trained and equipped to prevent terrorism \n     before it occurs. S. 21 will ensure that state and local law \n     enforcement receive a fair share of federal assistance \n     dedicated for prevention purposes.\n       NAPO therefore urges you to cosponsor S. 21. The \n     appropriate contacts to do so are Jon Nass with the majority \n     staff of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs, and Beth Grossman with the minority \n     staff.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William J.

Resources that to date have too often been \n     denied them.\n       We in law enforcement are constantly held accountable for \n     our decisions and actions. It is time that federal decision \n     makers are held to the same standard of accountability. S. 21 \n     will end the old practices that too often resulted in state \n     and local law enforcement receiving little or no support. It \n     ensures that once allocation decisions are made, we will be \n     given an explanation for those grant allocation decisions.\n       We know from long experience that prevention must come \n     before response. Swift and effective response should only be \n     necessary when those who would do us harm circumvent \n     prevention. By requiring that up to twenty-five percent of \n     the homeland security grant funding will be used for law \n     enforcement terrorism prevention purposes, we will be able to \n     place prevention in its proper place, in front of response. \n     We will have better information sharing, target hardening, \n     threat recognition, terrorist intervention activities, \n     interoperable communication, and overtime expenses to carry \n     out our mission of protecting the American public. Only in \n     this way will we be able to build our nation's prevention \n     capabilities from the ground up.\n       Please take this message from those on the front line and \n     use it to your best advantage in convincing your colleagues \n     to rally full support for S. 21.\n       Thank you for your commitment and your consideration.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                    Sam A.

Susan M. Collins,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the International \n     Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), I am writing to \n     encourage you to cosponsor S. 21, the Homeland Security Grant \n     Enhancement Act of 2005. The bill, sponsored by Senators \n     Susan Collins and Joseph Lieberman, is designed to reform \n     homeland security grant system in order to make it both more \n     accountable and more effective, thereby increasing the \n     ability of our nation's law enforcement agencies to prevent \n     terrorist attacks before they occur.\n       As you will see in the attached report, ``From Hometown \n     Security to Homeland Security,'' it is the IACP's belief that \n     in our national efforts to develop the capacity to respond \n     and recover from a terrorists' attack, we have failed to \n     focus on the importance of building our capacity to prevent a \n     terrorist attack from occurring in the first place. While \n     planning their attacks, terrorists often live in our \n     communities, travel on our highways, and shop in our stores. \n     As we have discovered in the aftermath of the September 11th \n     attacks, several of the terrorists involved had routine \n     encounters with state and local law enforcement officials in \n     the weeks and months prior to the attack. If state, tribal, \n     and local law enforcement officers are adequately equipped \n     and trained, they can be invaluable assets in efforts to \n     identify and apprehend suspected terrorists before they \n     strike.\n       By authorizing for the first time the Law Enforcement \n     Terrorism Prevention Program (LETPP), S. 21 makes prevention \n     a priority, and partners the federal government with state \n     and local law enforcement. Under the bill, up to twenty-five \n     percent of all authorized homeland security grant funding \n     will be used for law enforcement terrorism prevention \n     purposes, including information sharing, target hardening, \n     threat recognition, terrorist intervention activities, \n     interoperable communication, and overtime expenses occurred \n     in support of federal agencies for increased border security \n     and training.\n       In addition, recognizing how important prevention is, \n     Senators Collins and Lieberman have agreed that they will \n     work to amend S. 21 when it gets to the Senate floor to \n     ensure that a set percentage of homeland security grant \n     dollars are fenced off for LETPP, thus establishing a \n     predictable, significant funding homeland security funding \n     source for this critically-important program. Successful \n     terrorism prevention requires that state, tribal, and local \n     law enforcement across the country continue to receive LETPP \n     funds.\n       To date, the vast majority of federal homeland security \n     efforts have focused on increasing our national capabilities \n     to respond to and recover from a terrorist attack. These \n     efforts are important and must continue. But we must not \n     ignore the need to build the capacity to prevent attacks. S. \n     21 strikes a proper balance, and it has the IACP's support.\n       We therefore urge you to cosponsor S. 21. If you wish to \n     co-sponsor the bill, your staff should contact Jon Nass with \n     the majority staff of the Senate Committee on Homeland \n     Security and Governmental Affairs, and Beth Grossman with the \n     minority staff.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Joseph Estey,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 United Federation\n\n\n                                     of Police Officers, Inc.,\n\n                              Briarcliff Manor, NY, June 25, 2005.\n     Re: S. 21, The Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act of \n         2005\n\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the members of the United \n     Federation of Police Officers, Inc. and the United Federation \n     of Security Officers, Inc., I am writing to ask you to \n     cosponsor S. 21, the Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act \n     of 2005.

Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the International \n     Brotherhood of Police Officers (IBPO), representing 25,000 \n     rank-and-file officers from across the nation as the largest \n     police union voice in the AFL-CIO, I would like to thank you \n     for your introducing S. 21, the ``Homeland Security Grant \n     Enhancement Act of 2005'' and inform you of IBPO's \n     wholehearted endorsement of this legislation. S. 21\n\n[[Page S8122]]\n\n     aims to make Homeland Security grants more effective and \n     efficient. It further, rightly ensures significant support \n     for state and local law enforcement in their work of \n     terrorism prevention.\n       As the devastating loss of innocent life from this \n     morning's terrorist attacks in London England become fully \n     understood, America is again tragically reminded that those \n     who wish to derail our way of life and trumpet subjection \n     over the goals of freedom will be unrelenting in their \n     efforts of tyranny. The vigilant struggle against such aims \n     in alleviated by proper response and prevention, which this \n     legislation rightly works to guarantee.\n       Under S. 21, up to 25 percent of the Homeland Security \n     grant funding will be used for law enforcement terrorism \n     prevention purposes. This will include information sharing, \n     target hardening, threat recognition, terrorist intervention \n     activities, interoperable communication, and overtime \n     expenses occurred in support of federal agencies for \n     increased border security and training.\n       S. 21 will foster the development and enforcement of \n     voluntary consensus standards to improve the safety of first \n     responder equipment. It will also encourage the expansion of \n     the SAVER program, which provides first responders with \n     ``consumer report'' type information on the performance of \n     various brands of equipment relied upon by the law \n     enforcement community.\n       IBPO will work to ensure passage of this important \n     legislation and we thank you for your continued support of \n     our nation's law enforcement officers.\n           Sincerely,\n     Steve Lenkart,\n       Special Assistant to the President, Director of Legislative \n     Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Organization of Black Law Enforcement \n           Executives,\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 11, 2005.\n     Hon.

Joseph Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Collins and Lieberman: The National \n     Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE), an \n     organization of nearly 3,500 primarily African-American law \n     enforcement CEOs and command level officials writes to \n     express its support and appreciation for S.21 the Homeland \n     Security Grant Enhancement Act of 2005.\n       S. 21 allocates up to 25 percent of homeland security grant \n     funding to address the critical training, equipment and human \n     resource needs of state and local law enforcement agencies in \n     a proactive manner that will allow for greatly needed \n     prevention efforts.\n       Our members are on the front lines in the war on terror, \n     and when terror strikes our communities we want them \n     prepared. We want our citizens working in partnership with \n     law enforcement. We want our communities to know that their \n     law enforcement agencies have the necessary resources to \n     minimize death and injury. We need the funding that S. 21 \n     provides, for: planning, training, inter-operable \n     communications, proper protective equipment, information \n     exchange and community based terrorism prevention programs.\n       We believe that S. 21 will provide state and local \n     officials with not only resources, but also a voice in what \n     is needed to best protect their community. We trust that your \n     colleagues will make a positive commitment to those who are \n     sworn to keep the homeland secure.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this issue.\n           Sincerley,\n                                                 Clarence Edwards,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 22, 2005.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     Chair, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Homeland Security and \n         Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Chair and Senator Lieberman: We would like to \n     thank you and the Committee for your attention to state \n     concerns in S. 21, the Homeland Security Grant Enhancement \n     Act of 2005. The bill appropriately acknowledges the need to \n     assure that each state and territory is prepared to prevent, \n     respond to and recover from a terrorist attack. Similarly, we \n     appreciate your recognition that homeland security funding \n     and planning should be coordinated through each Governor's \n     office for maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of \n     homeland security spending and, by extension, the safety of \n     our citizens.\n       After each state and territory receives a base amount, we \n     believe that additional funding be distributed based on an \n     assessment of risks and threats, the calculation of which \n     should be as transparent as possible given the classified \n     nature of the threat information. Risk and threat assessments \n     should be based on all threats, including, but not limited \n     to, ports, borders, agricultural food production and supply, \n     water supply, fuel, and computer systems.\n       The Governors appreciate your recognition and inclusion of \n     state and local officials in determining the essential \n     capabilities for first responders. Our homeland security \n     personnel must be included in determining the levels and \n     competences needed in planning and equipping to prevent, \n     prepare for, and respond to acts of terrorism and other \n     catastrophic events; and must be given the flexibility to set \n     priorities based on local or regional needs, while reaching \n     nationally determined preparedness levels.\n       In addition, Governors support the continuation of separate \n     funding sources for pre-9/11 programs for law enforcement, \n     public health and emergency management; the establishment of \n     a ``one-stop shop'' to assist state and local officials with \n     information regarding homeland security; the flexibility to \n     use homeland security funds among programs for equipment, \n     training, exercises, and planning; and the ability to pay \n     overtime expenses regarding training activities consistent \n     with the goals outlined in the state plan.\n       To effectively protect our states and territories from \n     potential terrorist events, all sectors of government must be \n     part of an integrated plan to prevent, deter, respond to and \n     recover from a terrorist act. For the plan to work, it is \n     essential that it be funded through a predictable and \n     sustainable mechanism both during its development, and in its \n     implementation. A minimum allocation to each state and \n     multiyear authorization levels of funding will provide the \n     predictability necessary to implement statewide plans that \n     will assist Governors in securing our nation.\n       We appreciate the time and attention you have given to some \n     concerns in drafting this measure and look forward to working \n     with you as the bill moves through Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor Ruth Ann Minner,\n       Delaware, Lead Governor on Homeland Security.\n     Governor Mitt Romney,\n       Massachusetts, Lead Governor on Homeland Security.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Emergency Management Association,\n                                     Washington, DC, July 7, 2005.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     Chair, Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \n         Committee, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Homeland Security and Governmental \n         Affairs Committee, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: On behalf of the National Emergency \n     Management Association (NEMA), I would like to thank you for \n     your efforts to enhance the state homeland security grants \n     program in order to build a stronger national emergency \n     response system. NEMA is particularly encouraged by \n     provisions in S. 21 that would continue coordinating federal \n     homeland security funds through the nation's Governors to \n     ensure coordination of funding with priorities identified by \n     the state domestic preparedness plan.\n       We strongly support the inclusion of a state minimum level \n     of funding for capacity building included in S. 21. State and \n     local capacity building will be increasingly important as we \n     deal with the requirements of Homeland Security Presidential \n     Directive 8 on Preparedness. Additionally, we support efforts \n     to increase state and local flexibility on the use of federal \n     homeland security funds. States and localities have unique \n     needs for addressing homeland security preparedness, as \n     identified in their individual state plans. Further, we also \n     support provisions in S. 21 that would eliminate duplicative \n     planning requirements for state and local governments.\n       We are also appreciative of your recognition that a match \n     requirement would be too burdensome for state governments to \n     address, especially as we address matters of national \n     security. Additionally, the provision in your bill that \n     creates a Task Force on Essential Capabilities is critical to \n     ensuring that state and local governments, as well as \n     emergency responders are involved in identifying national \n     guidelines from early in the process of development.\n       Thank you for your contributions to emergency management \n     and homeland security. We truly appreciate the strides that \n     you are making in building upon national capacity to prevent, \n     prepare for, and respond to acts of terrorism, as well as all \n     disasters.\n       We look forward to continuing to work with you in \n     continuing to develop your legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dave Liebersbach,\n       NEMA President, Director, Alaska Division of Homeland \n     Security and Emergency Management.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, there are other issues as well that are \nvery important to comment on. Another one is that the Feinstein-Cornyn \namendment does not include adequate accountability measures. We know \nthat we need tough accountability measures, such as what is included in \nthe Collins-Lieberman amendment. Such\n\n[[Page S8123]]\n\nmeasures, for example, include a requirement for a GAO audit. We would \nalso require in our amendment--in contrast to the Feinstein-Cornyn \namendment--that all spending be tied to achieving essential prevention \nand preparedness goals.\n  This is an important point. We cannot afford to have scarce homeland \nsecurity dollars wasted on leather jackets in the District of Columbia \nor be used to buy air-conditioned garbage trucks for a New Jersey city. \nWe need to make sure the expenditures are wise and appropriate, and the \ntough accountability measures included in the Collins-Lieberman \namendment will do that.\n  I note that the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment is silent on an \nauthorization level, and it doesn't attempt to restore the $900 million \nin cuts since fiscal year 2004. Only our amendment seeks to stop the \nreduction of funding for first responders by authorizing a significant \nlevel of funding. We didn't go overboard. It is a level of funding that \nwas provided in fiscal year 2004; it is $2.9 billion.\n  While we are making progress every year on becoming better prepared \nto prevent or respond to attacks, we are a long way from completing the \ntask. I note that the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment excludes from risk-\nbased funding substantially all the cities that have not received funds \nin the past. This is an important point. While the Feinstein-Cornyn \namendment purports to authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to \ndistribute funds as he sees fit based on risk, in reality it \neffectively restricts the universe of cities that could apply for risk-\nbased funding to those that have received risk-based funding in the \npast. In this sense, it perpetuates the status quo.\n  If a city or region has not received risk-based funding in the past \nand then is faced with a potential threat, for example, due to the \nconstruction of a new chemical facility or another piece of critical \ninfrastructure or because it is hosting a large event, it is out of \nluck; it is ineligible to apply for risk-based funding under the \nFeinstein-Cornyn amendment.\n  Finally, let me show you the impact--on this chart in green and \nwhite--of the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment. The States in green are \nbetter off under the Collins-Lieberman approach--the approach supported \nby the occupant of the chair. It is virtually every State. I also point \nout that those seven states in white don't do badly. They do very well \nbecause we are doubling the amount of money that is risk-based, and we \nare also providing for a reasonable minimum allocation.\n  There it is. I hope my colleagues will consider this. A lot of work \nwent into crafting this amendment. It is a comprehensive approach for a \ngrant program for which we have appropriated billions of dollars, but \nnever authorized. Let's do this right. Let's adopt the bipartisan \nCollins-Lieberman amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am glad to summarize on our side. The \nlast opportunity I had to speak, I said that there is a very \nsignificant difference, which Senator Collins compellingly \ndemonstrated, between the Collins-Lieberman approach to contributing \nthese funds and the Cornyn-Feinstein approach. Of course, I think ours \nis much more fair.\n  The amendment Senator Collins and I are introducing is an amendment \nto the underlying appropriations bill. I want to stress the differences \nbetween our amendment and the underlying bill. The first goes to \nfunding.\n  Here is a sad story in the midst of an increasing concern about \nterrorism. In 2004, the Federal Government appropriated $2.9 billion to \nthe States and localities in homeland security grants. In 2005, that \nnumber was reduced to $2.3 billion. The President's budget for 2006 \nrecommended slightly over $2 billion. The appropriations bill that is \nbefore us now has slightly over $1.9 billion.\n  Senator Collins and I do what we think is the minimum we should be \ndoing to protect our people from the threat of terrorism here at home. \nWe went back to the 2004 level of $2.9 billion. So we increase by $1 \nbillion the amount of money authorized in the underlying bill.\n  Secondly, we have a predictable formula. It is not ad hoc every year. \nIt will tell local law enforcement what they can expect to get.\n  Third, it is a balanced formula. Most of it is based on risk. The \nrest gives a minimum to each State. Why a minimum to each State? \nBecause who knows where the terrorists will strike next? A lot of \nemphasis has been put on risk analysis here, Mr. President. I repeat \nthat risk analysis is an educated guess about what these insane, \ninhumane, hateful terrorists will do next to strike at America.\n  All of America is vulnerable and all of America needs help. That is \nwhy the National Governors Association supports our amendment and most \nlaw enforcement agencies do as well.\n  I thank the Chair and urge support of the amendment. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 54 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank both Senator Collins and \nSenator Lieberman, and particularly Senators Cornyn, Schumer, \nLautenberg, and Martinez, who spoke on behalf of our amendment.\n  Let me make clear, our amendment does not in any way, shape, or form, \nwe believe, interfere with the authorizing committee. The authorizing \ncommittee has the absolute right to set whatever standards it might \nwant to in operations. What we are trying to do is see that this huge \nnew bureaucracy, which has been set up under the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, with all of its robust new intelligence capabilities, is able \nto put forward a plan and have that plan be funded, and that plan will \nbe based on risk and threat and vulnerability. And, in fact, that is \nwhat Secretary Chertoff says in his letter to us, that he and the \nPresident want at least 90 percent of the funds devoted on a risk, \nthreat, and vulnerability basis.\n  He also says they have come up with 36 essential capabilities they \nbelieve are critical in preventing another terrorist attack.\n  I don't think we should go to 60-40. I truly don't believe places \nshould get money just to increase whatever it is they can increase with \ntheir own funds. I really believe that because the money is limited, it \nhas to go to places where there are risks, where we know there are \ntargets, where these targets have figured actionable intelligence that \nhas reached us. So that is what we try to do.\n  Let me summarize once again. Under the underlying bill, the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill, there is $1.339 billion based on risk. \nThe Collins-Lieberman amendment has $1.155 billion based on risk, 60 \npercent of the dollars. It is, in essence, less than the underlying \nbill. What we have tried to do is increase the amount on risk. So under \nthe Feinstein-Cornyn amendment, there is $1.667 billion based on risk. \nThat 87 percent of the available dollars is based on risk.\n  This does not take anybody out of applying. This does not say this \ncity cannot apply or this town cannot apply. What it says is, if you \napply, you are going to be judged on risk, threat, and vulnerability. I \nactually think that when you have limited numbers of dollars, that is \nwhat you have to do.\n  My friend and colleague, the Senator from Connecticut, mentioned the \nBali bombing. And, yes, one might say that is not the capital of \nIndonesia. But, on the other hand, if we look at Baghdad, if we look at \nBeirut, if we look at most of the places where these attacks take \nplace, they are in highly symbolic places where the economic and \nindividual damage is large.\n  When it comes to the United States, many of us fear a large attack, a \nmajor attack. So we have to figure, based on intelligence, where that \nattack is going to come down. Yes, someone might come in through a \nport, or they might come over the southwest border from Mexico. This is \nwhy we are trying to tighten our borders. All of that is true, but we \nhave to figure, if that big attack takes place, where is it going to \ntake place? What is the first response going to be? How fast is it \ngoing to be?\n  The fact is that the British people have done this. They put an \nemphasis on London. Therefore, when those bombs blew up, the response \nwas fast, and the speed of the response was able\n\n[[Page S8124]]\n\nto save lives. So it is a kind of prototype, if you will, of what we \nare trying to achieve here.\n  For once, I am on the same note as the administration. We would like \nto see as much money as possible go to cities based on risk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is what our amendment does. I hope this body \nwill vote yes.\n  Have I used all my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1200\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that amendment No. 1200 be stated by the \nclerk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Corzine, and Mr. Dodd, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1200.\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       For necessary expenses for programs authorized by the \n     Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. \n     2201 et seq.), $100,000,000 shall be available to carry out \n     section 33 (15 U.S.C. 2229) for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2005, to be available immediately upon \n     enactment, and to remain available until September 30, 2007.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the clerk.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be added as \ncosponsors: Messrs. Kennedy, DeWine, Corzine, and Dodd. That is it. \nThat completes the list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a very important \ngroup of men and women and to offer an amendment on their behalf.\n  All across this land, there are men and women who put their lives on \nthe line every day fighting fires, over a million firefighters, and \nover three-fourths of them are volunteers. So when one reads a list of \nthe responsibilities firefighters bear each day, it reads like a litany \nof good public service: fire suppression, wild land firefighting, \nhazardous materials response, code enforcement, fire prevention, \neducation, explosives response, investigation, industrial fire \nprevention and safety, and counterterrorism.\n  So in this high-technology, post-9/11 world, it is not our father's \nfire service. Firefighters require the latest equipment and training to \ncope with changing threats. When our Nation fell under attack on \nSeptember 11, 2001, firefighters raced into buildings, buildings \nengulfed in flames, to save people.\n  Today, over 8,000 firefighters are battling wildfires in eight States \nthat threaten our environment and property. When a house is on fire, \nfirefighters arrive quickly on the scene to rescue people and their \npets. They rush into burning buildings to pull people from the mayhem. \nWhen vehicles spill hazardous, even toxic materials, firefighters clean \nup the spill, thereby protecting nearby populations.\n  They do all of this often without proper equipment, often without \nenough training, often without sufficient staffing but--but, but--they \ndo it anyway. Yes, they do it anyway, and we are all better off for \ntheir bravery.\n  One could go on and on about these heroes, but words are meaningless \nwithout action. That is why I am offering an amendment that will \nrestore funding for the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, a \nprogram that provides equipment and training for these courageous \npublic servants.\n  So I say, restore funding for the Assistance to Firefighters Grant \nProgram because the bill that is before the Senate reduces funding for \nfirefighter grants by $100 million in comparison with last year. There \nis no justification for this cut. Applications for fiscal year 2005 \ntotaled $2.7 billion. With the funding that Congress approved, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security funded less than one-quarter of the \neligible applications.\n  Instead of responding to this significant demand for firefighter \nequipment and training, the administration proposed to cut firefighting \ngrants for fiscal year 2006 from $715 million to $500 million, a \nreduction of 30 percent.\n  Our leader, Homeland Security Subcommittee Chairman Gregg, has done \nall that he can to address the greatest needs in this Homeland Security \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2006. But our bank account--ah, \nnow, there is where the problem is--our bank account was pilfered by a \nbudget proposal from the White House. The White House proposed that the \nAppropriations Committee raise $1.68 billion in fees by raising airline \npassenger fees. The problem is, the Appropriations Committee does not \nhave authority to increase such fees. So what happened? This left the \ncommittee with a deep hole to fill, and as a result, our firefighters \nare $100 million short.\n  I received a letter on June 10 of this year from Chief Robert DiPoli, \nretired, president of the International Association of Fire Chiefs. I \nshall make this letter a part of the Record shortly but not at this \nmoment.\n  In the letter, Chief DiPoli tells me that the Assistance to \nFirefighters Grant Program and the Staffing for Adequate Fire and \nEmergency Response Firefighters, or SAFER, Program are the highest \npriorities of the members of the association. He goes on to state that \nalthough the fire departments are locally funded and operated, they do \nprovide a national service in times of crisis, whether natural or man \nmade.\n  Chief DiPoli has said that the Assistance to Firefighters Grant \nProgram is the greatest program ever to hit the streets because fire \ndepartments cannot fund all of their needs through bean suppers and \nbingo games. I have to agree. I agree.\n  According to a recent study by the U.S. Fire Administration entitled \n``A Needs Assessment of the U.S. Fire Service,'' only 13 percent of the \nfire departments have the equipment and training to handle an incident \ninvolving chemical or biological agents, and half of all fire engines \nare at least 15 years old. Ten percent of fire departments in cities \nwith at least one building over four stories high or higher do not have \nadequate ladders or aerial apparatus. Overall, fire departments in the \nUnited States do not have enough portable radios to equip half of the \nresponders on a shift, and the percentage is even higher in small \ncommunities.\n  So who would want to be a firefighter? I would not want to be, with \nall of that shortage of equipment.\n  One-third of firefighters per shift are not equipped with self-\ncontained breathing apparatus.\n  How about that? This equipment is not cheap. A portable radio costs \n$950. A chemical agent detector costs $8,585. An air pack costs $4,424. \nA defibrillator costs $1,695. Night vision goggles cost $3,210. \nUniforms and other basic gear cost $1,000. So it is no surprise to me \nthat the demand for this program has grown from $2.1 billion for fiscal \nyear 2003 to $2.3 billion in fiscal year 2004 to $2.7 billion for this \nyear.\n  What does surprise me, what disappoints me, is that in the face of \ndocumented needs--now these are not just ``suspicion'' needs or \n``maybe'' needs or ``perhaps'' needs. What does surprise me, what \ndisappoints me, is that in the face of documented needs for better \nequipment and growing demand for this program, the bill cuts the \nfunding for equipping and training our firefighters.\n  I am pleased that the bill provides an increase for the SAFER \nfirefighter hiring program. I commend my chairman, Senator Gregg, for \nhis support for the program. Overall, firefighter grants are cut by \n$100 million. Firefighters in both big cities and small towns across \nthis land face new challenges every day, while maintaining their \ntraditional missions. They should not rely on bean suppers and bingo \ngames to raise the funds to pay for their needs on the job. \nIndividually and collectively, we are safer with properly equipped and \ntrained firefighters. As a Nation, we rely on their capabilities. \nTherefore, Federal dollars are wisely invested in the effort.\n  That brings me to the present moment. I offer this amendment to \nprovide $100 million to the Assistance to\n\n[[Page S8125]]\n\nFirefighters Grant Program. By approving this amendment, the Senate \nwill be answering the call, will be saying, We hear you, we hear what \nyou are saying, will be answering the call from our firefighters.\n  This is a modest amendment. It simply restores firefighter grants \nfunding to the fiscal year 2005 level of $715 million. Even if this \namendment is adopted, the firefighting program will be almost $300 \nmillion below the level authorized by Congress. I wish we could do \nmore, but this is the least we can do.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to adopt the \namendment. I ask unanimous consent that the letter to which I earlier \nreferred from Chief Robert A. DiPoli be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                     International\n\n\n                                   Association of Fire Chiefs,\n\n                                       Fairfax, VA, June 10, 2005.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Homeland Security, Committee \n         on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: As you craft appropriations legislation \n     for Fiscal Year 2006 (FY 2006), I would like to draw your \n     attention to two critical federal grant programs for first \n     responders: the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program \n     (commonly known as the ``FIRE Act'') and the Staffing for \n     Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Firefighters Act of 2003 \n     (commonly known as ``SAFER''). The FIRE Act and SAFER are two \n     of our members' highest priorities, and we ask that you \n     provide full funding for both programs in your bill.\n       Establisbed in 1873, the International Association of Fire \n     Chiefs (IAFC) is a powerful network of more than 12,000 chief \n     fire and emergency officers. Our members are the world's \n     leading experts in firefighting, emergency medical services, \n     terrorism response, hazardous materials spills, natural \n     disasters, search and rescue, and public safety legislation.\n       Though fire departments are locally funded and operated, \n     they provide a national service in times of crisis, whether \n     natural or man-made. That means preparing for everything from \n     hurricanes and wildfires to potential acts of terrorism. \n     America's fire service is ready, willing and able to answer \n     the public call.\n       To do so, however, America's fire service must be \n     adequately staffed, trained and equipped. In December 2002, \n     the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA) and the National Fire \n     Protection Association (NFPA) issued a joint study entitled A \n     Needs Assessment of the U.S. Fire Service. While the federal \n     government has since begun funding state and local homeland \n     security programs, the NFPA believes that the following \n     statistics still reflect the problems that America's fire \n     service faces in meeting basic mission needs. For example:\n       Half of all fire engines are at least 15 years old.\n       On the whole, fire departments do not have enough portable \n     radios to equip more than about half of the emergency \n     responders on a shift.\n       About one-third of firefighters per shift are not equipped \n     with self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), and nearly \n     half of SCBA units are at least 10 years old.\n       An estimated 57,000 firefighters lack personal protective \n     clothing.\n       This report also documented a significant deficiency in \n     firefighter staffing. NFPA Standard 1710 requires that a \n     minimum of four firefighters respond to an event. An alarming \n     number of both volunteer and career fire departments are \n     unable to meet this safety standard:\n       The USFA/NFPA report found that at least 10% of volunteer \n     firefighters serve in fire departments that cannot achieve a \n     standard minimum response to a mid-day house fire.\n       A 2003 report by the NFPA entitled Preparing for Terrorism: \n     Estimated Costs to U.S. Local Fire Departments estimated that \n     more than 50,000 new career firefighters are needed to \n     provide an adequate baseline level of response. To adequately \n     respond to a terrorist attack, the nation would need 75,000 \n     to 85,000 new career firefighters.\n       To help address some of the glaring deficiencies in \n     equipment and training, Congress passed the FIRE Act in 2000. \n     Congressional, administration, and fire service officials \n     alike have called the FIRE Act one of the very best federal \n     grant programs. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) \n     issued a program analysis in 2003, proclaiming that the FIRE \n     Act works. In USDA's own words, the FIRE Act ``has been \n     highly effective in increasing the safety and effectiveness \n     of grant recipients . . . 99 percent of program participants \n     are satisfied with the program's ability to meet the needs of \n     their department . . . [and] 97 percent of program \n     participants reported positive impact on their ability to \n     handle fire and fire-related incidents.''\n       There are good reasons for the FIRE Act's success, and they \n     are the five pillars of the program. First, funds go directly \n     to local fire departments for the purposes intended. There is \n     no opportunity for the money to get bottlenecked at \n     intermediate levels as with so much other first responder \n     funding. Second, grants are awarded on a competitive basis, \n     and not on a predetermined formula. Third, grant applications \n     are peer-reviewed. Fourth, grants are supplemental only; they \n     may not supplant local funds. The fifth and final pillar of \n     the FIRE Act's success is that it requires a co-payment by \n     the community, and thus ensures community ``buy-in'' to the \n     idea of improving the fire service and, therefore, advancing \n     public safety.\n       As with the FIRE Act, SAFER would use a competitive and \n     peer-reviewed application process, and grants would be \n     supplemental only. Grants would be for a four-year period, \n     during which time the federal contribution would phase down \n     from 90 percent to 30 percent. Grantees must commit to \n     retaining new hires for an additional year. At least 20 \n     percent of funds would be reserved for volunteer \n     firefighters.\n       In FY 2005, Congress funded the FIRE Act at $650 million \n     and SAFER at $65 million. We ask that you include funding at \n     the full authorized levels for these two critical programs in \n     your budget plan for the coming year.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely.\n                                    Chief Robert A. DiPoli (Ret.),\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the proposal of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia. It is sincere and well intentioned. Obviously, if \nwe had the extra money, I would do it. Unfortunately, we are working \nwithin budget restraints, and the decision was made within this bill to \nmove dollars from accounts that we felt had either robust funding or a \nfair amount of money still in the pipeline toward accounts where we \nknew we had great needs such as weapons of mass destruction and border \nsecurity.\n  I simply note that in the area of firefighter assistance, since 2003 \nwe have put $2.5 billion into this initiative. In an earlier amendment, \nwe moved money from the equipment funds over to the staffing funds so \nthat we now have $115 million in this budget for staffing initiatives, \nwhich I think is very important because of that $2.5 billion, a very \nsmall percentage has been spent on staffing. As the Senator from West \nVirginia noted, we need to get people up to speed as to training and \nstaffing capabilities.\n  We retain still $500 million for equipment in this bill, which is a \nfair number of dollars. We have approximately $715 million in the \npipeline which has not gone out yet from 2005. Hopefully it will go out \nquickly and soon, but it has not gone out yet. So we know there is a \nfair amount of money in the pipeline.\n  Overall, the funding for firefighters, since 2003, is now over $3 \nbillion, which is a very strong commitment to our firefighter community \nand one which is very appropriate considering, as the Senator from West \nVirginia has so effectively outlined, the risks which these people \nundertake every day for our safety. So we believe that this is a strong \ncommitment to the firefighter community. We would like to do more if we \ncould do it within this budget context, but we cannot. Unfortunately, \nthis amendment would put us outside of the budget guidelines we are \npresently pursuing or subject to.\n  In addition, of course, many of these firefighting departments can \nobtain money from their State plans on top of the earmarked funds which \ngo to the fire departments, the earmarked firefighting funds of $3 \nbillion. There is the rather significant and robust commitment of over \n$14 billion which has been made toward first responder activity \ngenerally, and all of these dollars would theoretically be available to \nfund firefighters.\n  Obviously that is not going to happen, but clearly, if the State plan \ndecides they need more money in their firefighter community, a State \nplan can allocate that money for those firefighter initiatives beyond \nthe money which comes through this $3 billion initiative over the last \n3 years. So this is a strong commitment to the firefighter community, \nand it is an attempt to reorient that commitment so that we focus more \non staffing than on equipment, which we feel has received a \ndisproportionate amount of the funding over the last few years at the \nexpense of the staffing and training activities.\n  That is where we stand in this bill. I believe the bill is reasonable \non this point. At the proper time, obviously a point of order will lie \nagainst this amendment, and I would presume that we would have to make \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n[[Page S8126]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the able chairman yield for a comment?\n  I urge the chairman not to raise the budget point of order at this \ntime. I wonder if perhaps I might implore the chairman to work with \nChairman Cochran to approve using a portion of the fiscal year 2005 \nallocation for our firefighters so that this amendment would not be \nsubject to a point of order. Would the very able chairman be willing to \ngive some consideration to my request in this light?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I know the Senator from West Virginia, the \nsenior Senator in the Senate and the ranking member of the full \ncommittee, has discussed this matter with Senator Cochran. I am \nperfectly willing to pursue that course. I am willing to talk with the \nchairman of the full committee on that point, but I think probably from \nthe chairman's position--I cannot make his case because I have not \ntalked to him about it but suspect his concern is that opens the door \nthat could lead to a large amount of authorization from 2005 being \nused, which would then generate outlays in 2006 which would absorb \nmoney that I suspect the chairman of the full committee feels he is \ngoing to need in order to meet what is a fairly tight budgetary \nrestriction already subjected to the 2006 bill.\n  So I can understand if the chairman of the full committee might be \nreticent to accept such a request, but I will certainly be happy to--\nwell, I will not need to pass it on because I know the Senator from \nWest Virginia has, but I would be happy to sit on the sidelines and \nallow these titans to settle this issue.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator would allow me \nfurther just to say that I thank the chairman for his consideration \nthat he is giving to my request. I might add, firefighters and the \ncommunities they protect ought not to be penalized by inside-the-\nbeltway procedures. We are in this tough position because the White \nHouse proposed that the Appropriations Committee raise $1.68 billion by \nincreasing airline passenger fees.\n  I have gone over this already, but I have to say again, as I said \nearlier, that the Appropriations Committee does not have authority to \nincrease these fees. Therefore, we have been left with a gaping hole in \nresources, and this means that our firefighters are going to suffer a \nfunding cut of $100 million below the fiscal year 2005 level.\n  Some Senators might be surprised to know that the United States has \none of the highest fire death rates in the industrialized world at 13.5 \ndeaths per million population. Fires kill more Americans than all \nnatural disasters combined. In 2003, 3,925 civilians lost their lives \nas a result of fire, and 111 firefighters were killed in duty-related \nincidents. In that same year, 18,125 civilians suffered injuries that \noccurred as a result of fire. So there is a real need for this funding. \nCommunities need the money to buy essential equipment. This is not a \ncase of throwing dollars at fire departments so they can buy \nextravagant items.\n  This is a very modest amendment. Even with adoption of the amendment, \nthe program will still be $300 million below the level authorized by \nCongress. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security was unable to \napprove over $2 billion in eligible applications for equipping and \ntraining our firefighters because of lack of funding. We ought to do \neverything we can to meet this demand for equipment and training for \nour firefighters.\n  The Appropriations Committee currently has $1.058 billion in budget \nauthority available under the 302(b) allocation for fiscal year 2005. \nSo the reason I have asked my beloved chairman, Senator Gregg, to \nconsider discussing this with Chairman Cochran is that if Chairman \nCochran made just $100 million of this unused allocation available to \nhomeland security, this amendment would not be subject to a Budget Act \npoint of order.\n  I again thank my friend, the chairman, for at least saying that he \nwill withhold the point of order, and that he will give this matter \nsome further consideration.\n  Before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators \nLieberman and Mikulski as cosponsors to my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Obviously I am perfectly happy and do not intend to make \nthis point of order until the Senator from West Virginia feels he has \nhad adequate time to discuss this matter with the chairman of the full \ncommittee, and hopefully it can be resolved.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask that prior to the votes which are to \noccur at 5 o'clock on the Feinstein and Collins amendments--I guess the \nCollins amendment will be first--that 4 minutes be equally divided \nbetween the two sides with 2 minutes under the control of Senator \nCollins and 2 minutes under the control of Senator Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I make a point of order a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1162\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I call up an amendment numbered 1162.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. I offer this amendment together with \nSenator Lautenberg and Senator Corzine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry], for himself, \n     Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Corzine, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1162.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require the Inspector General to report to the Congress on \n                               the port)\n\n       On page 100, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       Sec. 519. Within 90 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Department of Homeland Security's Office of \n     Inspector General shall issue a report to the House and \n     Senate Committees on Appropriations, the House and Senate \n     Committees on Homeland Security, and the Senate Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation regarding the steps the \n     Department has taken to comply with the recommendations of \n     the Inspector General's Report on the Port Security Grant \n     Program (OIG-05-10).\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this is a rather straightforward amendment, \nnot very complicated in its scope but important in its scope. I offer \nit together with Senator Lautenberg and Senator Corzine.\n  This is an amendment to require the Department of Homeland Security \ninspector general to issue a report to the Congress within 90 days \ndetailing the steps which that agency is taking to correct what many \npeople feel is amounting now to a dangerous situation of either \noversight or mismanagement.\n  Let me explain that record and why I am concerned about it. Earlier \nthis year, the Department of Homeland Security inspector general issued \nan alarming report. We all ought to be very grateful to the IG for the \nissuance of that report. The IG concluded that 4 years after September \n11, the administration, and I quote the IG, ``has no assurance that our \nports program is protecting the Nation's most critical and vulnerable \ninfrastructure and assets.''\n  The IG concluded that the program's design hinders its ability to \ndirect enough funding to the most vulnerable ports, that available \ncritical infrastructure information was not used during the application \nvetting process, that of the $564 million awarded for port security \ngrants since September 11--that is over almost a 4-year period--only \n$106 million has actually been spent, that 82 out of 86 projects\n\n[[Page S8127]]\n\nfunds for the Office of Domestic Preparedness in 2003 lacked merit, and \nperhaps the most damaging revelation was in 2003 the Transportation \nSecurity Administration, which funded 811 projects, had only one staff \nmember overseeing the entire program.\n  That is a situation, according to the inspector general, that leaves \nAmerica more vulnerable to attack. I know my colleagues and, I am \nconfident, the President do not want to allow this situation to \ncontinue.\n  What is the best thing we can do to avoid that? Obviously, our \npriorities are reflected in how we choose to spend money and what we do \nwith that. When we passed the Maritime Transportation Security Act in \n2002, the Coast Guard estimated then it would cost port authorities, \nthe private sector, and the Government $7.3 billion to implement its \nrequirements. In other words, after the Maritime Transportation \nSecurity Act of 2002, which was in direct response to what we learned \nneeded to be done as a result of September 11, we had a private sector \nand Government estimate of $7.3 billion that needed to be expended in \norder to put America in the place we ought to be for security.\n  To date, only $564 million has been awarded for port security grants \nto help port authorities improve security and comply with the law. And \nof that, the IG report states very clearly only $106 million has \nactually been spent as of last year.\n  If we put that in perspective, according to the GAO, more funding has \nbeen spent on the Capitol Visitor Center than was awarded during the \nfirst four rounds of the port security grant program. If we consider \nthat only $106 million out of $7.3 billion that needed to be spent has \nactually been spent, the reality is we have almost five times the \nfunding going into the Capitol Visitor Center as is going to protect \nthe ports and providing security of our ports in the security program. \nI think that comparison would surprise a lot of Americans.\n  A lot of Members have supported spending a little bit more in the \nsecurity for the ports because we believe it is basic to the national \ndefense of our country. We know al-Qaida and other terrorists target \ntransportation systems. We have seen that since September 11 in Madrid \nand now London. We saw it in 1998 when they bombed the USS Cole as it \nsat docked at a port in Yemen.\n  We also know millions of containers enter our country each year \nuninspected. And we are told by the Department of Homeland Security \nthat all of the radiation screening equipment purchased after September \n11 will have to be replaced because it is ineffective.\n  If a major U.S. port were to be the victim of some kind of container \nattack, that attack could take any number of different forms. There was \na threat in New York City not long after September 11 which was taken \nvery seriously about the potential of a dirty nuclear bomb. There is \nobviously the threat of an actual primitive nuclear weapon of some kind \nbeing used which, primitive as it might be, could still pack the force \nof a bomb that was used at Hiroshima. That would threaten anywhere \nbetween 50,000 and 1 million American lives. It could blow a $300 \nmillion to $1.2 trillion hole in our economy in very short order, not \nto mention what it would do with respect to the energy crisis or to the \nlarger longer term issue of the overall port security and flow of goods \nwe rely on in our international trade. We would have a global economic \ndisaster.\n  No one can predict in any way that we can set up a fail-safe system. \nI am not suggesting that. But I do know from the information we have \ngleaned from any number of people working on this technology that there \nis a significant advance in the state of the art of technology for \nlarge-scale container screening. There are a number of different \ntracking systems that are available to secure containers at the place \nof embarkation and guarantee very inexpensively that they have not been \njimmied or monkeyed with in the course of transit so that we know we \nhave a secure container that is going from point of embarkation to \ndebarkation. There are any number of things we can do and they are very \nimportant to the longer term security of the country and not that \nexpensive in the end.\n\n  In the Senate, Members have debated previously whether we ought to be \ndedicating more funding. I understand the votes are not there at this \nmoment to actually do the funding, but I hope the votes would be there \nto take the IG of Homeland Security seriously. The IG has already \nsuggested the deficiencies that exist now. We ought to be looking to \nthe IG to further help the Senate make a choice about the future.\n  Nearly 4 years after September 11, the administration has yet to \ncomplete a national maritime security plan that was due to Congress \nlast year and they have offered no contingency plans to redirect the \nflow of commerce and keep the economy running in the event there were a \nterrorist attack at a port. All of this is required by Congress now. \nPort authorities, shippers, importers, vessel owners, truckers, and \nother commercial maritime entities have no idea what would be expected \nof them, what the procedures would be if an attack were to occur. We do \nnot even know which Federal agency would be in charge. The Coast Guard \nsays it will be in charge. The FBI says it is in charge.\n  In short, we are unprepared to do all we can do to detect and prevent \nand we are unprepared to deal with the reality if it were to occur. \nTherefore, we understand why the IG was critical of the way this \nprogram has been thus far administered.\n  I ask my colleagues this: If we cannot agree that protecting our \nports at this point deserves more funding--which many Members believe \non its face is obvious it ought to get more than the $106 million that \nhas been spent or the $560 million allocated--but if we cannot agree on \nthat, if we cannot agree it ought to get more funding than the Capitol \nVisitor Center, at least we ought to be able to agree we ought to be \nable to find out from the IG how the money could be spent in a way that \nis not mismanaged and that accomplishes our goals to the best of our \nability with the funds we have.\n  Thus far, the Department of Homeland Security has concurred with 11 \nof the 12 recommendations from the IG, and they have promised reforms. \nBut what we need to know is whether they have been implemented, they \nare going to be implemented, whether there are further steps we ought \nto be taking. We would be remiss in our responsibilities of oversight \nif we did not follow up on the report of the IG detailing what the \nDepartment has done to fix the problems.\n  That IG report was released in January. Since then there have been no \ncongressional hearings on the issue, and no formal report has been \ndelivered to Congress. We ought to ask for one. It is important to get \nthis information since the Office of State and Local Government \nCoordination and Preparedness, which inherited the program, is going to \nconduct a fifth round of grants beginning in September. So we go into a \nfifth round of grants without understanding what the urgency and \npriorities are according to the goals set out by the Congress itself.\n  My amendment is very simple: It requires the inspector general to \nissue another report so that Congress knows the exact state of the \nprogram now and performs the appropriate level of congressional \noversight and helps us to improve our port security. I hope this would \nbe an amendment we could accept. It should not be that controversial \nand does not provide for the expenditure of money, but provides for \ncongressional oversight and accountability that is so important to \ndoing our job to improve the security of our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Let me join with the Senator from Massachusetts on his \nconcern. It is a very important and correctly stated concern about the \nway these funds are being distributed and the slowness with which these \nfunds are coming out.\n  In this bill we have put forward additional funding for port \nsecurity. We consider that a priority, an area of significant threat. \nWe bumped up the amount of money for port security over what the \nPresident requested. We put in the report language which specifically \nsays on page 11 that we believe the Department can expedite awards for \nHomeland Security grants--including a series of them, port security--\nand the committee directs the Department to submit a report to the \ncommittee on\n\n[[Page S8128]]\n\nFebruary 18, 2006, that lays out a schedule for the award of grant \nfunds made available by this act as well as any prior year funds that \nremain obligated. If any grant funds are awarded after March 30, 2006, \nthe Department should provide a detailed explanation for the delay.\n  It is a legitimate concern and something the committee has focused \non. The Senator's proposal is constructive to the effort. We would be \nhappy to accept it by unanimous consent. I ask unanimous consent the \namendment of the Senator from Massachusetts be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1162) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY. I appreciate the chairman accepting that and I appreciate \nthe efforts of the committee. I know the committee put in additional \nmoney, about $200 million, and that is important funding.\n  Again, I restate, we are looking at a $7.3 billion problem. That is a \nstep forward. I am very grateful to the chairman for being willing to \ntry to find this report. I hope the Department itself will respond \naccordingly to the language which the committee has appropriately put \nin here to try to get this in scope. We have been talking about this \nfor 4 years now and most people would agree, in the major ports--\nCalifornia, New Jersey, New York, Miami, various places--this is a \nmajor concern. The communities are increasingly feeling ill-equipped to \nrespond appropriately.\n  I thank the Chair for his response.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendment be set \naside.\n  Mr. President, I call up amendments Nos. 1112 and 1113 and ask for \ntheir consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?

Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the \nfiscal year 2006 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act to \nensure that the men and women on the frontlines of a terrorist attack \non the United States are not unduly jeopardized by budget cuts. I am \njoined by my colleagues, Senators Lieberman, Harkin, Obama, Murray, \nCorzine, Lautenberg, Bingaman, Durbin, and Schumer.\n  Our amendment is simple. It would restore first responder funding to \nfiscal year 2005 levels.\n  Last week, the world witnessed a horrific attack on the United \nKingdom. My heartfelt sympathy goes out to the people who have been \naffected by this atrocity. As we reflect on this tragedy, we should \nremember the images of police, firefighters, and emergency medical \npersonnel who ran into the underground tunnels and streets as others \nwere evacuated. These images are a reminder that we should not abandon \nAmerica's first responders by cutting their funding.\n  The Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee had a difficult job \nthis year, and I would like to thank the chairman and ranking member \nfor their hard work. However, I disagree with their choice to reduce \nfirst responder funding below fiscal year 2005 appropriated levels and \nin one case even below the President's fiscal year 2006 budget request.\n  Our amendment would restore funding by adding a total of $587 million \nto the Homeland Security First Responder Grant Program. The majority, \n$467 million, would go to State and local grants which include the \nState Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Area Security \nInitiative. It would also direct $20 million to the Metropolitan \nMedical Response System and $10 million to the Assistance to \nFirefighters Grant Program, commonly known as the FIRE Act grants.\n  Our amendment does not address the other first responder grant \nprograms that are funded at or above last year's level.\n  Let me be clear, Mr. President. This amendment does not seek to \nincrease funding over what has already been spent in fiscal year 2005. \nWe simply are seeking to prevent a reduction in appropriations for \nfirst responder grants.\n  This country cannot afford to take resources away from its first \nresponders at a time when we rely on them now more than ever. In 2003, \nan independent task force sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations \nestimated that Federal funding for first responders would fall $98.4 \nbillion short of actual needs between 2004 and 2008. And that figure \nwas based on fiscal year 2004 funding levels remaining constant. If \nCongress approves the level of funding proposed in the Senate version \nof H.R. 2360, Federal funding will have decreased by over $592 million \nfrom the fiscal year 2004 numbers the CFR task force used for their \ncalculations.\n  The First Response Coalition, a nonprofit organization, reworked CFR \ncalculations using the President's fiscal year 2006 budget proposal and \nfound the gap would grow to $100.2 billion. The President's budget \nproposal allocates more funding to first responders than the bill we \nare considering today.\n  In my home State of Hawaii, this discrepancy between needs and \nfunding will be acutely felt as State emergency responders must be \nself-sufficient because there are no neighboring States to rely upon \nfor assistance. Hawaii State civil defense must assume that aid from \nthe mainland will not arrive for at least 72 hours and, in some cases, \nsuch as during a hurricane, for 7 days. In addition, the State is \nresponsible for not only protecting its own citizens but also the \napproximately 1.4 million tourists and U.S. servicemembers who are in \nHawaii on any given day.\n  The Federal Government is increasingly asking States and localities \nto bear more of the brunt of the war on terror. We ask our first \nresponders to run into a burning building not knowing whether they will \nfind a small fire or a lethal chemical agent. We ask them to understand \nand execute on a moment's notice the different response protocols for a \nradiological, biological or chemical attack. We ask this of our first \nresponders, in addition to carrying out their traditional \nresponsibilities. With all we ask of our first responders, it is not \ntoo much for them to ask us for a constant level of support and \nfunding.\n  Last month, I joined with Senators Collins, Lieberman, and Levin to \nintroduce the Interoperable Communications for First Responders Act \nwhich would create a grant program dedicated to interoperability \nfunding. We were forced to do this because there has not been enough \nfunding in the existing first responder programs to meet the country's \nconsiderable interoperable communication needs. How can we justify \ncutting the funding even more?\n  This is not a fiscally irresponsible amendment. I am not proposing an \nincrease in spending, simply a restoration of last year's funding.\n  Much progress has been made since the tragic attacks of September 11. \nWe\n\n[[Page S8129]]\n\nshould not undo this progress. We must build upon it. I ask my \ncolleagues to consider carefully the needs of the first responders in \ntheir communities, and I urge support for this important amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Dayton and \nSalazar be added as cosponsors to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from North Dakota \nwants to ask for 2 or 3 minutes to offer an amendment. I understand we \nare going to have 4 minutes, equally divided, before we begin the vote \non the Collins and Feinstein amendments. So I would ask unanimous \nconsent that I be allowed to speak for about a minute and a half, in \nresponse to the Senator from Hawaii, that we then go to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota for the purpose of calling up an amendment, speaking \nfor 2 or 3 minutes, and then that we go into the 4-minute presentation \nprior to the vote and the votes occur after that. After the first vote, \nwhich will be the Collins vote, I would ask there be, by unanimous \nconsent, 2 minutes equally divided, with 1 minute controlled by the \nSenator from California and 1 minute by the Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the amendment from the Senator from Hawaii \nI know is well-intentioned, but we are working within a budget, and the \npurpose of our bill was to focus our energies on areas where we saw \nhighest threat, and, yes, we did reduce the amount of first responder \nfunds and take those monies and move them onto the effort to try to \nfight weapons of mass destruction and to put more people and more \nemphasis on protecting our borders. That is where the money is moved, \nbut we kept $1.9 billion in the first responder funds, and that means \nthat since 2003 there will have been $13 billion put into first \nresponder funds.\n  To try to put this into perspective, this money has been flowing so \nfast into these accounts that there remains, from 2004 and 2005 \nappropriations, almost--or over--$7 billion of unspent money, I mean \nmoney that is in the pipeline that simply cannot be handled efficiently \nyet. So we are putting another $1.9 billion under this bill on top of \nthat $7 billion. And we believe that that is reasonable, in light of \nthe needs on the borders, to put more people on the borders. That is \nwhy we made this decision. The amendments of the Senator from Hawaii, \nalthough well-intentioned, are subject to a point of order, and we will \nmake a point of order at the proper time.\n  At this point, I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1111\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1111 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1111.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds appropriated under this Act to \npromulgate the regulations to implement the plan developed pursuant to \n        section 7209(b) of the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds appropriated under this Act may \n     be used to promulgate regulations to implement the plan \n     developed pursuant to section 7209(b) of the 9/11 Commission \n     Implementation Act of 2004 (8 U.S.C. 1185 note) to require \n     United States citizens to present a passport or other \n     documents upon entry into the United States from Canada.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know the manager of the bill and the \nranking member are asking for amendments to be offered and considered. \nI wanted to do that.\n  Very quickly, this amendment deals with the issue of whether to \nrequire passports for everyone entering and leaving this country at our \nborders.\n  We have a common border with the country of Canada, over 4,000 miles. \nIn my State of North Dakota, we have people moving back and forth \nacross the border all the time. We have people who farm on both sides \nof the border, people with families on both sides of the border. At the \nPembina port of entry, we have 100,000 people a month crossing the \nborder.\n  To require a passport for that is, in my judgment, far too \nburdensome. A passport now costs a $55 fee, a $12 security surcharge, \nand a $30 execution charge--a total of $97 to obtain a passport.\n  I believe very strongly we do need border security, no question about \nthat. That is important. But I think, especially with respect to day \ntravel and common tourist and business practices across, for example, \nthe United States-Canadian border, with which I am familiar, to require \na passport for moving across that border is enormously burdensome. I \nhope we will not do that.\n  The President, when asked about it, spoke to the American Society of \nNewspaper Editors and said: When I first read that in the newspaper, \nabout the need to have passports particularly for day crossing--he is \ntalking about the border--I said, what's going on here? I thought there \nwas a better way to expedite the whole flow of traffic and people.\n  I think the President is right, and I know that since the President \nsaid that, the folks in Homeland Security have been reconsidering this \nissue, but I am very worried that they still may proceed with their \nregulations at some point, and I hope this Congress would weigh in on \nthe question of whether we think everyone who moves back and forth \nacross the Canadian border should have a passport. I don't believe the \nrequirement for a passport is practical. I think it is overly \nburdensome. I believe that we ought to send that message to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  I am not suggesting we don't care about security. We do. We care \ndeeply about border security. But there must be other ways in which we \ncan accomplish that task. And so my amendment will address that.\n  I thank my colleague from New Hampshire for giving me the \nopportunity, just a few minutes, to at least get the amendment offered, \nto be talking about it, and have it considered.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 4 minutes evenly divided before votes in respect to the \nCollins and Feinstein amendments.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1142\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, during the past 3 years, we have \nappropriated more than $8 billion in homeland security grants, despite \nthe fact that this program has never been properly authorized. The \nHomeland Security Committee has spent the last 3 years working on an \nauthorization bill. We have produced a carefully crafted, balanced bill \nthat is incorporated in the Collins-Lieberman amendment.\n  This debate is about establishing a formula that provides a \npredictable level of funding scaled to reflect the different needs of \nlarge and small States that will allow all States to achieve essential \npreparedness and prevention capabilities. We break the mold that \nprovides a set baseline amount to each State regardless of size and \nneeds. This debate is also about distributing more funds based on risk.\n  Let's put this important issue in perspective. Compared to last year, \nour amendment would double the amount of funds distributed based on \nrisk. Last year only 37 percent of funds appropriated for homeland \nsecurity grants were allocated based on risk. Under our amendment, more \nthan 70 percent of the funds would be distributed based on risk or \nfactors used now by the Department of Homeland Security to determine \nrisk. That is a lot of discretion that we are giving to the Secretary.\n  I want to address the CRS memo solicited by Senator Lautenberg that \nwas discussed this morning. It has been\n\n[[Page S8130]]\n\nused by our opponents to suggest that only 60 percent is distributed \nbased on risk. In fact, it is more than 70 percent, as is the \nunderlying bill. Tellingly, in a memorandum issued just today, CRS \ncategorizes the sliding scale allocation as risk based.\n  This is a balanced approach. I urge my colleagues to vote for the \nCollins-Lieberman amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID.

There is now scheduled to be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided, to be followed by a vote on the \nFeinstein amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, despite this vote, I wish to make a \npoint. The administration has said in a letter dated today from \nSecretary Chertoff that their position is that 90 percent of homeland \nsecurity funds should be distributed on the basis of risk. The \nSecretary goes on to say that they have 36 essential capabilities they \nneed to carry out, and the way to do that is based on risk.\n  Here are the numbers: In the underlying appropriations bill, 70 \npercent is based on risk, $1.339 billion. Under Collins-Lieberman, less \nthan 70 percent goes to risk. It is cut back to 60 percent, $1.155 \nbillion. Under the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment, $1.667 billion is based \non risk, or 87 percent. It is the closest number to the \nadministration's letter dealing with this issue.\n  I have a very hard time substituting pork for risk. I just was \nreading some of the intelligence. Let there be no doubt that not every \nState is equal in terms of target. We have set up a huge agency of 22 \ndepartments. We have given them risk analysis. We have given them \nintelligence. We have broken down the wall between FBI and CIA. Why? \nBecause there is a real threat, and money should be accorded based on \nthat threat, not based on pork.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, we all want more funding to be \ndistributed on risk. The Collins-Lieberman amendment which was just \nadopted more than doubles the amount of money allocated based on risk. \nRisk is not a science. We are giving unprecedented authority to the \nSecretary of Homeland Security, that there is no precedent for in any \ngrant program of this size.\n  The fact is, under the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment, every State would \nlose at least $8 million in guaranteed funding. Some States would lose \ntens of millions of dollars. Even taking into account how funds have \nhistorically been distributed based on risk, 43 States lose money under \nthe Feinstein-Cornyn amendment verses the Collins-Lieberman amendment. \nWe have to recognize that every State has vulnerabilities and needs to \nbe brought up to a baseline ability to prepare and prevent for \nterrorist attacks. The Collins-Lieberman amendment was endorsed by many \nlaw enforcement groups that do not support this approach.\n  I urge opposition to the Feinstein-Cornyn amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the yeas and yeas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1215, as modified. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McConnell.

STRENGTHENING SECURITY AT NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) A taped interview shown on al-Jazeera television on \n     September 10, 2002, included a statement that al Qaeda \n     initially planned to include a nuclear power plant in its \n     2001 attacks on the United States.\n       (2) In 2001, David Kyd of the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency said that if a fully fueled large jetliner hit a \n     nuclear reactor ``then the containment could be breached and \n     the cooling system of the reactor could be impaired to the \n     point where radioactivity might well be set free.''\n       (3) Dr. Edwin Lyman, a physicist and former scientific \n     director of the Nuclear Control Institute has noted that if a \n     nuclear power plant were hit by a large commercial passenger \n     jet, ``significant release of radiation into the environment \n     is a very real one.''\n       (4) Operating nuclear reactors contain large amounts of \n     radioactive fission products that, if dispersed, could pose a \n     direct radiation hazard, contaminate soil and vegetation, and \n     be ingested by humans and animals.\n       (5) According to the organization Three Mile Island Alert, \n     a nuclear power plant houses more than 1,000 times the \n     radiation that would be released in an atomic bomb blast, and \n     the magnitude of a single terrorist attack on a nuclear power \n     plant could cause over 100,000 deaths.\n       (6) The federal government has offered Governors potassium \n     iodide pills to distribute to people living near nuclear \n     power plants in case of an attack, but no legislation has \n     passed to protect against an attack in the first place.\n       (7) In the 108th Congress, the Senate Environment and \n     Public Works Committee approved bipartisan legislation to \n     improve nuclear plant security. No action was taken by the \n     full Senate.\n       (8) Last month, the Senate Environment and Public Works \n     Committee again approved bipartisan legislation to improve \n     nuclear plant security.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Congress should pass legislation to assess terrorist \n     threats at each nuclear power plant and to establish new \n     federal standards to protect against those threats.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1217\n\n(Purpose: To provide funding for interoperable communications equipment \n                                grants)\n\n       On page 77, line 18, strike ``$2,694,300,000'' and insert \n     ``7,694,300,000''.\n       On page 79, line 22, strike the colon and insert a period.\n       On page 79, between lines 22 and 23, insert the following:\n       (7) $5,000,000,000 for interoperable communications \n     equipment grants: Provided, That such amount is designated as \n     an emergency requirement pursuant to section 402 of H.

SCHULTZ\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \noffer my congratulations and gratitude to an extraordinary Iowan. LTG \nRoger C. Schultz is stepping down from his distinguished position as \nDirector of the Army National Guard for the National Guard Bureau. He \nassumed this position in 1998 and has served for 7 years, the longest \nanyone has held this title. I would like to take this opportunity to \nshow Lieutenant General Schultz the appreciation that the country, the \nState of Iowa, and myself personally, have for his extensive commitment \nto the Army National Guard. He joined the Iowa Army National Guard in \n1963, and from there he began a career that lasted 42 years.\n  Lieutenant General Schultz has had an extensive career. In his most \nrecent position as director, he was responsible for the formulation, \ndevelopment, and implementation of all programs and policies affecting \nthe Army National Guard. Previously, he served as Deputy Director for \nMilitary Support on the Department of the Army Staff, where he was \nresponsible for coordinating all Department of Defense military support \nto civilian authorities, which included disaster relief. While \nstationed with the Iowa Army National Guard, he was in Command of the \n2nd Brigade, 34th Division and served as the Army Guard Chief of Staff \nand Deputy Adjutant General. General Schultz also received several \nawards and recognitions for his exemplary service. He is honored with \nthe Distinguished Service Medal, Silver Star, Legion of Merit with Oak \nLeaf Cluster, Bronze Star, Purple Heart with Oak Leaf Cluster, \nMeritorious Service Medal with Two Oak Leaf Clusters, Department of the \nArmy Staff Badge, Army Superior Unit Award, Humanitarian Service Award, \nthe Combat Infantry Badge for service in the Republic of Vietnam, and \nmany others.\n  General Schultz was born in LeMars, IA and enlisted when he was 18 \nyears old. He was a student at officer candidate school at the Iowa \nMilitary Academy. Following these studies, he was commissioned in 1967 \nas an infantry officer. Shortly thereafter, he was sent to serve his \ncountry in the Republic of Vietnam with the 25th Infantry Division. \nDuring his several assignments, he also earned a bachelor's degree in \nmanagement from Upper Iowa University and a Masters degree in public \nadministration from Shippensburg State University in Pennsylvania. He \nalso attended Army War College.\n  I share my appreciation for the general with not only his neighbors \nin the State of Iowa but the entire country. He has proven himself to \nbe versatile and fully capable of accepting and mastering the tasks \nplaced before him. His enduring commitment to the safety of Americans \nis cause for admiration.\n  Again, I offer my congratulations and sincere appreciation to LTG \nRoger Schultz for his remarkable achievements in the Army National \nGuard. He has continually provided an invaluable service to his country \nand I thank him for his dedication and devotion to Iowa and to America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/12/senate-section/article/S8131-4", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8131-S8132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     COMMENDING JOE KELLY McCUTCHEN\n\n Mr. ISAKSON.

Mr. President, during the July 4th recess, I \ntraveled to Iraq and Jordan to evaluate the progress of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my trip report \nbe entered into the Record at this point.\n\n       I spent two days--July 5 and 6--in Iraq and the morning of \n     July 7 in Jordan. I believe mine was the first Congressional \n     delegation to overnight in Iraq since the start of the war. \n     It was also my fifth post-war trip to Iraq.\n       In Iraq, I spent a day and a half in Baghdad meeting with \n     U.S. Embassy and military personnel and with Members of the \n     Government of Iraq, including the President and Prime \n     Minister. Additionally, I met with numerous Sunni Arabs, \n     including officials of the Government, a member of the Iraqi \n     National Assembly, and representatives of political groups, \n     including some who had just been added to the Assembly's \n     constitutional drafting committee. I also met with the \n     Chairman of the constitutional drafting committee and the UN \n     Special Representative, whose staff is advising on the \n     drafting of the constitution.\n       I spent the remainder of the second day in Iraq in Fallujah \n     in the Sunni Triangle, where I was able to meet with a number \n     of U.S. servicemen and women, and was privileged to have \n     dinner with ten Marine Corps and Navy personnel from \n     Michigan.\n       Once again, I was deeply impressed by the dedication and \n     professionalism of our servicemen and women and with their \n     very high morale. I told them that the Congress and the \n     American people are proud of them and back them one hundred \n     percent, regardless of differing positions on the \n     Administration's policies.\n       One purpose of my trip was to gauge the level of the \n     insurgency. I found strong support for the recent assessment \n     of General Abizaid, the regional U.S. Commander, that the \n     insurgency is not weakening and that the flow of foreign \n     jihadists into Iraq has increased. I found no support for \n     Vice President Cheney's view that the insurgency is in its \n     ``last throes.''\n       Another purpose of my trip was to assess the current and \n     potential level of participation of the Sunni Arabs in the \n     political and constitutional drafting processes, including \n     the likelihood that the Iraqi constitution would be completed \n     by August 15th (and therefore not needing to utilize the one \n     six month extension allowed under Iraqi law). I was surprised \n     by the optimism of most Iraqis that the constitution would be \n     agreed by August 15th and particularly that the Sunni Arab \n     participants (recently increased by 15) would likely be \n     supportive of the draft. If that is true, that will pave the \n     way for a referendum on the draft constitution on October \n     15th and a national election on December 15th.\n       If this optimism is not borne out, however, a way must be \n     found to bring pressure to bear on the parties to make the \n     reasonable compromises that will be required for agreement on \n     the constitution. Everyone whom I met on this trip advised \n     that none of the Iraqis--not just Shia and Kurd, but also \n     Sunni Arab--want U.S. forces to leave now. They want our \n     forces to be less visible and Iraqi security forces to be \n     more visible, but they want us to stay for now.\n       Given that fact and given the consensus that a political \n     solution is necessary if there is any prospect of defeating \n     the insurgency, we need to make clear to the Iraqis that if \n     they are unable to reach agreement on the constitution, we \n     will reconsider our presence in Iraq and that all options \n     will be on the table, including withdrawal. (The logic of \n     that position is that if a political settlement is essential \n     if there is a chance of lessening the insurgency, that \n     without a political settlement the insurgency is not going to \n     be defeated even with our presence.)\n       I focused on meeting with members of the Sunni Arab \n     community, as I believe they are the key to a successful \n     political process in Iraq. Most of them realize it was a \n     mistake for them not to have participated in the January \n     elections and they want to participate in the drafting of a \n     constitution and in the follow-on elections. At the same \n     time, the so-called former regime element that is fueling the \n     insurgency in an attempt to block a political settlement \n     comes from the Sunni Arab community, and too many members of \n     that community sympathize with and provide support for the \n     insurgents.\n       There are a number of issues that will need to be resolved \n     if a draft constitution is to be agreed upon by August 15th. \n     These include the role of Islam; the form of the government \n     (i.e. parliamentary or presidential); the relationship \n     between the national government and the provinces and the \n     degree to which natural resources will belong to the \n     provinces or the national government; and the degree of \n     autonomy that will reside in the regions. Since the oil \n     resources of Iraq are located in the Shia south and the \n     Kurdish north, these are issues that are extremely important \n     to the Sunni Arabs, whose area lacks oil resources.\n       The decision of the National Assembly to accept 15 Sunni \n     Arabs as members of the constitutional drafting committee, \n     despite the Sunni Arabs lack of participation in the \n     election, hopefully augurs well for the kind of compromises \n     that will need to be made by all three of the main political \n     factions for a draft constitution to be reached.\n       Although the successful drafting of a constitution, with \n     the active participation of the Sunni Arab community, is very \n     important and may help create an environment within which the \n     insurgency can be dramatically reduced, it will not \n     automatically achieve that result. The Sunni Arabs with whom \n     we met, although from different groups, complained of the \n     extended detention of their brethren, the perceived focus of \n     raids by Coalition and Iraqi security forces on their \n     community, the forced unemployment of hundreds of thousands \n     of Sunni Arabs fired in the de-Baathification process and \n     denied the pensions to which they contributed. They expressed \n     a preference for the U.S. military to leave the cities and to \n     locate on bases removed from populated areas, and the need \n     for at least a rough estimate as to when Coalition forces \n     will be withdrawn.\n       I explored in depth the training and equipping of Iraqi \n     security forces. It is clear that a great deal of time was \n     wasted during the existence of the Coalition Provisional \n     Authority or CPA. While it appears that progress is being \n     made now, it is moving slowly and will take quite some time \n     before Iraqis will be capable of dealing with the insurgency \n     on their own.\n       In his recent speech to the nation on Iraq, President Bush \n     said, with respect to the training and equipping of Iraqi \n     security forces, that ``as Iraqis stand up, we will stand \n     down.'' General Casey, the overall commander on the ground in \n     Iraq, acknowledged to me that he is working on a plan whereby \n     units of the Iraqi security forces would first partner with \n     Coalition military units and gradually take the lead in \n     military operations, then will assume control in selected \n     provinces, and gradually assume control more broadly until \n     they ultimately can control the entire country. Part of that \n     plan provides for Coalition forces to be reduced as Iraqi \n     security forces become more and more capable.\n       I also spoke to General Casey and to Iraqi officials about \n     the need for greater progress in the review of Iraqis \n     detained by Coalition or Iraqi forces and the need to either \n     release or try them. While some progress has been made in \n     this area, it has been too slow in coming and much more must \n     be done and done quickly.\n       In Jordan, I was pleased to be able to meet with King \n     Abdullah. King Abdullah had just finished presiding over the \n     closing session of a three day International Islamic \n     Conference that he had organized. This visionary and \n     critically important Conference was attended by top Muslim \n     authorities from around the globe. It was aimed at finding \n     common principles among various Muslim schools of thought and \n     isolating and deligitimatizing those who preach violence in \n     the name of Islam.\n       Two things need to happen within the next 40 days to \n     improve chances of a successful outcome in Iraq.\n       A draft of the Iraqi constitution needs to be agreed and \n     sent to the National Assembly by the constitutional committee \n     no later than August 15--the timetable the Iraqis have set \n     for themselves. All of the people with whom I spoke--whether \n     Sunni, Shia, or Kurd--agree that that date should and can be \n     met.\n       There also needs to be a more detailed road map for drawing \n     down U.S. forces. General Casey, commander of the multi-\n     national forces in Iraq, has said that it should be possible \n     for a fairly significant reduction in U.S. force levels in \n     the first few months of next year. But what is so far missing \n     are the decision criteria for determining when that reduction \n     can begin so that presidential rhetoric and statements of \n     intent are turned into a credible and reassuring roadmap for \n     Iraqis taking ownership of the risks and responsibility for \n     their own security and survival.\n       After much prodding by Congress, the Administration has \n     finally created and implemented a capability assessment \n     system for determining the readiness of Iraqi military and \n     police units to conduct counter-insurgency operations--\n     whether alongside of Coalition units, or in the lead but with \n     Coalition support, or independently. Now there must be a \n     detailed plan, mutually agreed to by the Coalition and \n     Iraqis, with measurable benchmarks to determine progress, and \n     with a reasonable estimate of the time required to reach \n     those benchmarks. Only in this way can we know the \n     approximate number of Iraqi units that need to be capable \n     of counterinsurgency operations so that coalition units \n     can first withdraw from cities and other visible locations \n     and begin a withdrawal from the country as a whole.\n       It is essential that such a plan be promptly agreed to and \n     implemented, and its outline publicly announced, so as to \n     provide reassurance to the American public which is \n     expressing growing concern about simply being told we need to \n     ``stay the course'' in Iraq, and to the Iraqi public which \n     needs to see that U.S. forces will not be in their country \n     indefinitely. Both publics must see that the President's \n     statement that ``as the Iraqis stand up, we will stand down'' \n     is not just a bumper sticker slogan.\n       Secretary Rice has said that we will be in Iraq as long as \n     we are needed. Without adopting and implementing a measured \n     and credible plan, coalition forces could be ``needed'' for \n     an indeterminate time. Without such a plan, Iraqis may never \n     assume the\n\n[[Page S8133]]\n\n     responsibility for taking back their country from the \n     insurgents and taking the risks and making the compromises \n     necessary to chart their own destiny.\n       Finally, while I was surprised by the high level of \n     optimism about the August 15 date being met for agreement on \n     a draft Iraqi constitution, I was given a sobering assessment \n     about the current and future strength of the insurgency.\n       Even if the timetable for adopting a constitution is met, \n     and even if a plan is agreed upon for phasing in capable \n     Iraqi military forces to take over responsibility for \n     security so U.S. forces in Iraq can simultaneously be \n     reduced, there is still great uncertainty that the insurgency \n     will be eliminated or lessened in the near term.\n       But, while taking those steps doesn't guarantee success, \n     they could help change the dynamic in Iraq and provide the \n     only way a poorly thought through and mistake ridden U.S. \n     policy in Iraq can still reach a successful \n     conclusion.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/12/senate-section/article/S8133-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JOHN H. JOHNSON\n\n   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \na renowned publisher, entrepreneur, businessman, humanitarian and an \noutstanding Arkansan, Mr. John Harold Johnson.\n  John H. Johnson, a native of Arkansas City, AR, was born on January \n19, 1918, to Leroy and Gertrude Johnson. Over 60 years ago, John H. \nJohnson founded and became owner of the largest black-owned publishing \ncompany in the world, Johnson Publishing Company, Inc., located in \nChicago, IL. From this company, the Negro Digest, Ebony, Jet and other \nmagazines and periodicals were created. Ebony and Jet magazines enabled \nJohnson to have an impact on Civil Rights in America, Entertainment, \nSports and the Nation's culture as a whole. These two magazines \ncontinue to successfully reflect and comment on the African-American \nexperience. Johnson has also enjoyed success in the cosmetic industry \nwith the establishment of Fashion Fair Cosmetics.\n  In 1999, the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff and Arkansas City, \nAR, formed an alliance for the creation of the John H. Johnson Delta \nCultural and Entrepreneurial Learning Center. The Cultural and \nEntrepreneurial Learning Center will provide accommodations in Arkansas \nCity for classroom and educational activities that originate at the \nUniversity of Arkansas at Pine Bluff.\n  On Saturday, May 21, 2005, the John H. Johnson Cultural and Education \nMuseum was dedicated in Johnson's hometown. Using materials from the \noriginal, the museum was constructed as a replica of Johnson's boyhood \nhome. It will now provide valuable insight into his life and origin \nwhile bringing tourism dollars to his native home of Arkansas City and \nthe surrounding area. His life is an inspirational American story \nwhere, rising from poverty with a strong sense of self, he overcame \nadversity and became one of the country's most successful \nentrepreneurs.

Mr. President, I ask that this letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 30, 2005.\n     IBM Boulder,\n     Diagonal Highway,\n     Boulder, CO.\n       Dear Friends, It is with great pleasure that I am able to \n     share in your celebration of IBM Boulder's 40th Anniversary \n     here at this majestic site next to the Rocky Mountains. IBM's \n     commitment to this facility, and to the region, serves as a \n     testament to its central role in the development of the \n     technology industry here in Colorado.\n       When IBM Boulder was founded in 1965, this region was still \n     mostly agricultural. By choosing to locate amongst \n     undisturbed open space and farmland, IBM demonstrated a bold \n     vision for the symbiotic potential of the technology industry \n     with the natural beauty of our State. I also respect and \n     admire how the workers at this facility have survived the ebb \n     and flow of the industry over the past 40 years. They have \n     shifted from manufacturing computer parts in the early years \n     to housing and supporting 20 different IBM divisions that now \n     develop printing systems, design engineering, software and \n     global services. And IBM's commitment to the community \n     through the annual Employee Charitable Contribution Campaign \n     has left a lasting mark on local health and human service \n     agencies that sets a tone for others to emulate.\n       Thank you for the honor of joining in your anniversary \n     celebration. As your newest United States Senator, I am proud \n     of the rich economic diversity of our State. You should be \n     proud of your significant contributions to the region and to \n     Colorado.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Ken Salazar,\n     U.S. Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/12/senate-section/article/S8133-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/12/senate-section/article/S8133-4", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/12/senate-section/article/S8133-5", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:19 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      Mr. CORZINE:\n  S. 1381. A bill to require the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to \nconsider certain criteria in relicensing nuclear facilities, and to \nprovide for an independent assessment of the Oyster Creek Nuclear \nGenerating Station by the National Academy of Sciences before any \nrelicensing of that facility; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nhelp ensure the safety of the Nation's oldest nuclear power plants \nbefore they receive a renewed license to operate.\n  The Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station in Lacey, NJ, has \noperated for 35 years and is the oldest nuclear facility in the \ncountry. It provides approximately ten percent of New Jersey's \nelectricity, powering 600,000 homes. Oyster Creek also provides high \npaying jobs for 450 New Jerseyans. While the plant is an important \nsource of energy and jobs for New Jerseyans, serious environmental, \nhealth, and safety concerns must be taken into account before the plant \nis relicensed. Three and a half million Americans live within a fifty-\nmile radius of this plant. Congress must recognize that it is \nimperative that the safety, performance and reliability of this plant \nbe assessed by an independent entity before it is relicensed.\n  I have been very clear about my support for an independent review of \nOyster Creek's safety and security as part of the relicensure process. \nSuch an assessment would have to go beyond what is currently studied by \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) when it reviews a license \nrenewal. Unfortunately, when the NRC decides whether to renew a plant's \nlicense, it does not subject that application to the same thorough \nanalysis that would be applied to a new power plant's application.\n  In particular, a plant's emergency plan is not evaluated by the NRC \nwhen it considers a license renewal. This is surely unacceptable.\n  The legislation I am introducing would require the NRC to withhold \nrelicensing of the Oyster Creek Station until the National Academy of \nSciences provides an independent assessment of safety performance, \nalong with recommendations for relicensing and relicensing conditions. \nThe assessment must identify health risks, vulnerability to terrorist \nattacks, evacuation plans, population increases, ability to store \nnuclear waste, safety and security records, and the impact of a nuclear \naccident. The NRC would not be allowed to grant the license until it \ngives appropriate consideration to the recommendations in the report. \nThis is important not just for New Jersey as it applies to Oyster \nCreek, but for all nuclear plants across the country.\n  In addition, the bill requires NAS to review and recommend what the \nlife expectancy of nuclear plants should be that are designed like \nOyster Creek.\n  Most public officials do not have the training or knowledge base \nneeded to make an independent assessment regarding the safety and \nsecurity of a nuclear power plant. This is why it is so critical that \npolicymakers solicit the independent and unbiased opinion of experts \nwho are able to thoroughly assess whether the Oyster Creek nuclear \npower plant would be able to operate without fail throughout the \nduration of a new license.\n  This Nation needs a plan for a sound energy future. Such a plan must \naddress the increasing role for clean, renewable energy. The plan, \nhowever, must ensure that nuclear power plants such as Oyster Creek \noperate safely and only as long as they are needed.\n  If New Jersey's energy future is left up to chance, it could leave my \nState more reliant on coal-fired energy imported from other States over \na regional grid that is unable to handle bulk power transfers of such a \nmagnitude. The obvious end result of such reliance on distantly \ngenerated and transported energy is more air pollution and more \nblackouts.\n  Considering that New Jersey already suffers from the health effects \nof out-of-State air pollution and is still smarting from the 2003 \nblackout, we should know better than to let this happen.\n  A mistake in this matter has devastating potential consequences for \nNew Jersey. An independent assessment of the safety of Oyster Creek is \na significant step to ensure the safety of the 3.5 million residents \nwho live in the vicinity of the plant. This additional layer of safety \nwill help ensure that if Oyster Creek is relicensed, it will have \npassed a stringent, independent assessment of its safety. New Jersey \nshould not expect anything less when it comes to the safety of its \ncitizens.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this crucial piece of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1381\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to seek urgent and essential institutional reform at \nthe United Nations; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Norm Coleman in \nintroducing the United Nations Management, Personnel, and Policy Reform \nAct of 2005.\n  United Nations reform is not a new issue. The structure and role of \nthe United Nations have been debated in our country almost continuously \nsince the U.N. was established in 1945. But in 2005, we may have a \nunique opportunity to improve the operations of the UN. The revelations \nof the Oil-For-Food scandal and the urgency of strengthening global \ncooperation to address terrorism, the AIDS crisis, nuclear \nproliferation, and many other international problems have created \nmomentum in favor of constructive reforms at the UN.\n  We have ample evidence that the United Nations is in need of reform. \nThe Foreign Relations Committee held the first Congressional hearing on \nthe UN's Oil-for-Food scandal a year ago last April. Since that time, \nthrough the work of Paul Volcker, Senator Coleman, and many others, we \nhave learned much more about the extent of the corruption and \nmismanagement involved.\n  Senator Coleman's hard work as a Member of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee and as the Chairman of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has \nprovided the Senate with extensive knowledge of what went wrong in the \nOil-for-Food Program. We have combined efforts to offer the Senate a \ntop-down/bottom-up comprehensive look at what needs to be reformed if \nthe United Nations is going to be a highly effective institution in \nthis century. I would like to thank staff on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations who have \ncollaborated for many hours during the past several weeks as we have \nfinalized this bill.\n  We know that billions of dollars that should have been spent on \nhumanitarian needs in Iraq were siphoned off by Saddam Hussein's regime \nthrough a system of surcharges, bribes, and kickbacks. This corruption \ndepended upon members of the UN Security Council who were willing to be \ncomplicit in these activities. It also depended on UN officials and \ncontractors who were dishonest, inattentive, or willing to make \ndamaging compromises in pursuit of a compassionate mission.\n  The diminishment of UN credibility from corruption in the Oil-for-\nFood Program and other scandals is harmful to U.S. foreign policy and \nto efforts aimed at coordinating a stronger global response to \nterrorism. The capabilities possessed by the United Nations depend \nheavily on maintaining the credibility associated with countries acting \ntogether in a well-established forum with well-established rules. \nProfiteering, mismanagement, and bureaucratic stonewalling squander \nthis precious resource. At a time when the United States is appealing \nfor greater international help in Iraq, Afghanistan, and in trouble \nspots around the world, a diminishment of UN credibility reduces U.S. \noptions and increases our own burdens.\n  The UN's ability to organize burden sharing and take over missions \nbest handled by the international community is critical to the long-\nterm success of U.S. foreign policy. As such, the United States must \nhelp achieve effective reform at the UN.\n  Our legislation contains a comprehensive list of reforms that the \nUnited States must pursue at the United Nations. Some were espoused in \nthe Gingrich-Mitchell UN reform study. Others have been proposed by our \ncolleague on the House side, Henry Hyde, and have already been adopted \nby the House of Representatives. Others have emerged from the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee's and the Permanent Subcommittee of \nInvestigation's examination of sound management, personnel and \noversight practices that can prevent past failures from reoccurring.\n  The legislation includes a new UN procurement system that embodies \nthe high standards required in modern governments and private sector \ncompanies, including relevant standards contained in the Foreign \nCorrupt Practices Act. It calls for a new Management Performance Board \nto hold senior UN officials accountable and a Sanctions Management \nOffice to assist the Security Council in managing, monitoring, and \noverseeing UN sanctions programs. It calls for strengthened financial \ndisclosure requirements for UN personnel and the creation of an Office \nof Ethics to monitor the disclosure policy and enforce a code of \nethics. On the UN budget, it supports sunset provisions for all new \nprograms mandated by the General Assembly and cost-cutting measures \nsuch as greater use of the internet for public information, expanding \noutsourcing of translation, and reducing the frequency of conferences \nand international meetings. It\n\n[[Page S8139]]\n\npromotes whistle-blower protections for UN employees and strengthens \nthe UN inspector general function carried out by the Office of \nInternational Oversight Services (OIOS). And it calls for the creation \nof a new Independent Oversight Board to ensure the integrity and fiscal \nindependence of the OIOS.\n  The legislation also calls for reforms in the two functions, \npeacekeeping and humans rights protection, where the United Nations \nwill need to be stronger and more effective over the next several \ndecades if it is to make a major contribution to international peace \nand security.\n  This legislation would provide President Bush with Congressional \nsupport and flexibility as he moves to generate reforms at the UN. The \nbill establishes a comprehensive agenda for creating the kind of United \nNations the American people can support. It does not impose an \nartificial formula or rigid checklist of items that narrows our \ndefinition of success. Nor does it require mandated cuts in UN dues. \nInstead, the underlying premise of this legislation is that we want to \ngive a President who knows how to achieve reform and is firmly \ncommitted to doing so the tools he needs to achieve our national \nobjectives.\n  We see President Bush's pledge to seek reform reinforced by his \ndeeds, including his nomination of a reform-minded expert on UN affairs \nto be our ambassador at the United Nations and now his subsequent \nnomination of a trusted White House aide to be the Assistant Secretary \nfor International Organizations at the State Department.\n  The drive for reform at the UN is not going to occur in a national \nsecurity vacuum. We will continue to have national security interests \nthat are affected by UN agencies and UN deliberations. Without \nnarrowing the President's options, this legislation gives him the \nleverage he needs. If he believes that, despite our best efforts, the \nother member states of the UN do not share our views on the urgency for \nreform, this bill grants the President full authority to withhold 50 \npercent of our UN dues until reforms are implemented. But it allows the \nPresident to make tactical judgments in the national security interest \nabout how to apply leverage and about what methods to use in pursuing \nreform.\n  Secretary General Kofi Annan has proposed a substantial reform plan \nthat will provide a platform for further reform initiatives and \ndiscussions. Other member nations have ideas for reform as well. The \nUnited States must be a leader in the effort to improve the United \nNations, particularly its accountability. And this legislation provides \nthe right balance, outlining the kinds of reforms that will make the \nUnited Nations an accountable, transparent, and well-managed \ninternational organization, while giving the President the authority to \nwithhold contributions if reform efforts fall short.\n  I thank Senator Coleman for the expertise and leadership he has \nprovided in crafting this legislation, and I ask my colleagues to give \nit their full support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 1385. A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to ensure fair treatment and due process protections under the \ntemporary assistance to needy families program, to facilitate enhanced \ndata collection and reporting requirements under that program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, later this year the Senate may again \nconsider reauthorization of the 1996 Personal Opportunity and Work \nResponsibility Reconciliation Act. This law ended the Aid to Families \nwith Dependent Children program and created our current Federal welfare \nprogram, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.\n  I supported the legislation that created TANF because I believed that \nthe welfare system was failing recipients and their families and that \nwe needed to do better. Now, almost nine years later, poverty levels \nare again on the rise and it is clear that improvements need to be made \nto the TANF program in order to achieve the goal of breaking the cycle \nof poverty and moving recipients into well-paying, sustainable jobs.\n  As we all know, each State's welfare program is different, and the \nimplementation of these programs often varies from provider to provider \nand from county to county. While we encouraged State-level innovation \nwith the 1996 law and should continue to encourage it with our \nreauthorization legislation, we should also ensure that all State plans \nconform to uniform Federal fair treatment and due process protections \nfor all applicants and clients.\n  I am deeply concerned that a client who applies for or receives \nbenefits in one part of Wisconsin may not be getting the same treatment \nas another applicant or client in a different part of my State.\n  The bill that I introduce today, the Fair Treatment and Due Process \nProtection Act, would improve Federal fair treatment and due process \nprotections for applicants to and clients of State TANF programs by \naddressing gaps in current law in three areas: access to translation \nservices and English as a Second Language education programs, sanction \nnotification and due process protections, and data collection and \nanalysis. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy and the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. \nLandrieu.\n  In order for low-income parents whose primary language is not English \nto understand their rights with respect to availability of benefits, to \ncomply with Federal and State TANF program rules, and to move from \nwelfare to work, we should ensure that translation services and English \nas a Second Language classes are available.\n  My bill would require States to provide interpretation and \ntranslation services to low-income parents who do not speak English, \nand provides that the standards currently used in the food stamp \nprogram would be used to determine when the requirement to provide such \nservices would be triggered for TANF-funded programs.\n  States would also be required to advise adults who lack English \nproficiency of available programs in the community to help them learn \nEnglish, and to allow individuals who elect to enroll in such programs \nto participate in them. Individuals who participate in such activities \non a satisfactory basis would be considered to be engaged in work \nactivities and these activities would be counted towards the work \nparticipation rates.\n  If we are not only to reduce the welfare rolls but to reduce poverty \nand to ensure that low-income parents find sustainable jobs, we must \nensure that these parents have access to education and training, \nincluding ESL classes, and that this training counts toward the work \nrequirement. I support efforts to expand the number of activities that \nTANF clients are permitted to count as work, and my bill would add ESL \nclasses to that list.\n  In addition, I am concerned about reports of unfair sanctioning and \ncase closures across the country. We should make every effort to \nminimize discrimination in the application of sanctions and the \ntermination of benefits. My bill would require that, prior to imposing \na sanction, States inform individuals of the reasons for the sanction \nand what individuals may do to come into compliance with program rules \nto avoid the sanction. It also would stipulate that sanctions may not \ncontinue after individuals have come into compliance with program \nrules, and that individuals be informed of all other services and \nbenefits for which they may be eligible during the period of the \nsanction, and of their rights under applicable State and Federal laws.\n  Finally, this bill would require States to perform enhanced data \ncollection and analysis so that we can get a better picture of the \npeople who apply for and receive TANF benefits and those who leave the \nwelfare rolls.\n  I share the concern that has been expressed by a number of my \nconstituents regarding the lack of comprehensive, uniform data about \nState welfare programs, including information on those who apply for \nbenefits and those who have left the welfare rolls. My bill would \nrequire States to collect and manage data in a uniform way; to \ndisaggregate the data based on a larger number of subgroups, including \nrace, ethnicity/national origin, gender, primary language, and \neducational level of recipient; to include information on\n\n[[Page S8140]]\n\nwork participation and about applicants who are diverted to other \nprograms; and to track clients whose cases are closed.\n  In addition, the Federal Department of Health and Human Services \nwould be required to include a comprehensive analysis broken down by \nthese same data groups in its annual report on the TANF program. The \nDepartment would also be required to perform a longitudinal study of \nprogram outcomes that includes data on applicants for assistance, \nfamilies that receive assistance, and families that leave assistance \nduring the period of the study. The Secretary of Health and Human \nServices would be required to protect the privacy of individuals and \nfamilies applying for or receiving assistance under State TANF programs \nwhen data on such individuals and families is publicly disclosed by the \nSecretary.\n  These enhanced requirements are not meant to impose an additional \nburden on the States. Rather, they are intended to measure the success \nof the program in a more comprehensive and transparent manner.\n  This legislation is supported by the Leadership Conference on Civil \nRights, the Nation's oldest and most diverse civil rights coalition. I \nask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1385\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

STRENGTHENING SECURITY AT NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) A taped interview shown on al-Jazeera television on \n     September 10, 2002, included a statement that al Qaeda \n     initially planned to include a nuclear power plant in its \n     2001 attacks on the United States.\n       (2) In 2001, David Kyd of the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency said that if a fully fueled large jetliner hit a \n     nuclear reactor ``then the containment could be breached and \n     the cooling system of the reactor could be impaired to the \n     point where radioactivity might well be set free.''\n       (3) Dr. Edwin Lyman, a physicist and former scientific \n     director of the Nuclear Control Institute has noted that if a \n     nuclear power plant were hit by a large commercial passenger \n     jet, ``significant release of radiation into the environment \n     is a very real one.''\n       (4) Operating nuclear reactors contain large amounts of \n     radioactive fission products that, if dispersed, could pose a \n     direct radiation hazard, contaminate soil and vegetation, and \n     be ingested by humans and animals.\n       (5) According to the organization Three Mile Island Alert, \n     a nuclear power plant houses more than 1,000 times the \n     radiation that would be released in an atomic bomb blast, and \n     the magnitude of a single terrorist attack on a nuclear power \n     plant could cause over 100,000 deaths.\n       (6) The federal government has offered Governors potassium \n     iodide pills to distribute to people living near nuclear \n     power plants in case of an attack, but no legislation has \n     passed to protect against an attack in the first place.\n       (7) In the 108th Congress, the Senate Environment and \n     Public Works Committee approved bipartisan legislation to \n     improve nuclear plant security. No action was taken by the \n     full Senate.\n       (8) Last month, the Senate Environment and Public Works \n     Committee again approved bipartisan legislation to improve \n     nuclear plant security.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate. It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the Congress should pass legislation to assess the terrorist \n     threats at each nuclear power plant and to establish new \n     federal standards to protect against those threats.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1217.
