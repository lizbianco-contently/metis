Mr. President, this morning, we will have morning business \nuntil 11 a.m. At 11 o'clock, we will resume the bankruptcy legislation \nand immediately proceed to three consecutive rollcall votes. Those \nvotes are on the Kennedy amendments Nos. 70 and 69, and the Akaka \namendment No. 105. Under the order from last night, we will then have \nanother series or two of stacked votes throughout the day in order to \nfinish the bill.\n  We will vote on final passage of the bankruptcy bill later today. It \nis going to be a very busy day, with many rollcall votes over the \ncourse of today. Therefore, I encourage all Members to remain close to \nthe floor. We will limit all votes, after the first in the series, to \n10 minutes in length. I encourage my colleagues to stay nearby so that \nwe do not have to extend this limit. It is always difficult, and we \nalways have excuses as people come in a few minutes late, but on a day \nlike today we need--we will; not need--we will finish this bill. We \nwill have a lot of votes over the course of today. We have to have all \nof our colleagues understand that they need to come and vote, and vote \non time.\n  Over the course of the day, we will consider the bankruptcy bill. It \nis a bill we have worked on for not just the last 2 weeks solidly but \nreally for the last about 7 years or 8 years, almost in the same form \nthat is being addressed today. It has been talked about, has been \ndiscussed, has been debated, and has been modified.\n  Later today, we will have a great victory again for the American \npeople in passing the bill that I expect will pass with overwhelming \nbipartisan support. The issues that we are talking about are not \nDemocrat issues or Republican issues; they really are American issues. \nToday, people will be able to look back over the course of the last 2 \nweeks, and really this whole 109th Congress, and say that we are doing \nwhat the American people want, what they deserve; that is, to govern \nwith meaningful solutions to the very real challenges, the very real \nproblems in people's lives, whether it is in Tennessee or Florida or \nNevada or California, all over this country. So I am very pleased with \nthe activity on the floor of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S2406]]\n\n  Over the course of the day, the Budget Committee will also be marking \nup the budget proposal. Once that markup is completed, we will bring \nthat to the floor. I would very much like to be able to start that \nbill, if at all possible, tomorrow. Under the rules of the Senate, \nafter that bill comes to the floor, we will spend 50 hours on that \nbill, and we will have a number of votes.\n  Once again, historically, or in the recent past, we have had \namendment after amendment after amendment. The Democratic leader and I \nhave, over the last week, been engaged in discussions on how we can \nhelp the managers of that bill limit the amendments to those amendments \nthat really are important and substantive and to have a good discussion \nbetween us and between the managers, among all the Senators, so we can \ncoordinate how to bring those amendments to the floor and have them \nvoted upon so that we do not, at the end of the day, or at the end of \nthat 50 hours, have 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 amendments, which we \nhave seen in the past. It is not necessary.\n  If we can work together over the course of the next 8 or 9 days, I \nbelieve we can take what can be very chaotic on the floor and give it \nsome definition and make it clear to people we want their ideas heard, \nwe want them debated within the 50 hours, we want to have them voted \nupon, but we can do it in a way that brings order out of this sometimes \nchaotic process.\n  With that, Mr. President, I will yield the floor, looking forward to \na very full day. We will be in session tomorrow. I would think--and I \nwill have more to say a little bit later, but in talking to the \nDemocratic leader, if we can complete the budget today in committee, \nand I believe we can, and if we complete this bankruptcy bill, which we \nwill, then I would think we probably would not have to have rollcall \nvotes tomorrow. We will be in session tomorrow. I put both of those \n``ifs'' in there because we have to move forward and accomplish the \nbusiness before us. If we were unable to finish those two things, we \nwould have to be in tomorrow with rollcall votes.\n  But our goal is to complete the markup on the budget and complete the \nbankruptcy bill today. I would like to do it in the late afternoon. If \nnot, we will go into the evening until we complete both.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/10/senate-section/article/S2406-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I yield myself such time as I might use.\n  Mr. President, I speak now in morning business because at 11 o'clock \nwe will have a continuation of votes in the Senate on the bankruptcy \nbill. Then we will have a series of votes later on in the afternoon, \nwith a time to be designated by the leadership. Then we will move to \nfinal passage. There would not be otherwise an opportunity to express \nmy views about the bankruptcy bill in general and on a number of the \nitems we have debated and on which we have failed to persuade the \nmajority of our colleagues. I want to reference those in my remarks \nthis morning.\n  America at its best is when we are united in common cause and a \nunified purpose. We came together to overcome the Great Depression. We \ncame together to fight two world wars against tyranny. We came together \nin the Cold War years to contain and defeat Communism. We came together \nto fight polio, to explore the heavens, and to create a secure \nretirement for our seniors. We came together after much struggle to \nexpand the circle of opportunity in America for civil rights, voting \nrights, disability rights, and women's rights. We came together on 9/11 \nas a nation determined to fight terrorism and defend our land.\n  As Americans, we know how to come together to achieve great goals, to \nmake stronger our communities, our families, our economy, our schools, \nand our nation. That is the America I believe in. That is the America I \nfight for every day. An America where we are joined arm in arm to \nadvance the cause of opportunity, freedom, and fairness for all of our \npeople.\n  But this legislation breaks the bond that unites America, the bond \nthat makes our country strong. It says the concerns of low and middle-\nincome families don't matter. They no longer have a voice in the United \nStates Senate. What matters are the special interests. This bill \nsacrifices the hopes and dreams of average Americans to the rampant \ngreed of the credit card industry. It turns the United States Senate \ninto a collection agency for the credit card companies, reaching the \nlong arm of the law into the pocketbooks of average Americans who have \nreached the end of their economic rope.\n\n  That is wrong. That is not what we should be doing here. We have a \nresponsibility to the people to fight for them and their needs, not to \ndo the bidding of the almighty credit card companies.\n  A lot of people are going to be pained with this bill. Make no \nmistake. The idea that this bill is focused on spendthrifts is \nlaughable when the other side admits that the most we have in terms of \nspendthrifts is maybe 10 percent of the total of those who go into \nbankruptcy, and most of the bankruptcy attorneys say it is anywhere \nfrom 5 to 7 percent. We are picking up all these individuals who are \ngoing to be forced to pay and be treated more harshly with this bill \nthan they otherwise would be under the regular Bankruptcy Act.\n  Our bankruptcy laws are intended to give families a second chance. As \nAmericans, we believe that if you work hard, live responsibly, but fall \non hard times, our bankruptcy laws should be there to help you get back \non your feet. If you get sick and face a mountain of medical bills, if \nyou face divorce and no longer have two incomes to support your family, \nif your job gets sent overseas, then Americans believe you should have \nan opportunity to rebuild your lives.\n  These are the principal causes for bankruptcy. We know that more \nchildren drop out of college every single year, not academically, but \nbecause of the cost of student loans. They can't pay them. We have been \nthrough this during the course of the debate. If you have a heart \nattack, if you are diagnosed with cancer, even if you have health \ninsurance, you basically have overwhelming bills and more often than \nnot get thrown into bankruptcy. If you get divorced--as we will have a \nchance to vote on--200,000 women don't receive alimony and don't \nreceive child support, these are hard-working Americans who are going \nto get thrown into bankruptcy. And rather than be let out so that they \nwill have a new chance and a new opportunity in life because they have \ndone nothing wrong, they are going to be tied up and paying the credit \ncard companies for the next 5 years. That is the way this bill works.\n  This bill changes everything. It takes dozens and dozens of \nbankruptcy rules and rewrites every single one of them in favor of the \ncredit card industry. Yesterday, we witnessed the powerful grip of this \nindustry over the Republican Party. The Republicans defeated amendment \nafter amendment after amendment after amendment that tried to give \naverage Americans a fair chance when they face the credit card company \nlawyers in bankruptcy court. But when it appeared that a special \ninterest loophole for the financial services industry threatened to be \nclosed by the Leahy-Sarbanes-Warner amendment, the Republicans shut \ndown the Senate.\n  It is not as if the credit card industry is suffering. As we can see \nfrom this chart, the profits are in the billions of dollars: $6.4 \nbillion 1990; $12.9 billion in 1995; $20.5 billion in 2000; and they \nexpect as a result of this bill that it will be 5 billion more dollars \nin profits. That is what this bill will mean. Over who? Over the \nfamilies going into bankruptcy because of a heart attack, a stroke, \nchildren who have spina\n\n[[Page S2407]]\n\nbifida, over women who are not getting paid alimony or child support, \nover those workers whose jobs have been shipped overseas trying hard to \npick up another job and can't keep up with the payments and go into \nbankruptcy. Those are the people who are suffering. But when it came to \nan issue involving the financial services industry, our Republican \nleadership closed the Senate down last night.\n  In the 8 years that this bill has been before the Senate, credit card \nprofits have jumped 163 percent from $11.5 billion a year to more than \n$30 billion a year.\n  We hear the proponents of this legislation say: Look, we have had \nthis legislation before us for 8 years. We have a problem. We have to \ndeal with the problem. A problem, with these kinds of profits?\n  We have a problem with health care coverage for Americans. We have a \nproblem with the cost of health care. We have a challenge in supporting \nour schools and our local communities. That is what is on the minds of \nAmericans. Here we are in the Senate, taking 2 weeks of our time in \norder to look out for the credit card companies and make sure there are \ngoing to be greater profits for a single industry. That is the priority \nof the Republican leadership, rather than dealing with the root causes \nof so many of those who will be dragged into bankruptcy and made \nindentured servants to the credit card industry for the next 5 years. \nIt does not make sense. These are the wrong priorities, the wrong \nvalues.\n  Middle class families are facing tough times with incomes falling, \nhealth costs out of control, college tuition through the roof, and now \ngasoline prices rising once again.\n  But this bill says that what's going on in your life every day \ndoesn't matter.\n  You may be a member of the Guard or the Reserve called to Iraq and \nyour business failed because you were away serving your country. In \nfact, 40 percent of those called up say they lost income, and over \n19,000 soldiers declared bankruptcy just last year. They sacrificed \ntheir lives in Iraq and their financial security here at home, but the \ncredit card companies will honor their service by squeezing every last \ndime out of our veterans in bankruptcy court.\n  Here is a letter from the Military Officers Association of America:\n\n       On behalf of the nearly 370,000 members of the Military \n     Officers Association . . . I am writing to request your \n     support for the protection of servicemembers, veterans, and \n     military survivors from the increased bankruptcy penalties.\n\n  They have it right, ``increased bankruptcy penalties.'' And this was \nwritten after Senators accepted the Sessions amendment which is just \neye dressing.\n\n       Our association is sensitive that overseas contingencies \n     disrupt the lives and finances of servicemembers and their \n     families. This is particularly true of the mobilized Guard \n     and Reserve members. Those who are self-employed, or who took \n     significant pay cuts from their civilian occupations, have \n     been placed at increased risk of facing bankruptcy because of \n     their service and sacrifice for our Nation. Survivors of \n     members killed on active duty also may find themselves at \n     increased financial risk. Many have left service rather than \n     be subject to similar recalls in the future, and we are \n     already concerned about the implications of this for long-\n     term retention and readiness.\n       MOAA does not believe this is the time to impose new \n     financial strictures . . .\n\n  There it is. Nonetheless, we have gone ahead and done that. Democrats \ntried to correct this problem, to put some balance and fairness in the \nbill. Senator Durbin offered an amendment to protect those who protect \nus, but our Republican friends said no. Every single Republican in the \nUnited States Senate voted for more credit card profits and against our \nservice men and women.\n  You may be a cancer survivor, but you can't survive the $35,000 in \nmedical bills that your insurance company won't pay, and you lost \nanother $20,000 for all the months you couldn't work and had to use \nyour credit cards to pay the mortgage, cover the car payments, pay the \nutilities, and buy the groceries. You're doing everything you can to \npay down your debt. You have taken out a second mortgage. You have \ncashed in your retirement savings. Your family is sharing one car.\n  But that doesn't matter. Under this bill, the profits of the credit \ncard companies are more important than your recovery from cancer. Tough \nwords; tough bill.\n  Democrats fought to correct this problem. I offered an amendment to \ngive responsible Americans who fall on hard times due to illness or \ninjury a fair chance in bankruptcy court. But the Republicans voted \nagainst these Americans in favor of the credit card companies.\n  You may be a single mother trying to raise your family, juggle your \njob and school, and rely on alimony and child support to pay the bills. \nBut more than 200,000 women owed alimony or child support are forced \ninto bankruptcy every year.\n  Democrats are addressing this problem, too. Republicans have a chance \nto vote for single mothers later this morning. We have a chance to say \nto women across America, who are taking responsibility every single day \nfor their children, but have a deadbeat dad who won't do his part, that \nwe're on your side. We believe it's more important for you to get back \non your feet than for the credit card companies to have greater \nprofits.\n  Maybe your job was one of the 2.8 million manufacturing jobs that \nhave been shipped overseas in the past 4 years. You found a new job, \nbut it pays only half as much. But under this bill, it doesn't matter. \nIn bankruptcy court you will still have to keep paying the exorbitant \ninterest payments to the credit card companies as if you still had your \nold, better paying job.\n  It doesn't matter that you have worked hard and lived responsibly all \nyour life.\n  It doesn't matter that you were willing to take a lower paying job \nbecause you wanted to be a contributing member of society.\n  It doesn't matter that you clip grocery coupons every week to try to \npreserve the money you set aside to put your children through college.\n  It doesn't matter that you gave up your vacation to pay for repairs \nto your leaky roof.\n  It doesn't matter that your lost job means you had to move your \nelderly parents into a cheaper nursing home to try to avoid bankruptcy.\n  It doesn't matter. You can sacrifice and cut corners and put aside \nhopes and plans and dreams. But all that matters in this bill is for \nthe credit card companies to have more and more profits.\n  We'll have a chance to vote on this question later this morning, too. \nBut I have a feeling that Republicans are going to say no to the needs \nof Americans whose jobs have been outsourced overseas, just as they \nhave said no to Iraq veterans, to single mothers, to children, and to \nseniors.\n  We should be working to unite the country to achieve great goals \nagain. Why are we not debating those issues here on the floor of the \nSenate, instead of trying to get more profits for the credit card \nindustry--perhaps the most profitable industry in America--at the \nexpense of the mothers, children, veterans of Iraq, those who have \nserious health care bills, and those whose jobs have been shipped \noverseas. We should be battling for them. We should be battling to \nimprove our schools and make college more affordable. We should be \nstrengthening our economy and training our workers to compete against \nglobalization. We should be fighting to keep our country safe from \nterrorism.\n  This bill makes these goals more difficult to achieve. It divides \nAmerica by rewarding the most powerful special interests at the expense \nof low and middle-income families. A Republican supporter of the bill \nsaid yesterday that this bill was ``fair and balanced.'' Where is the \nfairness? Where is the balance?\n  It does nothing to fix the millionaires' mansion loophole that allows \nmillionaires to go into bankruptcy and still keep their massive \nestates. You may lose your home, but they get to keep their palaces \nunder this bill. Where was the effort on the other side--talking about \na fair and balanced bill--to try to do something about that? All they \ncould do was whip up their own membership in order to defeat that \namendment to have one standard for all Americans. That is what I \nthought we were about as a country one standard--not a dual standard \nfor wealthy millionaires that can hide the tens of millions of dollars\n\n[[Page S2408]]\n\nin their mansions and palaces in a handful of States.\n  It does nothing to help the thousands upon thousands of employees and \nretirees of companies like Enron and WorldCom and Polaroid, who are \nleft out, twisting in the wind, after a bankruptcy process that lets \nthe responsible corporate executives go free. They go free. These \nemployees lose their pensions, their health insurance, their \nretirement, and their investments, as they did at Polaroid. Is there \nanything in this bill to try to help those individuals, many of whom \nworked a lifetime for these companies? Absolutely not. They are fair \ngame. After these individuals, the Ebbers, the Skillings, Enron, and \nthe rest, robbed those companies, they are sitting in their mansions \nnow in Houston; but these other individuals will be dragged into \nbankruptcy court if they get a serious illness or sickness, or if they \nrun into family problems.\n  Fair and balanced? No way, Mr. President. The Republicans and the \ncredit card companies may get their way, and the American people may \nlose this round; but the fight is never over until we have assured \nfairness and freedom and opportunity for every one of our citizens. \nThat is our pledge as Democrats today and tomorrow and in the future. \nThat is why I hope our colleagues will vote no.\n  I will mention a few further items. One is from the Children's \nDefense Fund, who care about children. We tried to point out some of \nthe other groups that will be affected. Here is a letter from the \nChildren's Defense Fund. I will read excerpts of it. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Children's Defense Fund,\n                                    Washington, DC, March 1, 2005.\n     Re: oppose S. 256, the Bankruptcy Act of 2005.\n\n       Dear Senator: The Children's Defense Fund is writing to \n     urge you to oppose S. 256, a bankruptcy bill that would hurt \n     many Americans facing financial problems due to job loss, \n     divorce, child-rearing, lack of medical insurance, or \n     predatory lending practices. This bill would inflict hardship \n     on more than one million economically vulnerable women and \n     families who are affected by the bankruptcy system each year. \n     Medical emergency, job loss or family breakups are factors \n     which account for nine out of ten filings.\n       The bill would also hurt women who are owed child or \n     spousal support by men who file for bankruptcy. The bill will \n     make it more difficult for mothers to collect support because \n     credit card companies and other commercial creditors will \n     have greater claims to the debtor's resources during and \n     after bankruptcy. Being first among unsecured creditors in \n     Chapter 7 bankruptcy is meaningless when over 95 percent of \n     debtors have no resources to pay unsecured creditors. In \n     Chapter 13, the bill would require larger payments to be made \n     to many commercial creditors, resulting in smaller payments \n     of past-due child support over a longer period of time, \n     increasing the risk that child support debts will not be paid \n     in full. And after the bankruptcy is over, more debts owed to \n     commercial creditors will survive--and mothers and children \n     owed support are not a match for the collection departments \n     of the commercial credit industry.\n       S. 256 contains a number of provisions which would have a \n     severe impact on families trying to regain their economic \n     stability through the bankruptcy process. S. 256 would make \n     it harder for women to access the bankruptcy system. Low and \n     moderate income families are not protected from many of the \n     bill's harsh provisions. Parents who desperately need to \n     preserve their homes from foreclosure or prevent their \n     families from being evicted, or keep a car to get to work, \n     would find it more difficult to do so. And, when the \n     bankruptcy process was over, parents already facing economic \n     disadvantage would find it harder to focus their income on \n     reasonable and necessary support for dependent children \n     because many more debts would survive.\n       Passage of the bankruptcy bill would make it harder for \n     families struck by financial misfortune to get back on track. \n     It would benefit the very profitable credit card industry at \n     the expense of the modest-income families who represent the \n     great majority of those who declare bankruptcy. Congress \n     should not enact reform that puts women and children at \n     greater risk. The bill is profoundly unfair and unbalanced. \n     Unless there are major changes to S. 256, we urge you to \n     oppose it.\n           Very truly yours,\n\n                                         Deborah Cutler-Ortiz,\n\n                               Director of Family Income and Jobs,\n                                          Children's Defense Fund.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In part, the letter says:\n\n       This bill would inflict hardship on more than 1 million \n     economically vulnerable women and families who are affected \n     by the bankruptcy system each year.\n       . . . and after the bankruptcy is over, more and more debts \n     owed to the commercial creditors will survive--and mothers \n     and children owed support are not a match for the collection \n     departments of the commercial credit industry.\n\n  There it is. The credit card companies and the mothers will be \nscrambling over the nickels and dimes that might be left. Guess who is \ngoing to win out? That is the fairness and balance that has been put in \nhere. That is why the Children's Defense Fund is strongly opposed to \nthis.\n  The National Women's Law Center wrote:\n\n       This bill would inflict additional hardship on over one \n     million economically vulnerable women and families who are \n     affected by the bankruptcy system each year: those forced \n     into bankruptcy because of job loss, medical emergency, or \n     family breakup--factors which account for nine out of ten \n     filings--and women who are owed child or spousal support by \n     men who file for bankruptcy.\n\n  It will make it ``harder for women to meet their children's needs \nafter bankruptcy because many more debts would survive.''\n  Finally, the Alliance for Retired Americans wrote:\n\n       The fastest growing group of Americans filing for \n     bankruptcy are those over 65. This unfortunate situation has \n     been caused by skyrocketing health costs that can drain a \n     lifetime of savings in a very short period of time. In \n     addition, many older Americans have seen their pensions and \n     retirement savings disappear as well. The result has been \n     that many older Americans cannot enjoy the security in their \n     retirement through no fault of their own. And they end up in \n     bankruptcy.\n       This legislation before the Senate actually increases the \n     burden on older Americans who undergo financially difficult \n     times through health care costs or loss of retirement income.\n\n  This administration wants to privatize Social Security. This is what \nthey say. That is why they are opposed to it. Those who represent the \nchildren are opposed to it. The ones in the military are opposed to it. \nThose who represent workers are opposed to it. Those who represent \nwomen are opposed to it. The one group that is for it is the credit \ncard companies. Take your choice. I know how I will decide.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, the crisis created by the unprecedented \nuse of filibusters to defeat judicial nominations must be solved while \npreserving two important Senate traditions. On the one hand, extended \ndebate is an important part of how the United States Senate conducts \nits legislative business. On the other hand, we have traditionally \ngiven judicial nominations reaching the Senate floor a final \nconfirmation decision. Two years ago, this latter tradition was \nattacked when the filibuster was used for the first time to defeat \nmajority supported judicial nominations. Mr. President, these are two \ndifferent and important traditions and each must be preserved.\n  Solving this crisis by restoring Senate tradition is not a partisan \nstep, but is in the interest of the Senate as an institution. Both \nRepublicans and Democrats should follow the same standard, no matter \nwhich party occupies the White House or runs the Senate. Neither \nDemocrats nor Republicans should have to go through this vicious cycle \nof filibusters against qualified judicial nominees.\n  Let me first clarify once again the situation in which we find \nourselves. Before 2003, no majority supported judicial nomination had \nbeen defeated by a filibuster. Under our Rule XXII, we did vote on \nmotions to end debate on judicial nominations, though we did so just 15 \ntimes in 35 years. Simply taking a cloture vote, however, does not mean \na filibuster is underway. In fact, some of those cloture votes were \nused deliberately to prevent filibusters, clearing the procedural path \nand guaranteeing an up or down confirmation vote. Some have been used \nfor floor management purposes. We did so even on very controversial \nnominations, such as President Clinton's choices of Richard Paez and \nMarsha Berzon for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n  Before 2003, only one judicial nomination on which cloture was not \ninvoked was not confirmed. Opposition to cloture on the controversial \n1968 nomination of Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice was evenly bipartisan \nand showed that\n\n[[Page S2409]]\n\nthe nominee lacked clear majority support. At the nominee's request, \nPresident Lyndon Johnson withdrew the nomination the next day. Senator \nRobert Griffin, from Michigan, who led opposition to the nomination, \npersonally told me that there never was an intention to use the \nfilibuster to defeat the Fortas nomination. There was no need, since \nthe votes were there to defeat the nomination outright. Lyndon Johnson \nknew it and that is why they withdrew the nomination rather than be \nembarrassed by the bipartisan vote of both parties against the nominee.\n  Before 2003, if the Senate rejected a judicial nomination that \nreached the Senate floor, we did so by voting it down; filibusters did \nnot prevent a final vote in order to keep a nomination from \nconfirmation. The break with that tradition came in 2003. During the \n108th Congress alone, we voted on motions to end debate on judicial \nnominations 20 times. Each vote failed, and opposition to cloture was \ncompletely partisan. None of those nominees was confirmed, though each \nhad clear bipartisan majority support.\n  Those who want to end this Senate tradition of giving judicial \nnominations reaching the Senate floor an up or down vote fear they will \nlose if we follow that tradition. To them, the end of defeating \nPresident Bush's judicial nominations justifies the means of destroying \nSenate tradition. Being honest about it would reveal how such partisan \nstrategies are politicizing the judicial appointment process, so they \ntry to make other arguments.\n  They claim Republicans filibustered President Clinton's judicial \nnominations, but each of his judicial nominees on whom we took a \ncloture vote is today a sitting Federal judge.\n  They claim they don't filibuster very often, which is beside the \npoint if using the filibuster against judicial nominations violates \nconstitutional principles and departs from Senate tradition. There have \nalready been enough judicial nomination filibusters to give President \nBush the lowest appeals court confirmation rate of any president since \nFranklin Roosevelt.\n  Or they claim they filibuster only nominees who are out of some kind \nof mainstream. It is difficult to know what that charge really means, \nespecially since the American Bar Association--which Democrats once \nconsidered the gold standard--has found them qualified. Senators may, \nof course, vote against a judicial nominee for any reason they wish, \nbut we should stop pretending that out of the mainstream is anything \nmore than a prediction that the nominee may not always rule the way \nliberal interest groups want. Considering the stream in which many of \nthose groups swim, I'm not so sure this isn't a compliment. If the \nmainstream really mattered, though, these filibusters would never have \nstarted. Newspaper editorials opposing filibusters of judicial \nnominations outnumber those supporting them by at least six-to-one.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that some representative \neditorials from mainstream newspapers be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 13, 2003]\n\n                      The Politics of Filibusters\n\n       Where's Jimmy Stewart when you need him? Two historic \n     filibusters are currently under way in the Senate--one's been \n     going on for months--but next to no one outside the Beltway \n     has noticed.\n       Senate business proceeds as usual, the Members get to sleep \n     in their own beds at night, and Miguel Estrada and Priscilla \n     Owen's names come up only when repeated motions to close \n     debate and bring their judicial nominations to a vote are \n     defeated. Hollywood is not remaking ``Mr. Smith Goes to \n     Washington.'' All of which is exactly the way Democrats want \n     it: They can defeat two Bush judges, and more down the road, \n     without paying a political price.\n       So one can hardly blame Majority Leader Bill Frist for \n     trying to shine a little light on the problem. The Democrats \n     are imposing an extraordinary new standard for confirming \n     judges--not a simple majority of 51 votes but a super-\n     majority of 60, the number required to shut off debate. Both \n     filibustered nominees have the support of a bipartisan \n     majority, yet they are being denied the confirmation votes to \n     which they are entitled under the advice-and-consent clause \n     of the U.S. Constitution.\n       Mr. Frist's proposed solution is to change the procedure \n     under which debate ends and a vote is taken, a process known \n     as ``cloture.'' He would amend Senate Rule XXII so that the \n     number of votes needed to end a filibuster would fall from 60 \n     to 57 to 54 to 51 on successive votes. This would preserve \n     the essential purpose of the filibuster--which is to give the \n     minority a chance to make their case--but not let them abuse \n     the system by holding confirmable nominees hostage forever.\n       Georgia Democrat Zell Miller made an even more ambitious \n     reform proposal on this page in March, when he called for new \n     cloture rules for nominations and legislation--not just \n     nominations, as Mr. Frist proposes. Mr. Miller's proposal was \n     in turn based on one in 1995 by Democrats Tom Harkin and \n     Joseph Lieberman.\n       That last one had the support of none other than Tom \n     Daschle, who said at the time that ``Democracy means majority \n     rule, not minority gridlock.'' Mr. Daschle hewed to a \n     different principle on Sunday, when he told NBC's ``Meet the \n     Press'' that Mr. Estrada and Judge Owen are ``exceptions to \n     the rule'' that every nominee deserves an up or down vote in \n     the Senate. Apparently he doesn't believe the Constitution \n     should be applied equally to every American.\n       Under current practice no Senate rule, including the 60-\n     vote cloture rule, can be changed except by a two-thirds \n     majority. Which is where things get interesting, \n     constitutionally speaking. Many legal scholars--liberal and \n     conservative--argue that Rule XXII is unconstitutional \n     because it binds future Senates to rules made by a past \n     Senate. ``It is an ancient principle of Anglo-American law \n     that one legislature cannot bind a succeeding legislature,'' \n     Steven Calabresi of Northwestern Law School, told the Senate \n     last week.\n       Catholic University's Douglas Kmiec made a similar point on \n     this page in March, and Lloyd Cutler, White House Counsel to \n     Presidents Carter and Clinton, wrote in 1993 that ``the \n     Senate rule requiring a super-majority vote to cut off debate \n     is unconstitutional.'' Vice Presidents Nixon, Humphrey and \n     Rockefeller, while presiding over the Senate, have all held \n     that Senate rules can be changed by a simple majority.\n       If the current Senate did that with Rule XXII--obtain a \n     majority vote to change the cloture rules for nominations--\n     Vice President Cheney would presumably agree. That would \n     leave the Democrats with the option of going to court, where \n     the Supreme Court could take the case or, more likely, decide \n     it was a political dispute best left to the Senate to \n     resolve. The President's nominees would be seated.\n       We've said it before, but it's worth repeating that the \n     Democrats' judicial filibusters are unprecedented in Senate \n     history. Filibustering nominations wasn't even permitted \n     until 1949 and the sole judicial nominee stopped by a \n     filibuster was Abe Fortas, LBJ's nominee for Supreme Court \n     Chief Justice, who faced charges of corruption. Meanwhile, \n     the Democrats are just warming up. A third appeals-court \n     filibuster looks likely this spring, and a Supreme Court \n     filibuster could be next if there's a vacancy this summer.\n       The system for confirming judges is clearly broken. \n     Democrats are playing politics with Senate rules, but they \n     now profess shock and outrage that Republicans want to play \n     politics too and reform the filibuster rules being abused. \n     Sounds to us as if Republicans are on to something.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     [From the Wheeling News Register Intelligencer, Sept. 8, 2003]\n\n                  Time for Filibuster Rules To Change\n\n       Miguel Estrada, whose nomination to the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals was bottled up by hyper-partisan Democratic \n     opposition for more than two years, decided to get on with \n     his life and withdrew himself from the nomination process.\n       It should not have shocked Republicans to see their liberal \n     colleagues play hardball on judicial nominations. Democrats \n     have been doing it since the Reagan administration. Teddy \n     Kennedy and friends undoubtedly are astonished to encounter a \n     GOP Senate leadership so feckless that it has allowed them to \n     get away with imposing an extra-constitutional 60-vote \n     supermajority requirement on judicial nominations, by using \n     the filibuster technique to stall a vote on Estrada. It takes \n     60 votes to end a filibuster, and Senate leaders no less than \n     seven times mounted ``cloture'' votes to ``end debate,'' each \n     time coming up short.\n       But they never forced Democrats to take to the Senate floor \n     to expound at length about their opposition to Estrada or any \n     of the several other nominees now subject to powder-puff \n     filibusters. All a senator need do these days is threaten a \n     ``filibuster,'' and--presto!--60 votes are required to \n     accomplish anything. The ``filibustering'' senators need not \n     worry about actually having to publicly defend their position \n     on the Senate floor.\n       Yes, long gone are the scenes from Frank Capra films in \n     which senators lose their voices trying to keep the floor to \n     maintain filibusters.\n       While Republicans have control of the Senate, they should \n     put an end to this practice that allows the will of the \n     minority to prevail without any effort being put into it.\n       The practical effect of GOP leaders allowing the minority \n     to so easily impose a 60- vote supermajority means there's a \n     new set of litmus tests for the courts: No judge may be \n     confirmed unless he or she agrees with the Senate's left \n     wing.\n       Now that there's nomination blood in the water, Republicans \n     can expect a lot more bare-knuckle torpedoing of President \n     Bush's\n\n[[Page S2410]]\n\n     judicial nominees unless Republicans are willing to actually \n     get a little political dirt under their fingernails. And \n     maybe even--gasp!--sacrifice an all-nighter on the Senate \n     floor by making the ``filibusterers'' actually filibuster. If \n     they want it badly enough, they should have to work for it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Grand Forks Herald, Mar. 13, 2003]\n\n                         Call End to Filibuster\n\n                            (By Tom Dennis)\n\n       Our View: Don't set a new constitutional standard of \n     demanding a supermajority vote.\n       North Dakota's congressional delegation has to walk a \n     political tightrope. Sens. Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan and \n     Rep. Earl Pomeroy are Democrats, while North Dakota itself \n     trends heavily Republican. The GOP's supermajorities in both \n     houses of the state Legislature, plus the fact that voters \n     chose Republicans for president in 1992, 1996 and 2000, \n     illustrate this.\n       But the delegation not only has walked that tightrope, it \n     has done handstands and even an occasional flip. All three \n     members are masters of wrangling federal dollars for North \n     Dakota projects. Furthermore, they've chosen their party-line \n     issues with care, voting with the Democrats on the budget but \n     showing more independence on some social and environmental \n     issues.\n       The Miguel Estrada filibuster in the Senate, however, may \n     change that perception.\n       Because the filibuster is as nakedly partisan as an issue \n     gets.\n       Estrada is President Bush's candidate for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals. He's a Harvard Law School \n     graduate who clerked for a Supreme Court justice, worked in \n     the U.S. Solicitor General's office, argued cases in front of \n     the Supreme Court, earned the top ranking of ``well \n     qualified'' from the American Bar Association--and didn't \n     speak English when he immigrated to the United States from \n     Honduras, to boot.\n       Fifty-five senators (including four Democrats) support his \n     nomination. But the other 45 Senators won't let it come to \n     the floor for a vote. They've invoked a filibuster. They say \n     they're doing it because Estrada hasn't answered enough \n     questions, but that's patently false. Senators know as much \n     or more about Estrada as they have about most nominees. \n     Furthermore, when given the chance to ask Estrada more \n     questions in writing, not one Democratic senator took the \n     administration up on its offer.\n       No, the transparent reason for the filibuster is that \n     Estrada's a conservative Hispanic lawyer who has a shot at \n     being named to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n       And for the left wing of the Democratic party, that's do-\n     or-die unacceptable.\n       Conrad and Dorgan should distance themselves from this \n     scorched-earth tactic. The Constitution gives the president \n     the power to appoint ``with the Advice and Consent of the \n     Senate . . . Judges of the supreme Court and all other \n     Officers of the United States.'' It does so in the same \n     paragraph in which it lists a special power demanding a two-\n     thirds majority Senate vote--namely, the power to ratify \n     treaties.\n       The Founding Fathers could have held judicial confirmations \n     to that higher standard. But they didn't. Clearly, they \n     intended judges to be confirmed by a simple Senate majority. \n     Just as clearly, 200 years of Senate practice call for the \n     same thing.\n       The GOP won its Senate majority fair and square. The \n     filibustering Democrats smack of being spoilers when they \n     obstruct majority rule, especially because their objection in \n     this case is not based on truth, justice or the American way, \n     but on politics.\n       Fifty-five duly elected United States senators are willing \n     to give Estrada the nod. That's enough.\n       Let his nomination come to the floor, and call the vote.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Buffalo News (New York), Mar. 19, 2003]\n\n           Let's Change Rules That Hang Up Judicial Nominees\n\n       Senate rules are an important part of American political \n     tradition, worthy of respect.

There is speculation that one or \n     more member of the current court may step down after the \n     current term.\n       The offer sounds conciliatory on its face--after all, \n     wouldn't it be better for everyone to get together and choose \n     a consensus candidate beforehand, rather than subject a \n     string of nominees to hostile questioning and ultimate \n     rejection on political grounds?\n       The ``advice and consent'' clause might indeed lend itself \n     to such a novel reading--if the Senate were overwhelmingly \n     held by a party diametrically opposed to the president's \n     philosophical leanings.\n       But if this has never been the procedure in times when the \n     government was thus implacably divided, why on earth should \n     it be adopted now?

The implication is that--if \n     they are not given this extraordinary power to hand the \n     president their own list of suitably liberal nominees, or to \n     strike names of known constitutionalists off any list the \n     president may have in hand--they might even filibuster a \n     nomination to the Supreme Court.\n       Wisely, Mr. Bush has now called that bluff.\n       White House counsel Alberto R. Gonzales replied in a letter \n     to Senate Democrats Wednesday that, ``If a Supreme Court \n     vacancy arises during his presidency, President Bush will \n     nominate an individual of high integrity, intellect and \n     experience,'' whereupon ``the Senate will have an opportunity \n     to assess the president's nominee and ... to vote up or \n     down.''\n       Will the last ponderous graybacks of the New Dealers' aging \n     herd squander their remaining political capital attempting a \n     last hurrah--lining up for a first-in-history filibuster \n     designed to prevent the entire Senate from voting on the \n     confirmation of a chief justice? It would be interesting to \n     watch them try.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the San Diego Union Tribune, Sept. 8, 2003]\n\n     Battle Over Judges--With Estrada Out, Senate Must End Turmoil\n\n       The battle between Democrats and Republicans in the Senate \n     over President Bush's judicial nominees may be the stuff of \n     interesting politics. But while this continuing controversy \n     makes for a potentially potent campaign issue, it makes for \n     bad government. After last week's withdrawal of Miguel \n     Estrada for consideration to the U.S. Circuit Court of \n     Appeals, antagonism in the Senate is only likely to grow.\n       Estrada, nominated to the appeals court more than two years \n     ago, had become the focal point of the controversy because \n     Democratic senators had used the filibuster seven times to \n     block votes by the full Senate on his nomination. If the \n     Senate had been allowed to vote on Estrada's nomination, a \n     majority would have confirmed him. But under Senate rules, 60 \n     votes are needed to break a filibuster in the 100-member \n     chamber. The motions to end the filibuster never received \n     more than 55 votes.\n       In addition to Estrada, Democrats have blocked the \n     nominations of Alabama Attorney General William Pryor to the \n     11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which sits in Atlanta, \n     and of Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owens to the 5th \n     Circuit, which sits in New Orleans. Other filibusters are \n     likely, including one over Bush's appointment of Los Angeles \n     Judge Carolyn Kuhl to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which \n     covers California and other Western states and territories.\n       But while Republicans put forth strong and justifiable \n     arguments over Democratic abuse of the filibuster, which \n     allows a minority to thwart the will of the majority, \n     antagonism over judicial nominees did not start with \n     President Bush's nominees. While one could go back to \n     President Reagan's 1987 nomination of Robert Bork to the U.S. \n     Supreme Court and his ultimate rejection by a Democratic \n     Senate, the real battle started during\n\n[[Page S2411]]\n\n     the Clinton administration. During those years, even single \n     senators, using a ``blue slip,'' could block nominees. At \n     least two nominees to the court on which Estrada was to sit \n     were blocked in this manner.\n       Overall, nominees during the first three years of the Bush \n     administration and the first three years of the Clinton \n     administration have been confirmed at about the same rate. So \n     far, the Senate has confirmed 145 of Bush's appointments, 27 \n     of them to the appeals courts, even though the discourse has \n     grown more strident.\n       In the interest of good government, a few senators have \n     talked of possible compromise, but nothing workable has yet \n     been put forward. Any compromise obviously would have to \n     involve the White House, and so far both the administration \n     and senators from each party are standing their ground.\n       But what's at stake here is the independence of the federal \n     judiciary and the public's respect for that branch's \n     interpretation of the laws Congress passes and the president \n     signs. If the Senate continues to fight over nominees, and \n     nominees are viewed as more political, there is a danger that \n     the public perception of judges who are eventually seated \n     could be tarnished. That would be disastrous for our system \n     of law and order. For this reason, and for others, both sides \n     must end this rancor.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. These may be their reasons, but there are no excuses. At \nthe mere suggestion of abandoning the Senate's tradition regarding \njudicial nominations when President Clinton was in office, former \nDemocratic Leader Tom Daschle said, ``I find it simply baffling that a \nSenator would vote against even voting on a judicial nomination.'' That \nshould be our response today as Senators on both sides of the floor.\n\n  Last week here on the Senate floor, the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia made his case against returning to Senate tradition \nregarding judicial nominations. I respect him. I have a lot of regard \nfor him, but I have to confess I was surprised that someone with such \nknowledge of the traditions and rules of this body would appear so \nwilling to abandon tradition.\n  He equated the filibuster with the Senate itself. He equated \nfilibustering judicial nominations with filibustering legislation and \nconcluded that returning to our tradition regarding judicial \nnominations would be an attack on the Senate somehow. I would like to \naddress each of these elements because I do not believe they can \nwithstand fair scrutiny.\n  First, my friend from West Virginia argued that the Senate was \ndesigned from its very inception as a place of absolutely unfettered \nand completely unlimited debate. As such, he argues, any limitation of \ndebate strikes at the very heart of the institution itself. Yet in the \nsecond volume of his own history of the Senate, he writes on page 115:\n\n       It is apparent that the Senate in the First Congress \n     disapproved of unlimited debate.\n\n  The original rule IV prohibiting a Senator from speaking more than \ntwice in any one debate on the same day without leave of the Senate \nremains in only slightly modified form as our rule XIX today. Even more \nsignificantly, rule VIII in the first Senate provided for a majority to \nproceed to a vote by calling the previous question.\n  Coupled with the Founders' expressed commitment to majority rule, \nthese facts demonstrate that even with regard to legislation, the \npossibility of preventing final action through extended debate was not \ncreated by original design. It arose by default through dropping that \nprevious question rule in 1806.\n  It would still be decades before Senators who sought to protect the \ninstitution of slavery would discover they could use this procedural \nloophole to their advantage and, of course, the filibuster was born. \nIts twin, however, was a parallel and ongoing effort at filibuster \nreform by which we have actively sought properly to balance the \nminority's right to debate and the majority's right to decide. The \nsolution we seek today is part of that ongoing effort.\n  The Senator from West Virginia next equated filibusters of judicial \nnominations with filibusters of legislation. His policy arguments in \nfavor of the filibuster, however, apply only to the legislative \nprocess. He said, for example, that without the filibuster ``there \nexists no leverage with which to bargain for the offering of an \namendment. All force to effect compromise between the parties will be \nlost.''\n  I note that in previous debates about filibuster reform, such as in \n1975, Democrats, such as the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKennedy, offered this very same argument against the filibuster. Still, \nthis notion obviously applies where the Senate either fashions or \neffects legislation, but it is irrelevant to nominations.\n  The Senator from West Virginia has long been this Chamber's leading \nexpert on our history and procedure. For that I compliment him. For \nthis reason, though, I was disappointed that he would fail to make such \nan important distinction between legislative and judicial nomination \nfilibusters, a distinction based on both historical fact and \nconstitutional principle. In other words, there is a difference between \nthe legislative calendar and the executive calendar in the Senate.\n\n  The Senator from West Virginia is not the first in the debate over \nthese new judicial nomination filibusters failing to make this critical \ndistinction. Other Democratic Senators, for example, want to use the \ncup-and-saucer analogy by which George Washington allegedly described \npouring hot action from the House cup to cool in the deliberation of \nthe Senate saucer.\n  As Jeffrey Toobin's recent analysis in the New Yorker magazine points \nout, however, not only is this story probably apocryphal, but the \nsupposed exchange between Washington and Jefferson specifically focused \non, you got it, legislation. In fact, that is the only context in which \nit makes any sense. If they said it at all, they were talking about the \nrelationship between the two Houses within the legislative branch, not \nthe relationship between the legislative and executive branches.\n  The distinction between legislative and judicial filibusters is a \nmatter of historical fact. Every example offered last week by my friend \nfrom West Virginia involved legislation. He opened and closed his \nspeech by evoking scenes from the classic film ``Mr. Smith Goes to \nWashington.'' I went back and checked the script. Senator Jefferson \nSmith in that movie, played by the great Jimmy Stewart, filibustered an \nappropriations bill. That is legislation.\n  The example the Senator from West Virginia said was most relevant--\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt's proposal to reorganize the judiciary--\nwas also, you got it, legislation. That example is actually not \nrelevant at all, however, because that 1937 legislation was not \ndefeated by a filibuster. The most definitive study of President \nRoosevelt's plan by Mary McKenna concludes that it did not have \nmajority support in the Senate at all. There was no need for a \nfilibuster. Rather than the majority being stymied in its attempt to \npass the bill, the majority--and an overwhelming majority at that--sent \nit back to committee.\n  To my knowledge, no Senators are today calling for an end to the \nlegislative filibuster as a group of Democratic Senators did a decade \nago. Nine of them, led by the Senator from Iowa, Tom Harkin, and the \nSenator from Connecticut, Joseph Lieberman, serve in this body today. \nThey argued back then that all filibusters, including those of \nlegislation, unconstitutionally infringe on majority rule. The two \nSenators from Massachusetts, Edward Kennedy and John Kerry, along with \nthe Senator from California, Barbara Boxer, the Senator from New \nJersey, Frank Lautenberg, the Senator from Maryland, Paul Sarbanes, the \nSenator from New Mexico, Jeff Bingaman, and the Senator from Wisconsin, \nRuss Feingold, voted against tabling that proposal.\n  I find it simply baffling that Senators who once supported abolishing \nthe Senate tradition of legislative filibusters would today support \nestablishing a tradition of judicial nomination filibusters--in other \nwords, filibusters of nominees by the President on the executive \ncalendar, not the legislative calendar.\n  Ignoring the distinction between legislative and judicial nomination \nfilibusters is necessary for the argument of the Senator from West \nVirginia, as evidenced when he asked:\n\n       If we restrain debate on judges today, what will be next?\n\n  Yet for more than a century, filibusters of legislation coexisted \nnicely with our tradition of giving up-or-down votes to judicial \nnominations that reach the Senate floor.\n  Our experience under the current version of rule XXII shows that \nthese two traditions can peacefully coexist. That rule, by the way, was \nborn in 1917\n\n[[Page S2412]]\n\nafter a filibuster of legislation. We have had the current version of \nrule XXII since 1975. From 1975 to 2002, the 94th Congress through the \n107th Congress, only 3 percent of cloture votes were judicial \nnominations; 85 percent of those cloture votes passed, and all \nnominations subject to cloture votes were confirmed.\n  During the 108th Congress, 49 percent of cloture votes were on \ntraditional nominations. None of them passed, and none of the \nnominations were confirmed.\n  I must say, with all due respect to my dear friend from West \nVirginia, that using the filibuster to defeat majority-supported \njudicial nominations has not been part of even modern Senate practice, \nlet alone historic Senate tradition.\n  Let me repeat that. Using the filibuster to defeat majority-supported \njudicial nominations has not been part of even modern Senate practice, \nlet alone historic Senate tradition.\n  In his op-ed piece in the Washington Post last week, the Senator from \nWest Virginia ignored our tradition regarding judicial nominations in \nanother way. He argued that by preventing a confirmation vote through a \nfilibuster, the Senate had formally rejected these judicial \nnominations. How can it be a rejection of judicial nominations when a \nmajority of Senators supports confirmation of each one of those people? \nEach nominee on whom cloture was not invoked remained on the Senate's \nexecutive calendar. Our own rule XXXI states that nominations that are \n``neither confirmed nor rejected'' shall be returned to the President. \nEach of those filibustered nominations was, indeed, returned to the \nPresident when the 108th Congress adjourned. By definition, common \nsense, and our own rules, that means they were not rejected. My friend \nfrom West Virginia cannot on the one hand claim these nominations were \nrejected but on the other hand claim that these filibusters are about \ndeliberation and debate.\n  Legislative and judicial nomination filibusters are different as a \nmatter of historical fact because they are different as a matter of \nconstitutional principle. Legislation belongs to the legislative branch \nunder article I of our Constitution, while nomination and appointment \nbelong to the President under article II. In Federalist No. 65, \nAlexander Hamilton wrote that the President would be the ``principal \nagent'' in appointments. The Senate has an important role of advice and \nconsent that checks the President's appointment power, but we do not \ncontrol the executive process any more than the President controls the \nlegislative process. We recognize the difference between legislative \nand executive business when we leave legislative session and proceed to \nexecutive session to address nominations we have placed on the \nexecutive calendar. My friend from West Virginia, I think, ignored \nthose differences.\n\n  Interacting with the executive branch is simply not the same as \ninteracting within the legislative branch. And thus it would seem \nalmost self-evident that procedures we use regarding our authority over \nlegislation might not be appropriate when we affect the President's \nauthority over appointments. We must preserve our tradition that \nrecognizes this constitutional distinction between the executive and \nlegislative branches, between our role of advice and consent on \njudicial appointments, and our authority over legislation.\n  The Senator from West Virginia, in my opinion, used an unfortunate \nanalogy in attacking those who would return the Senate to its \nconfirmation tradition regarding judicial nominations. Others, such as \nthe Anti-Defamation League, have strongly objected to his reference to \nHitler's Nazi regime for various reasons. My point here is not that. It \nis different. I object to his claim that returning to our tradition \nregarding judicial nominations would be an example of ``how men with \nmotives and a majority can manipulate law to cruel and unjust ends.'' \nThere is nothing cruel or unjust about the Senate returning to our \ntraditional advice and consent role regarding judicial nominations.\n  The Constitution gives the Senate the authority to determine our \nprocedural rules. It was pursuant to that authority that the Senate \ndropped the previous question rule in 1806, adopted a cloture rule in \n1917, and amended that rule several times since.\n  It was also pursuant to that authority that the Senator from West \nVirginia aggressively used various strategies to change Senate \nprocedures when he served as majority leader of this body. This \nincludes approaches currently under discussion, such as seeking a \nruling from the Senate's Presiding Officer. Though the Senator from \nWest Virginia last week said such an approach would abandon the ``cloak \nof legality,'' it would simply be following a procedural path that he \nhimself blazed. I was here for part of that.\n  The Senator from West Virginia said this approach ``seeks to alter \nthe rules by sidestepping the rules, thus making the impermissible the \nrule.''\n  Yet the Senate operates on the basis of parliamentary precedents and \ntraditions, as well as by our standing rules, a history my friend from \nWest Virginia helped shape and has been recognized as helping shape \nthose rules.\n  In 1977, for example, the Senator from West Virginia made a point of \norder that once cloture has been invoked, the Presiding Officer must \nrule dilatory amendments out of order. One Senator criticized this \nstrategy as trying to change Senate rules by majority vote during the \nheat of the debate. That criticism sounds an awful lot like the \ncriticism the Senator from West Virginia leveled last week against \nthose who might take the same approach today. Nonetheless, the strategy \nsucceeded when the full Senate tabled an appeal of the Presiding \nOfficer's ruling in favor of the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  In 1979, the Senator from West Virginia introduced Senate Resolution \n9 to make various changes to rule XXII. He argued that notwithstanding \nrule XXII's cloture requirement for rules changes, a simple majority \ncould change Senate rules at the beginning of a new Congress. He was \nright. The current Senate, he argued, is not bound by the dead hand of \nthe past Senate. He threatened that if the Senate did not come to a \ntime agreement for considering his resolution, he would attempt to \nproceed by seeking a parliamentary ruling.\n  Also in 1979, the Senator from West Virginia made a point of order \nthat the Presiding Officer, rather than the Senate, as required under \nour rule XVI, ruled nongermane certain amendments to appropriations \nbills.\n  As in 1977, that strategy worked when the Senate tabled an appeal of \nthe Presiding Officer's ruling in favor of the Senator from West \nVirginia. In 1980, the Senator from West Virginia also secured a \nhelpful parliamentary precedent but from a different procedural \ndirection. He wanted to achieve confirmation for an individual nominee \non the Executive calendar.\n  At that time, while a motion to go into executive session was not \ndebatable, a subsequent motion to proceed to a specific item on the \nExecutive calendar was debatable. On March 5, 1980, the Senator from \nWest Virginia made a single motion for the Senate both to go into \nexecutive session and to proceed to a specific nomination. When the \nPresiding Officer sustained a point of order against this motion, one \nSenator criticized this attempt to change procedure by majority vote. \nNonetheless, the Senator from West Virginia appealed the Presiding \nOfficer's ruling, which was his right to do, and the Senate overturned, \nsupporting the distinguished Senator's majority rule change.\n  This strategy might be described by some, using the Senator from West \nVirginia's words last week, as altering the rules by sidestepping the \nrules. It certainly limited what he now insists would be unfettered and \nunlimited debate.\n  In 1987, the Senator from West Virginia secured a parliamentary \nprecedent that obviously dilatory requests by Senators to be excused \nduring a rollcall vote were out of order. This applied the same \nstrategy he had used in 1977, getting the Presiding Officer to rule \ndilatory tactics out of order, in a new context. Each of these examples \nhas similarities and differences with the current situation.\n  I offer this detail only to demonstrate that Senate procedures have \nbeen changed through parliamentary rulings as well as by formal \namendments to the rules themselves. As my friend from West Virginia has \ndemonstrated by pursuing each of these\n\n[[Page S2413]]\n\nstrategies himself, the Senate can exercise its constitutional \nauthority to determine its procedural rules either way.\n  He may certainly believe that the changes he sought were warranted \nwhile the change we may seek today is not. That is his right, and he \ncan express that right in debate by voting against such a change. But \nthat difference of opinion does not make his attempts to limit debate, \neven on legislation, right and just while any attempt to do so today on \njudicial nominations cruel and unjust.\n  We departed from our tradition of giving judicial nominations \nreaching the Senate floor an up-or-down vote only 2 years ago. The \nresult has been the Senate's inability to do its constitutional duty of \nproviding advice and consent regarding judicial nominations. We were \nable to give advice, I presume, but with regard to these 10 nominees we \nwere never able to give consent or not consent, whichever the case may \nbe. And that is done by a vote up and down. It demonstrates that the \nconfirmation process is, in the words of the Washington Post, \n``steadily degrading.''\n  Returning to that tradition of giving up-or-down votes for judicial \nnominations will not in the long run mean either party will always get \nits way. Both the executive branch and the Senate do change partisan \nhands from time to time. This standard, this tradition, knows no party \nand guarantees no partisan advantage. It applies no matter which party \noccupies the White House or which party controls the Senate. It would \nbind Republicans as well as Democrats and preserve our institutional \ntraditions. I hope and believe, however, that restoring this tradition \nwill, despite some Senators' threats to blow up the Senate, help \nrestore some comity and good will to this body.\n\n  Returning to that tradition, which recognizes the difference between \nour authority over legislation and the President's authority over \nappointments, is not an attack on the Senate; rather, it affirms our \ntraditions and the Senate's unique place in our system of separated \npowers. Returning to it both respects the President's authority over \nappointments and asserts the Senate's role of advice and consent, not \njust advice but consent as well.\n  A majority of Senators have been deprived of the right to give or not \ngive consent by these irresponsible filibusters of judicial nominations \non the Executive calendar. The deviation we have seen from that \ntradition, wherein a filibuster prevents confirmation of nominees with \nmajority support, undermines the President's authority and distorts the \nSenate's role. Preserving both of our traditions--extended debate \nregarding legislation and up-or-down votes on judicial nominations \nreaching the Senate floor--will restore the proper balance.\n  There is nobody in this body who respects the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia more than I do. I hope we can resolve these matters \nso both parties are bound by the correct tradition that we are not \ngoing to filibuster executive branch nominees and we will both preserve \nthe right to filibuster over the matters we totally control on the \nlegislative calendar. I would fight to my death to preserve rule XXII \non legislation because I have also been in the minority from time to \ntime, and it was the only way we could stop some things which would \nhave been just terrible for this country. But there is a difference \nbetween the legislative calendar and the Executive calendar.\n  I respect my colleague from West Virginia. I can truthfully say I \nlove him because he has been a strong force around here for years, but \nI hope he will look at some of these examples I have given and some of \nthese thoughts I have and help us stop this impasse that is occurring \nin the Senate, not by preferring one party over the other but by \nbinding both parties to treat Presidential nominations with the respect \nthey deserve.\n  I have to say I never quite concentrated on this enough until these \njudicial nominations were filibustered in 2003 and 2004. I myself am to \nblame for not having thoroughly studied this until these problems \narose, but I have now studied it. I believe it would be far better for \nour Senate to get rid of these animosities and threats to have nuclear \nwarfare and bind both the Republicans and the Democrats in the Senate \nto do what is right, to give a vote up or down, so that we can not only \ngive advise but consent as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, freedom is a fragile thing and never more \nthan one generation away from extinction. It is not ours by \ninheritance; it must be fought for and defended constantly by each \ngeneration, for it comes only once to a people. Those who have known \nfreedom and then lost it have never known it again. These words come \nfrom the lips of former President Ronald Reagan.\n  I rise today to discuss freedom, not the grandiose worldwide \n``freedom talk'' one hears so much about. No. Not far-flung foreign \npolicy goals, but, rather, my concern today is preserving our freedoms \nright in our own backyard at home.\n  Freedom, like a good garden, needs constant tending. One must watch \nfor the worms in the wood. As Wendell Phillips, the abolitionist, \norator, and the columnist, once said, ``eternal vigilance is the price \nof liberty.'' One must pay the price if one wants the blessing.\n  In a culture where sports metaphors are more common public parlance \nthan historical analogies, our unique form of government, carefully \nrestraining powers while protecting rights, presents a special \nchallenge to maintain. The ``winning is everything'' philosophy so \nbeloved by Americans may, without careful balance, obscure the goal of \njustice for all that must be the aim of a representative democracy. \nDemeaning minority views, characterizing opposition as obstructionist--\nthese are first steps down the dark alley of subjugating rights.\n  Majorities can prevail by numerical force. They do not need \nprotection from minorities. Yet some would have us believe that \nminority voices threaten the larger public good in the case of \nPresidential judicial appointments. The opposite is true. It is \nminorities who are most in jeopardy without fairness from the Federal \nbench. I am talking about those who are in the minority. The \npersecuted, the disadvantaged, the poor, the downtrodden--these are the \nvery citizens who need the strong protection of an unbiased legal \nsystem.\n  Appointees to the Federal bench should be scrutinized for traces of \nideological rigidity or allegiance to political movements which could \ncloud impartial judgment. I for one do not favor activist judges of any \nstripe. I do not think the proper role for a judge is to make new law \nfrom the bench. My own preference is usually for strict \nconstitutionalists. Conservative judges can hold activist views, just \nas can liberal judges. Such labels tell us very little. What we should \nstrive for on the Federal bench is blind justice; that is, justice \nabsent a political agenda.\n  Judicial appointments must never be a sure thing for the bench simply \nbecause they please the majority party, whether that majority is \nDemocratic or Republican. Federal judges enjoy life tenure. Remember \nthat. Federal judges enjoy life tenure, making decisions of huge \nimportance to the lives and the livelihoods of our citizens. Are they \naccountable to anyone? No. They are accountable to no one, and no \nPresident can fire them. No President can say: Go home, you are sick \ntoday.\n  It is ridiculous to suggest that mere superiority of numbers in the \nSenate should alone guarantee confirmation to a Federal judgeship. Such \na claim reduces the constitutional advice and consent function of the \nSenate to a pro forma rubberstamping of Presidential judicial \nappointments whenever the President's party controls the Senate. We are \ntalking about a separate branch of the Federal Government. We are \ntalking about a separate branch of the\n\n[[Page S2414]]\n\nFederal Government here, which wields tremendous power.\n\n  There is no God-given right to a seat on the Federal bench--no God-\ngiven right. There is no God-given right to a seat on the Federal \nbench. Should a minority have only the recourse of delay to defeat a \njudicial candidate of concern, that minority is well within its rights \nto filibuster. In fact, the minority would be derelict in their duty if \nthey did not filibuster. There is no shortage of candidates for the \nFederal bench, no shortage. Another name can always be offered. Our aim \nshould be to select excellent judges acceptable across a wide spectrum \nof political views.\n  There was a time in this country when men and women of opposite \npolitical parties could reason together to achieve such goals. There \nwas a time when the concerns of honorable men and women serving in this \nSenate received the respect of fellow Members of the Senate, even \nthough they were in the minority. Now I am very sorry to observe the \nSenate and the country are so polarized--so polarized, so politicized--\nthat nearly all dissent is discarded as obstructionist and politically \nmotivated. ``Get out of the way'' is the cry. ``Get out of the way, get \nout of the way'' is the cry. Few take the time to consider other views.\n  If 41 Members of the Senate have objections to any judicial \ncandidate, perhaps those objections should be heeded. Those are 41 \nMembers. Perhaps that nominee should not serve. Forty-one Members, \nrepresenting at the very least the people of 21 States, at the very, \nvery least. Perhaps the minority is right. Perhaps the minority is \nright.\n  Senate service often reminds me of a game of ``red rover.'' We line \nup like two opposing camps and run as hard as we can at each other to \nscore points. The talk show mavens keep the fires fanned, and through \nthe din, honest discourse is nearly impossible. I worry. Oh, yes, I \nworry about a country whose major political pastime is not in finding \ncompromise but, rather, in seeking conflict. The people are not well \nserved. The courage to speak out about one's convictions is in scarcer \nand scarcer supply. Where, oh, where are the 21st century's profiles in \ncourage?\n  President John F. Kennedy's Pulitzer Prize-winning book ``Profiles in \nCourage'' lionized public servants who did not fear to stand alone, \nlike Senator George Norris of Nebraska. From 1806 to 1917, there was no \nability to invoke cloture in the Senate. Why 1806? Because that was \nwhen the rule was dropped from the Senate rules asking for the previous \nquestion, which would shut off debate. Therefore, it was really from \n1789 to 1917 that there was no ability to invoke cloture in the Senate. \nBut, in 1917, a cloture rule passed after a filibuster by 12 determined \nSenators who opposed U.S. intervention in World War I. That debate \nbegan when President Wilson asked Congress for the authority to arm \nU.S. merchant ships against Germany. The House of Representatives \npassed Wilson's bill, the ``Armed Ship'' bill, by a vote of 403 to 13. \nBut a handful of determined Senators who opposed U.S. intervention in \nWorld War I, including Republican George W. Norris of Nebraska, \nlaunched a filibuster with far-reaching consequences.\n\n  George Norris's filibuster killed President Wilson's bill, though \nWilson resurrected its contents by Executive order shortly after the \nfilibuster ended.\n  I was born during the administration of Woodrow Wilson.\n  Nebraskans and, in essence, all States, the entire nation, were \nconsumed with rage at George Norris because of public disclosure that \nGermany had promised Mexico several United States States if Mexico \nwould align itself with Germany in war against the United States.\n  Well, there was a huge din, a huge outcry. The New York Times called \nNorris and others ``perverse and disloyal obstructionists.'' Does that \nrecall anything of present-day vintage to Senators? The New York Times \ncalled Norris and others ``perverse and disloyal obstructionists'' and \neditorialized that:\n\n       . . . the odium of treasonable purpose will rest upon their \n     names forevermore. The Hartford Courant called them \n     ``political tramps.'' The New York Sun called them ``a group \n     of moral perverts.'' The Providence Journal called their \n     action ``little short of treason'' and the Portland Free \n     Press said they should be ``driven from public life.''\n\n  Senator George W. Norris, the Nebraskan from the heart of America, \nsuffered merciless abuse, vicious invective and public scorn, tarred by \npublic sentiment, savaged by a strident press and the grip of a public \nfilled with hate of Germany and the start of World War I. Yet he was \nand is an American hero. George Norris was ``fearful of the broad grant \nof authority'' that President Wilson sought to go to war, and resentful \nof the manner in which that authority was being ``steamrolled'' through \nthe Congress.\n  Oh, how history repeats itself. How history repeats itself.\n  In Senator Norris's words:\n\n       I will not, even at the behest of a unanimous constituency, \n     violate my oath of office by voting in favor of a proposition \n     that means the surrender by Congress of its sole right to \n     declare war. . . . I am, however, so firmly convinced of the \n     righteousness of my course that I believe if the intelligence \n     and patriotic citizenship of the country can only have an \n     opportunity to hear both sides of the question, all the money \n     in Christendom and all the political machinery that wealth \n     can congregate will not be able to defeat the principle of \n     government for which our forefathers fought.\n\n  That was George Norris speaking.\n  When George Norris went home to explain why he had filibustered in \nthe face of universal criticism, he sought an open meeting in Lincoln, \nNE.\n  ``I had expected an unfriendly audience,'' Norris wrote, ``And,'' he \nsaid, ``it was with some fear that I stepped forward. When I stepped \nout on the stage, there was a deathlike silence.''\n  Senator Norris began, President Kennedy tells us, by stating simply: \n``I have come home to tell you the truth.''\n  After more than an hour, the crowd in Lincoln, NE, Kennedy wrote, \nroared its approval.\n  Many have written extensively and with legitimate fear of what could \nhappen if men without the courage of their convictions simply sat back \nand let themselves be swept away by a powerful majority, including \nGeorge Orwell, writing of the horrors of power run rampant, of a world \nrun by ``thought police'' who seek to control not just information but \nthe speech and thoughts of every individual citizen. In ``1984'' Orwell \nrecorded what life would be like under the thumb of Big Brother, with \nno autonomy of thought or speech.\n\n  George Orwell's fictional warning against Big Brother should \nencourage us all to ponder, to cherish and to protect our precious \nfreedom--our precious freedom to think and speak freely. And the means \nto that end is protecting the right to dissent. Orwell said of liberty:\n\n       If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to \n     tell people what they do not want to hear.\n\n  That right will be in jeopardy if a misguided attempt to eliminate \nthe filibuster succeeds.\n  Robert Caro, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his renowned book about \nLyndon B. Johnson, made Orwell's point in a letter to the Senate Rules \nCommittee in June 2003.\n\n       Many times in America's history the right of extended \n     debate has been used to defend causes with which I profoundly \n     disagree. Nonetheless, great care should be taken in placing \n     new restrictions on that right. Senators who are considering \n     doing so should understand that they will be taking a step \n     that has significant implications for the balance of powers \n     created under the Constitution, and also for another \n     fundamental concern in a democracy: the balance between \n     majority and minority rights.\n\n  Caro stressed that the Framers gave the Senate strong protections \nfrom transient public passions or executive pressures and that the \nConstitutional Convention kept the Senate small so that it would have, \nin Madison's words:\n\n       [less propensity] to yield to the impulse of sudden and \n     violent passions, and to be seduced by factious leaders into \n     intemperate and pernicious resolutions.\n\n  Madison believed:\n\n       . . . there are more instances of the abridgement of \n     freedoms of the people by gradual and silent encroachment of \n     those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations.\n\n  Madison was right. The loss of freedom will not come as a \nthunderclap. I say again, the loss of freedom will not come as a \nthunderclap from Heaven. Rather, if it goes away, it will slip silently \naway from us, little by little, like so many grains of sand sliding \nsoftly through an hourglass.\n  The curbing of speech in the Senate on judicial nominations will most \ncertainly evolve to an eventual elimination of the right of extended \ndebate.\n\n[[Page S2415]]\n\nAnd that will spur intimidation and the steady withering of dissent. An \neagerness to win--win elections, win every judicial nomination, \noverpower enemies, real or imagined, with brute force--holds the poison \nseeds of destruction of free speech and the decimation of minority \nrights.\n  The ultimate perpetrator of tyranny in this world is the urge by the \npowerful to prevail at any cost. A free forum where the minority can \nrise to loudly call a halt to the ambitions of an overzealous majority \nmust be maintained. We must never surrender that forum--this forum--the \nSenate, to the tyranny of any majority.\n  When Aaron Burr said farewell to the Senate, he urged the Senate to \ndo away with the Senate rule that would close debate on the previous \nquestion. That previous question has seldom been used in the short \ntime. And in 1806, the Senate carried out the will of Aaron Burr.\n\n       This house is a sanctuary; a citadel of law, of order and \n     of liberty; and it is here--it is here, in this exalted \n     refuge; here, if anywhere, will resistance be made to the \n     storms of political phrensy and the silent arts of \n     corruption; and if the Constitution--\n\n  This Constitution.\n\n     --and if the Constitution be destined ever to perish by the \n     sacrilegious hands of demagogue or the usurper, which God \n     avert, its expiring agonies will be witnessed on this floor.\n\n  On March 2, 1805, Aaron Burr stated that prophetic warning.\n  The so-called nuclear option, if successful, will begin the slow and \nagonizing death spiral of freedom, speech, and dissent, and it will be \nwitnessed on this floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). There is 9 minutes 40 seconds \nremaining in total to the minority.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, I came to the floor today to talk about \nbankruptcy reform and the need to enact legislation dealing with \nbankruptcy reform. Before I do that, given the comments of our esteemed \nleaders, Senator Byrd and Senator Hatch, I feel compelled to say \nsomething first with respect to judicial nominations.\n  This 109th Congress, in my view, has begun with much promise. We have \ntaken steps to begin to restore a sense of balance in our legal \nsystems--the system of civil justice to make sure that little people \nharmed by big companies have a chance to band together and be made \nwhole, and at the same time make sure that companies defended in class \naction lawsuits have a fair trial in a court where the deck is not \nstacked against them.\n  We are on the verge of passing significant and needed bankruptcy \nreform legislation. A conference on energy policy is taking place that \nwill reduce our dependence on foreign oil, which has the promise also \nof increasing our reliance on renewable forms of energy and cleaning up \nour air, reducing sulfur dioxide emissions, nitrogen dioxide, mercury, \nand even carbon dioxide.\n  We have just reported out of the Finance Committee legislation that \nwill better ensure that work pays more than welfare to help people make \nthat transition from welfare to work. We are close to consensus on \noverhauling our postal system and taking the 1970s model created under \nthe leadership of Senator Stevens--who has joined us on the floor--to \nbring that into the 21st century.\n  There is much promise. There is much that can be done and ought to be \ndone.\n\n  I fear that we are approaching a precipice that we may fall off--both \nparties, Democrats and Republicans--which is going to render us unable \nto achieve what I think would be a very fruitful session in this \nCongress. Reason must prevail here. Democrats will not always be in the \nminority; the Republicans will not always be in the majority; \nRepublicans will not always hold the White House. We have to figure out \nsome way to work through our divisions on the nomination of judges.\n  It is sort of ironic in the first term of President Bush's \nadministration that 95 percent of his nominees were approved, compared \nto President Clinton's success rate of about 80 percent over the 8 \nyears he served.\n  We need to be able to establish a system of checks and balances. We \ndon't want to be obstructionists; we don't want one party to basically \ncall the shots in the executive and legislative branches, and stack the \ndecks in our courts.\n  I encourage our leaders, as I have done privately, Senator Reid and \nSenator Frist, to sit down--if they have done it, to do so again--and \nhave a heart to heart.\n  I urge colleagues on both sides of the aisle who want this place to \nwork, who want us to do the people's business, to work and find a way \nout of this bind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/10/senate-section/article/S2415-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2415-S2416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BANKRUPTCY REFORM\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to talk about \nbankruptcy reform legislation.\n  Much has been said about the bill that is before us. Let me say a few \nthings as well.\n  Two years ago, roughly 83 Senators voted in favor of an overhaul of \nour Nation's bankruptcy laws. As you may know, under current law, \npeople who do not have the ability to pay their debts can go into \nchapter 7 and their debts are largely forgiven. They may have to turn \nover some of their assets. That is chapter 7. If the court of \nbankruptcy believes a family has the ability to repay some of their \ndebts, they go into chapter 13, if a payment schedule is worked out.\n  Concerns have been raised, justifiably, over the last decade or more \nthat some people who have the ability to repay don't; they simply run \nup their debts and walk away from those obligations, and, frankly, \nleave the rest of us having to pay more interest on the consumer debt \nwe acquire and to pay more for the goods and services we buy.\n  Bankruptcy laws exist for a good purpose. People do have disasters \nthat come into their lives; marriages end, serious health problems \noccur, and people lose jobs. For those reasons, we have bankruptcy \nlaws. Most people who file for bankruptcy are not trying to defraud \nanybody. They have a genuine emergency, or a huge problem in their \nlife, and they need the protection of the bankruptcy court. That is why \nwe have those laws.\n  There is a principle, whether you are for this bill or not, that I \nthink we can all agree on. That principle is simply this: If a person \nor a family has the ability to repay a portion or all of their debts, \nif they have that financial wherewithal, they should repay a portion or \nall of their debts. If a family doesn't have that wherewithal to pay or \nbegin repaying their debt, they should be accorded protection of the \nbankruptcy court. That is it; it is that simple.\n  The legislation we have before us is an effort to try to codify that \nprinciple, and to improve on the system today where too many people, \nfrankly, have abused that system.\n\n  Much has been said about credit card banks and putting credit cards \nin the hands of people, encouraging them to use them. I have heard from \nmy credit card banks. They would like to see this legislation adopted. \nI have heard more from my credit unions in Delaware than I have from \nthe credit card banks, saying there is a problem and it is one that we \nneed to address.\n  I want to consider for a moment what will happen, or continue to \nhappen, if we don't enact this legislation.\n  No. 1, some people who ought to be repaying a portion of their debts \ndo not.\n  No. 2, the folks who ought to be receiving childcare from parents who \nare not anxious to meet that obligation will not receive that childcare \npayment. Their biological parent will file for bankruptcy in an effort \nto avoid making that childcare payment, or to make an alimony payment. \nIn fact, the way the current law is structured, when somebody is in a \nposition to start paying their responsibilities or obligations, legal \nfees come ahead of childcare and come ahead of alimony. That is wrong.\n  Today, under current law, a wealthy individual in a State such as \nFlorida or Texas can go out, if they are a millionaire, and take those \nmillions of dollars and invest that money in real estate, a huge house, \nproperty, and land in the\n\n[[Page S2416]]\n\nState, file for bankruptcy, and basically protect all of their assets \nwhich they own because of a provision in Florida and Texas law. \nHomestead exemptions exist in other States as well. People can put \nmoney in trusts today and tomorrow file for bankruptcy and know that \nall the millions of dollars they put in those trusts can be protected \nfrom bankruptcy. That is wrong.\n  With the legislation we have before us, someone has to figure out \nthat 2\\1/2\\ years ahead of time people are going to want to file for \nbankruptcy and be smart enough to put the money into a home, or an \nestate, or into a trust--not something you can do today--and file for \nbankruptcy tomorrow; or this year and file for bankruptcy next year or \nthe next 2 or 3 years, or 3\\1/2\\ years. It is a much better approach. \nI, frankly, would like to see a cap on the homestead exemption. I voted \nfor one yesterday. It didn't prevail. It should have.\n  What is in this current bill is a heck of a lot better than it is in \nthe law that exists today. Here is how this bill would work. For people \nwhose median family income is under 100 percent of median family \nincome, those families for the most part will be able to file for \nbankruptcy and go into chapter 7 bankruptcy without a whole lot of \nfuss.\n  What is median family income? In my State, it is about $72,000. \nNationally, median family income is about $65,000 for a family of four. \nIt varies from there. It can be as low as $48,000 or $49,000 for a \nfamily of four in Mississippi, up to $80,000 in States such as \nConnecticut and others. But it is a range from the high forties to the \nlow eighties for median family income.\n  For folks whose income is below 100 percent of median family income, \nthey go into chapter 7 pretty much without a lot of dispute. However, \nfor those families whose income is above median income, above $72,000, \nthey would have to go through a means test. That is not a bad thing to \ndo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to talk about the most vulnerable \npeople who go into bankruptcy; they are single women with children. \nThere is $95 million a year in unpaid alimony and child support. When \nthese women marry--or divorced women end up in bankruptcy, they end up \nin the harsh provisions of this legislation. That is wrong. These are \npeople who are trying. They are working hard. They are playing by the \nrules, and they wouldn't be in bankruptcy if their husbands had paid. \nWhy we ought to treat them harshly as this bill does is wrong.\n  This amendment which I have introduced with the Senator from \nConnecticut, Senator Dodd, makes sure that we are going to treat them \nfairly under this provision.\n  I hope the Senate will accept it.\n  I yield 30 seconds to the Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. He \nmakes a point. Next year, more than 1 million single women will file \nfor bankruptcy in the United States. Most of them are women with \nchildren, significant numbers of children. This is far too harsh for \nthis constituency.\n  We urge adoption of the Kennedy amendment. It is only right and only \nfair and ought to be done to provide relief to these people under the \nbankruptcy system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, workers in this country have hit a \nperfect storm with the decline in manufacturing, the outsourcing of \njobs, and the increasing of part-time work. This has fallen \ndisproportionately on African Americans and Latinos. The unemployment \nrate for Latinos has increased by 40 percent in recent years. It has \nincreased by 31 percent with African Americans. If you are a Latino \nhomeowner, you are 250 percent more likely\n\n[[Page S2417]]\n\nthan White homeowners to go into bankruptcy. African-American \nhomeowners are 690 percent more likely to go into bankruptcy.\n  All this amendment says is that those individuals can still go into \nbankruptcy, but they will not be caught up in the harsher provisions of \nthis bankruptcy act. It would be enormously unfair, unjust, and \ndiscriminatory. That is what this amendment does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

There will now be 2 minutes of \ndebate equally divided on the Akaka amendment No. 105.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, the bankruptcy bill does not allow \nconsumers to declare personal bankruptcy, in either chapter 7 or \nchapter 13, unless they receive a briefing from an approved nonprofit \ncredit counseling agency within 6 months of filing for bankruptcy.\n  About one-third of all credit counseling consumers enter into a debt \nmanagement plan. In exchange, creditors can agree to offer concessions \nto consumers to pay off as many of their debts as possible. However, \nmost credit card companies have become increasingly unwilling to \nsignificantly reduce interest rates for consumers in credit counseling.\n  My amendment would prevent unsecured creditors, primarily credit card \nissuers, from attempting to collect accruing interest and additional \nfees from consumers in credit counseling.\n  As a show of support for the effectiveness of sound consumer credit \ncounseling, especially as an alternative to bankruptcy, credit card \nissuers should waive the amount owned in interest and fees for \nconsumers who enter a consolidated payment plan. Successful completion \nof a debt management plan benefits both creditors and consumers. For \nmany consumers, paying off debt is not easy, and my amendment seeks to \nhelp these struggling individuals.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment to help consumers \nenrolled in debt management plans to successfully repay their \ncreditors, free themselves from debt, and avoid bankruptcy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the amendment of the Senator from Hawaii \nis dressed up as a credit counseling amendment, but it would cause \nhavoc in our modern consumer credit system. It requires that a lender \nstop charging interest on the outstanding debt of any bankrupt debtor \nwho participates in a debt management program. The practical result is \nthat lenders are forced to either waive further payments on an \nextension of credit or have the debt discharged in bankruptcy. This \nwill not be good for the consumer, the borrower.\n  This is a sweeping change in modern banking practices. We have had no \nhearings in the Senate Banking Committee. I ask my colleagues to oppose \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to Akaka amendment \nNo. 105.\n  Mr. AKAKA.

Mr. President, in past weeks I have come to the floor to \nreport on the tremendous job that America and other allies did in \nassisting relief from the devastating tsunami that struck in Indonesia, \nMalaysia, and Thailand last December. Later I spoke about the very \npromising development of broad-based support for moderate Islam among \nleaders in Southeast Asia. The constructive work being done there is an \nextremely important counter to the Wahabiism strain of Islam teaching \nwhich subverts the teaching of a peaceful religion to promote terrorist \nattacks on any and all\n\n[[Page S2418]]\n\nwho are regarded as infidels. In addition, Hadhari, or ``civilization'' \nIslam, preaches fair and equal treatment for women and tolerance of \nviews of other religions.\n  As former President Richard Nixon detailed in one of his last books \nbefore his death, developing strong and supportive relationships with \nmoderate Islamic countries is of critical interest to the United \nStates. He had warned of the dangers of radical Islam teachings even \nbefore we experienced the overseas terrorist attacks against Americans \nin the 1990s, culminating in the massive attacks of September 11, 2001, \non our homeland.\n  In this area, former President Nixon was prescient, and laid out an \nimportant principle for us to follow today. With Southeast Asia and its \nlarge Muslim population as the second front in the war on terror, we \nhave the opportunity through constructive engagement to help those \ncountries win their wars on terrorism without the need for massive \nmilitary actions such as we have undertaken in Afghanistan and Iraq to \nroot out governments that harbor terrorists.\n  As President Bush said in his State of the Union speech, fostering \nand encouraging the development of democratic, free societies \nthroughout the world is not only an humanitarium imperative for us, it \nis also in our own security interest because free governments, \ndemocratically elected, as much less likely to engage in aggressive \nmilitary action against their neighbors, and threaten peace and \nsecurity in the world. In addition, with the proper diplomatic, \neconomic, and strategic support, we can help those governments as they \nfight to eliminate the threat of terrorist activities within their \nborders.\n  In a region previously dominated by monarchies, communist rule, and \nautocratic governments, democracy is making strides in Southeast Asia. \nAs in all evolutions of democratic societies, the progress is not \nwithout its stumbles, its reverses, and occasionally undesirable \nresults from the democratic process. Southeast Asia still has \nsignificant problem areas where democracy and human rights are not \nflourishing. As Natan Sharansky has said in his book The Case for \nDemocracy, and in his presentation to Senators here in the Capitol on \nFebruary 9th, the difference between a free society and a fear society \ncan be measured by the town square test. Can a citizen go to the town \nsquare and express opposition and criticism of the government without \nfear of reprisal?\n  Southeast Asia has glaring examples of the fear society, which is the \nopposite of the free society in Sharansky's terms. Communist North \nVietnam has shown some interest in economic development and some \ntolerance of free markets, but it is far from a free society. According \nto the measurements of Freedom House--which views political and civil \nfreedoms--other countries regarded as not free are Laos, Cambodia, and \nBrunei. The worst offender in the Freedom House rankings, and in my own \nview, is the state of Myanmar, which we previously knew as Burma. That \ncountry has gained international attention for its arrest, \nimprisonment, and abuse of Aung San Suu Kyi, that country's leading \npolitical opposition leader.\n  Most recently, Thailand--among the most free and open societies in \nall of Asia--overwhelmingly re-elected the government of Prime Minister \nThaksin Shinawantra, a very successful business man with strong \nmanagerial skills. Personally, I was relieved to see that apparently \nthere was no weight given to his opponent's charges that I personally \nhad lobbied Thaksin and convinced him to allow the introduction of \nbiotechnology through genetically modified food products into Thailand. \nIn truth, on my visits to Thailand with world renowned plant \nbiotechnology leader, Dr. Roger Beachy of the Danforth Plant Science \nCenter in Saint Louis, Missouri, we and our Ambassador discussed with \nthe Prime Minister making available the resources of our bio-technology \nregulatory agencies in the U.S. so that Thai scientists and officials \nwould have the technical capacity to make judgments for themselves \nabout the safety of proposed bio-technology plantings and GMO food \nproducts, which hold tremendous promise to cure crop and plant disease \nin Southeast Asia, to feed the countries throughout the world and \nperhaps deliver vital vaccines to less developed countries.\n  In Indonesia, the voters have elected a new President Susilo Bambang \nYudhoyono who is committed to operating a corruption-free government, \ndedicated to recognition of human rights, free markets, and civilian \ncontrol of the military with full protections for the civilian \npopulation. It is worth noting that the President, popularly known as \nSBY, participated in the last International Military Education and \nTraining program--IMET--with our military at Fort Leavenworth, KS \nbefore Congress effectively cut off IMET participation for Indonesia \nmilitary leaders. He also received a Masters' Degree from Webster \nUniversity in Kansas City, MO. In Malaysia, the newly-elected Prime \nMinister Abdullah Badawi--of whom I spoke previously--noting his \nsupport for Hadhari Islam, has taken steps to rid his government of the \nfavoritism and corruption of the previous administration, which sapped \nthe economic growth potential of that very prosperous country.\n  In the Philippines, popularly-elected President Gloria Arroyo is \nfacing challenges within her own government, but she has been \ndemocratically elected and brought major change in the life of that \ncountry following the corruption and abuses of Ferdinand Marcos.\n  Singapore has a new Prime Minister, Lee Hsien-Long, who is the son of \nthe long-time ruling figure in Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, now known as \nthe Minister Mentor. Although some have charged that it is highly \nunlikely that the people of Singapore could choose a candidate not \nassociated with the Ruling Party, I believe that Singapore would pass \nNatan Sharansky's test of a free society rather than a fear society on \nthe town forum test. In addition, Singapore has been one of our \nstaunchest allies strategically, economically, and in the war on \nterrorism. When the United States military forces were booted out of \nthe Philippines, Singapore responded by developing a deepwater port \nwhere our large warships could dock and refuel and resupply. They moved \nvery swiftly to crack down on terror rings including the very dangerous \nJemaah Islamiyah, JI, when they discovered threats against United \nStates and Australia Embassies in that country. In addition, we have \nrecently completed the first Free Trade Agreement in Asia with the \nSingaporeans.\n  In addition to supporting democracies and free societies and fighting \nterrorism, the United States has a very significant strategic interest \nin Southeast Asia. As many leaders in that region have told me, \nprivately, they are concerned that the United States active engagement \nand association with those countries is essential to stop China from \nextending hegemony over the region. China has made many moves recently \neconomically to gain control over the markets of Southeast Asia with \noffers of free trade and other inducements. In addition, China has \nflexed its muscle in the region by military maneuvers in the South \nChina Sea to lay claim potentially to the significant petroleum \nreserves in that area.\n  States of Southeast Asia, notably Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia, \ncontrol the important Malacca Straits through which one quarter of all \nthe shipping in the world passes, and one half of the petroleum \nproducts carried by ocean-going vessels pass.\n  The Southeast Asia nations which have been generally supportive of \nthe United States stand in contrast to the People's Republic of China, \nwhich has long opposed our efforts against terrorism and may be \nengaging in proliferation of nuclear and missile technology. The \ninfluence of China can be seen already in support for lifting United \nNations sanctions and the Arms Embargo of China. There are many who \nfeel that China may be building military capability which could be a \nthreat to world peace and security as well as to the United States--all \nthe more reason to prevent excessive China influence or control in \nSoutheast Asia.\n  In addition to our strategic interests, Southeast Asia is a very \nimportant economic trading partner for the United States. Malaysia is \nour tenth largest export market and ASEAN has passed Japan and is now \nthe United States' third largest trading partner; two-way trade stands \nat $120 billion. In 2003 United States exports to Singapore\n\n[[Page S2419]]\n\nwere $19 billion, to Malaysia over $17 billion. Although Thailand with \n$6.8 billion imports from the United States, the Philippines with $5.4 \nbillion, and Indonesia with $2.8 billion, are relatively smaller, they \nalso offer opportunities with economic progress to be much more \nsignificant trading partners with us.\n  Farmers in Missouri and throughout the Midwest felt the severe pain \nof the collapse of the Southeast Asia markets in 1997 and in 1998. Our \nprevious $12 billion a year agricultural exports in the mid-1990s \ndropped to almost nothing during that period. The impact of that on \nfarm prices in the agricultural heartland was extremely harsh. Farmers \nsuffered significant losses of income, and rural communities dependent \nupon agriculture felt the pain, everywhere from equipment dealers to \nretails stores. Missouri farmers have been very relieved to see the \neconomies, and, thus, the demand for agricultural products recover in \nthe ASEAN region.\n  At the same time we have good economic ties with the region the \nUnited States has image problems that cannot be ignored. The problems \nwith the United States start with its support for Israel in its battle \nwith the Palestinians and its invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq. This \nhas brought great concern in Muslim countries and the former Malaysian \nPrime Minister, Mahathir Mohammed--the first Muslim to come to his \nUnited States Embassy to register his sympathies after the September \n11, 2001 attack--became an even harsher critic of the United States \nwhen we took the battle against terrorism to Afghanistan and then to \nIraq. Previously, I and other members of the Senate, had heard him \ndeliver in the mid-1990s stinging criticism of the United States and \nother peoples with light skin--especially Jews--for currency \nmanipulation which he felt had brought on the collapse of the Thai baht \nwhich triggered the Asian economic collapse and problems with his \ncurrency in Malaysia.\n  There is also the inevitable reaction against a very large and \npowerful country when we have a presence in the region such as we did \nduring the tsunami relief efforts. At the time we deployed our aircraft \ncarrier strike force with the helicopters and marine copter ship with \ntroops to the region, a very good friend of America in the region told \nme the United States needed to ``tiptoe'' coming into the region. I \nnoted to him it was difficult to tiptoe when you have to bring an \naircraft carrier strike force with helicopters into a region to provide \nthe airlift and the personnel needed for vital relief. I noted his \nconcerns and passed them along to our forces who did leave as soon as \nthe mission was completed.\n  Our friend also suggested the U.N. should play a larger role or at \nleast be perceived as playing a larger role. Upon investigation I \nlearned that might be rather difficult. The first appearances of the \nU.N. officials in the region were to hold news a conference to \ncriticize the United States for doing nothing. As we would say back \nhome, they came with big hats but no cattle.\n  Some 17 days after the tsunami, the first U.N. operation, a World \nHealth Organization medical team, showed up and our airlift transported \nhim to the site where they set up operations. The fact remains that the \nUnited States and allied governments in the region and volunteer forces \nwere the ones who arrived at a critically important time to save the \nlives of perhaps tens of thousands who lived through the tsunami but \nwere threatened by death and disease or starvation.\n  Within 6 days of the tsunami, Navy and Marine helicopters were \ndelivering lifesaving food, water, and medical attention to isolated \nareas all along the west coast of northern Sumatra.\n  I might also say there is a perceived racist undertone and some \nresentment of the United States. As I mentioned, in 1996 I was part of \na Senatorial delegation attending the Asia Pacific dialog conference in \nMalaysia. Unfortunately, we had to sit through a 25-minute attack by \nPrime Minister Mahathir who placed the problems of his country at the \nfeet of Jews, Americans, and other Caucasians who he said did not care \nabout brown-skinned people--obviously, a very unpleasant message. At \nleast one of my colleagues vowed he would never travel halfway around \nthe world again to hear such accusations.\n  The larger problem, of course, in the Muslim region has been the \nUnited States support of Israel and the conduct of the wars in \nAfghanistan and Iraq where many are concerned that the United States is \nconducting war on Islam, not on radical terrorists. These concerns have \nbeen partially and somewhat temporarily relieved by the extraordinary \ntsunami relief effort, but the scholars in the region, people whose \njudgment I respect, think this improvement will not last long without \nsignificant continuing efforts.\n  As I have said, the most obvious problem we have with Indonesia has \nbeen a congressionally imposed restriction on military assistance in \nIndonesia. These restrictions were first imposed in response to abuses \nby the Indonesian military, TNI, during the 1990s in brutally \nrepressing the unrest in East Timor, leading to the establishment of a \nseparate state in East Timor. Subsequent human rights abuses occurred \nin other areas under the authoritarian rule of President Suharto. But \nwith a newly elected President SBY, who is working to gain control over \nthe military and install appropriate respect for human rights and \ncivilian control of the military, the time has come, in my view, to \nassist in that effort by reestablishing full participation for the \nIndonesian military and our International Military Education and \nTraining Program.\n\n  Secretary Rice has taken the first step by clearing the way for \nresumption of full IMET participation by Indonesia. ``IMET for \nIndonesia is in the United States' interests,'' Secretary Rice said to \nthe Committee on Foreign Affairs. I agree. I look forward to working \nwith her and this body to expand the opportunity for IMET training.\n  Not only, however, are we missing an opportunity to help Indonesia on \nits path to appropriately constrain military force, the sanctions have \nraised strong reactions from democratically elected members of the \nIndonesia parliament. Defense Minister Sudarsono stated that if the \nUnited States does not change its position, Indonesia would look \nelsewhere for assistance and alliance. Some members of parliament urged \nhim not to solicit or accept the United States' assistance, but their \nposition, fortunately, still does not appear to be the controlling view \nin the Government of Indonesia.\n  Some opponents of increased IMET participation for Indonesia are \ncharging that the TNI was responsible for murders of Americans at the \nTamika Mine. Our FBI, our own U.S. FBI, was deployed to the area and \nconducted an investigation in conjunction with the Indonesian forces. \nThe FBI has concluded that the murders were committed by an Indonesian \nseparatist who thought he was killing TNI members. That individual is \nstill being sought, and we hope he will be brought to justice in the \nnear future.\n  Obviously, I think that expanding military-to-military relations with \nIndonesia is the first and most important and obvious step we can take \nto improve relations. Beyond that, however, there is work to be done to \nwork more closely with our friends in southeast Asia in providing \ntechnical assistance and tsunami relief efforts to help rebuild water \ninfrastructure and other needed facilities.\n  Another tremendous concern is itself a compelling reason for the \nUnited States to pursue an active foreign policy with Indonesia; that \nis, the threat to democracy from political groups that may espouse an \nextreme form of Islam. After the fall of the Suharto regime, an \nauthoritarian government, the people of Indonesia have embraced \ndemocracy. In Congress, Indonesia does not get the credit it deserves \nfor moving so quickly down the path of democratic government.\n  With the election of President SBY, Indonesia just experienced its \nfourth peaceful democratic transfer of power. Voter participation in \nIndonesia, approximately 80 percent, should be the envy of us in the \nUnited States. However, the voice of extreme Islam is working through \nthe political system, through activists and politically oriented \ngroups, to spread their influence. Their presence is small but growing. \nIn 2004, 79 percent of their voters cast their vote for a secular \nparty, but that is down from 84 percent in 1999.\n  There are groups such as the Justice and Prosperity Party that is \ngrowing by taking a hard line against the corruption of the past \nadministration, and\n\n[[Page S2420]]\n\nit has participated in tsunami relief and other charitable activities. \nThe party is gaining influence among those in Indonesia. But there are \nalso elements in the party in the past who have expressed a desire for \nan Islamic State and feel that Islam suffered a setback as well as \nIndonesia suffering an economic setback during the secular dictatorship \nof Suharto in the ensuing years.\n\n  There is a danger of the spread of radical Islam, whether it be in \nthe madrasas or the political arena, the anti-western strain of this \nintolerant form of Islam, or other activities. I believe, as I have \noutlined previously, there are courageous and determined people in \nIndonesia fighting to ensure the future of the country as a democracy \nand one that values the principle of freedom known in secular \ngovernment. We must remain engaged so their struggle prevails.\n  The bigger picture requires active engagement with Southeast Asian \ncountries seeking the path of democracy, human rights, and economic \nfreedom. In my view, the best forms of assistance we can provide are \neconomic participation by American companies in the region and \neducational exchanges. These were actually identified by the U.S. \nAgency for International Development Woods Report of the early 1990s \nwhich said that economic investment, trade, and education were the most \neffective ways of strengthening the relations and building the \neconomies of developing countries. I believe that report was accurate, \nand I think it is the path for our participation in Southeast Asia.\n  For example, in my recent visit to Malaysia, many leaders we spoke to \nwere concerned that fewer Malaysian students are now studying in the \nUnited States than in the past. I believe this educational exchange is \nextremely valuable for us as well as for students. I hope we can \nencourage more American colleges and educational foundations to \nincrease their support for educational exchanges.\n  As noted above, however, I believe we must deal with military \nrestrictions and use our IMET programs and other collaborative efforts \nas a means of assisting Indonesia, as well as other countries in the \narea, to work in a constructive fashion with our military in observing \nhuman rights and civilian control in that country.

This law has caused a tremendous uproar in Taiwan. Taiwan's \nforeign minister and chairman of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council have \nboth denounced the law as a unilateral act on the part of China. It \nwill cause tensions in the Taiwan Strait to rise and may have serious \nconsequences for future Taiwan-China relations.\n  I agree with the assessment that China is seeking to change \nunilaterally the status quo in the Taiwan Strait. China seems to have \nabandoned any attempt at future dialogue between the two sides and \nseeks to impose this law on the 23 million people of Taiwan. Chinese \nassumptions are that Taiwan and China are now already unified and that \nChina has jurisdiction over Taiwan, especially the authority to serve \npenalty and punishment to Taiwanese people and their leaders. China has \nignored the fact that Taiwan and China have been two separate political \nentities since 1949 and neither has jurisdiction over the other. China, \ntherefore, has no right to carry out punishment to Taiwanese people and \nleaders whenever China sees fit.\n  Predictably, Taiwanese people are outraged by the latest Chinese act \nand ask the international community to oppose China's new law. So far, \nwith a wait-and-see attitude, the international community has remained \nquiet on the subject. It is important that we not appease China.\n  Inaction of the international community will send a dangerous signal \nand will further encourage China to indulge in its political rhetoric \nand war-like actions. We must single out the dangers inherent in \nChina's new law, whose enactment will totally discourage the Taiwanese \npeople from seeking a peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue. Now is not \nthe time to empower China to prepare for military conflicts across the \nTaiwan Strait, just as the EU stands to do by lifting the Chinese Arms \nEmbargo.\n  In this era of global terrorism and natural catastrophes, war is the \nlast thing we would like to see in the Asia-Pacific region. I urge all \nAmericans and the international community to oppose China's enactment \nof the antisecession law, and I plead with both Chinese and Taiwanese \nleaders not to resort to any extreme measures and not to make a bad \nsituation worse. Both sides should allow tempers to cool and keep \ndialogues open.\n  May the Lunar New Year bring good will to the Chinese and Taiwanese \npeoples and may they continue to maintain peace and stability in the \nTaiwan Strait.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are in morning \nbusiness until 2 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for those who do not follow the debate in \nthe Senate very closely, this 500-page bill has been the subject of our \ndebate and discussion for the last 2 weeks. It is likely to be \nconcluded today with a vote, and the vote is likely to be in favor of \nthis legislation.\n  It is about bankruptcy law. It is something everyone dreads the \nthought of, that you would reach a point in life where you have more \ndebts than assets, and finally say: I have to go to court and ask for \nhelp.\n  But bankruptcy is an institution created by Western civilized society \nto respond to a terrible injustice. There was a time in this world when \nif you were deeply in debt, you ended up deeply in jail--debtors' \nprison--put in an unconscionable situation where you could not pay your \nbills and, once in prison, did not have any place to turn.\n  We decided that in a more civilized society we would acknowledge the \nfact that through misfortune or miscalculation some people reach a \npoint where they do not have enough money to pay their bills. And if \nthey are prepared to go into a bankruptcy court, file extensive \ndocumentation to establish their debt and their assets, the court may \nconsider discharging them in bankruptcy. As a result of that discharge, \npeople lose most of what they have on Earth, but also walk away from \ntheir debts and have a chance for a fresh start, for a new day.\n  That is something that has been in the law for a long time. The law \nhas been amended over the years. We have chapter 7, where you walk out \nof the bankruptcy court with your debts behind you. Chapter 13 is where \nan individual tries to repay, says to the court: I don't want to be \nfound to be bankrupt. I am willing to work out with my creditors a \nrepayment schedule. That is what chapter 13 does. So you try to take a \nlimited amount of money and pay it out over a period of time.\n  For years and years the credit card companies and big banks have \nsaid: We want to change this law. Too many people are going to \nbankruptcy court. The numbers range from 1.3 million to 1.5 million \neach year, but there is no doubt the numbers are going up.\n  The credit industry argues: Too many people are in bankruptcy court, \nand as a consequence, we should limit the opportunity for bankruptcy. \nSo for almost 10 years they have been pushing for this bill--year after \nyear after year.\n\n[[Page S2421]]\n\nToday their prayers will be answered. This bill will pass the Senate. \nIt will glide right through the House of Representatives and be signed \nby the President in a hurry. What it will mean is that many of the \npeople walking into bankruptcy court are now going to face new hurdles, \nnew obstacles, new paperwork, new legal costs to file for bankruptcy, \nand at the end of the day many of them will not have their debts \nerased. Many of them will find they have to continue to keep paying on \nthose debts for a long period of time.\n  It concerns me because we ought to ask the most basic question: Why \nare more people filing for bankruptcy? Is it the fashionable thing to \ndo? I do not think so. Years ago, a member of my staff and her husband \nhad a bad business experience. When she came to tell me they were going \nto file for bankruptcy, she was in tears. She was not happy about that \nat all.\n  People I have known who have gone through bankruptcy are not proudly \nannouncing to their friends: Well, I had a great day in bankruptcy \ncourt. These are people who are a little embarrassed, a little ashamed \nof what they had to go through. They certainly did not want this to \nhappen.\n  And why do people end up in that predicament? Well, for a lot of \nreasons. If you look at the No. 1 reason people give for why they go to \nbankruptcy court today, it is because of medical bills. And that stands \nto reason. The cost of medical care in America has gone up dramatically \nyear after year. If you are not prepared for a major illness in your \nfamily, you might face major bills that you will never be able to \nrepay. Sometimes the hospital or doctor will write it off and say: I \nknow I am never going to collect it, and that is the end of the story. \nBut sometimes they will not.\n  Sometimes the bills just keep coming in and the bill collectors keep \ncalling and the harassment on individuals and their families increases \nto a point where some people say: That is it. I can't do it. I will \nnever be able to pay off this debt. And they go into bankruptcy court.\n  So here we are in a nation with a health care crisis, in a nation \nwhere each day fewer people have health insurance, a nation where each \nday the cost of health care is going up, a nation where businesses are \nstruggling to keep health insurance on the owners of the business and \ntheir employees, where labor unions are at their wit's end about how to \nprovide the basic benefit package and still increase take-home pay, \nhere we are in a certifiable American crisis when it comes to health \ncare. And what is the response of your Government? To deal with the \nproblem? No, we are going to deal with the victims.\n  The victims of today's health care crisis will now go into bankruptcy \ncourt and face a mountain of paperwork they have to fill out. If they \ndon't do it right or they fall into the categories in this bill, they \nare not going to have their debts discharged. They are going to walk \nout of that court as deeply in debt as when they walked in.\n  The credit card industry says it is only fair because all these \npeople going to bankruptcy court evidence some moral failure in \nAmerica. There is just something wrong today with people and their \nvalues.\n  Excuse me, but being preached to by the credit card industry about \nmoral values is a little tough to swallow. This is the same industry \nthat in 2003 made record profits. All that plastic we carry in our \nwallets, they are making a bundle off those credit cards--so much so \nthat they will inundate anyone who is up and taking nourishment with \nmore credit card solicitations. Go home tonight and look in the \nmailbox. Maybe it won't be tonight. Trust me, by tomorrow there will be \nanother solicitation for another credit card. And you think to \nyourself: Am I that important that they keep coming to me and offering \nme a credit card? The answer is, sadly, no. They are ready to offer \ncredit cards to anything moving.\n\n  In my office one of my attorneys has a little boy who is 3\\1/2\\ years \nold. Tyler must be a pretty special little baby. He got his first \ncredit card solicitation at the age of 3\\1/2\\. I told that story in \nRockford, IL, last week, and one of my business friends said: I have \nyou on that one. My 9-month-old daughter received a solicitation.\n  So here is this industry dumping credit cards on America, oblivious \nto whether the people who are receiving them are good credit risks, \nhoping you will sign up for that credit card, hoping you will pay 16 \npercent, 20 percent interest, hoping you will make the minimum monthly \npayment so they will eat you alive with interest payments, and ready to \naccept the possibility that they guessed wrong, ready to accept the \npossibility that you won't be able to pay your bills. They will write \nthat off, or at least they did until this bill came along. Now they \nwant that credit card debt to trail you for a lifetime. That is what \nthis bill is all about.\n  You say to yourself: Is it a moral failure in America that has led to \nmore bankruptcies? No, it is the lack of health insurance; it is the \nfact that people who worked hard and thought they had the world by the \ntail end up seeing their jobs outsourced when they are 55 years old and \nhave nowhere to turn. Those are the realities of what leads people to \nbankruptcy court.\n  This bill says an awful lot about the Senate of the United States. It \nis the second most important bill of the Republican leadership. Did \nthey bring us a bill to deal with the health care crisis? No. Did they \nbring us a bill to deal with all the jobs being outsourced in America, \nthe Tax Code that creates rewards and incentives to send jobs overseas? \nNo. Did they deal with a bill to fund our schools? Remember that \nFederal mandate called No Child Left Behind, that unfunded mandate \nPresident Bush and the Republicans in Congress refused to fund? Did \nthey offer a bill to help struggling schools? No.\n  What did they come with? They came with the granddaddy of special \ninterest bills, this 500-page gift to the credit industry in America. \nSo we offered some amendments. We said: If there is going to be a real \ndebate, let's have real choices.\n  The first amendment I offered said I am going to give you a category \nof bankrupt people I think should get a break from the terrible \nprovisions in this bill. The category is the people we salute every \nnight on the news, who many of us give speeches praising, who our \nthoughts and prayers are with every day--the men and women in uniform \nserving America. These are men and women who a year and a half ago had \na nice little restaurant or a nice little business and went to their \nGuard meetings once a month and then were activated and, once \nactivated, found out it wasn't for 30 days, it was for 18 months. While \nthey were gone, their little business disintegrated, and now they face \nbankruptcy. Where was the moral failure of these soldiers? Where \nwas the moral failure of the guardsmen and reservists who volunteered \nto go overseas and fight for my freedom and my home? I don't see any \nmoral failure there.\n\n  When we brought the amendment to the floor and said, give these \nservicemen a break, by a vote of 58 to 38, with every Republican voting \nagainst it, that amendment was defeated by the same Congress that gives \nall of these stirring speeches about how much we love the men and women \nin uniform. Where were they when the men and women in uniform needed a \nvote on this bill? They were AWOL, that is where they were.\n  Senator Kennedy said: What about the family in medical crisis? Should \nwe not say to them at the end of the day, if you go through bankruptcy \ncourt, we will protect your home? We will give you a home to go to, and \nnot an expensive home, a $150,000 home. You can buy a nice small home \nin Springfield, IL, for $150,000. You get up to Chicago or Washington \nor Boston or New York or Los Angeles, where does $150,000 take you? Not \nvery far. But Senator Kennedy said: If it is a medical crisis that \nbrought them to bankruptcy, shouldn't at the end of the day they have a \nroof over their heads? Rejected--another virtual partisan rollcall. The \ncredit card industry said: No exceptions.\n  Bill Nelson of Florida said: What if they steal your identity, run up \nall these bills, take you to court, and you are trying to discharge \nbills you didn't even enter into? Shouldn't you get a break then if \nthey have stolen your identity? No, rejected. The credit card industry \nsaid: Go to court; fight it out in court with your lawyer. We are not \ngoing to give you that break.\n  I am going to offer an amendment, my last amendment, to the relief of\n\n[[Page S2422]]\n\nmany on the Republican side. I know they are tired of my amendments and \ntired of hearing me. I am about to lose my voice, so maybe it is time \nto end the debate. But the last amendment is their last chance. Here is \nwhat the last amendment says: If you are a disabled veteran and if the \ndebts that brought you to bankruptcy were primarily incurred while you \nserved in the active military, we are going to give you a break in \nbankruptcy court.\n  Who are the men and women I am talking about? Come to Bethesda, come \nto Walter Reed, and I will introduce you to them. These are guardsmen \nand reservists, active military, marines, soldiers from our Army, \nsailors who have now gone overseas and who have lost a leg or an arm or \nboth hands or suffered a head injury. These are people who gave \neverything we could ask of them for this country. What profiles in \ncourage they are. When I go out there, I am just amazed. They are \nfighting to get that prosthetic limb, fighting to get back on their \nfeet. Most of them more than anything want to go back and fight with \ntheir units, but they are headed home. Some of them are headed home to \na financial situation that is going to be another challenge to them. \nSome of them won't be able to get through it. They are going to file \nfor bankruptcy. They are going to ask to maybe put those bitter \nmemories of the war behind them and to put their debts behind them and \ngive them a chance to start their lives again.\n  My last appeal to the Republican side of the aisle, which has \nsteadfastly stood in ranks for the credit card industry and has been \nunwilling to stand for our men and women in uniform, is this: For the \ndisabled veterans, those who incurred debts while they were at war, can \nyou give them a break?\n  That is the last amendment I am going to offer. I am glad to have the \ndisabled veterans organization of America supporting this amendment. I \nwas happy to have all the military groups and families supporting my \nearlier amendment. I hope those who are following this debate on both \nsides of the aisle will consider those families who are affected. They \nhave considered the credit card industry. There is a great deal of \nsympathy for the credit industry in the Senate. Our heart goes out to \nthese poor people, the credit card industry swamping us with cards \nmaking billions of dollars. What can we do to help?\n  How about a 500-page bill, they say? Any time soon? Sure. It will be \nthe second item on the Senate agenda. We will make sure we get this big \npresent out of the way so you can put it on your list of \naccomplishments in Congress this year. For the people who will end up \nin bankruptcy court, most of whom never wanted to be there, the \nnightmare just got worse. What you are going to face because of this \nbill is a lot more in terms of obstacles, paperwork, and costs.\n  Instead of dealing with the problems that force people into \nbankruptcy, we are going to punish the victims. That is the priority of \nthis Congress. It doesn't speak very well for why we are here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I understand we are in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/10/senate-section/article/S2422-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2422-S2424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     OUR NATION'S FISCAL SITUATION\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to tell my colleagues that our \nNation's fiscal situation is bad and likely to get worse. On an apples-\nto-apples basis, today's projected 10-year deficit is $500 billion \ndeeper than CBO's September 2004 report.\n  When plausible assumptions about the path of current tax and spending \npolicies are used, the official baseline deficit of $855 billion \nballoons to a deficit of $5.8 trillion. Even with a strong economy, \nannual deficits are likely to hover between $400 and $500 billion for \nthe next 5 years. After that, the combination of tax cut extensions and \ngrowing entitlement costs threatens an upward spiral of deficits and \ndebt that cannot be sustained.\n  But even this sobering assessment of Federal finances may be overly \noptimistic. Assuming continued, but declining, spending for the global \nwar on terrorism increases the 10-year deficit by $418 billion--we read \nyesterday where the Secretary of Defense and General Myers said there \nis no real prediction about how long we are going to have to spend \nmoney in Iraq--assuming that discretionary spending keeps pace with \neconomic growth (rather than inflation) increases the 10-year deficit \nby $1.4 trillion; even assuming that expiring tax cuts are only \nextended for 5 years increases the deficit by $306 billion; assuming \ncontinuation of recent adjustments in the alternative minimum tax (AMT) \nincreases the deficit by $642 billion, freezing appropriations, \nincluding defense, the war on terrorism and homeland security, would \nsave $1.3 trillion. However, if combined with the extension of tax cuts \nand continued AMT relief, the budget would still remain in deficit \nevery year, totaling $2.2 trillion over the next decade.\n  We must also remember that current Medicare payment increases for \ndoctors and hospital expire at the end of 2005. The American Medical \nAssociation, AMA, reports that physicians would see a 31 percent \ndecrease in payments from 2006-2013. If we do not act, senior citizens \nwill face serious problems obtaining health care; but it will cost tens \nof billions to continue reimbursing doctors and hospitals at the \ncurrent rate.\n  The fiscal policy decisions we make in the 109th Congress will \nlargely determine whether the U.S. economy and the Federal Government \nwill generate the financial resources to meet these challenges or \nwhether we will force our children to choose between massive tax \nincreases or draconian cuts in public services.\n  I am not exaggerating when I use the term ``draconian cuts in public \nservices.'' President Bush submitted a budget that proposes to \nsubstantially reduce or eliminate more than 150 government programs. In \nits annual ``Budget Options'' report, the Congressional Budget Office \nidentifies 285 government programs that may need to be reduced, \neliminated or substantially modified in order to control future \nspending. Federal budget analysts are already warning that current \ntrends in Federal spending for health care, education, income security \nand even national defense simply cannot be sustained for much longer.\n  I will never forget meeting with Dan Crippen before he left CBO, and \nhim telling me that by 2030, almost all of the GDP we are now spending \nat this time will be used to pay for Medicare, Medicaid, and Social \nSecurity, leaving no money for anything else but that.\n  I recognize that some of my colleagues consider any government \nprogram wasteful spending and would willingly enact all the proposals \nsuggested by both President Bush and the CBO.\n  Nevertheless, back on planet Earth, mayors, county commissioners, \ngovernors and yes, even Senators, are expected to provide at least \nbasic public services, as well as maintain a social safety net, enhance \neconomic development, promote civic improvements and even support \ncultural enrichment.\n  Realistically, we are not going to eliminate economic development \nprograms such as Community Development Block Grants as President Bush \nhas proposed. Nor are we going to seriously consider CBO's suggestion \nto narrow the eligibility for VA disability compensation to only pay \nfor disabilities related to military service. Everyone in this body \nknows that very few of these proposals are new. Some of them were first \nsuggested by President Reagan 25 years ago. Congress has had ample \nopportunity to consider all of them and has never shown a willingness \nto enact any of them.\n  The bitter truth is that regardless of which party is in control, \nCongress has never shown an appetite for fiscal restraint. We are \nalways much more likely to spend like drunken sailors than to save our \nconstituents' money the way we would save our own.\n  I believe the reason we have never been able to control our appetite \nfor spending is that most Members of Congress and the public simply do \nnot understand the long term implications of short term spending \ndecisions. Our constituents consistently ask for increased spending on \nexisting programs as well as money for new programs. Congress almost \nalways says yes to these requests because the true cost of these is so \nwell hidden, they seem like minor investments for major public \nbenefits. Unfortunately, the truth is that long after any public \nbenefit has faded, our\n\n[[Page S2423]]\n\nchildren and grandchildren will still be paying the bills for our \ngenerosity.\n  It is time to recognize that we are in a fiscal hole and to stop \ndigging. The sooner we get started, the better. Prompt action will \nreduce the need for drastic steps and give individuals more time to \nadjust to any changes. It will also allow the miracle of compounding to \nstart working for us rather than against us. Perhaps most important, \nprompt action will help us to avoid a dangerous upward spiral of debt \nand inflation that would ultimately harm every American.\n  We can begin by insisting on truth and transparency in government \nfinancial reporting. More than 200 years ago, Thomas Jefferson wrote to \nhis Secretary of the Treasury, ``We might hope to see the finances of \nthe Union as clear and intelligible as a merchant's books so that every \nmember of Congress, and every man of any mind in the Union, should be \nable to comprehend them, to investigate abuses, and consequently to \ncontrol them.'' Today, consistent and accurate financial information \ncan seem as elusive as it was in Jefferson's time. But these fiscal \nrisks can be managed only if they are properly accounted for and \npublicly disclosed.\n\n  That is why I have introduced the ``Truth in Budgeting Act.'' This \nbill has three simple goals.\n  First, it will help guarantee that Congress, the President and the \nAmerican people have the information necessary to make intelligent \ndecisions regarding our long term financial commitments.\n  Second, it will force Congress to focus more attention on the long \nterm obligations instead of short term cash flows.\n  Finally, it will provide Congress the time to make fiscal policy with \ndue deliberation rather than unseemly haste.\n  In order to guarantee that Congress, the President and the American \npeople fully understand out long term liabilities, this legislation \nwill require the Federal Government to gradually shift to accrual \naccounting for insurance programs; require CBO and the Joint Committee \non Taxation to compute and report the change in Federal interest \nexpense associated with any legislative action, and require the \nPresident to submit an annual report to Congress on the fiscal exposure \nthe Federal Government faces including debt, financial liabilities, \nfinancial commitments, financial contingencies and other exposures. GAO \nwould then be required to report to Congress on the extent and quality \nof the liability exposures presented by the administration.\n  I sincerely believe this knowledge will fundamentally change \nattitudes about Government spending. When my constituents come to me \nasking for this or that new spending program, I always tell them how \nmuch we will have to borrow to pay for the program they want and as \n``Is this really worth imposing that kind of debt on our \ngrandchildren?'' In almost every instance, their answer is ``NO.'' The \nAmerican people do not want to saddle their children and grandchildren \nwith unsustainable bills; but they do not always clearly recognize the \nlong term costs of some very attractive programs. When we fully explain \nthese costs, our constituents will usually choose fiscal prudence.\n  My legislation will force Congress to focus more attention on long \nterm obligations rather than short term cash flows by extending \ndiscretionary spending caps and the PAYGO rules for five years; \ncreating a new Budget Act point of order requiring supermajority roll \ncall votes to put Congress on record when it circumvents discretionary \nspending caps or PAYGO rules; putting more teeth in the annual budget \nresolution by directing the Budget Committee to set 302(b) levels and \nmake efforts to exceed 302(b) levels subject to a 60-vote point of \norder--that will be a difficult one to get through with our \nappropriators, I am sure--and requiring CBO and the Joint Committee on \nTaxation to assess whether the budgetary consequences of legislation \nbeyond the existing 10-year budget window are significantly greater \nthan the cost inside the window. In other words, we pass things, and \nthen we do not talk about what exposure we are going to have 10 years \ndown the road. In the event that CBO or the Joint Committee on Taxation \nconcludes the costs in real terms of legislation in the second decade \nafter enactment would be more than 50 percent greater than in the first \ndecade, it would be required to note this fact in cost estimates, and a \npoint of order would lie against legislation causing these changes in \noutlays or revenues. This would mean Senators would have to acknowledge \nwith a recorded vote the fact that they have been informed about \noutyear effects of their spending decisions.\n\n  I recognize these provisions are no substitute for genuine commitment \nto fiscal discipline. Discretionary spending caps and pay-go rules were \nin place between 1997 and 2002, but Congress still managed to spend \nmoney, as I referred to earlier, like drunken sailors. Nevertheless, it \nis important to require rollcall votes when we attempt to bust the \nbudget and, under the right circumstances, they can be very effective.\n  Over the past 2 years, there have been 79 attempts to waive the \nCongressional Budget Act and increase spending. All but two of them \nwere defeated. If these attempts at fiscal irresponsibility had been \nsuccessful, Federal spending over the next 10 years could have \nincreased by more than $1.5 trillion.\n  Also, my bill will give Congress the time it needs to properly \ndeliberate financial decisions by moving the Federal Government to a \nbiennial budget process. There are 21 States, including my own, that \nuse biennial budgeting. In Ohio, we supplemented the biennial budget \nwith a second annual budget review. The biennial process provides time \nfor deliberation and, more importantly, effective oversight.\n  CBO reports that last year, Congress appropriated over $170 billion \nfor 167 programs that had expired authorizations. Do you hear me: 167 \nprograms, $170 billion, and the authorizations had expired. This is not \nthe fault of the appropriators. No one expects them not to fund \nveterans health care or other critical programs due to expired \nauthorization. It is the fault of a process that simply does not leave \nus enough time to adequately review and reauthorize important \nGovernment programs. We need to give ourselves time to do the job \nright, and biennial budgeting will help get us there.\n  According to the best information I have, our agencies today in the \nFederal Government spend about 60 percent of their time every year on \nthe budget and appropriations. There is no time for congressional \noversight because of the fact that we have these annual budget \nmarathons we go through. I am hoping--working with Senator Domenici and \nother Members of this body--that we can bring the 2-year budget issue \nto the floor of the Senate and once and for all put it into law.\n  The Truth in Budgeting Act I have introduced will provide Congress \nand the American people important financial management tools. Like any \nother set of tools, they are only as useful as the skill and dedication \nof the craftsman using them. However, just as a carpenter or auto \nmechanic is more productive when working with quality equipment, \nCongress can be more effective if we provide ourselves with better \nquality information.\n\n  Finally, before I close, I want to share my concerns regarding \nFederal revenues. Many of my colleagues would like to extend until 2010 \nall or some of the tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003. Moreover, they \npropose to extend these tax cuts without offsetting the revenues lost \nto the Federal Government. The various proposals could increase the 5-\nyear deficit by at least $90 billion and possibly as much as $306 \nbillion. This is unacceptable.\n  Personally, I do not see a need to extend these tax cuts at this \ntime. Now is the time for patience, not haste.\n  Most of the current tax provisions do not expire until 2010, and even \nthe reduced rates on dividends and capital gains do not expire until \n2008. I have consulted with experts such as Alan Greenspan and Pete \nPeterson who agree the stimulative effect of these cuts helped the \neconomic recovery but also agreed we should pay for extending them with \noffsets. It is time to pay for them with offsets.\n  We do not know yet the impact of Federal revenues if we do Social \nSecurity reform. We still do not know the full cost of the prescription \ndrug benefits we approved in the 108th Congress. Nevertheless, all of \nus must concede that most experts agree that if we keep going the way \nwe are, spending for\n\n[[Page S2424]]\n\nMedicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will greatly exceed 18 percent \nof GDP, as I mentioned, by the year 2030.\n  We still do not know the full cost of the ongoing war on terror at \nhome and particularly overseas. I predict we will be committed not just \nto Iraq and Afghanistan but to Kosovo and Bosnia for a long time, which \nwill increase our national security costs dramatically.\n  I have spent time with our reservists who have returned home, and \nmany of them say their equipment is in bad shape because of the war. \nThere are so many uncertainties in dealing with our national security \nthat we ought to be careful about reducing our revenues.\n  We will not know the strength of the duration of the current economic \nrecovery for at least another year, but I will say this: We recently \nlearned that last year we had GDP growth of 4.4 percent. That is the \nbest we have had since 1999. There is no question that we are back on \ntrack. And the real issue is, do we need to continue to stimulate the \neconomy with the tax reductions we passed in 2001 and 2003, \nparticularly 2003 when we felt we needed to give the economy a front-\nend loaded stimulus that would make sure we would see an upturn.\n  We will not know until 2008 or 2009 how Federal revenues will be \nimpacted by baby boomers becoming eligible for early retirement. Most \nexperts expect slower economic growth and slower growth in Federal \nrevenues. It is a real question, with the retirement of our baby \nboomers: Will we have the workforce we need to keep economic growth \nmoving forward?\n  Finally, and perhaps more important, the President's Commission on \nfundamental tax reform will not complete its work until July. Once they \nsend their report to Treasury Secretary Snow, he may very well \nrecommend sweeping tax reform proposals for us to consider in 2006. It \nmakes little sense to me to rush into making current tax policy \npermanent only to redo all our work in less than 18 months.\n\n  Under these circumstances, it seems more prudent to wait until next \nyear before extending tax cuts enacted in the 2001 or 2003 tax reform \nbills. However, if my colleagues absolutely insist on extending these \ntax cuts, then we should at least offset their costs by reducing \nspending or increasing revenues elsewhere in the budget. In other \nwords, the budget resolution is going to be calling for something like \n$70 billion or $80 billion of tax cuts that will be handled in \nreconciliation, which basically says they can be passed by the Senate \nwith 51 votes.\n  My suggestion is, just eliminate them from the budget resolution. If \nextending the lower tax on dividends or extending the lower tax on \ncapital gains is something in the best interest of the American people, \nthen let's require 60 votes to get that done, just as we did last year \nwhen we did not have the continuation of three tax cuts for marriage \npenalty, lower marginal rates, and for the child tax credit. We did not \nhave a budget. We did not have reconciliation language, but we extended \nthose three because it was the feeling of this body and the House that \nthey were needed to continue to respond to the needs of the American \npeople.\n  My basic yardstick for Government spending, including tax cuts, has \nalways been is it necessary and is it affordable? I believe the tax \ncuts in 2001, 2003, and 2004 were both. Nevertheless, we face a \ndifferent situation today, and I will no longer support tax cuts until \nthey are fully offset. The Nation's gross domestic product grew by over \n4 percent in 2003 and 2004. Unemployment has dropped from 6.6 percent \nto 5.2 percent, and new jobs have been created every month for the last \n21 months. Even Alan Greenspan at the Federal Reserve has noticed the \nturnaround and started to raise interest rates. The tax cut medicine \nworked, and it is time to stop before we overdose on too much of a good \nthing. I know some people want to make our recent tax cuts permanent, \nbut I cannot support doing so at this time.\n  Any additional tinkering with the Tax Code should only be done as \npart of a comprehensive reform package designed to return Federal \nrevenues to their 60-year average of 18 percent of the economy.\n  In closing, I tell my colleagues and constituents that I valued my \nstatus last year, while I was running for reelection, as a deficit \nhawk. I have always placed fiscal responsibility at the top of my \nagenda and never supported spending or tax cuts unless I thought they \nwere necessary and affordable.\n  The legislation I have introduced will help us more effectively \ndetermine what fiscal policies really are necessary and affordable. I \nencourage Senators to support this legislation. I also encourage them \nto show patience regarding making the tax cuts permanent. With all the \nuncertainties facing us, it does not make sense to deal with the issue \nnow.\n  I will finish with these words: One of the requirements I have used \nduring my political career to decide whether we should do something is \nthe issue of fairness. How in the world can we ask the American people \nto flat fund domestic discretionary spending, deal with the problem of \nMedicaid and many of these other issues, and at the same time say to \nthem, and by the way, we are going to extend these tax cuts we have \nhad? It does not make sense. It is not fair. It is not right. It is not \nacceptable.\n  I am hoping that my colleagues understand that to put ourselves in \nthe position where we are going to have probably one of the most stingy \nbudgets we have had since I have been in the Senate, at the same time \nwe cannot continue these tax cuts and extend them or, for that matter, \nmake them permanent.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand there will be a vote on the \nLeahy-Sarbanes amendment at 2 o'clock; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 83\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this amendment Senator Sarbanes and I have \npending is going to moderately preserve the current conflict-of-\ninterest standards for investment banks. They might safeguard the \nintegrity of the bankruptcy process. Senators understand that well \nbefore I was born we have had in bankruptcy law provisions to cover \nconflicts of interest of investment bankers. For some reason this was \ntaken out in the pending legislation. The pending legislation would \neliminate the now 67-year-old conflict-of-interest standards that \nprohibit investment banks which served as underwriters of a company's \nsecurities from playing a major advisory role in the company's \nbankruptcy process.\n  In other words, it means if you had an investment bank that advised \nor underwrote securities for WorldCom or Enron at a time when, as we \nnow know, they were cooking the books--they were the ones who advised \nthem how to do this before bankruptcy--then they could be hired to \nrepresent the interests of the defrauded creditors during the \nbankruptcy proceeding.\n  It is kind of the fox guarding the chicken coop. You advise one of \nthese\n\n[[Page S2425]]\n\ncompanies how to cook the books, make a lot of money--it is going to \ndefraud a lot of people--but if the bubble breaks and you go into \nbankruptcy and the people who have been defrauded try to get a little \nbit of money back--try to get back some of the money they are owed, \neven though it is going to be cents on the dollar, people who had their \npensions built into this, had their retirement built into this--you \ncould have the very same investment banker saying, ``We will represent \nyou. We are the guys who got you in the problem in the first place, \nwhere you lost all your pension and the money you are owed, but we will \nhelp you get it back.''\n  It is ironic that firms that had a part in the company's deception \ncould stay on the payroll in bankruptcy and profit handsomely from \ntheir own fraud.\n  For 67 years we said, wisely: Enough. You can't do that. Nobody \nseemed to have a problem with it, but for some reason, that prohibition \nwas dropped here. I have to ask what kind of message are we sending to \ninvestors and pensioners who are suffering from corporate misdeeds and \nensuing bankruptcies if we allow this to happen. They deserve better.\n  What we have suggested, what a lot of people seem to support, is: All \nright, we won't put the total blanket prohibition in, but we will at \nleast say that if you were involved within 5 years of this bankruptcy \nyou cannot come back and handle the rights of the creditors. In other \nwords, if you are the one who lost all the money of the creditors, you \nlost all the money of the pensioners, you lost all the money of the \ninvestors, you are not the one who is going to come back in and say now \nyou can pay us to get back what little bit is left.\n  The National Bankruptcy Review Commission, agreeing with us, strongly \nrecommended that Congress keep the current conflict-of-interest \nstandards in place. They said:\n\n       Strict disinterestedness standards are necessary because of \n     the unique pressures inherent in the bankruptcy process.\n\n  Of course there are. Of course there are pressures. The larger the \nbankruptcy, the greater the pressures. Which assets do you sell? Which \nassets do you keep? Which assets should go to the creditors? What we \nwant to do is monitor section 414. I would like to go back to the \nblanket prohibition, but we said at least make it 5 years. In fact, \nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Edith Jones, well respected, very \nconservative member of the Fifth Circuit and member of the Bankruptcy \nCommission, urged Congress to remove section 414. She said:\n\n       If professionals who have previously been associated with \n     the debtor continue to work for the debtor during a \n     bankruptcy case, they will often be subject to conflicting \n     loyalties that undermine their foremost fiduciary duty to the \n     creditors. Strict disinterestedness, required by current law, \n     eliminates such conflicts or potential conflicts. . . . \n     Section 414, in removing investment bankers from a rigorous \n     standard of disinterestedness, is out of character with the \n     rest of this important legislation and should be eliminated.\n\n  Then the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission wrote to \nus. He said, speaking for the Commission:\n\n       We believe that it would be a mistake to eliminate the \n     exclusion in a similar one-size-fits-all manner at a time \n     when investor confidence is fragile.\n\n  Think of what he said. A lot of investors, since Enron and WorldCom, \nhave lost confidence. If we perpetuate the things that perpetuate that \nlack of confidence, loss of confidence, then shame on us. We can easily \ngo in with a very commonsense exclusion of conflicts of interest.\n  How can any one of us go back and say to our constituents: We were in \nfavor of keeping the people who advised and got the enormous bankruptcy \nin the first place. Now we are in favor of putting them in to guard \nwhat little bit of assets the creditors and the investors might have. \nTry to explain that to somebody who is trying to recover because they \nrelied on what these same people had said and now they are trying to \nrecover their life savings, or trying to recover their business which \nitself may go bankrupt because of money owed them. Try to convince them \nthat we are trying to protect you by letting the same people who made \nthis mess now be responsible for getting payment to you.\n  The amendment Senator Sarbanes and I offer is a modest compromise. We \nlimit it to 5 years before the bankruptcy. It only applies in the 5 \nyears immediately preceding the bankruptcy. It doesn't say you are \nprecluded forever, as current law does. But it says you are precluded \nif you were involved within 5 years of this collapse. Then you are not \ngoing to be involved in getting people back their money.\n  With Enron and WorldCom and others, this is the last time in the \nworld that the Senate should weaken conflict-of-interest standards. \nCertainly the investors and the public are not going to like it. What \nwe are trying to do, we are trying to get us back in line with the SEC \nand others, to restore public confidence in financial transactions with \ngreater accountability and increased investor protection.\n  As I said earlier, I will yield to the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I again commend my able colleague from \nVermont for coming forward with this amendment. I am very pleased to \njoin with him in cosponsoring it, and I urge its adoption upon our \ncolleagues.\n  First, I want to underscore, the Senator from Vermont has tried very \nhard to work out a very reasonable proposal. The existing law prohibits \nthe investment bankers from playing any part in the bankruptcy, if a \ncompany for which they were an investment banker goes into bankruptcy.\n  They can't come along and then become an adviser to the bankrupt \ncompany. The rationale for that is strong because often the investment \nbankers, because of their own activity, need to be examined and \nreviewed, and they may be held accountable.\n  The argument has been made: Well, suppose they were the investment \nbanker 20 years ago and they have not had a connection with this \ncompany since. Why should they be precluded from possibly being taken \non in the bankruptcy? Recognizing that argument, Senator Leahy's \nproposal has a 5-year ban period. In other words, if you have been the \ninvestment banker in the last 5 years, you can't then be engaged when \nthe company goes bankrupt. The investment bankers are intimately \ninvolved in the financial structure of the company. Often, they can be \nheld liable in one way or another for what has taken place. Certainly \nthere is the appearance of impropriety if the very people who were the \ninvestment bankers to this company in the recent period, and they then \ngo bankrupt, and they are taken on subsequent to bankruptcy.\n  Only a while back, Gretchen Morgenson, writing in the New York \nTimes--I ask unanimous consent that the statement be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. SARBANES. She said:\n\n       Do you think Solomon Smith Barney, the brokerage firm that \n     bankrolled WorldCom and advised it on a business and \n     financial strategy that failed rather spectacularly, should \n     be allowed to represent the interests of the company's \n     employees, bondholders and other creditors while WorldCom is \n     in bankruptcy?\n\n  She said:\n\n       If you answered no, you win a gold star for common sense \n     and for knowing right from wrong.\n\n  Elizabeth Warren, a very distinguished professor at Harvard Law \nSchool, commenting about this problem--I understand that financial \nfirms are eager to earn money from bankruptcy advice. There is often \nvery big money to be made. They have been lobbying this issue very \nhard. This doesn't preclude any investment banker, just the ones who \nhave been providing advice to the company leading up to the company's \nfailure, with the Leahy modified amendment, just in the 5-year period \nprior to the bankruptcy.\n  Elizabeth Warren says:\n\n       There is reason why the professionals who have worked for a \n     business that collapses into bankruptcy are not permitted to \n     stay on. The company must go back after bankruptcy and \n     reexamine its old transactions. Having the same professionals \n     review their own work is not likely to yield the most \n     searching inquiry.\n\n  Obviously, having the same professionals review their own work is not \nlikely to yield the most searching inquiry.\n  Arthur Levitt, former Chairman of the SEC, said:\n\n       I haven't read a single argument made by the investment \n     banks that would persuade\n\n[[Page S2426]]\n\n     me that the prohibition should be changed. What we are \n     talking about is a significant potential conflict of \n     interest, and I think it is outrageous that investment banks \n     would even try to go down this road.\n\n  This prohibition has existed in law ever since 1938, which has been \nreaffirmed by the Bankruptcy Study Commission, by all the experts in \nthe field, those who have no vested interest in the outcome, who come \nobjective, people who are in favor of modifying the bankruptcy law, \npeople not in favor of it, but they all come together and agree on this \nissue.\n\n  Professor Warren said:\n\n       It is not a provision to ensure investor confidence, or to \n     enhance protection for employees, pensioners, or creditors of \n     failing companies. This is a provision to enrich an already \n     wealthy interest group, nothing more.\n\n  It needs to be understood that an investor bank that advised on the \ncreation of a company's capital structure before a bankrupt filing may \nitself be exposed to potential liability. If it is brought in to work \nout the deal that permits the company to emerge from bankruptcy, you \nare opening the door that they may be tempted to prefer the creditors \nwho have a potential claim against the investment bank. Don't open this \nstable door.\n  The Leahy proposal is an extraordinarily reasonable proposal. It \nactually is more accommodating than what the experts are telling us \nbecause the experts want to continue the complete ban which exists in \ncurrent law. But what Senator Leahy has done in this proposal--this is \na 5-year ban. If you are earlier than the 5 years, you can be \nconsidered, but if you are within the 5-year period, it is not going to \nbe permitted because we don't want to run the risk of the inherent \nconflict of interest which would exist in that situation. When a \ncompany goes bankrupt, you need a fresh look at what is going on, and \nyou won't get that from the same investment bankers who represented the \ncompany before.\n  This is the point that has been made by the Securities and Exchange \nCommission. In fact, as Chairman Donaldson expressed his personal view \nat a hearing--Senator Leahy and I wrote to him, and he conveyed to us \nthe view of the Commission, saying how cautiously Congress should \nproceed before loosening any conflict of interest restrictions.\n  He noted that they were aware of the arguments of proponents of the \namendment that the current statutory exclusion is too broad because it \ncovers firms that participated even if it was years ago and the firms \nhave no further involvement with the debtor. However, if the exclusion \nis eliminated entirely, we are concerned that the general protection in \nthe statute would be insufficient. It may well be insufficient. That is \nthe problem.\n  I plead with my colleagues, given what we have been through and given \nwhat investors have suffered across the country, given the effort now \nto eliminate these conflicts of interest, don't open this major door to \na very severe potential conflict of interest, and the way that we are \ngoing to do that is to support the Leahy amendment.\n  I urge it upon my colleagues.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Leahy amendment \nNo. 83 to the bankruptcy reform bill. This amendment offers a common-\nsense solution to a thorny issue in current bankruptcy law.\n  While I am a strong supporter of the underlying bankruptcy reform \nbill, and look forward to voting for its final passage, I am concerned \nabout section 414, which amends the disinterested person definition in \nthe conflict of interest standards of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  Under current law, a firm that serves as an underwriter for a \ncompany's securities may be barred absolutely from advising that \ncompany in a bankruptcy reorganization. The existing law is probably an \nover-broad response to the fear of potential abuse. For example, there \nis little potential for abuse in bankruptcy if an investment bank \nunderwrote securities for a company 50 years ago, and had not done so \nsince.\n  Section 414 in this bankruptcy reform bill essentially does away with \nthe current ban, and gives bankruptcy judges the discretion to \ndetermine whether the investment bank has a material adverse interest. \nIf the judge decides that no such adverse interest exists, then the \nbank would be able to advise the debtor company, even if some of the \nbank's advice helped contribute to the bankruptcy in the first place.\n  In my view, while the current law is over-broad, section 414 swings \nthe pendulum too far the other way. I agree with the Chairman of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, William Donaldson, who recently \nwrote to Members of the Senate on behalf of the SEC. Chairman Donaldson \nnoted that the SEC believes that ``it would be a mistake to eliminate \nthe exclusion in a similar one-size-fits-all manner at a time when \ninvestor confidence is fragile.''\n  Given the number of high-profile corporate bankruptcies over the past \nfew years, it is paramount that we completely avoid the slightest \nappearance of impropriety in these bankruptcies. In my view, the Leahy \namendment achieves that goal, and strikes a solid middle ground in this \nimportant debate.\n  On the one hand, the amendment does not attempt to reinstate the \noverly broad current law. On the other hand, the amendment recognizes \nthat it is important for Congress to set out some uniform policy in \nthis area rather than leaving it up to hundreds of individual \nbankruptcy judges.\n  Instead, the Leahy amendment imposes a reasonable 5-year waiting \nperiod under which an investment bank that underwrote securities for a \ncompany would be precluded from advising that same company in \nbankruptcy.\n  In my view, this amendment would protect against any possibility of \nabuse, would safeguard against the appearance of impropriety, and would \nnot unduly harm investment banks from rightfully participating in the \nbankruptcy process.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, am I correct that the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The yeas and nays have been \nordered.

The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 129\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we now \nproceed to a vote in relation to the Schumer amendment No. 129 with all \nother provisions of the agreement still in place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We can expect two more votes right now, first on the \nSchumer amendment and then on the underlying Talent amendment. Then \nthere will be a break before we have another series of votes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes equally divided. Who seeks \ntime?\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will address both the Schumer second-\ndegree amendment and the underlying Talent amendment. This all relates \nto the millionaire's loophole.\n  Mr. TALENT. Will the Senator yield for a second? Does the Senator \nwant to ask unanimous consent to have 4 minutes at once here, which we \ntalked about before?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I think that is what the Chair called for. Am I right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. TALENT. So it is 4 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. It is 4 \nminutes equally divided, 2 minutes on each side.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we have debated this before when I \noffered an amendment to close the millionaire's loophole. My colleagues \nmay recall the millionaire's loophole will allow a millionaire to \nshield his or her assets in a certain type of trust. It would not be \nsusceptible to bankruptcy. The millionaire could then declare \nbankruptcy, shed his debts, and still have the assets in the trust. It \nis an egregious abuse.\n  Unfortunately, my amendment was voted down. My friend from Missouri \nhas offered an amendment that frankly keeps the status quo. I \nunderstand many on the other side are sort of pained that they had to \nvote against this amendment, but let me tell colleagues what the Talent \namendment does.\n  It requires a showing of intent to defraud in order to not shield the \nassets. Well, give me a break. Or as my kids would say: Hello.\n  Which millionaire is going to hire a lawyer and say, make sure you \nleave a paper trail so they can prove intent? Of course, one cannot \nprove intent, particularly if the actual intent is to hide the assets.\n  So in all due respect to my good friend from Missouri, this amendment \nis simply a subterfuge. Make no mistake about it, the Talent amendment \nwill not rectify the millionaire's loophole, will not provide cover for \npeople who seek cover. If we want to correct the Talent amendment, vote \nfor the Schumer second-degree to Talent, which eliminates the intent \nrequirement.\n  One more point. Aside from the intent issue----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I guess there are no more points.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, one can have self-settled trusts. What the \namendment of the distinguished Senator from New York does is do away \nwith essentially all self-settled trusts. Frankly, Senator Schumer's \namendment is so broad that it covers all settled trusts, not just \nfraud.\n  The amendment of the distinguished Senator from Missouri covers \nfraud, and he does it in the appropriate way, a legal way, the way it \nshould be done.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. I thank the Senator from Utah.\n  Very briefly, we should not allow criminals to hide their assets and \navoid paying their bills. This amendment makes certain that dishonest \npeople can't hide their assets, especially if they have caused others \nto lose their jobs, retirement pensions, health care benefits and, in \nsome cases, their life savings.\n\n  One of the reasons the economy plunged into a recession a few years \nback was because of corporate fraud. And those crimes caused companies \nto fail, eliminating thousands of jobs. It is fundamentally unfair to \nallow these crooks to abuse the trust laws of certain States to hide \ntheir wealth.\n  My amendment is simple. It closes the asset protection trust loophole \nby empowering bankruptcy courts to go back 10 years to take away \nfraudulent transfers that criminals have sheltered away in an attempt \nto avoid paying back their debts.\n  Here is a little background on the problem. Asset protection trusts \nare trusts that a person forms to shield assets for his or her own \nbenefit.\n  Although the law has historically allowed property owners to create \ntrusts\n\n[[Page S2428]]\n\nfor others, courts have historically refused to permit someone to tie \nup his or her own property in such a way that he or she can still enjoy \nit but prevent his or her creditors from ever reaching it.\n  My amendment states clearly that these trusts cannot be used in \nbankruptcy to allow a person to shelter their assets to avoid repaying \ntheir debts because of a judgment in criminal, civil, or bankruptcy \ncourt.\n  In addition, my amendment closes the loophole that the New York Times \nwrote a good article about. That article noted how difficult it is to \ndetermine how much money these crooks have sheltered into these asset \nprotection trusts. Some estimate that criminals have stashed away \nbillions of dollars in these types of trusts.\n  This amendment allows victims to go after any resource transferred \ninto the trust by a corporate criminal over the previous 10 years. \nCurrent laws says that if a corporate executive is convicted of a \ncrime, victims can only go after resources transferred into these \ntrusts over the last year. The bankruptcy bill, without my amendment, \nwould have made it only 2 years.\n  But, that is still not enough time to go after the criminals who set \nup these asset protection trusts.\n  There is a gap of several years where criminals could have put \nbillions in assets into these trusts and the Federal and State \nbankruptcy courts might not be able to touch them. My amendment closes \nthe loophole for criminals.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment--it simply cracks down \non criminals.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 129 to amendment No. \n121.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

It is a bill that has wide bipartisan support. I thank \nSenator Kennedy and all of the members of the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee and all of the staff members who have worked on \nthis bill. It has been a tremendous bipartisan effort to make sure that \nwe will have as many people able to enter the workforce with good \nskills as possible and to make an improvement in the way high schools \noperate.\n  I thank a number of Senators for being cosponsors: Senators Gregg, \nAlexander, Dodd, Jeffords, Murray, Harkin, Mikulski, Clinton, Reed, \nBingaman, Sessions, Burns, Thomas, Isakson, and Roberts. Of course, \nthose are in addition to the two main sponsors, Senator Kennedy and \nmyself.\n  We are pleased to have a bipartisan effort, one that strengthens and \nimproves the Federal program designed to support career and technical \neducation. I am pleased the Senate is able to consider this legislation \nat this time.\n  This legislation was reported favorably by the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee yesterday morning and it was by unanimous \nvote. I am encouraged by the wide range of support in the committee and \noutside, and there are good reasons for that. The program adds emphasis \nto academic instruction. It provides career training. It is already at \nwork in all of the schools and is making some great inroads. And those \nwill be much better with these changes.\n  I have to mention a couple of examples of the ways this is working in \nWyoming. In Casper, WY right now, the community college and the school \ndistrict are working on plans to create a hybrid career and technical \neducation center which will help students earn credit toward a college \ndegree, learn relevant job skills, and meet State academic standards \nall through a single sequence of courses. The legislation encourages \nmore schools to begin innovative programs such as the one developed in \nCasper.\n  The second reason the legislation is important is because it will \nhelp ensure that we are preparing students for tomorrow's workforce. We \nare in the midst of a skills revolution. Students going to school \nprobably will not go to work for a single company and work there 30 \nyears and then retire. The statistics show that they will probably have \n14 different careers--not 14 different jobs, 14 different careers. Many \nof them won't even have been invented now. It is very important that we \nhave a flexible learning environment that will allow them to cope with \nthese changes.\n  I also wanted to mention a program in Rock Springs, WY. Ted \nSchroeder, a career and technical education teacher, has demonstrated \nfirsthand the success that comes from connecting career and technical \neducation to the needs of business. In response to complaints heard \nfrom local businesses about the need for students with stronger \naccounting skills, Ted went looking for a program that could help train \nhis students with the skills requested by the businesses. I am very \npleased that it was accounting, too. We could use a couple more \naccountants in the Senate.\n  Working with local teachers and school leaders, Ted began a computer-\nbased accounting program at the high school in Rock Springs and has \nbeen enrolling students successfully for the past few years. Some of \nthe students are now moving on to community college. Some have moved \ninto the workforce where they are successfully meeting a need for the \nbusiness community and for their own lives.\n  A final reason, too, for this being important legislation is that it \nprovides a foundation for the redesign of Federal education policy.\n  I have a letter from the Secretary of Education that asks some \nquestions that we have answers for based on the work we did putting \nthis bill together. I ask unanimous consent that her letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                   The Secretary of Education,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 9, 2005.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n         Pensions, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express my strong \n     opposition to S. 250, the Carl D. Perkins Career and \n     Technical Education Improvement Act of 2005, which would \n     reauthorize the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical \n     Education Act of 1998 (Perkins Act). The Perkins Act is \n     currently the primary Federal funding source for educational \n     programs in high schools. Unfortunately, in its current form, \n     the bill does little to address the urgent challenge that has \n     been highlighted by both President Bush and the nation's \n     governors to reform our Nation's high schools.\n       Given the changing dynamic of the workforce, all students, \n     including those in vocational and technical education \n     programs, need to complete high school with a high level of \n     academic skills and be prepared to participate in the \n     globally competitive workforce. Unfortunately, recent results \n     from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) \n     demonstrate that, while achievement for our Nation's fourth- \n     and eighth-graders is on the rise, scores for twelfth-graders \n     have declined in both reading and mathematics. Currently just \n     68 out of every 100 ninth-graders will graduate from high \n     school on time, and two-thirds of students leave high school \n     without the skills to succeed in college. Clearly, our high \n     schools are not getting the job done for America's students. \n     With governors and educators just beginning to consider \n     various reform options, the President's High School \n     Initiative is essential to foster nationwide efforts to \n     transform our high schools.\n       As you are aware, the President's fiscal year 2006 budget \n     request proposed to eliminate funding for the Vocational \n     Education State Grants and National programs, authorized by \n     the Perkins Act. Career and technical education programs, at \n     their best, can provide students with both strong academic \n     and advanced technical skills, in a ``real-world'' context \n     that can hold up against the best schools and colleges, both \n     in the United States and internationally. However, under the \n     Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) process, the Vocational \n     Education State Grants program, by far the largest component \n     of the Perkins Act, was rated ineffective because it has \n     produced little evidence of improved outcomes for students \n     despite decades of Federal investment. On the most recent \n     NAEP assessments, less than 10 percent of vocational students \n     scored at or above proficiency in mathematics (2000) and only \n     29 percent scored at or above proficiency in reading (1998). \n     In its final report to Congress in June 2004, the National \n     Assessment of Vocational Education (NAVE) found no evidence \n     that high school vocational courses themselves contribute to \n     academic achievement or college enrollment. Also, the NAVE \n     did find that high school students, on average, earn more \n     credits in vocational education (4.2) than in math (3.5) or \n     science (3.2). In addition, the most telling data come from \n     employers--according to a February 2005 Achieve, Inc. survey, \n     employers estimate that 39 percent of high school graduates \n     who have no further education are not prepared for their \n     current job and 45 percent are unprepared for advancement.\n       As a result of these findings, and the widely recognized \n     need for a more comprehensive approach to the improvement of \n     high school education, the President instead proposes that \n     these funds be redirected to support a new High School \n     Initiative to improve achievement and narrow achievement gaps \n     at the high school level. This proposed initiative will give \n     educators greater flexibility to design and implement \n     programs that best meet the needs of all students, including \n     career and technical education students. The fiscal year 2006 \n     budget also includes funds to improve access to community \n     colleges and to expand the training programs administered by \n     those institutions.\n       Enactment of S. 250 in its current form would continue to \n     reauthorize, with little change, the very programs that have \n     been ineffective in improving the quality of education of our \n     Nation's career and technical education students. It would be \n     irresponsible to continue an investment in a program that \n     does not improve the education of students at the high school \n     level.\n       The Perkins Act requires fundamental changes to its mission \n     and focus. While the Administration still supports a \n     redirection of Perkins funds, any extension of the Perkins \n     Act should, at the very least:\n\n[[Page S2450]]\n\n       Promote a stronger academic foundation by ensuring that all \n     career and technical education (CTE) students receiving \n     services under the Perkins Act have access to a rigorous \n     academic curriculum to prepare them to enter college or the \n     workforce. CTE students should have a smooth transition to a \n     postsecondary education program leading to a technical \n     certificate, an associate or baccalaureate degree, an \n     apprenticeship, or a job. This change will support the \n     findings of the American Diploma Project, which concluded, \n     ``successful preparation for both postsecondary education and \n     employment requires learning the same rigorous English and \n     mathematics content and skills. No longer do students \n     planning to go to work after high school need a different and \n     less rigorous curriculum than those planning to go to \n     college.''\n       Require that, by school year 2009-2010, students \n     participating in Perkins Act programs be tested annually in \n     three high school grades in reading/language arts and math in \n     order to assess their progress in meeting State standards. \n     The President's FY 2006 budget proposed funding for high \n     school assessments so that principals and teachers have new \n     tools and data to meet the needs of individual students and \n     strengthen high school accountability.\n       Give the Secretary adequate authority to establish common \n     measures to assess program performance and to ensure that \n     data provided by the States are valid and reliable. In the \n     bill's current form, State performance measures would not \n     have to be valid or reliable indicators of what they purport \n     to measure. It is thus inequitable to sanction eligible \n     recipients, as the bill allows, for failure to meet \n     performance levels if the performance measures themselves do \n     not meet basic standards of validity and reliability.\n       Provide the Secretary authority to negotiate specific \n     performance measures and targets, in percentage form, with \n     each State. Currently, the bi11 would permit States to \n     continue using previously developed performance measures and \n     would limit the role of the Secretary to reaching agreement \n     on the percentage or numbers of students who attain the \n     State-adjusted levels of performance.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the submission of this report.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Margaret Spellings.\n\n  This legislation reflects a bipartisan effort to strengthen and \nimprove Federal programs designed to support career and technical \neducation. I am very pleased to have introduced this bill with my \nfriend and colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy.\n  This legislation was reported favorably by the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee yesterday morning by a \nunanimous vote. I am encouraged by the wide range of support for this \nlegislation as we move forward in the legislative process.\n  This legislation is important for three reasons. The 1st reason is \nthe added emphasis on academic instruction. I commend the President and \nthe Governors for raising the issue of high school reform, and I \nbelieve this legislation is an important part of that process. \nImproving and strengthening the academic focus of the Perkins Act is \npart of a much larger effort to ensure that today's students will be \nready for tomorrow's reality, whether it is in college or the \nworkplace.\n  In 1998, when Congress last reauthorized the Perkins program, \nadditional emphasis on student academic achievement was incorporated \ninto the bill. That emphasis was critical, and the results have been \ndemonstrated in the program. More Perkins students are performing \nbetter on national reading and math assessments than ever before.\n  According to a recent study of Arizona career and technical education \nstudents, students in career and technical training courses were more \nlikely to meet State math proficiency levels than students not enrolled \nin technical training courses. That's good, because today's jobs are \nrequiring stronger academic preparation than ever before, especially in \nmath and science.\n  We are also facing a significant problem in terms of today's students \ncompleting high school. Many college instructors and employers agree \nthat public high school graduates are not prepared for college-level \nclasses or to advance beyond entry level jobs.\n  Only 68 percent of the students entering the ninth grade 4 years ago \nare expected to graduate this year; and, that for minority students \nthis number hovers around 50 percent. In addition, we continue to \nexperience an overall drop out rate of 11 percent per year.\n  Another recent study, conducted by the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development, shows that American students are lagging \nbehind the international average in math proficiency. Another study by \nthis same group has pointed out that American high school students are \nless likely to complete high school than their peers in other \ncountries. In that study, the United States ranked sixteenth out of \ntwenty nations studied in terms of graduation rates.\n  The legislation we are now considering emphasizes high school \ncompletion by making academic courses more relevant. According to the \nNational Assessment of Vocational Education, released last year, career \nand technical education students are three times more likely to apply \nacademic skills to job related tasks than students in academic courses.\n  Making learning relevant is one of the best ways to ensure students \nstay interested in their coursework, while also preparing them for \ncollege or the workforce.\n  The National Governors Association recently held an education summit \nhere in Washington, DC, to discuss the issue of high school reform and \nhow we can do a better job of graduating students on time with the \nknowledge and skills they need to succeed in life. According to their \nreport, high school is now the front line in America's battle to remain \ncompetitive on the increasingly competitive international economic \nstage.\n  In the bill we are now considering, we have made academic achievement \none of several core indicators of performance for programs receiving \nfunds from this act. As states are elevating their expectations for \nstudents under No Child Left Behind, we anticipate that career and \ntechnical education students will benefit from those same high \nexpectations. We believe that career and technical education programs \nshould be able to take credit for helping students improve their \nacademic achievement in core subject areas, like reading, math, and \nscience.\n  This legislation also emphasizes the connection to postsecondary \neducation. Many of today's high schools students are entering college \nbehind the curve before they even start. Twenty-eight percent of \ncollege students are taking some remedial education courses before \ngraduating. We need to make sure that more high school students are \nreceiving the instruction they need before they leave high school in \norder to be successful in college.\n  The impact of the need for remedial academic instruction has dramatic \nconsequences. As many as three in four students requiring remedial \nreading instruction will not complete a postsecondary degree program. \nOver 60 percent of students requiring remedial math education will not \ncomplete a postsecondary degree.\n  The Perkins program can help address the ``wasted senior year'' by \nhelping to improve student academic achievement. It does that by \nlinking learning to relevant applications and tasks. Students that are \nexcited about learning will always do better, and a great way to get \nstudents excited about learning is to show them how they will use some \nthe skills they're learning.\n  For many students, understanding how they will use the skills they \nlearn can mean the difference between completing a high school degree \nand dropping out. For others, it means greater investment in their \nstudies than they might otherwise have.\n  The Perkins program can support students in high school by providing \nstrong academic courses linked through a career pathway that will help \nreduce the need for remedial education.\n  The Perkins program is in a unique position to help prevent the need \nfor additional remedial education at the postsecondary level. Because \nthe program provides funds to both secondary and postsecondary schools, \nprograms are more coordinated, and students have broader exposure to \npostsecondary education before leaving high school. A number of \nprograms enabling students to earn concurrent credits for high school \nand college are springing up within the Perkins program, helping \nstudents prepare for college and reduce their time to graduation from a \npostsecondary degree certificate or degree program.\n  In Casper, WY, right now, the community college and the school \ndistrict are working on plans to create a hybrid career and technical \neducation center, which will help students earn credit toward a college \ndegree, learn relevant\n\n[[Page S2451]]\n\njob skills, and meet state academic standards, all through a single \nsequence of courses. This legislation encourages more schools to begin \ninnovative programs like the one being developed in Casper.\n  The second reason this legislation is important is because it will \nhelp ensure we are preparing students for tomorrow's workforce. We are \nin the midst of a skills revolution. It is estimated that today's \nstudents leaving high school or college will have fourteen different \ncareers in their lifetimes. It is also estimated that the top 10 jobs \nten years from now haven't been invented yet. The question that faces \nall of us, put simply, is ``got skills?''\n  We must equip our workers with the skills the technology-driven \neconomy demands. We need to prepare our students for tomorrow's economy \nin order to remain competitive in the global marketplace. China is \ngraduating four times as many engineers as the United States, and there \nis no way for us to catch up in terms of raw numbers of graduates. The \nonly way we can compete is to graduate students with the highest \nquality academic and technical skills. If we are going to support a \nstrong economy, we need to ensure our students have the high quality \nskills they need to succeed in postsecondary education and the \nworkforce.\n  Earlier this week on the Senate floor we discussed the need for \nskills training and its impact on wages. I made a speech to the effect \nthat the problem we are facing is one of minimum skills--not minimum \nwages. The effect may be low wages, but the cause is low skills. We \nneed to address those workers who have few, if any, of the skills they \nneed to compete for a better job and command higher wages. We need to \nstart thinking in terms of skills, the kinds of skills that will help \nstudents support themselves and their families in the future.\n  Research suggests that high school dropouts have an unemployment rate \ntwo times higher than high school graduates, and three times higher \nthan college graduates. Over time, the earning differential between \nhigh school and college graduates has increased as well. In 1980, \ncollege graduates earned fifty percent more during their lifetime than \nhigh school graduates. Today this differential has increased to 100 \npercent and continues to expand.\n  The Perkins program helps students learn and develop the skills they \nneed to compete in the workforce. In the bill before us, we've \nemphasized the need to prepare students for placement in high skill, \nhigh wage, or high demand occupations. These are the types of jobs that \nwill ensure a stronger future for students and will help them become \nself-sufficient.\n  Eighty percent of the jobs created over the next ten years will \nrequire some postsecondary education. However, the majority of those \njobs will require less than a four year degree. This is a critical \nissue, and we need to start now to meet the needs of the future \nworkforce. I believe that a stronger, more effective Perkins program is \nan important way to address this issue.\n  As you can see on this chart, by 2010 we face a projected skilled \nworker shortage of 5.3 million workers. That's 5.3 million American \njobs that can't be filled because our workers don't have the right \nskills. That is why career and technical education funds are so \ncritical to the supply of skilled labor in this country. These are \nprecisely the types of careers for which the Perkins program is \npreparing students. Career and technical programs in this country are \npreparing engineers, health care professionals, information technology \nworkers, trade, industry, and business leaders, and a host of other \ncareers.\n  One of the most critical improvements we've made to the Perkins \nprogram in this bill is to strengthen the connection of career and \ntechnical education programs to the needs of businesses. If we are \ngoing to help fill the growing need for skilled workers, we need to \nensure Perkins programs are coordinating their instruction with current \npractices in industry and the needs of the local workforce.\n  In Rock Springs, WY, Ted Schroeder, a career and technical education \nteacher, has demonstrated firsthand the success that comes from \nconnecting career and technical education to the needs of business. In \nresponse to complaints heard from local businesses about the need for \nstudents with stronger accounting skills, Ted went looking for a \nprogram that could help train his students with the skills requested by \nthe businesses.\n\n  Working with local school leaders, Ted began a computer-based \naccounting program at the high school in Rock Springs and has been \nenrolling students successfully for the past few years. Some of those \nstudents are now moving on to community college or the workforce.\n  That's the type of relevant instruction that we need to encourage and \nthat we are encouraging through this bill. I would expect that the \nstudents performing well in that accounting class are also performing \nwell on state math assessments in Wyoming.\n  The final reason that this legislation is important is because it \nprovides a foundation for the redesign of federal education policy. We \nneed to structure Federal education policies that provide students and \nadult learners have access to lifelong education opportunities. In this \n21st century economy, learning never ends, and school is never out.\n  The Perkins Act is one part of a ``three-legged stool'' of federal \neducation and training programs, all of which we will be considering \nthis year. The other two key pieces of this approach are the Workforce \nInvestment Act, and the Higher Education Act.\n  If we are going to stay competitive, Federal education programs need \nto help support seamless transitions from education to the workforce, \nthroughout life, from preschool through postsecondary education and \nbeyond. The bill we are considering takes the first step in that \ndirection by emphasizing the connection between academic and technical \neducation and the workforce and postsecondary education. The Workforce \nInvestment Act and the Higher Education Act will be the next critical \nsteps in ensuring that American students are prepared for today and \ntomorrow's careers, many which haven't been invented yet.\n  Today's students are more and more likely to return to school \nthroughout their lives for additional training. Some estimates suggest \nthat as many as 75 percent of today's workers will need additional \ntraining just to stay current with their jobs. The modern college \nstudent reflects this trend perfectly. Today's average college student \nis likely to be older than 24, independent, and more likely to be \nfemale.\n  That snapshot reflects the reality that today's college students are \nthere for training and technical skills acquisition more than anything \nelse. Postsecondary education is one of the fastest means to \nadvancement in today's economy. With a postsecondary education, workers \nare more likely to keep their jobs and take advantage of opportunities \nto grow and advance in the workforce, or transition to another \noccupation as the workforce changes.\n  Federal policy needs to reflect the 21st century reality that we are \nin the midst of a jobs revolution. We are going to experience dramatic \nchanges in the workforce over the next ten to fifteen years, and we \nneed to start now if we are going to adapt Federal education and \ntraining policy to meet the coming crisis of too few workers with too \nfew skills.\n  I am grateful for the work of my colleagues and the distinguished \nranking member of the committee on this legislation. We were able to \nmove this bill quickly through committee, and now to the floor, because \nwe were able to work in a bipartisan manner to reauthorize a program \nthat the members of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \nfeel is an important part of the federal education and training system.\n  I hope that we will be able to proceed quickly to conference with the \nHouse. I know they marked up their legislation yesterday as well, and I \nexpect they will also proceed quickly to floor consideration.\n  We look forward to working with the House to conference this bill and \nsend it to President for signature this spring.\n  I am hopeful we will be able to complete action on this bill quickly \nand send it to the President for signature, so that we can begin work \non the Workforce Investment Act and the Higher Education Act, the next \ncritical pieces of a comprehensive approach to federal education and \ntraining initiatives--and lifelong educational opportunities.\n\n[[Page S2452]]\n\n  Mr. President, S. 250 makes significant changes in the Perkins \nprogram. It does so to further emphasize a stronger academic focus in \ncareer and technical education so students are ready for the workforce \nand for college. The bill requires better articulation between high \nschool and college career and technical programs. It requires States to \ndevelop career pathways that incorporate challenging academic courses \nand requires that information about academic preparation for the \nworkforce be provided for all students, not just career and technical \neducation students.\n  The bill also links the accountability between the Perkins program to \nrigorous and challenging academic standards under the No Child Left \nBehind Act. The bill is consistent with the goals outlined by the \nAmerican Diploma Project which suggests students need stronger academic \npreparation regardless of whether the next step is college or the \nworkforce. Today's students need to be ready for the next step in life, \nwhether it is the workforce or college. That is why the Senate bill \nemphasizes both academic and technical achievement that leads to \npostsecondary education or a high skill, high wage, or high demand \noccupation, perhaps all three incorporated in one.\n  The bill incorporates the assessments required under No Child Left \nBehind and maintains the same requirement for all high school students \nrather than applying an uneven standard for Perkins and non-Perkins \nstudents. The Perkins program is not a substitute for comprehensive \nhigh school reform because it doesn't reach all high school students. \nIt is an important part of that effort, however.\n  The Senate bill provides much stronger accountability than even the \nNo Child Left Behind Act. Not only does it require that students meet \nacademic standards, but it also requires schools to report on students \nmoving on to college, receiving postsecondary credit, earning an \nindustry-recognized credential, certificate, or a degree. It even wants \nto know if they got a job.\n  The bill also emphasizes stronger ties between high schools and \ncolleges so students can begin to prepare themselves for the next step \nin their education. It also strengthens connections between schools and \nemployers so students who don't go to college will be ready for the \nworkforce. The bill requires that information is provided to students \nso they know how their academic course work will prepare them for work \nand college in the future.\n  The bill also requires accountability systems to be based on either \nindustry-recognized credentials or other standardized secondary and \npostsecondary performance indicators, such as completion of a \npostsecondary degree or certificate program. It requires participating \nschools to report on indicators that are nationally understood. In many \ninstances we have followed the Department's request that indicators be \nmade consistent between programs, which we have done.\n  The bill draws extensively from No Child Left Behind, the Workforce \nInvestment Act, and the Adult and Basic Education Act, incorporating \nmany common requirements into this bill. The Senate bill provides an \nopportunity for the Secretary to work with States to develop \nperformance measures. The bill allows States to use percentages or \nnumbers to determine performance standards. The performance indicators \nare negotiated at the State level with the Secretary, and the goal \nought to be helping States improve their Perkins program by meeting \nperformance indicators regardless of whether they are expressed in \nnumber or percentage forms.\n  We have covered a lot of ground in this bill, aspects that haven't \nbeen included before, aspects that will improve provisions, that which \nwill help the students focus on getting jobs. We think this is a bill \nthat America needs, and we want to get it to them quickly. We \nappreciate the efforts of the Senate to get it brought up quickly and \nto get it passed so we can get it into conference and get this great \npiece of legislation active this spring.\n  I would particularly like to thank staff of the Senate Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions who have worked to successfully \nbring this bill forward. I want to thank Beth Buehlmann, Scott Fleming, \nand Courtney Brown from my own staff; Jane Oates, Carmel Martin, and \nLiz Maher from Senator Kennedy's staff. I'd also like to thank the \nother staff members who worked diligently on this legislation.\n  I yield to my ranking member, Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I join all of our \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle who have the good opportunity to \nwork on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in \ncommending our friend and chairman, Senator Enzi, for his good work in \nbringing this legislation out of our committee yesterday and being able \nto arrange for us to have a chance to consider it on the floor this \nafternoon.\n  This legislation is enormously important to more than 70,000 students \nin my State and to millions of students all across the country. To a \ngreat extent, we are here because of the chairman's determination and \npersistence in ensuring that our committee meets its responsibilities \non this legislation, as he has on others as well.\n  I will just mention that we also passed out of committee the Child \nCare Development Block Grant Program, with which my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Dodd, has had so much to do. It will make a large \ndifference in terms of child care for families. Also, there are some \nimportant protections, in terms of the FDA, on the whole issue of \ncontact lenses. And then there is a very important piece of legislation \ndealing with the improvement of patient safety, to reduce the incidents \nof events that adversely affect patient safety. We are waiting to work \nout some minor details. That is an enormously important piece of \nlegislation. This has been a very full agenda so far this year.\n  We have been on the floor over the last 6 or 7 days talking about a \npiece of legislation that has divided this institution. Today, we are \nstrongly together on a matter that will make a great deal of difference \nto young people and old people alike.\n  Our chairman pointed out the importance of acquiring skills, \nretaining skills, and lifelong learning in the United States today. \nEspecially in this age of globalization, we want every one of our \ncitizens to have the learning and the skills essential to the \ncontinuing strength of our modern economy.\n  Investing in our education system, continuing education, continuing \ntraining, and the acquiring of skills is essential in terms of our \nnational security as well. It is not always thought of in those terms, \nbut it clearly is. This legislation, which has been upgraded in the \ncourse of this Congress, is essential for equipping millions of \nAmericans with the skills they need to compete in the global economy.\n  It is a lifeline to many of those young people. With the changes we \nhave made in this bill, and with a number of changes that have been \nmade at the State level, we have the assurance that these young people \nare going to get a first-class education.\n  I ask my colleagues to look at this chart behind me. In my State of \nMassachusetts, we have some 78,000 students who are involved in \nvocational education. Years ago, vocational education simply meant an \nextra class in shop in many schools. That is not the case now. The \nkinds of skills these young people are getting are enormously \nsophisticated, complex, and incredibly important, as our whole economy \nhas become that way. There are more than 74,000 students in career and \ntechnical education programs who passed what we call the MCAS test, our \nState assessment exam. We have over 74,000 career and technical \neducation students who passed the test out of 78,376. That is 95 \npercent. That percentage is extraordinary.\n  The MCAS test is a difficult test. The extraordinary thing about \nMassachusetts--if I can take 10 more seconds on this--is that the State \npublishes the MCAS test, and makes public the items on the test each \nyear. So every parent and school teacher, and people around the \ncountry, know the quality of the test itself and know the demands \nthat this puts on young people. What these results demonstrate is that \nthese young people are acquiring skills and also developing very, very \nimportant academic skills in their career and technical programs.\n\n[[Page S2453]]\n\n  Now, look at this chart, which says, ``What does the Perkins program \nmean in Massachusetts?'' We have students in Brockton who received \nonsite clinical training in health care facilities. In New Bedford, a \ncity that has suffered tremendously with the outsourcing of \nmanufacturing jobs, the regional school has begun an engineering \nprogram. The program partners with 2- and 4-year colleges, Texas \nInstruments, and Bose. Students will be able to earn $22,000 directly \nafter high school and far more when they go on to earn their college \ndegree. All Massachusetts community colleges have instructional support \nstaff and a major source of funding for adaptive equipment for students \nwith disabilities who are enrolled in technical education programs.\n  Now, this chart shows the positive placement rates of five vocational \nschools in Massachusetts--all are over 90 percent. We have shown the \nacademic rates and accomplishments of career and technical education \nstudents. The bottom line is, when we are looking for accountability \nand results, we should look at the placement rates for these young \nstudents. It is 98 percent at Assabet Valley Regional Vocational School \nin Marlborough. At Worcester Vocational High, it is 96 percent. At \nNortheast Metropolitan Vocational in Wakefield, it is 95 percent. At \nNew Bedford Regional Technical, 90 to 95 percent of the graduates go on \nto the workforce or postsecondary education. This is true also at Upper \nCape Cod Tech, at 90 percent.\n  I want to mention a couple of stories. I will mention one other very \nsignificant, impressive result of a technical school. At Shawsheen \nTechnical High School, we have 600 eighth-grade students vying for 320 \nseats in the program. A third of the students are in special education. \nYet, the school has a 100 percent pass rate on the Statewide student \nassessment exam. That is an extraordinary outcome.\n  These are outcomes we can see, and they make a difference for young \nstudents who need special education. At Shawsheen Tech, special \neducation students have an outstanding rate of passing the Statewide \nstudent assessment exams. Learning academic skills in an applied \ncontext is responsible for this success. Ninety-seven percent of the \ngraduates go on to immediate employment in their field or continue \ntheir education.\n  Let me mention a couple of other interesting facts about this \nextraordinary school. Shawsheen has developed an intensive Licensed \nPractical Nurses program for adults. Students serve in clinical \nrotations on alternate weekends at one of the great medical centers, \nthe Leahy Clinic, which my family has benefitted from for three \ngenerations--it is a first-rate clinic in Massachusetts. These students \nare able to gain jobs in this very prestigious and important clinic. \nFifty percent of the students enrolled in this program are minority \nstudents. Sixty percent are Pell recipients. The first 3 classes of 40 \nstudents each had a 90 percent retention rate and a 98 percent pass \nrate for the program completers, and their average starting salary is \nmore than $23 an hour.\n  These are extraordinary outcomes. Let me mention one other example. \nKerry is a student at Middlesex Community College in the dental hygiene \nprogram. She is the mother of two preschool-age children and struggled \nat several different colleges because of a learning disability. At \nMiddlesex she receives support and accommodation from disability \nsupport services and works closely with a disability support \nspecialist. That specialist's salary is paid for with Perkins funding. \nThere we have a tie of special needs students into these well-\norganized, structured programs, and the outcome has been a very \nimportant success. Kerry's success in school is due to the fact that \nshe receives Perkins funding.\n  The story really is in the outcome. I see my friend from Rhode \nIsland. He knows and values the importance of vocational training \nbecause of the excellent programs in the State of Rhode Island. In our \nregion of the country, training programs have made an enormous \ncontribution to the industrial and commercial success of so many of our \nindustries. This program has played a very important role. It has been \nupgraded and improved from an academic point of view, from a training \npoint of view, from the expectations of results, of working with \nbusinesses to give new emphasis to the kinds of specialities which are \nin short supply, and we have benefitted from broad participation.\n  Chairman Enzi pointed out the very good work of the various \ncommunities that have given valuable help and assistance to us and the \nincredible staff of all the Members on both sides of the aisle. We have \napproached this legislation with an attitude of how we can make it \nbetter, how we can improve on it, and the lessons we have learned in \nthe past that are going to strengthen this program.\n  This is an important program that makes a real difference in the \nlives of people. I know the President has some reservations about this \nprogram and does not support Perkins in his budget. We take important \nsteps in this bill to strengthen the program and address a number of \nthe concerns the President has.\n  With that in mind, we are very hopeful we will continue to have the \nsupport of our colleagues in the Senate.\n  I again thank Senator Enzi for his hard work. As we are finding out, \nhe and his staff have welcomed ideas and suggestions. He does not \nalways say yes, but he does not always say no. It has been a real \npleasure to work with him. We on our side are in very strong support of \nthis legislation. We believe it is a stronger bill than exists at the \ncurrent time. We believe it will help in critical areas for young \npeople and old people--continuing education and the adult education \nprograms.\n  This legislation is about acquiring skills--skills, skills, skills, \nskills--which we all understand is absolutely essential if this country \nis going to continue to be the leader of the free world economically \nand from a national security point of view.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nhis outstanding comments, and I appreciate the charts he had giving \nreal-life examples of some things happening in his State. I can tell \nyou that those are happening throughout the Nation.\n  The issue our committee is concerned about is the high dropout rate \nin high schools in the United States. Mr. President, 68 percent of the \nkids who start as freshmen will not graduate. They will drop out of the \nprogram at some time. For minorities, it is considerably higher. We are \ntrying to figure out some way to keep them more interested in school, \nkeep them on a learning program, which they will have to be for the \nrest of their lives if they are going to have high-quality jobs. We \nbelieve this bill is the first leg of a three-legged stool that will \nprovide that. We will have other bills we will be bringing along at a \nlater time.\n  I thank our fellow Senators for their indulgence in allowing us to \nbring this bill up. I look forward to getting it through the Senate.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of a \ncritical piece of legislation, the reauthorization of the Carl D. \nPerkins Vocational and Technical Education Act. More than ever, we need \nrigorous, relevant career and technical education programs to help \nstudents prepare for postsecondary education and to address the \nshortage of highly skilled workers necessary to meet the demands of the \ncontemporary workforce. A skilled and flexible workforce is essential \nto building a strong and dynamic economy and to maintaining our \ncountry's ability to compete in a global economy.\n  According to a recent U.S. Chamber of Commerce survey, 75 percent of \nemployers report severe difficulties when trying to hire qualified \nworkers, with 40 percent of job applicants having poor skills. Further, \na survey by the National Association of Manufacturers found that 80 \npercent of manufacturers experience a shortage of qualified workers. \nMost troubling, as many as 3.3 million jobs may be sent overseas in the \nnext 15 years, resulting in American workers losing $136 billion in \nwages.\n  With this reality, it is vitally important to support S. 250, the \nCarl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education, CTE, Improvement Act of \n2005. This legislation promotes a rigorous curriculum, innovative \nlearning environments, and relevant coursework and\n\n[[Page S2454]]\n\ntraining, thus ensuring students receive the education and training \nnecessary to develop a highly skilled workforce. Strong career and \ntechnical education programs are essential in addressing this shortage \nof highly skilled workers and in preserving American jobs.\n  Career and technical education must be academically rigorous and \nenhance students' critical thinking and applied skills. Accordingly, \nthis bill makes a number of significant improvements to ensure that CTE \nstudents participate in a rigorous and challenging curriculum, and \nrealize positive educational and employment outcomes.\n  For example, the bill integrates challenging academic and technical \nstandards, aligned with No Child Left Behind and nationally-recognized \nindustry standards, into CTE instruction. The bill also strengthens \neducational and career pathways for students beyond high school and \nmakes significant strides in building alliances among high schools, 2- \nand 4-year colleges, business and industry, and community \norganizations. Further, the bill expands career guidance and academic \ncounseling services to ensure that students have a career plan and \ncareer objectives.\n  Well-prepared CTE teachers and good professional development are \nessential components of an effective, rigorous CTE curriculum. CTE \nteachers must possess the knowledge and skills to teach effectively. \nHence, this bill dedicates resources to promoting the leadership, \ninitial preparation, and professional development of career and \ntechnical education teachers to foster effective practices.\n  Mr. President, this bill is designed to improve student educational \nand employment outcomes, including their technical and workplace \nknowledge and skills. But, we must be able to measure how well CTE \nprograms are meeting the needs of its students. Accordingly, the \nlegislation will require states to identify core indicators of \nperformance that include measures of student achievement on technical \nassessments and attainment of career and technical skill proficiencies.\n  Thus, it is essential to develop valid and reliable assessments of \ntechnical and career competencies that are aligned with national \nindustry standards and integrate industry certification assessments, if \navailable and appropriate. To address this need for high-quality \ntechnical assessments, this bill permits State leadership funds to be \nused to develop valid and reliable assessments of technical skills that \nare integrated with industry certification assessments where available.\n  Yet, increasing academic and technical rigor alone is not enough to \nprepare students to enter into and compete in the 21st century \nworkforce. The learning environment students experience also heavily \nimpacts academic performance and student outcomes. When smaller \nlearning communities are in place, students benefit greatly: they \nexperience a greater sense of belonging to their schools and they have \nfewer discipline, crime, violence, and substance abuse problems.\n  I would like to highlight two high schools in my home State of New \nMexico which demonstrate some of the best practices of rigorous and \ninnovative career and technical education. Rio Rancho High School, in \npartnership with Intel Corporation, has served as a model example of \nhow academic rigor, hands-on-learning, strong professional development, \ndefined career pathways, and robust alliances are elements of a \nsuccessful, quality CTE program. Rio Rancho has created academies of \nstudy for all students, which allow students to: pursue career pathways \nto postsecondary education and beyond; take core courses geared toward \ninterests, skills, and competitive careers; form partnerships with \ninstructors; and become part of a smaller learning community within the \nlarger high school. The academies allow students to explore personal \nstrengths and interests in relationship to career planning and job \nmarkets. Accordingly, Rio Rancho has been designated as a Microsoft \nCenter of Innovation and Time Magazine has called Rio Rancho one of the \nten most innovative career and technical schools in the nation.\n  Another great example of innovative career and technical education \ncan be found at Albuquerque High School. In just a couple of years, the \ncareer academies at Albuquerque High School have demonstrated very \npositive student outcomes. The first students in Albuquerque's Academy \nof Advanced Technology have lower dropout rates and improved academic \nachievement.\n  Accordingly, this legislation recognizes that smaller learning \ncommunities are a critical educational investment and thus allows local \nfunds to be used to support and develop personalized career themed \nlearning communities. As Rio Rancho and Albuquerque High Schools \ndemonstrate, rigorous career and technical education and smaller \nlearning environments enhance students' achievement and motivation to \nlearn.\n  Mr. President, this country is facing a crisis. Only 68 percent of \nour Nation's students are graduating high school with a regular diploma \nin four years. We must devote more attention and resources to increase \ngraduation rates and promote dropout prevention. Providing quality \ncareer and technical education is one crucial way to increase \ngraduation rates. CTE programs provide students with relevance, and are \nthemselves a form of dropout prevention. In fact, quality CTE programs \nresult in positive educational and employment outcomes for students. \nEffective career and technical education results in increased school \nattendance, reduced high school dropout rates, increased entry into \npost-secondary education and greater access to high-tech careers.\n  Accordingly, we must improve our ability to measure the effectiveness \nof career and technical education programs. High-quality data systems \nare essential to collect and analyze information regarding educational \nand employment outcomes and to inform the development of effective \ncareer and technical education programs. The data reported, however, \nmust be complete, accurate, and reliable. Yet present data and data \nsystems are too often incapable of meeting the requirements of career \nand technical education programs, of states, and of this Act. \nAccordingly, the bill includes several new provisions for data \ncollection, utilization, and analysis, including provisions which allow \nthe State allocation to be used to support and develop State data \nsystems, and State leadership funds to be used to develop and enhance \ndata systems to collect and analyze data on postsecondary and \nemployment outcomes.\n  Effective career and technical education programs are necessary to \nbuild a strong and dynamic economy and to maintain a competitive \nAmerican workforce. This legislation evinces some of the best \nprinciples of strong, effective career and technical education. Mr. \nPresident, I fully support Senate passage of S. 250.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support \nof the Carl D. Perkins Vocation and Technical Education Improvement \nAct. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation and am extremely \npleased that this bill was written in a bipartisan fashion. I thank \nSenator Enzi, Senator Kennedy, and their staff members, Scott Fleming, \nIlyse Schulman, and Jane Oates, for working so hard on this \nlegislation. I sincerely hope that we continue in this spirit of \nbipartisanship in the HELP Committee.\n  The bill before us today recognizes the important role of career and \ntechnical education for preparing today's workforce and rejects the \nBush administration's proposal to eliminate the Perkins program, a \nproposal that would cost New York approximately $65 million a year. The \nbill before us today is evidence of a strong bipartisan commitment to \nmaintaining and strengthening the program.\n  It is an often overlooked fact that the Perkins program is the \nlargest Federal investments in our Nation's high schools. Over 66 \npercent of all public high schools have at least one vocational and \ntechnical education program and 96 percent of high school students in \nthis country will take at least one vocational or technical course \nwhile they are in high school.\n  The Perkins program also plays a key role in postsecondary education. \nAccording to the National Center for Education Statistics, nearly 38 \npercent of all degree-seeking undergraduates are pursuing vocational \ncareers. These\n\n[[Page S2455]]\n\nprograms play a key role in educating our workforce, and census data \nconsistently shows that people with higher educational attainment have \nhigher median incomes. Nearly 75 percent of employers say they have a \nvery hard time when trying to hire qualified workers, according to a \n2002 survey by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  In New York, the demand for business career and technical education \nprograms in New York increased by 44 percent between the 2002 to 2003 \nschool year and the 2003 to 2004 school year. In New York City, there \nwas a 211 percent increase in enrollment in the approved business \nprogram and a 55 percent increase in the technology and communications \nprograms. And the vast majority of these students are succeeding \nacademically. Eighty-five percent of New York students that completed a \ncareer and technical education program passed all of the required \nregent's exams.\n  The Perkins program is extremely important--not just for the numbers \nof students it serves but for the communities that benefit from a \nbetter prepared workforce as a result of these programs. This is why \nfor the last 3 years I have spearheaded a letter to the Senate \nAppropriations Committee requesting additional funding for Perkins. I \nalso offered an amendment to the budget resolution in 2003 to protect \nthe Perkins programs from cuts because I was deeply concerned that \nPresident Bush's proposal to slash the Perkins program by 25 percent \nwould be reflected in the Senate's budget.\n\n  The Carl D. Perkins Vocation and Technical Education Improvement Act \nwill go a long way towards strengthening vocational and technical \neducation in New York and across the country. Among other things, it \nwill provide for comprehensive professional development for career and \ntechnical education teachers, increase States' flexibility to meet \ntheir unique needs, and align secondary and postsecondary indicators \nwith those established in other programs to ultimately reduce \npaperwork.\n  I am particularly pleased that this bill also improves programs and \nservices for women and girls pursuing nontraditional occupations. Last \nfall, at a HELP Committee hearing on vocational education, an inspiring \nwoman from New York, Angela Olszewski, testified about how important it \nis that we support and encourage women and girls in their pursuit of \nnon-traditional, traditionally ``male'' careers--in technology, math, \nscience, and the construction and building trades. Unfortunately, women \nare still significantly underrepresented in these fields. For example, \nwe know that while the number of women carpenters has tripled since \n1972, they still only represent 1.7 percent of all carpenters. You can \nsay the same about many other high-skill, high-wage trades.\n  Many of these skilled trades industries are experiencing a \nsignificant labor shortage and experts expect these shortages to get \nworse over the next two decades as many workers retire. If women were \nto enter these professions, most of which are unionized and pay a \nlivable paycheck and benefits, women would increase their earnings and \nstandard of living for their families. For example, a journey-level \nelectrician will make over $1,000,000 more than a typical cashier in a \n30-year career.\n  This bill requires States to measure students' participation and \ncompletion in career and technical programs in nontraditional fields \nand to disaggregate their data on performance by gender and race. In \naddition, programs will be required to prepare special populations for \nhigh skill, high wage occupations that will lead to self-sufficiency. \nThese important provisions will go a long way toward helping more women \nfollow in Angela's footsteps.\n  Finally, I am pleased that the bill maintains Tech Prep as a separate \nprogram, rejecting the Bush administration proposal to eliminate it. \nInnovative Tech Prep programs in New York have made a real difference \nin the lives of students. For example, the Syracuse City Health Center \nTech Prep program reduced the achievement gap between ethnic groups, \nwhite vs. non-white--to 2.8 percent. And at least 65 percent of \nstudents in the Syracuse City Health Careers Tech Prep program enroll \nin health-related professions, where New York has a critical shortage, \nafter high school. In New York State, the average age of nurses is 47 \nand 80 percent of current nurses will reach retirement age within 10 \nyears.\n  For all of these reasons, I am thrilled that we are passing this \nlegislation today.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Carl D. Perkins \nVocational and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2005. To compete \nin this global economy, we need to make sure our students have 21st \ncentury skills for 21st century jobs. Vocational and technical \neducation is an extremely important part of this effort. The Perkins \nAct, which provides $1.3 billion to help train more than 10 million \nAmericans across the country, is a vital investment in our nation's \nhigh schools, community colleges, and our students.\n  The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical program gives a boost to \nAmerica's workforce development system by providing funds to schools \nthat teach technical skills ranging from auto shop to computer \nprogramming. The Perkins Act also supports practical career programs \nand links between secondary and post-secondary education, helping \nstudents to move up the opportunity ladder and prepare them for high-\nskill, high-wage jobs. Students who have completed Perkins-supported \nprograms are better prepared not only for higher education but for the \nworkplace.\n  The President has proposed eliminating funding for all vocational and \ntechnical education programs. This is the wrong way to go. If Perkins \nwas eliminated, high schools, technical schools, and community colleges \nin every state would suffer. In Maryland, our schools would lose almost \n$19 million. Last year, we had more than 150,000 students enrolled in \ncareer and technical programs in Maryland. In the United States, 97 \npercent of high school students take at least one career and technical \neducation course. One-third of college students are involved in career \nand technical programs. And almost 40 million adults attend short-term \noccupational training. If these schools had to close their doors or \nshut down their vocational programs, where would these students go to \nlearn the skills they need to get good paying jobs?\n  Vocational and technical education provides students across the \ncountry with opportunities to develop academic and technical skills \nthat are critical for economic and workforce development. It is our job \nin the United States Senate to make sure these opportunities are there \nfor the people who need them and to invest in our human capital to \ncreate a world class workforce. That is why I strongly support this \nbipartisan bill and I oppose any cuts to the Perkins Vocational and \nTechnical Education programs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Carl D. Perkins \nVocational and Technical Education program.\n  By the year 2010, 80 percent of all jobs in the Nation will require \nsecondary and postsecondary education and training as a prerequisite \nfor a job that supports a middle-class lifestyle. The Perkins \nVocational and Technical Education program provides business and \nindustry with the skilled workers they need to compete in the 21st \ncentury economy and provides a future of hope for those workers.\n  Unfortunately, President Bush has proposed eliminating Federal \nfunding for these programs in his fiscal year 2006 budget. This would \nhave a tremendous negative impact across the nation and especially in \nIllinois, which is receiving $49.6 million dollars in fiscal year 2005 \nfor these programs. In fact, in Illinois, 3 out of 5 high school \nstudents are enrolled in Vocational and Technical Education annually, \nrepresenting more than 348,000 students.\n  The Senate's strong support for this legislation today demonstrates \nthat the Bush administration is out of touch with regular people and \nthe state of our economy. We need to create more good jobs in America; \nthat's what vocation education programs do.\n  For example, we need more teachers. Stacy J. attended Capital Area \nCareer center and went on to graduate from Lincoln Land Community \nCollege and from there to the University of Illinois Springfield. She \nearned a Bachelor's in Psychology and an elementary teaching \ncertificate and now works for the Springfield School District. Her path\n\n[[Page S2456]]\n\nwas largely funded by the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical \nEducation program.\n  We need car specialists. Nick O. graduated from the welding program \nat Capital Area Career Center and now works for Ray Evernham \nMotorsports in research and development and as a tire specialist. \nAgain, Nick took advantage of the Perkins program.\n  We need electricians, x-ray technicians, dental assistants, and \nplumbers. Justin K. is an apprentice plumber in Springfield after \ncompleted the Perkins program at the Capital Career Center.\n  We need nurses, carpenters, and firefighters. Andy, Josh and Dustin \nstudied Fire Science at the Kishwaukee Education Consortium.\n  Because we need these people, we need the Carl D. Perkins Vocational \nand Technical Education program.\n  Of course, we also need our students to graduate. Another Perkins \nprogram student, Jessica G., began her career as a co-op student from \nLimestone Community College. She works for the RSM McGladrey Network \nand is now one course away from earning her masters of business \nadministration. One of the most spectacular attributes of the Perkins \nprogram is the increase in the probability of graduation. Participation \nin a career and technical program raises the probability of graduation \nby 15 percentage points for those who registered for at least one \ncourse and nearly 28 percentage points for those who completed a career \nand technical program.\n  The school-based programs supported through the Perkins program \nprovide a foundation for our Nation's workforce development system, by \nteaching technical skills based on industry standards and workplace \nskills and employability skills common to all occupations. This program \nis the single largest Federal investment in the nation's high schools.\n  We want our students to succeed in their education. This means we \nneed the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education program. \nResearch proves students engaged in Perkins-supported programs are \nbetter prepared to transition into post-secondary education and the \nworkplace. Students who complete a rigorous academic core coupled with \na career concentration have test scores that equal or exceed college \nprep students. These dual concentrators are more likely to pursue \npostsecondary education, have a higher grade point average in college \nand are less likely to drop out in the first year. Fifty-two per cent \nof all career and technical education students enroll in college.\n  I strongly support this legislation and commend Chairman Enzi and \nSenator Kennedy for their leadership in ensuring that the Carl D. \nPerkins Vocational and Technical Education program continues.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the Carl D. \nPerkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act. This bill \nreauthorizes the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act \nof 1998 and supports a key goal for this country's future: to ensure \nAmerica's students have the knowledge and skills to be competitive in \ntoday's global economy. Specifically, this legislation supports the \ncreation of stronger partnerships between high schools, colleges, and \nbusinesses to allow for career and technical education programs to \nbetter meet the needs of the workforce, including small businesses. \nAlso, S. 250 provides for the creation of outlines for logical \nsequences of courses, including high school and college courses, that \nwill lead to an industry recognized credential, certificate, or \npostsecondary degree. Furthermore, this measure promotes activities to \nimprove the recruitment and retention of career and technical education \nteachers, including those underrepresented in the profession.\n  As a former member of the organization previously known as Future \nFarmers of America FFA, I am proud of Montana's highly successful \nvocational education programs. Montana has over 500 approved career and \ntechnical education programs and more than 800 certified teachers in \nagriculture, business, marketing, family and consumer sciences, \nindustrial technology, and health occupations. Over 160 Montana high \nschools participate in the Federal Carl D. Perkins and State career and \ntechnical education grant programs in order to support and improve \ntheir career and technical education programs. These valuable programs \nprepare Montana K-12 students for a variety of careers and post \nsecondary education programs.\n  I will continue my strong support of vocational education programs \nand look forward to working with the leadership as the Senate examines \neducation programs during the 109th Congress.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the \nreauthorization of the Perkins Career and Technical Education \nImprovement Act of 2005.\n  This bill is critically important to ensure that students are \nentering the workforce with the academic, vocational, and technical \nskills they will need to be successful in today's job market.\n  According to 2003 U.S. Census data, only 27 percent of Americans have \na college degree. Therefore, vocational education programs are \nnecessary to provide occupational training to the majority of high \nschool students who do not go on to earn a bachelor's degree.\n  Without adequate vocational and technical training programs, these \nindividuals have few career options. Unfortunately, high schools \ncurrently offer fewer vocational education classes than in the past, \ndue to funding shortages.\n  There are many ways in which Perkins funds are used, and I would like \nto share a few examples of how these dollars are utilized in my State \nof California which typically receives approximately 11 percent of \nFederal funding for vocational education through Perkins.\n  The Fresno Unified School District uses about $1 million in Perkins \nmoney to fund vocational education classes in areas such as \nintroductory business, computers, and multimedia for students in grades \n7-10.\n  Perkins funding also helps to pay for 10 resource center facilitators \nwho assist students in researching colleges and registering for \nentrance exams.\n  The Los Angeles Unified School District receives Perkins funds to \nbuild career and technical education, CTE, programs. With these funds, \nthe district has created 15 ``industry clusters,'' each of which \ncontains a specific career pathway. These industry clusters range from \nagriculture to the arts to engineering to medical technology.\n  I understand the importance of Federal support for vocational and \ntechnical education, and I will continue to do all I can to ensure that \nall students have access to the educational opportunities that will \nallow them to become productive and successful adults.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am pleased to support S. 250, the Carl D. \nPerkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2005. The \nproduct of a true bipartisan effort, this bill reauthorizes and \nstrengthens the federal investment in career and technical education \nprograms, which touch students of all ages in communities across the \nNation.\n  I commend Senator Enzi for his extraordinary leadership on this \nissue. His dedication to creating opportunities for lifelong learning \nand ensuring that students of all ages have the skills they need to \nsucceed in higher education and in the workforce is reflected \nthroughout this bill.\n  Nearly every student in America enrolls in at least one career and \ntechnical education class during high school, and millions of adults \nupdate their skills at the postsecondary level each year. Career and \ntechnical education provides increasingly rigorous, relevant learning \nthat prepares students for success in postsecondary education and in a \nwide array of occupations. Given that a majority of jobs created over \nthe next decade will require skills that only a relative few workers \ncurrently possess, it is important that we provide opportunities for \nstudents and workers to gain the skills they need to secure and succeed \nin these jobs.\n  In many communities, including those in my own State of New \nHampshire, innovative career and technical education programs are \nhelping to fill pressing workforce needs, including in fast growing \nfields like technology and health care. High school students in health \nscience programs may earn CPR\n\n[[Page S2457]]\n\nand, first aid certifications and gain valuable clinical experience in \nhospitals and nursing homes, as well as enroll in certified nursing \nassistant programs. Through Project Running Start, high school students \ncan earn community college credit in a variety of disciplines. New \nHampshire Community Technical College in Nashua offers programs ranging \nfrom an FAA-approved aviation technology program to a \ntelecommunications program in partnership with Verizon. Such \nopportunities at both the secondary and postsecondary level are \nconstantly expanding, offering students more options than ever before.\n  Career and technical education programs are also helping alleviate \nshortages of skilled workers in certain industries, such as the \nautomotive industry. The Automotive Youth Educational Systems program, \nwhich operates in New Hampshire and 44 other States, is widely regarded \nas a successful education and business partnership, and has been \npraised by both the Department of Labor and the Department of \nEducation. The AYES program affords high school juniors and seniors the \nopportunity to gain valuable experience as interns working alongside \nskilled auto technicians who serve as mentors. Upon graduation, this \nwork experience then translates into high-skill, high-wage, high-demand \njobs for students.\n  The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of \n2005 would strengthen career and technical education programs in a \nnumber of ways. Among the improvements are stronger accountability \nprovisions, increased flexibility for States, and greater emphasis on \nthe integration of academic and technical course content, on connecting \nprograms with business and industry to ensure that students gain \nrelevant skills, and on building pathways from secondary to \npostsecondary programs and the workforce. All of these efforts will \nhelp ensure that students acquire the tools and knowledge necessary to \nacquire and excel in high-skill, high wage occupations.\n  S. 250, which I am pleased to cosponsor, stands as an example of what \nis possible when we work in a bipartisan way in good faith. I would \nlike to thank Senator Kennedy and my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle for their commitment to career and technical education and \nfor helping move the reauthorization process forward.\n  This bill was also crafted with significant input and support from \nthe career and technical education community, which helped us refine \nand improve the legislation. The result is a work product of which we \ncan all be proud. I look forward to the bill's final passage.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the Carl \nD. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act. By passing \nthis legislation today, the Senate recognizes the critical need to \nmaintain the Perkins program--the Federal Government's single biggest \ninvestment in our nation's high schools.\n  The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act provides a \nvital link between students and the high-skilled workforce American \nbusiness depends on to thrive. It funds rigorous and challenging career \nand technical education programs that give more than 10 million \nAmericans the opportunity to attain the specific skills needed to \nsuccessfully embark on careers and undertake further education.\n  The President's decision to eliminate this program in his fiscal year \n2006 budget proposal is exceedingly short-sighted. It would aggravate \nthe skills gap that employers already face and cost our country in \nfuture competitiveness, productivity, and innovation. The President \nseeks to eliminate a $1.3 billion investment, $6.4 million of which \nwould be a loss to my state, Rhode Island.\n  Instead, the Senate's action today will help ensure this program's \ncontinued success.\n  I am especially pleased that this legislation contains provisions I \nauthored to address the needs expressed to me by educators in Rhode \nIsland. As I have in other education reauthorization bills, I worked to \nstrengthen professional development programs for career and technical \neducators, principals, administrators, and counselors. I also ensured \nthe legislation gives states more flexibility in their use of funding \nand in implementing innovative statewide initiatives. In addition, I \nadded language to ensure schools can offer students the benefit of \nreal-world internships and other work-based learning experiences to \nenhance their skills.\n  These and other provisions in the bill will strengthen the Perkins \nAct. I sincerely hope that we will maintain the same cooperative and \nbipartisan spirit as we work toward final passage of this bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend my friend, Chairman Enzi, for \nhis bipartisan leadership on this legislation and his effective work in \nbringing it before the full Senate today.\n  One of our highest priorities in Congress is to expand educational \nopportunities for every American. Especially in this age of \nglobalization, we want every one of our citizens to have the learning \nand the skills essential to the continuing strength of our modern \neconomy. We want them to fulfill their hopes and dreams, to raise \nhealthy families, and contribute to their communities. We will be a \nfairer and stronger America when every citizen takes part and \ncontributes.\n  We know that in today's global economy, every person counts more than \never. We cannot afford to leave out anyone. We must equip our citizens \nto compete in the global economy--not by lowering their pay and sending \ntheir jobs overseas, but by increasing their skills.\n  The legislation before us today will strengthen our commitment to a \nvital aspect of that mission, by equipping millions of young Americans \nwith the skills they need through career and technical education.\n  There was a time in many schools when vocational education meant \nsimply an extra class in shop. But today in Massachusetts, and many \nother states, we see the vital role that vocational education--now \nappropriately called career and technical education--can have in \ntransforming the lives of students and workers, and in strengthening \nour economy.\n  Career and technical students are high school students who want to \nlink their learning to a career. They are students who want a real \nworld application of their high school education. They are students who \nearn college credits or earn industry-recognized credentials and pass \nstate licensing exams while still in high school. Career and technical \neducation today is designed to prepare and train students for 21st \ncentury jobs.\n  Career and technical education students go on to higher education--\nalmost two-thirds of all high school graduates of career and technical \nprograms enter college or another form of postsecondary education.\n  In addition, through its educational programs at the postsecondary \nlevel, the Perkins Act also serves adults who are seeking critical \ntraining to be competitive in the job market. Whether we are talking \nabout new immigrants, struggling adults, or women who are seeking \nemployment outside the home for the first time, these are adults who \nneed specially designed programs.\n  In Massachusetts, career and technical education serves more than \n70,000 students. Through Perkins funding, high school programs in \npartnership with community colleges and local businesses, provide \nstudents with the academic and technical skills they need to continue \ntheir education or to compete for high-skill, high-wage jobs \nimmediately. The outcomes of these programs are extraordinary. Last \nyear, 95 percent of career and technical education students in \nMassachusetts passed our state assessment--the MCAS exams.\n  The Perkins program has worked to reduce the gender imbalance in \nearnings by emphasizing the importance of eliminating discrimination \nand actively recruiting students for non-traditional employment. The \nsegregation of certain demographic groups into low-wage industries can \nand should be corrected as soon as possible through education. The \nprogram sets aside specific dollars for the collection and \ndissemination of occupational and employment information. Providing the \nmost complete and up-to-date information is essential if counselors are \nto help their students make good decisions about course selection and \ncareer choice.\n  To be competitive in today's economy, we need a renaissance in math, \nin\n\n[[Page S2458]]\n\nscience, and in technical skills. Technology and innovation are \nessential for America's economic strength and competitiveness in the \nfuture. The Tech Prep program in this bill addresses these needs by \ncreating programs that integrate technology skills based on employer \nneeds. At Springfield Technical Community College in Massachusetts, \nstudents can enroll in the Diagnostic Medical Imaging Program. They \ntake rigorous math and science courses that prepare them to use today's \nnewest technology.\n  It has always been a priority for our committee to see that all \nstudents have the opportunity for high quality educational \nopportunities. Ensuring strong career and technical programs is an \nessential part of reaching that goal. In the legislation before us \ntoday, we were able to address critical issues for the continued growth \nof this program--the integration of academic and technical education, \nthe use of funds for secondary and post-secondary programs, and the \nimportance of the Tech Prep programs that form the bridge between the \nhigh school and college programs.\n  Our bill also builds on existing provisions designed to ensure that \nstudents, parents and teachers have the information they need to select \nthe courses that will give them the best options for obtaining a good \njob or continuing with their education after high school.\n  This bill also addresses the unique professional development needs of \nCareer and Technical Education teachers. Every day, we see rapid pace \nof change in industry. Cell phones and computers can become obsolete in \na year. Teachers need to see the changing aspects of the industries \nthat they teach about in the classroom, so that their students of all \nages can receive the best possible training. Local schools and \ndistricts must provide opportunities for these teachers to spend time \nwith the industries they are teaching about. They are preparing the \nnext workforce generation, and their knowledge base must be state of \nthe art.\n  In Massachusetts, Perkins grants fund a wide variety of important \nprograms. Students in Brockton have received onsite clinical training \nin health care facilities.\n  In New Bedford, a city that has suffered tremendously with the \noutsourcing of manufacturing jobs, the regional technical school has \nbegun an engineering program in partnership with 2 and 4-year colleges, \nTexas Instruments and Bose.\n  Graduates will be able to earn $22,000 a year directly after high \nschool, and far more when they go on to earn their college degree.\n  At Shawsheen Technical High School, six hundred 8th grade students \nare vying for 320 seats in the program. A third of the students are \nspecial education, yet the school has a 100 percent pass rate on the \nstatewide student assessment exams. Learning academic skills in an \napplied context is responsible for this success. Ninety-seven percent \nof the graduates go on to immediate employment in their field or \ncontinue their education.\n  Responding to the critical shortage in the nursing profession, \nShawsheen has developed an intensive Licensed Practical Nurses program \nfor adults. Classes are held for 10 months, four nights a week from \n5:30 to 10 p.m. Students serve in clinical rotations on alternate \nweekends at the Lahey Clinic. The program has become an entry to a good \ncareer for many low-income adults; 50 percent of those enrolled are \nminority students and 60 percent are Pell recipients. The first three \nclasses of 40 students each have had a 90 percent retention rate, a 98 \npercent pass rate for program completers and a 100 percent placement \nrate in the Merrimack Valley and the graduates are in jobs with an \naverage starting salary of $23 an hour.\n  In addition, because of Perkins grants, all Massachusetts community \ncolleges have instructional support staff and major funding for \nadaptive equipment for students with disabilities enrolled in technical \neducation.\n  None of this would be possible without Perkins dollars.\n  Again, I commend Chairman Enzi and his staff for all their good work. \nSpecial thanks go to Scott Fleming and Beth Buehlmann with Senator \nEnzi, Kelly Scott with Senator Gregg, Meredith Davis with Senator \nFrist, Kristin Bannerman with Senator Alexander, Jenny Hanson with \nSenator Burr, Bradford Swann and Glee Smith with Senator Isakson, \nLindsay Morris with Senator DeWine, Lindsay Lovlien with Senator \nEnsign, Juliann Andreen with Senator Hatch, Prim Formby with Senator \nSessions, Jennifer Swenson with Senator Roberts, Dana Lewis with \nSenator Reid, Mary Ellen McGuire with Senator Dodd, Laura Prebeck with \nSenator Harkin, Dvora Lovinger with Senator Mikulski, Sherry Kaiman \nwith Senator Jeffords, Michael Yudin with Senator Bingaman, Jamie \nFasteau with Senator Murray, Catherine Brown with Senator Clinton, \nKristen Romero and Amy Gaynor from Legislative Counsel, and Carmel \nMartin and Liz Maher of my staff.\n  And I want particularly to express my appreciation to Jane Oates who \nhad principle responsibility for this bill for my staff. I am grateful \nfor her important contributions and insights on this legislation.\n  I thank our Chairman, Senator Enzi, for moving this bill so quickly \nthrough our Committee and am pleased we are able to move it to final \npassage today. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am here today in support of a bipartisan \nbill that would reauthorize the Perkins Vocational and Technical \nEducation Act. Few issues are as critically important to the future of \nthe country as the competitiveness of our workforce. This bill will \nhelp to ensure America's economic dominance for years to come.\n  Essential to strengthening the workforce, the Carl D. Perkins Career \nand Technical Education Improvement Act not only prepares youth and \nadults for the careers of today, it prepares them for the careers of \ntomorrow. For that reason, it is the first line of defense in ensuring \nAmerica's competitive advantage in a global economy.\n  We have heard a lot lately about American students losing their \ncompetitive edge. In math and science our fourth graders are among the \nbest in the world but by their senior year of high school, they score \nnear the bottom of all industrialized nations. Our college dropout rate \nis one of the highest in the world. The United States has dropped from \nfirst to fifth in the percentage of young adults with a college degree. \nSingapore has displaced the United States as the top economy in \ninformation technology competitiveness. And, the number of patents \nawarded to Americans is declining. Clearly, all of this is having an \neffect on our global competitiveness.\n  The problem is further compounded by the fact that our universities \nare facing intense competition in higher education and are slipping in \ntheir ability to attract the world's best students. Yesterday, the \nCouncil of Graduate Schools released a study showing that foreign \napplications to graduate schools are down 6 percent. These are \nindividuals that contribute to the cutting-edge research American \nuniversities and corporations have long been known for.\n  Do we need to increase our efforts to attract these students back? \nYes. Do we also need to do everything we can to increase our \ncompetitiveness from within? Yes. The bill before us will help us to do \nthat.\n  The bill before us does a number of important things. First and \nforemost, it emphasizes accountability and improved results. Second, it \nimproves monitoring and enforcement. Third, it disaggregates \nperformance goals and report information by special populations so no \none falls through the cracks. And fourth, it strengthens the ties \nbetween industry, high schools, and higher education by ensuring that \nteachers are well trained, that students are academically ready for \ncollege, and that high schools are training students for the actual \nneeds of their communities.\n  The premise of the bill is that high schools, industry and higher \neducation need to work together to provide our workforce with the \nskills that they need in order to achieve and compete in the 21st \ncentury. This bill works to ensure that American students are not just \ngetting a world-class education, but the best education in the world.\n  I would be remiss in my remarks if I did not mention the President's \nproposed elimination of the Perkin's program in his fiscal year 2006 \nbudget. And, I would be remiss if I did not commend the leadership of \nSenator Enzi, our committee chair, in bringing this\n\n[[Page S2459]]\n\nbill forward despite the President's plan. Senator Enzi's unwavering \ncommitment in this area is unparalleled. I hope that the administration \nunderstands that our decision to make this the first major piece of \neducation legislation that we take up this Congress is reflective of \nour unwavering commitment to career and technical education. We will \nnot let this program fall by the wayside. Perkins will not be \neliminated.\n  We often hear the pledge that we will leave no child behind. May I \nsuggest that we also make every effort to ensure that we leave no \ncareer and technical education student behind? Passage of these \nimportant provisions today will go a long way toward ensuring that \ncareer and vocational education students are not left behind in the \nclassroom, that they are being held to high academic standards, that \ntheir teachers are provided with the training they need to keep up to \ndate with the latest industry needs, and that high schools, industry \nand higher education work seamlessly together to provide our workforce \nwith the skills that they need to maintain America's economic dominance \nin the 21st century.\n  Career and vocational programs are an essential part of keeping \nstudents in school and helping our Nation train its workforce. I am \nconfident that this bill will go a long way in helping another \ngeneration of Americans succeed, and, in doing so, strengthen our \neconomy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will be glad to yield back my time.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the committee \nsubstitute is adopted and the bill will be read a third time.\n  The committee amendment, in the nature of a substitute, was agreed \nto.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. ENZI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next series \nof votes begin at 4:30 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. For the information of my colleagues, the next vote, which \nwill begin at 4:30 p.m., will be on passage of the Perkins vocational \neducation bill which was just debated, to be followed by a series of \nrollcall votes on the remaining amendments to the bankruptcy bill, to \nbe followed by final passage. That means there could be up to seven \nrollcall votes in this next series of consecutive rollcall votes. Once \nagain, we urge Members to stay close to the Chamber during these votes \nto avoid missing any.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/10/senate-section/article/S2459-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2459-S2462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   BANKRUPTCY ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2005--\n                               Continued\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of S. 256, \nthe Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, \nand to thank all of the people who made this bill possible. This \nbankruptcy bill has been a long time coming. We all know how bankruptcy \nclaims have skyrocketed since the last major bankruptcy reform bill in \n1978. We all know about the abuses of the system.\n  Well, that is about to change for the better. This bill is about \nfairness and accountability. We have made some important changes in \nthis legislation. This bill contains a debtor's bill of rights with new \nprotections that prevent bad actors from preying upon the uninformed.\n  The bill also includes new consumer protections under the Truth in \nLending Act, such as new required disclosures regarding minimum monthly \npayments and introductory rates for credit cards. It protects consumers \nfrom unscrupulous creditors, with new penalties on creditors who refuse \nto negotiate reasonable payment schedules outside of bankruptcy.\n  S. 256 provides for protection of educational savings accounts, and \nit gives equal protection for retirement savings in bankruptcy. It \nhelps women and children by providing a comprehensive set of \nprotections for child and domestic support throughout the bankruptcy \nprocess.\n  This legislation dramatically revises the reaffirmation agreement \nprovisions of the Code. It imposes critical disclosure requirements \nthat will put a stop to abusive practices. It makes the provisions \nrelating to farmers in chapter 12 permanent and broadens its \nprovisions. It cleans up the law governing complex exchanges and \nthereby reduces systemic risk in our marketplace. It acts to stop \nabuse.\n  When this bill hit the floor on Monday, February 28, I mentioned that \nwe were in the last leg of a legislative marathon. The finish line is \nfinally in sight. I am pleased to have been a part of this process and \nI am even more pleased we are able to pass this important legislation, \nand I anticipate that it will pass shortly. This bill has been a long \ntime in development. I am proud of what we have been able to \naccomplish. Today it seems it is finally going to cross the finish \nline, and it is well worth it.\n  This bill may not lead to a severe reduction in the number of \nbankruptcies. I believe, though, that it will reduce the number of \nfraudulent and abusive filings and help educate consumers to keep their \nfinancial houses in order. This is always an important goal. No \nresponsible society can long countenance the open flouting and abuse of \nits laws.\n  This bill, with its means test, will discourage such abusive filings \nby restricting access to chapter 7 liquidation by those with relatively \nhigh incomes. We should all stand behind a law that requires people \nwith the ability to repay their debts to actually repay those debts.\n  Most of our debate on this bill has focused around the means test. \nThere is no doubt that this will discourage some bankruptcy filings, \nbut I also hope our credit counseling provisions will work to persuade \neven some low-income debtors that there is another way out.\n  Right now, too many are only hearing one part of the story: Declare \nbankruptcy. Liquidate your debts. Some attorneys pushing this line, \nhowever, leave out the part about the years of ruined credit that \nresult, the inability to get a car loan or a house loan. My hope is our \nmodest credit counseling provisions will persuade some people to stay \nout of bankruptcy and meet their obligations, do what is right, and \nkeep their credit alive.\n  While a great majority of Senators support this bill, I know not all \nof my colleagues are pleased. Last night my friend from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy, again voiced his strong opposition to this \nlegislation. This was probably clear from my response. I vehemently \ndisagree with his opinions about this bill, but I hope he understands \nthat we are trying our best.\n  Could we have done better? I have no doubt about that, not for a \nsecond, but I also know this bill has benefitted from some of Senator \nKennedy's suggestions over the years. We have not ignored him, and I \nhope he understands we appreciate his participation.\n  I also understand some of my colleagues feel that they may not have \nbeen treated fairly in this process. My desire throughout this process, \nand the desire of my colleagues who supported this bill, was always to \nact as an honest broker who took the suggestions of the other side with \nappropriate seriousness. I understand the frustration from some on the \nother side at the inability to get amendments agreed to or considered \non the floor, but I hope they in turn can understand that we have tried \nour best on this side to balance all of the competing interests in this \nbody\n\n[[Page S2460]]\n\nwhile also trying to get this very important bill done.\n  In particular, I think we could have done a better job of working \nthrough the technical amendments offered by Senator Feingold. Truth be \ntold, I do not think all of these amendments were merely technical \namendments. Be that it as it may, Senator Feingold had a right to \nsubmit his amendments at the committee and then on the floor. Perhaps \nthe consideration of the Feingold amendments would have been more \ncomplete if we had all focused on these proposals earlier in this \ndebate. I fully respect the right of the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin to offer his amendments, even if we know he is opposing the \nunderlying bill, which he always has. Getting all the parties on board \nis an uphill climb.\n\n  I was given the assignment by Chairman Specter to try to get this \nbill reported by the last recess. We accomplished that goal. In that \nprocess, I know Senator Feingold feels he did not get a fair hearing in \nthe committee. I hope the final outcome today persuades him otherwise.\n  For my part, I instructed my staff to meet with the staff of the \ndistinguished Senator from Wisconsin after the markup. Our staffs met \non a number of subsequent occasions. We were able to work out several \nagreements. Frankly, I was sympathetic to several features of other of \nhis amendments. As we all recognize, proposing an amendment is much \neasier than getting an agreement on an amendment. I want him to know \nthat we tried.\n  In discussions with the sponsor of the bill, Senator Grassley, the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Specter, our leadership, \nSenator Sessions, who has played a significant role on this bill and \nothers, we had to make a number of determinations over what amendments \nto support and what to exclude from the bill. These were not easy \ndecisions, and sometimes they had to be made in conjunction with \nleaders in the House of Representatives, which is not unusual. We do \ntry to work with them, if we can. In this case, I think we have been \nworking with them.\n  We could not accept all of Senator Feingold's amendments. I think he \nprobably knows that, too. Our staffs made the effort to work through \nboth the substance and the politics of the issues, and these \nconsultations have borne some fruit. That is important to state, \nbecause I do not want my colleague to feel badly or feel he has not \nbeen treated fairly. I wish we could have found still more common \nground, but after consulting with and facilitating consultations \nbetween Senator Feingold's staff and my staff and other Senate staff, \nwe at least made some progress.\n  I thank and congratulate Senator Grassley, the prime sponsor of this \nbill over the last 8 years. He has worked extraordinarily hard on this \nbill. It has been a long time in coming. My hat, as usual, is off to \nhim. Senator Sessions is another Senator whose hard work made this \npossible. We all appreciate his work in the committee and on the floor \nduring the last few weeks.\n\n  I would also thank the majority leader, Senator Frist, and the \nmajority whip, Senator McConnell, and the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee for their efforts on behalf of this legislation. Chairman \nSpecter has been here working hard for the people of Pennsylvania only \ndays after his cancer treatments, and that is not easy to do, and \ncertainly not easy since he has a continuation of those treatments. He \nis a heroic figure, in my eyes, for the way he has handled himself in \nthis very difficult time.\n  I must also thank Chairman Shelby, and Senator Sarbanes of the \nBanking Committee. We all know how vital the Banking Committee was to \nthis process. We could not have gotten this done without their help.\n\n  I believe that several Senators from across the aisle deserve \nrecognition as well. I want to once again thank the Minority Leader, \nSenator Reid, and the Minority Whip, Senator Durbin, for helping to \nmove this bill through the Senate.\n  Senators Biden and Carper have worked tirelessly for years on this \nlegislation, and they have taken some tough votes to get it done. \nSenator Nelson from Nebraska has also shown great resolve and deserves \nrecognition for his efforts, particularly with respect to the \nprovisions affecting farmers. Senator Johnson has also been committed \nto this legislation and I thank him.\n  No thank you list would be complete without the Senator from Vermont. \nMy dear friend Senator Leahy and I have not always agreed on every \naspect of this legislation, but we have worked hard to make it better. \nSenator Leahy developed two important amendments that were accepted. \nSimilarly, Senator Feingold--who has been an ardent opponent of this \nlegislation--has nevertheless dedicated himself to improving it. I have \nenjoyed working with him, and several other Democratic members of the \nJudiciary Committee over the years--including Senators Feinstein, Kohl, \nKennedy, Schumer and Durbin--to get this bill done.\n  I would also like to take a moment to thank all of the staff who \nworked so hard to make this happen. I know that several of them--on \nboth sides of the aisle--have not seen their significant others in \nweeks. We owe them a great debt of gratitude. If my colleagues would \npermit me, I would like to name a few of them.\n  I think the record should reflect that Rene Augustine, a former \ncounsel now at home with her new-born child, and Makan Delrahim and \nManus Cooney, both former Judiciary Committee Chief Counsels, worked \nfor years on this legislation and it would not have been possible but \nfor their efforts. Similarly, John McMickle, a former staffer of \nSenator Grassley who worked on this bill while he was in the Senate, \nhas taken an enormous amount of time away from his young children to \nhelp on this project.\n  For staff who still work here, I think that Senator Grassley's chief \ncounsel, Rita Lari-Jochum, should be singled out for her hard work and \ndedication to this bill. She has helped manage this process over the \nlast several weeks, and she has done a fantastic job. Similarly, Mike \nO'Neill, Judiciary Committee Chief Counsel, and Harold Kim, Chief Civil \nCounsel, have done an outstanding job--as have the whole Judiciary \nteam. There are several new counsels in that office that were thrown \ninto the crucible in their starting weeks. First with class action, and \nnow with bankruptcy. The record should reflect the professionalism and \nexcellence with which Ivy Johnson, Tim Strachan, Ryan Triplette, \nHannibal Kemmerer, and Nathan Morris have conducted themselves. They \nare a fantastic group.\n  In Senator Sessions office, no one could overlook his chief counsel, \nWilliam Smith, or his deputy chief counsel Cindy Hayden. Amy Blakenship \nand Wendy Fleming also with Senator Sessions, did a great job as well. \nThey all did wonderful job.\n  In the Majority Leader and Majority Whip's office, Eric Ueland, \nSharon Soderstrom, and Allen Hicks led the team. John Abegg in Senator \nMcConnell's office, proud father of a baby girl born on the day this \nbill hit the floor, nevertheless managed to get the job done. Kyle \nSimmons, Brian Lewis, and Malloy McDaniel all worked vigorously to plan \nand manage the strategy and votes on amendments. Stephen Duffield and \nhis team at the R.P.C. has also provided timely and accurate \ninformation on the bill on a daily, and when needed, hourly, basis.\n  As my colleagues all know, the Banking Committee played an important \nrole in this process. Senator Shelby is fortunate to have people like \nKathy Casey, Doug Nappi and Mark Oesterle working for him.\n  I would also like to thank the House Judiciary Committee staff--they \nhave been an invaluable resource and we would not have been able to get \nthis done without them. As always, Phil Kiko provided a steady hand \nsteering important legislation. Susan Jensen is a treasure trove of \ninformation and she has devoted herself to this endeavor. Stephanie \nMoore and Perry Applebaum of Representative Conyer's office, I am sure \nwill help the legislation move through the House.\n  The hardworking people in the legislative counsel's office have also \nundertaken a Herculean effort and flourished in the process. I believe \nthat 125 amendments were filed on this bill, and that does not include \nthe 50 or so that we had in Committee. That is a lot of drafting of \ncomplex legislation and we all owe Bill Jensen, Matt McGhie and Amy \nGaynor our thanks for their contributions during this long trip. I\n\n[[Page S2461]]\n\nwould add Bob Schiff of Senator Feingold's staff, who worked to make \nthis a better bill. It is a pleasure to work with him and he is someone \nwe respect. I wish we could have done more for him and his great boss. \nWe have done the best we can.\n  Finally, on my own staff, Bruce Artim, Kevin O'Scannlain, Perry \nBarber and Brendan Dunn all worked very hard on this legislation.\n  My personal executive assistant, Ruth Montoya, has put up with an \nawful lot over these last few weeks, and I appreciate her as well as my \nchief of staff Trish Knight, and Susan Cobb and the many others who \nliterally have worked so hard to help me over these last several \nweeks--frankly, over the last many years. I know there are many others \nI have not been able to recognize, and they should all know what a \nwonderful job I believe they have done. I believe we have an important \nachievement with this bill, and I think it is only a matter of time \nuntil we get this bill passed on the floor, which will be a good end.\n  Mr. President, the bankruptcy legislation cures some abuses in the \nBankruptcy Code regarding executory contracts and unexpired leases.\n  One provision, Section 404(a) of the bill, amends Section 365(d)(4) \nof the Bankruptcy Code. Presently, Section 365(d)(4) provides a retail \ndebtor 60 days to decide whether to assume or reject its lease. A \nbankruptcy judge may extend this deadline for cause--and therein is the \nproblem. Some experts believe that too many bankruptcy judges have \nallowed this exception essentially to eliminate any notion of a \nreasonable and firm deadline on a retail debtor's decision to assume or \nreject a lease. Some bankruptcy judges have been extending this \ndeadline for months and years, often to the date of confirmation of a \nplan.\n  This situation can be troublesome. For example, a shopping center \noperator is a compelled creditor. It has little if any choice but to \ncontinue to provide space and services to the debtor in bankruptcy. \nYet, the current Code permits a retail debtor as long as years to \ndecide what it will do with its leases. Coupled with the increased use \nof bankruptcy by retail chains, the Bankruptcy Code is seen by some to \nbe tipped unfairly against the shopping center operator.\n  Some stores curtail their operations or go dark, and still the lessor \ncannot regain control of its space.\n  This legislation, like the conference report in the last two \nCongresses, acts to curb this abuse. It imposes a firm deadline on a \nretail debtor's decision to assume or reject a lease. It permits a \nbankruptcy trustee to assume or reject a lease on a date which is the \nearlier of the date of confirmation of a plan or the date which is 120 \ndays after the date of the order for relief. A further extension of \ntime may be granted, within the 120 day period, for an additional 90 \ndays, for cause, upon motion of the trustee or lessor. Any subsequent \nextension can only be granted by the judge upon the prior written \nconsent of the lessor: either by the lessor's motion for an extension, \nor by a motion of the trustee, provided that the trustee has the prior \nwritten approval of the lessor. This is important. We are limiting the \nbankruptcy judges' discretion to grant extensions of the time for the \nretail debtor to decide whether to assume or reject a lease after a \nmaximum possible period of 210 days from the date of entry of the order \nof relief. Beyond that maximum period, there is no authority in the \njudge to grant further time unless the lessor has agreed in writing to \nthe extension.\n  Retail debtors filing for bankruptcy will undoubtedly factor into \ntheir plans this new deadline. Most retail chains undertake a careful \nreview of their financial condition and business outlook before they \nfile for bankruptcy. They will already have an understanding of which \nleases are ones they wish to assume and which ones they wish to dispose \nof. The legislation gives them an additional 120 days to decide on what \nto do with their leases, once they file for bankruptcy. Beyond that 120 \nday time period, an additional 90 days can be granted for cause. A \nfurther extension may be negotiated by the retail debtor and the lessor \nif circumstances warrant, and any such extension can be granted by a \njudge only with prior written consent of the lessor. Further, a \nlessor's prior written approval of one such extension does not \nconstitute approval for any further extensions--each such extension \nbeyond the 210-day period requires the lessor's prior written approval.\n\n  The bill in Section 404(b) also amends Section 365(f)(1) of the \nBankruptcy Code to make sure that all of the provisions of Section \n365(b) of the code are adhered to and that 365(f) of the code does not \noverride Section 365(b).\n  This addresses another problem under the Bankruptcy Code. The bill \nhelps clarify that an owner should be able to retain control over the \nmix of retail uses in a shopping center. When an owner enters into a \nuse clause with a retail tenant forbidding assignments of the lease for \na use different than that specified in the lease, that clause should be \nhonored. Congress has so intended already, but bankruptcy judges have \nsometimes ignored the law.\n  Congress made clear, in Section 365(b)(1) and 365(f)(2)(B), that the \ntrustee may assume or assign an executory contract or unexpired lease \nof the debtor, only if the trustee gives adequate assurance of future \nperformance under the contract or lease.\n  In Section 365(b)(3), Congress provided that for purposes of the \nBankruptcy Code:\n\n     adequate assurance of future performance of a lease of real \n     property in a shopping center includes adequate assurance--\n       (A) of the source of rent and other consideration due under \n     such lease, and in the case of an assignment, that the \n     financial condition and operating performance of the proposed \n     assignee and its guarantors, if any, shall be similar to the \n     financial condition and operating performance of the debtor \n     and its guarantors, if any, as of the time the debtor became \n     the lessee under the lease;\n       (B) that any percentage rent due under such lease will not \n     decline substantially;\n       (C) that assumption or assignment of such lease is subject \n     to all provisions thereof, including (but not limited to) \n     provisions such as a radius, location, use, or exclusivity \n     provision, and will not breach any such provision contained \n     in any other lease, financing agreement, or master agreement \n     relating to such shopping center; and\n       (D) that assumption or assignment of such lease will not \n     disrupt any tenant mix or balance in such shopping center.\n\n  Congress added these provisions to the Code in recognition that a \nshopping center should be allowed to protect its own integrity as an \nongoing business enterprise, notwithstanding the bankruptcy of some of \nits retail tenants. A shopping center operator, for example, must be \ngiven broad leeway to determine the mix of retail tenants it leases to. \nCongress decided that use or similar restrictions in a retail lease, \nwhich the retailer cannot evade under nonbankruptcy law, should not be \nevaded in bankruptcy.\n  It is my understanding that some bankruptcy judges have not followed \nthis Congressional mandate. Under another provision of the Code, \nSection 365(f), a number of bankruptcy judges have misconstrued the \nCode and allowed the assignment of a lease even though terms of the \nlease are not being followed. This appears to ignore Section 365(b)(3).\n  For example, if a shopping center's lease with an educational \nretailer requires that the premises shall be used solely for the \npurpose of conducting the retail sale of educational items, as the \nlease in the In re Simon Property Group. LP v. Learningsmith, Inc. (D. \nMass. 2000) case provided, then the lessor has a right to insist on \nadherence to this use clause, even if the retailer files for \nbankruptcy. The clause is fully enforceable if the retailer is not in a \nbankruptcy proceeding, and the retailer or the bankruptcy trustee or \njudge should not be able to evade it in bankruptcy. Otherwise, the \nshopping centers operator could lose control over the nature of its \nbusiness.\n  In the Learningsmith case, the judge allowed the assignment of the \nlease to a candle retailer because it offered more money than an \neducational store to buy the lease, in contravention of Section \n365(b)(3) of the Code. As a result, the lessor lost control over the \nnature of its very business, operating a particular mix of retail \nstores. If other retailers file for bankruptcy in that shopping center, \nthe same result can occur.\n  In the past, courts have disagreed about whether Section 365(f) \noverrides the provisions of Section 365(b)(3). For example, in the case \nof In re Rickles Home Ctrs., Inc., 240 B.R. (D.Del. 1999), appeal \ndismissed, 209 F.3d 291 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 873 (2000), \nthe\n\n[[Page S2462]]\n\njudge disregarded the use clause and allowed a lease sale to go through \nto a non-conforming user. However, in In re Trak Auto Corp., 367 F.3d \n237 (4th Cir. 2004), an appellate court held that a use clause must be \nstrictly enforced under Section 365(b)(3) on sale of the lease, \nnotwithstanding Section 365(f). This legislation provides the necessary \nclarity by amending Section 365(f)(1) to help make clear it operates \nsubject to all provisions of Section 365(b).\n  I note that Section 365(d)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code applies to cases \nunder any chapter of Title 11. Language to that effect in the current \nCode's Section 365(d)(4) is deleted because it is repetitive of \nSections 103(a) and 901 of the Code, which already make clear that \nprovisions like Section 365(d)(4) apply to all cases under Title 11.\n  This bill creates new legal protections for a large class of \nretirement savings in bankruptcy. This measure has widespread support \nfrom a long list of groups, ranging from the American Association of \nRetired Persons, to the Small Business Council of America and the \nNational Council on Teacher Retirement.\n  Let me take this opportunity to point out that the assets of some \npension plans already are protected from bankruptcy proceedings. The \nUnited States Supreme Court has ruled in Patterson v. Shumate, reported \nat 504 U.S. 753 (1992), that assets of pension plans which have, and \nare required by law to have, anti-alienation provisions, are excluded \nfrom bankruptcy estates.\n  Let me be absolutely clear that this provision is not intended in any \nway to diminish the protections offered under existing law and under \nthe United States Supreme Court's decision in Patterson v. Shumate, but \nrather, is intended to provide protection to other retirement plans and \naccounts not currently protected.\n  Mr. President, this has been a battle, there is no question about it, \nlike all hotly contested issues are. But I think virtually everybody \nhas contributed, and we have had some tough times on the floor. We have \nhad even some bad feelings from time to time. But we have been at this \nfor 8 solid, difficult years. It is unfortunate we could not work out \nmore amendments, also, but we couldn't and still have this bill pass, \nhopefully for the last time. We worked in good faith to try to do that.\n  For those who feel they have not been treated as fairly as I would \ncertainly have wanted to treat them or I feel I have treated them and \nothers as well have treated them, we feel bad about that and hope they \nwill forgive us for not being able to make some of the changes that \nperhaps we would have made had this been the first year of this bill \nand we didn't have the difficulty of meeting the suggestions of our \nfriends over in the other body.\n  We think they have done a terrific job. The people in the House of \nRepresentatives are tremendous leaders, from Chairman Sensenbrenner \nright on through the whole Judiciary Committee and, of course, the \nleadership over in the House as well and others who are not on the \nJudiciary Committee but are concerned about this very important bill. \nThey work closely with us. It is difficult for them and it is difficult \nfor us, but that is the way these two bodies ought to work together, \nand this bill is a perfect illustration of what can happen if good \npeople can get together, compromise on some of these issues that can be \ncompromised, and yet stand firmly so we can pass legislation like this \nthat will benefit the whole country.\n  In my final remarks, let me recognize the efforts of Ed Pagano and \nBruce Cohen of Senator Leahy's office and Jim Flug and Jeff Teitz of \nSenator Kennedy's office for all the hard work they have done over the \nyears on this issue as well. It is a pleasure to work with staff on the \nJudiciary Committee. They are bright. They are articulate. They are \nbrilliant, as a matter of fact. That is what you want in Judiciary \nCommittee staffers. I wish those on the minority side would not be \nnearly as tough as they are, but I respect them for being that way.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, we \nare about to have the last vote of the evening which is final passage \nof bankruptcy legislation. I thank all Members for their hard work \ntoday in the Chamber, as well as the Budget Committee and their efforts \non the budget resolution. They made huge progress today. We will start \non the budget Monday morning. We expect amendments during Monday's \nsession. Therefore, we do expect the next vote to be Monday evening at \n5:30.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, several years ago, when we were considering \nthis legislation, I spoke here on the Senate floor about some important \nprovisions that I think have been overlooked in our discussions. In my \nremarks today I will repeat what I said back then, in March of 2001.\n  We have heard a lot in recent days about how this bill lacks \ncompassion--specifically, that it will hurt women and children who \ndepend on alimony and child support.\n  Critics claim that by making sure that more money is paid back to \nother creditors, this bill will make it harder for women and children \nto get what is coming to them.\n  I am particularly proud of my record of protecting women and children \nduring my career in the Senate. That record includes the Violence \nAgainst Women Act to protect women threatened by domestic violence.\n  I am here again today to show that, contrary to a lot of the rhetoric \nthat has been tossed around, this bill actually improves the situation \nof women and children who depend on child support. It specifically \ntargets the problems they face under the current bankruptcy system into \na virtual extension of the current national family support collection \nsystem.\n  There may be other aspects of this legislation that we can debate: \nthe balance between creditors and debtors, between different kinds of \ncreditors, or between different kinds of debtors. But on the question \nof child support and alimony, there should be no dispute.\n  Because this bill strengthens the collection of alimony. Period.\n  Over the many years we have discussed this bill, it has earned the \nsupport of the National Child Support Enforcement Association, which \nrepresents over 60.000 child support professionals.\n  It has earned the support of the National Association of Attorneys \nGeneral, which has sent a letter of support personally signed by \ntwenty-seven State attorneys general.\n  Over the years, the child support protections in this legislation \nwere endorsed by the Attorney General of the State of Vermont.\n  The Attorney General of Minnesota endorsed them, too, along with the \nAttorneys General from Illinois, from Massachusetts, and from \nCalifornia, Montana, North Carolina, Michigan, Maryland, Iowa, Hawaii, \nand Washington.\n  The child support and alimony protections in S. 256 are so far \nsuperior to current law that the National District Attorneys \nAssociation, representing more than 7,000 local prosecutors, have \nendorsed them.\n  In addition to those national associations, those protections have \nearned the support of: the California Family Support Council, whose \n2,500 enforcement professionals are responsible for carrying out the \nFederal child support program in California;\n  The Western Interstate Child Support Enforcement Council, composed of \nchild support professionals from the private and public sectors west of \nthe Mississippi River;\n  The California District Attorneys Association, consisting of elected \ndistrict attorneys from each of every one of California's 58 counties \nand over 2,500 deputy district attorneys; and finally,\n  The Corporation Counsel of the City of New York. Yes, even New York \nCity loves this bill.\n  Why has this legislation earned such overwhelming support from the \nprofessionals out in the field and in the trenches who, ever single \nday, seek and enforce child support orders?\n  One reason is the hard work of Phillip Strauss, who, speaking for the \nNational Child Support and Enforcement Association, has represented the \nconcerns of child support professionals in testimony before our \ncommittee over the years we have debated bankruptcy reform. From his \npersonal experience with the problems women and children face under \ncurrent bankruptcy law, he brought together his fellow enforcement \nofficials to draft the provisions I am here to discuss.\n  As Mr. Strauss and his colleagues have told us, right now the \ntreatment of child support and alimony in bankruptcy is a mess, and \nthis bill fixes it.\n  When a deadbeat dad files for bankruptcy under the current system, \nwhat happens to mom and the kids?\n  Well, if the dad is actually making the payments, those payments \nstop. That's right, the payments stop cold. Mom then has to find a \nlawyer or a government advocate, take time off of work, and go to \nbankruptcy court to try to get those payments started\n\n[[Page S2464]]\n\nagain. And when she goes to court, her claim may not be heard that day, \nso she'll have to return again and again . . . or if she's late, she'll \nmiss her day in court.\n  What else happens under current law? When dad's bill collectors show \nup in bankruptcy court, mom has to fight with them over dad's assets. \nThere's a good chance that mom not only needs her payments \nstarted again, but she is due past support--support payments dad never \nmade last month, last year. She needs him to pay her back for all the \npayments he failed to make.\n\n  And in asserting her claim, she is not the ``Number 1'' collector in \nline. Under current law, she is Number 7. That's right--Not So Lucky \nNumber 7. The current Code permits other bill collectors to beat her in \nthe race to get at dad's assets. The current law handicaps her at the \nstarting line. She is forced to wage a fight to make sure she and the \nkids receive their due.\n  And what happens after she fights it out with the bill collectors? \nWell, under the current system, she might be lucky and get every dollar \ndue. But, she may only get a portion of what is due or she may not get \none red cent.\n  That's not right. If a bankrupt household is a sinking ship, then \nwomen and children should be protected first. This is what the current \nlaw fails to do, but it is what this bill does: it puts women and \nchildren first.\n  S. 256 dictates that even if he files for bankruptcy, dad must \ncontinue making those support payments that mom needs to feed and \nclothe her children. Under this bill, women and children will continue \nto receive their support payments during bankruptcy, while everybody \nelse, from the credit card bank to the department store, waits for the \nbankruptcy judge's final order and plan.\n  That alone would be a major improvement over current law. But that is \njust the beginning of the advances of this bill over current law.\n  This bill makes mom ``Number 1'' and places her ahead of all the bill \ncollectors on her past-due claim. No other bill collector--not the \ncredit card company, not the car loan company, not the student \nlenders--can jump ahead of a mother and her children. Every other bill \ncollector must stand in line behind the family.\n  What is so great about the continuation of payments and making mom \n``Number 1''? As a practical matter, she doesn't have to find room in \nher hectic schedule to make appearances in a federal bankruptcy court--\nan intimidating place for most people. She can go to work without \ninterrupting her day. She can complete her errands and pick up her kids \nafter school. Under the bill, she will be automatically first in line \non her claims and she will continue to receive her payments during \nbankruptcy.\n  When we pass this bill, she does not have to work her way through the \nbankruptcy system. The system will work for her, not against her.\n  That's the beauty of this bill: It is self-executing. The provisions \nto be added to the Bankruptcy Code will function automatically. This is \nvital. Unrepresented women will not be harmed by the process, as they \nare under the current Code.\n  Today, under current law, these women have to get an attorney and go \nto court to assert their claims.\n  In addition, under this bill, family support will never be \ndischargeable. It must be paid in full. All of it.\n  This is important because, under the curren, domestic debts may not \nbe paid in full or at all . . . believe it or not. Right now, a \ndeadbeat father can file for bankruptcy and come out without paying one \npenny of support. While his slate is wiped clean, a mother and her \nchildren go without. When this bill passes and the President signs it, \nthe law will hold the deadbeat dad's feet to the fire: he will pay, he \nwill pay in full.\n  There are other important ways that this bill will remove real \nobstacles to justice that exist in current bankruptcy law.\n  This bill not only lifts the stay on support payments during \nbankruptcy, but it adds that, when a wife-beater files for bankruptcy, \na domestic violence restraining order against him must remain in \neffect. It cannot be stayed. And the woman who needs a restraining \norder against him can still get one.\n  I have here an order from a family court in my home state of \nDelaware. A woman went to the court and requested a restraining order \nagainst her abuser, who had already filed for bankruptcy. Incredibly, \nthe judge found, under the current Bankruptcy Code, that a proceeding \nfor a domestic abuse restraining order is automatically stayed ``by \noperation of law.''\n  That's right. We have judges out there right now who look at today's \nBankruptcy Code, and they find that filing for bankruptcy stops all \nproceedings. They find that we have failed to write an exception for \nproceedings like those for domestic violence. They find their hands are \ntied.\n  Then they send a woman in fear for her life off to a federal \nbankruptcy court to lift the Code's automatic stay by filing a special \nmotion. Unbelievable.\n  If you think this is fair, if you prefer this state of affairs, then \nI guess you will vote against this bill. Personally, I am proud of this \nbill, and I wish that those who are fabricating wild claims about it \nwould stop. If they have their way, the women and children in this \ncountry who depend on alimony and child support will be robbed of real \nprotections. That would be a crime.\n\n  Under current law, more than just child support and--alimony are \nstopped in their tracks by the filing of bankruptcy. That automatic \nstay, as it is called, stops a lot of other proceedings that could \nprovide real help to women and children.\n  This legislation changes that. It lifts the stay on a number of \nmethods that family support officials use to go after deadbeat dads, \nwho today can hide behind the bankruptcy system. Unlike current law, \nthis bill would permit reporting the deadbeat's overdue support \npayments to a consumer reporting agency. Under current law, it would \npermit restrictions on a deadbeat dad's driving, professional, or \nrecreational licenses. It would permit family support collection \nofficials to intercept his tax refunds.\n  The legislation also clarifies the definition of support payments, \nending conflicting bankruptcy decisions by different courts that today \nquestion what support payments actually are.\n  Most significantly, though, this bill prevents a father from \ncompleting bankruptcy unless he has paid all his support obligations \ndue after he filed for bankruptcy.\n  Let's think about this. Under current law, a father filed for \nbankruptcy and can complete bankruptcy under a plan that relieves him \nof his past-due domestic obligations. Under the bill, however, this \nscenario will become obsolete. A father will never complete bankruptcy \nuntil he is paid up. He must pay.\n  Moreover, the bill protects mom during a bankruptcy plan. Once a \nfather is under a bankruptcy plan and he fails to make his support \npayments, a mother can march to the bankruptcy court and ask the court \nto dismiss his plan. The court will call dad back in to explain \nhimself. He doesn't want to make payments during his bankruptcy plan? \nFine, he can be thrown out of bankruptcy, and find himself back at \nsquare one.\n  Some claim that this bill lacks compassion. Well, right now, women \nwho want child support orders or who already have orders but fail to \nenforce them slip through the cracks. If we pass this bill, the \nBankruptcy Code will empower women with the information they need.\n  Section 219 of the bill requires the U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee to \nnotify a woman of her rights to use the services of her state child \nsupport enforcement agency and gives her the agency's address and phone \nnumber. Better yet, the Trustee likewise notifies the agency \nindependently of the woman's claim. This is striking.\n  Women who need help will get the information they need, because the \nbankruptcy system is charged with reaching out to family support \nprofessionals--acting under federal family support collection law--and \nputting them at the service of the women and children who need them.\n  This last item needs stressing, Mr. President, because so much has \nbeen made about what will happen after someone who owes family support \npayments comes out of bankruptcy. The claim is that other ``more \npowerful'' creditors will push women and children aside and strip the \ndad bare before he can make payments to his family.\n  That makes for a moving story, Mr. President, but it is fiction, not \nfact.\n\n[[Page S2465]]\n\n  This legislation requires the bankruptcy Trustee to notify both the \nwoman and the family support collection professionals about the dad's \nrelease from bankruptcy, his last known address, the name and address \nof his employer, and a list naming all the bill collectors who will \nstill be collecting from dad.\n  This section helps mothers both during and after bankruptcy.\n  The new notification process will help a mother and the support \nenforcement agencies keep track of a father, where he is working, and \nwhat other bills he is required to pay.\n  Because of this monitoring, which would be put in place by the \nbankruptcy system under this bill, mothers and collection agencies can \nmore easily go to court and get that portion of a father's wages that \nnow really belongs to them. Dad may complete his bankruptcy plan, but \nhis obligations do not stop.\n  These new protections guarantee that family support claims of women \nand children,will always receive ``Number 1'' priority--during and \nafter bankruptcy. The process for obtaining a portion of a father's \nwages--through a wage attachment--gives priority to domestic support \norders over orders held by bill collectors, including credit card \ncompanies.\n  That money is taken out of his paycheck before he even sees it. He \ncan't be forced by ``powerful creditors'' to choose between them and \nhis alimony or child support. Those payments are automatic. Again, the \npicture of greedy bill collectors rushing to the front of the line \nmakes for dramatic storytelling. But it is only that--storytelling.\n  The legislation builds on the existing Federal Child Support \nEnforcement Program, that exists to help women of all walks of life \nreceive their support payments. By tying Federal dollars to federal \nstandards, current law requires state and local support enforcement \nagencies to enforce national standards.\n  A couple of the requirements under Federal family support law are: \nfirst, that immediate wage withholding should be included in all child \nsupport orders; and second, that the withholding of child support \nobligations be given top priority over every other legal process under \nState law against the same wages.\n  Therefore, after bankruptcy, when a mother and the bill collectors \nwalk into court to make claims against the father's wages, the mother \nis again ``Number 1'' in priority and those bill collectors fall in \nline behind her.\n  In response to some of my colleagues concerns--concerns that I would \ncertainly share if I listened to some of the claims out there--I looked \nfor ways to make the system even tighter.\n  I found out that the only way to do that was to require a wage \nattachment, whether the woman wanted one or not. Maybe she wants \nnothing to do with an abusive husband. Maybe she is afraid for him to \nknow her address. We have to leave that decision up to her, but she \nwill get all the help we can give to help her know her rights.\n  As I said, I looked for ways to make this bill stronger in support of \nwomen and children who depend on support payments, and I simply \ncouldn't find any.\n  Even if a father does not earn wages, then support enforcement \nagencies have many tools to use to ensure that the mother and her \nchildren are paid. A support enforcement agency can intercept taxes and \nunemployment benefits, revoke driver's, professional and recreational \nlicenses (like those used for fishing, hunting, and boating), deny \npassports, and institute criminal and contempt actions.\n  That is why, even compared to any imaginary ``powerful creditor'' you \nmight be able to conjure up, mothers and children have real, tangible \nprotections and resources at their disposal to bring a first priority \nclaim against a father's wages after bankruptcy.\n  Finally, let me conclude where I began: with the enthusiasm for this \nlegislation that we have heard from the folks in the trenches.\n  Here is what the National Association of Attorneys General has \nasserted: the bill ``improve[s] the treatment of domestic support \nobligations'' and when the current Code's ``obstacles are removed, as \nthis legislation seeks to accomplish, we believe that our State and \nlocal support offices will continue to be able to collect these monies \neffectively, regardless of whether other lower-priority creditors \nremain.''\n  As I mentioned before, the Association's letter was personally signed \nby the State Attorneys General from twenty-seven States, including \nthe--State Attorneys General from Vermont, Minnesota, Illinois, \nMassachusetts, California, North Carolina, Michigan, Montana, Maryland, \nIowa, Hawaii, and Washington.\n  The National District Attorneys Association, with more than 7,000 \nlocal prosecutors in their membership, does ``not believe that after \nbankruptcy it would be more difficult to collect support simply because \ncredit card debts are not discharged. To the contrary, support \ncollectors have vastly more effective, and meaningful, collection \nremedies before a bankruptcy case is filed, or after the case is \ncompleted, than any other financial institution . . . It is under the \ncurrent law, during bankruptcy, that support collectors have the \ngreatest difficulty because they are in competition with all other \ncreditors for bankruptcy estate assets and because their most effective \ncollections remedies have been stayed . . . This legislation provides a \nmajor improvement to the problems facing child support creditors in \nbankruptcy proceedings.''\n  I support the reform that the enforcement professionals call for, \nfrom New York City to California, from Minnesota to Vermont, from \nMassachusetts to Michigan. I want to save women and children from \nhaving to fight their way through a broken bankruptcy system. I want to \nmake the system work for them, not against them.\n  A vote against this bill is a vote in favor of the current broken \nsystem. A vote for this bill is a vote to protect family support \npayments in bankruptcy.\n  That is why I support this bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know that the Senate is about to pass a \nbankruptcy reform bill, and that this bill will be signed into law. And \nit is with some regret that I say that I will not vote for it.\n  I do believe that there have been cases of abuse of our bankruptcy \nsystem, and that some reform is needed. Nobody likes to hear of wealthy \npeople who walk away from their debts because they can game the system. \nThat's not fair to financial institutions, and perhaps more \nimportantly, it's not fair to Americans who pay their debts in full.\n  I voted for a bankruptcy reform bill twice in the past, most recently \nin 2001. That bill passed in the Senate with significant bipartisan \nconsensus, and I had hoped that it would be signed into law. But the \nHouse of Representatives refused to compromise with the Senate, and \nultimately the bill failed.\n  This time around, I would have liked to have reached another \nbipartisan consensus. However, the bipartisan spirit seems to have \nbroken down.\n  My colleagues on the Democratic side offered a number of amendments \nthat were reasonable, common-sense tweaks to the bill, to reflect \nchanges in our country since the last time the bankruptcy bill was \nconsidered.\n  There have been hundreds of thousands of National Guard and reserve \ntroops called up because of the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. They \nhave left behind their jobs, their businesses, and their families. When \nthey find themselves in bankruptcy, why not allow them some \nconsideration? My colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, offered an \namendment that would have done precisely that, but it was voted down on \na largely partisan vote.\n  Or how about victims of identity theft? In the last few years, \nidentity theft has become a plague on law-abiding citizens. My \ncolleague from Florida, Senator Nelson, offered a most reasonable \namendment, which simply said that if someone is forced into bankruptcy \nbecause of identity theft, he should receive some consideration. That \namendment was also voted down along partisan lines.\n  Or how about Americans who suffered major medical problems and were \ndriven into bankruptcy? A very recent Harvard Medical School study \nfound that about half of all people that have been driven to bankruptcy \nhave suffered a major medical problem. Many of these people have lost \ntheir homes. So Senator Kennedy offered an amendment that would have \nallowed such\n\n[[Page S2466]]\n\nAmericans to keep their home--not a mansion, mind you, but a modest \nhome, while they try to get back on their feet. But this amendment also \nwas shot down.\n  We have not heard good arguments for why these amendments should have \nfailed. The majority party have really only had one argument: that they \nwant to avoid displeasing the House of Representatives, and don't dare \nmodify the Senate bill even with modest, reasonable amendments.\n  Well, I am just not going to support a bill that turns its back on \nservice members and veterans, or on hardworking people that just happen \nto have had a medical crisis, and have been driven into bankruptcy not \nbecause they are gaming the system, but because of circumstances beyond \ntheir control.\n  One other point. This bankruptcy bill was supposed to be about \npreventing cheating in the bankruptcy system. Well, I offered an \namendment, along with Senator Durbin, that would have dealt with a \ndifferent kind of cheating: the fraud, waste, and abuse that has been \nrampant in many of the reconstruction contracts in Iraq. My amendment \nsaid, let's appoint a bipartisan special committee of the Senate to \ninvestigate these abuses. But that amendment did not even get a vote.\n  In 1941, a Senator from Missouri by the name of Harry S Truman heard \nallegations of wasteful and fraudulent spending in the preparations for \nWorld War II. He thought this waste and fraud could undermine the war \neffort, so he drove around the country, visiting military bases. And \nwhen he came back, he called for the creation of a special committee. \nThat committee, which came to be known as the Truman Committee, saved \nthe U.S. government an estimated $15 billion--and that's in 1940s \ndollars.\n  That was a case of a Democrat calling for investigations of contracts \nhandled by a Democratic Administration. But for Harry Truman, this \nwasn't about politics--it was about looking out for the U.S. taxpayer, \nand not squandering resources that were meant for the war effort.\n  We need a Truman Committee again, because the majority party is not \ncalling for oversight hearings on these contracting abuses in Iraq. My \namendment would have created a bipartisan special committee to do just \nthat. But it did not even get a vote, because the majority party rested \non a technicality in Senate rules to deny a vote.\n  Under these circumstances, I am, regretfully, not going to vote for \nthe bankruptcy bill.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to oppose S. 256, the \nBankruptcy Reform Bill. This bill is unfair to the little guy--to \nfamilies who are struggling to overcome medical bills, unemployment, or \ndivorce and find themselves forced to declare bankruptcy. Under the \nguise of reform it makes it tougher on families who have done the right \nthing. That's not what we should be doing in the United States Senate. \nOur job is to make sure we are protecting middle-class Americans and \nsmall businesses who are the lifeblood of our economy, not hurting \nthem. While some of the reforms of the bill are good steps it goes too \nfar to favor credit card companies and corporations over working \nfamilies.\n  This bill creates such strict standards that many of our nation's \nmost vulnerable families are treated unfairly when they are forced to \nfile bankruptcy because of the loss of a job, the high cost of health \ncare or a divorce. This bill does nothing to address the problems these \nindividuals are having, the problems that have driven them to \nbankruptcy and it provides virtually no discretion for courts dealing \nwith these bankruptcy claims.\n  I have supported bankruptcy reform legislation in the past--but it \nwas not this bill and it was not this process. This bill was rushed \nthrough Committee with the promise that amendments would be considered \non the floor, that there would be debate and an opportunity to improve \nthe bill. Yet, none of the amendments were truly considered, most were \nopposed by Republicans marching in lock step to defeat every amendment \nto the existing bill. In short, there was no real opportunity to \nimprove the bill. What came to the floor leaves the floor virtually \nunchanged and truly unfair to many of our citizens who are forced to \nfile bankruptcy because of unforeseen circumstances like job loss, \ndivorce or medical costs.\n  Half of all families filing for bankruptcy have faced illness or high \nmedical costs. Medical costs, especially for seniors, are one of the \nfastest growing causes of bankruptcy. These are not folks who use their \ncredit cards to buy fancy suits, designer wares or other luxury goods. \nThey are paying for the basic necessities of their lives with their \ncredit cards. They are putting their food, clothing and medical bills \non the credit cards. Nearly 9 out of 10 people file bankruptcy because \nof health care problems, job loss or divorce. These individuals don't \nwant to file bankruptcy--in fact, they have tried to avoid bankruptcy. \nThat's why they pay those medical bills with credit cards when they \nsimply can't afford any other way. Or they skip going to the doctor all \ntogether because they know have no means to pay. And what happens--they \nget sicker, incur greater costs for catastrophic care and that sends \nthem spiraling further into debt and forcing many into bankruptcy.\n  We ought to be doing something to help those individuals--not \ncreating a law that will make matters worse. The Senate should be on \nthe side of those Americans who are facing hard times and hard \ndecisions. We should be addressing the lack of health care and working \nto ensure that we are creating good, high paying jobs.\n  I am opposing this version of the Bankruptcy Reform Bill because it \ncreates needless and unfair hoops for these individuals to jump through \nand the rigid means test puts those in real need of relief at a \ndisadvantage. It imposes new burdens on families already overburdened \nby the debt they must shoulder. Certainly we all agree that those who \ncan afford to should pay their creditors back--that they should be \nresponsible for their debt. Those debtors who charge thousands of \ndollars on luxury goods, new cars and the like, only to then declare \nbankruptcy, should be held accountable. Many of us can remember a \nmother or father who taught us about debt, taught us the dangers of \ngetting into debt and to be responsible for paying all our debts back. \nBut we need to be fair in how we calculate who can pay. And we need to \nmake sure that the provisions are not so rigid that they allow courts \nno discretion to take into account the circumstances that lead to the \nbankruptcy.\n  The legislation that the Senate considers today is different from \npast versions that I have supported. There is obviously the removal of \nthe Schumer amendment which held those who block access to abortion \nclinics accountable for the court judgments that they have incurred. \nBut it also gives women, single parents, families and those living in \npoverty less opportunity to overcome their hardships and get a fresh \nstart. This bill punishes people, assumes that all those filing for \nbankruptcy have purposefully created their debt problems, imposes a \nstrict standard that does not take into account the circumstances \nsurrounding the bankruptcy and the real means of individuals to pay \ntheir debt back. That's not fair, it's not right, and it makes life \ntougher on working families. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nstanding up for women, children and working families by opposing this \nbill.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I share my concern over S. 256, the \nBankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, and \nurge my colleagues to vote against this flawed legislation. This \nlegislation provides a misguided and uneven approach to combating \nbankruptcy abuse, especially because it leaves so many causes of \nbankruptcy unaddressed.\n  Most provisions in this bill were written years ago and do not target \nabuses which have recently gained public attention. When this bill was \noriginally drafted, corporate fraud at Enron and elsewhere had not yet \ncome to light. The executives at these corporations had not yet been \ncaught enjoying huge personal gains at the expense of shareholders and \nemployees only to later file for bankruptcy. This bill does not fully \naddress these types of bankruptcy abuses, and unfortunately efforts to \nclose these loopholes failed.\n  At the time this bill was drafted, companies were less likely to file \nfor bankruptcy to shed health care and pension obligations to their \nretirees. In fact, the number of senior citizens in bankruptcy tripled \nfrom 1992 to 2001,\n\n[[Page S2467]]\n\nrepresenting the largest increase of any group. Today, nearly a million \nAmericans have had their pension plans taken over by the Pension \nBenefit Guarantee Corporation and their benefits reduced; this is a \nsubstantial increase from when the bill was drafted. I am disappointed \nthat this body not only voted against the Feingold amendment that would \nhave helped elderly Americans protect their houses, but also against \nthe Rockefeller amendment to improve employees' claim for owed wages \nand benefits. The Rockefeller amendment would have also required \ncompanies that dropped retiree health benefits to reimburse each \naffected retiree for 18 months of COBRA coverage upon reemerging from \nbankruptcy.\n  The bill adds a means test, which supporters of the bill say will \nsignificantly reduce abuse. The nonpartisan American Bankruptcy \nInstitute found that over 96 percent of families seeking to go into \nchapter 7 bankruptcy would be judged as unable to pay under the new \nmeans test. However, the means test would likely deter qualifying \nfamilies from filing for bankruptcy due to the addition of regulatory \nrequirements and legal costs.\n  I am not opposed to sensible bankruptcy law reform, but this is a \nreverse Robin Hood--squeeze the down-on-their-luck middle class and \nimpoverished Americans and give the proceeds to the financial services \nindustry. Contrary to the claims of creditors, many of these families \nsimply cannot pay. About half of families going into bankruptcy have \nhad their utilities or phone shut off, and 60 percent went without \nmedical care. One in five families that are bankrupt because of medical \nbills went without food. Surveys have shown that many of them want to \nrepay their bills but are unable to, and they must ultimately file for \nbankruptcy to stop the harassment of collection agents.\n  This bill does nothing to prevent bankruptcy by targeting its causes. \nWe should work to ensure adequate worker compensation, lower the high \ncost of health care, improve financial education, and stem predatory \nlending.\n  Our middle class is increasingly squeezed. Median family income has \nbeen relatively stagnant, rising by only 12 percent in constant dollars \nfrom 1978 to 2003. This increase has not kept up with families' sharply \nincreasing costs. Health care costs have risen by 327 percent in \nconstant dollars from 1988 to 2004. The real cost of tuition at a four \nyear public university increased by 646 percent from 1978 to 2003. \nChild care costs have risen by 35 percent more than inflation from 1986 \nto 2003.\n  With less disposable income, families are less able to make it \nthrough difficult financial times and can be devastated by a single \nunexpected event. It saddens me that many of my colleagues in the \nmajority voted against Senator Kennedy's amendment to raise the minimum \nwage for the first time in eight years. This measure could have meant \nthe difference to countless Americans between being able to pay their \nbills and having to file for bankruptcy.\n  Indeed, according to a new Harvard Law School study, illness or high \nmedical costs cause half of personal bankruptcies. Certainly this is \nsure to affect the 45 million uninsured Americans, up from 30 million \nin 1978. It also has a traumatic effect on those who do have health \ninsurance, one-third of whom lost it while they were sick. Yet again, I \nbelieve it was a mistake for this body to have killed an amendment to \noffer protections to patients with high medical bills.\n  We also continue to see some banks cross the line into predatory \nlending practices. We must continue to find a balance between providing \naccess to credit and capital and protecting individuals from predatory \nlending. Unfortunately, as many of my colleagues have pointed out, \nmembers of our Armed Forces have become a top target of these unsavory \npractices. Senator Durbin's G.I. protection amendment would have \nextended protections to military members who have been forced into \nbankruptcy because of income loss connected to their service. It would \nalso have protected them from predatory ``pay day'' loans. \nUnfortunately, this amendment was voted down.\n  For all of these reasons, I intend to vote against this flawed \nlegislation, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are now into our second week of \ndebate on this bill, but in fact, we have been talking about it for 8 \nyears, since it was originally introduced.\n  During that time, personal bankruptcies in our Nation have surged, \nwhile the profits of credit card companies have soared.\n  We had an opportunity to pass a good bill that would have curbed real \nabuses of bankruptcy, while protecting consumers who fall on hard times \nbecause of a medical catastrophe, divorce or the loss of a job. \nInstead, the majority rejected dozens of amendments that would have \nprotected the homes of senior citizens, and required credit card \ncompanies to level with consumers about how much they would really pay \nin interest and penalties.\n  Now we are left with a bill that punishes consumers and lines the \npockets of the credit card companies, a bill that protects the mansions \nof multimillionaires who file for bankruptcy protection but makes it \neasier for landlords to evict tenants from their homes if they are \nforced into bankruptcy, and, a bill that makes no distinction between a \nfamily struck by catastrophic illness, and a spendthrift who maxes out \nhis credit cards on a shopping spree.\n  I mentioned catastrophic illness because half of all bankruptcies \ntoday are the result of medical debts. Most families who are driven \ninto bankruptcy by a medical problem probably think it can never happen \nto them because they have health insurance. But it can happen to \nanyone, and it does.\n  Three-fourths of the people who file for bankruptcy because of \nmedical debts have health insurance when the medical problem begins.\n  But eventually their insurance runs out or certain treatments are not \ncovered. And the next thing they know, they are facing financial ruin.\n  Bankruptcy also hits families that have been torn apart by divorce. \nOn Sunday, the Washington Post published a front-page article about \nthis bill.\n  The article described how a woman who was left alone by her husband \nto raise three children had fallen behind on her credit card payments. \nEven though she worked a second job and paid $2,000 a month to the \ncredit card companies, her debt continued to pile up because of \nexorbitant late fees and interest rates. This woman was almost an \nindentured servant to her credit card companies, struggling to pay off \na debt that could never be satisfied.\n  This is not an isolated incident. The trend in the credit card \nindustry today was described by one expert as a ``fee feeding frenzy.''\n  Credit card companies collected almost $15 billion in penalty fees \nlast year--nearly 10 times the $1.7 billion they collected in 1996.\n  Penalty fees have become so important to the bottom line that some \nbanks refer to customers who pay their bills on time as ``deadbeats,'' \nbecause they cannot be hit with exorbitant penalties.\n  It has become commonplace for credit card companies to jack up the \ninterest rates of customers who are slightly late with their payments--\nin some cases, by no more than one day.\n  Credit companies already charge late fees of up to $39 for every late \npayment. Piling a higher interest rate on top of that late fee is like \ndouble jeopardy, and that is not fair to consumers.\n  There are many reasons why a consumer might be a day or two late in \nmaking a credit card payment. Maybe a child got sick and had to see a \ndoctor, and his mom was too busy taking him to the hospital to worry \nabout a credit card payment. Maybe a car broke down, and it had to be \nfixed so a worker could get to their job. Maybe the mail was a little \nslow that week.\n  Whatever the reason, a consumer should not be unfairly and harshly \npunished for one late payment.\n  At the very least, credit card companies should give consumers fair \nwarning before hiking their interest rates. If there is a problem, the \nconsumer should have a chance to correct it before their rate can be \nincreased.\n  But the credit card companies are not interested in fairness. In \nfact, they actually hope customers will be late with a payment so they \ncan be hit with penalty fees.\n\n[[Page S2468]]\n\n  To that end, they engage in ``bait and switch'' tactics to lure \nconsumers with low rates, then automatically jack those rates up the \nfirst time a payment is a day late.\n  One example of this is the Capital One Platinum MasterCard.\n  Customers going to the Capital One Web site to apply for a credit \ncard will find the following ad, which touts ``a great low rate''--an \n``8.9 percent fixed APR.''\n  This ad is pretty prominent. As you can see, the type is large and \neasy to read, and there is a nice picture.\n  On an entirely separate Web page, buried in pages of fine print, \nCapital One discloses that:\n\n       All your APRs may increase to a default rate of up to 25.9% \n     ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE if you default under this Card \n     Agreement because you fail to make a payment to us when due, \n     you exceed your credit line or your payment is returned for \n     any reason. Default APRs will be effective . . . immediately.\n\n  In other words, despite advertising a ``fixed'' rate of 8.9 percent, \nCapital One can almost triple a customer's rate to a whopping 25.9 \npercent--just for sending one payment one day late.\n  The cost of this rate hike to a customer with a balance of $5,000 \nwould be as much as $880 in interest payments over the following year. \nThat is simply too harsh of a penalty for sending one payment one day \nlate.\n  This is the dire situation in which many consumers find themselves. \nEven though they make payments every month, and don't charge any new \npurchases to their credit card, they fall deeper and deeper into debt. \nEventually, seeing no other way out, some of these people declare \nbankruptcy.\n  Many States have passed laws to protect consumers from unscrupulous \npenalties and rate increases. Unfortunately, these laws cannot be \nenforced, as courts have ruled that the banks are bound by the laws of \nthe States where they are located, not where their customers reside.\n  As a result, credit card companies have flocked to States with weak \nconsumer protections, creating a ``race to the bottom.''\n  With this bill, we had an opportunity to put a stop to that, and end \nthe unscrupulous gouging of consumers. By giving consumers a chance to \ncorrect problems before they were hit with higher interest rates, we \ncould have prevented many bankruptcies. Unfortunately, we have \nsquandered that opportunity.\n  This bill does nothing to address the roots of the bankruptcy problem \nin our country today. And it does nothing to help consumers. For that \nreason, I must vote against S. 256.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I voted against a bankruptcy bill \nthat puts credit card companies and politics ahead of ordinary \nAmericans. Rather than providing balanced reform, this bill punishes \nthose who have fallen on hard times--particularly our military families \nand those who are struggling under the weight of soaring medical bills.\n  I have heard from residents across Washington State that the cost of \nmedical care is forcing them into bankruptcy. In fact, a report last \nsummer by the Working for Health Coalition found that half of \nWashington State bankruptcies were due to rising health care costs. \nMost of these families are working and more than half have health \ninsurance, but the growing cost of health care is so overwhelming it \npushes them into bankruptcy. A national study last month found that 61 \npercent of bankruptcy filers did not seek the medical care they needed. \nThese families deserve help, but instead this bill punishes them for \ncircumstances beyond their control.\n  This bill also fails to adequately protect our military families, \nparticularly our Guard and Reserve members. These patriotic families \nhave had to struggle with half their normal income during long--and \noften extended--deployments. Many have seen their businesses collapse \nat home while they have served overseas. I have met with Washington \nState Guard and Reserve families and have seen how they are struggling \nto meet the financial burdens of long deployments. They deserve a \nlifeline, not more paperwork, legal fees, and threats from collection \nagencies. The Senate had an opportunity to protect our soldiers through \nSenator Durbin's amendment, but that was rejected for a Republican \namendment that falls far short. Our military families deserve better.\n  If Republicans had been willing to make the bill less punitive toward \nordinary Americans, they would have adopted a number of reasonable \namendments in committee and on the Senate floor, but they refused. For \nexample, Republicans blocked an amendment that would have protected \nworkers and retirees if their company files for bankruptcy. Republicans \nalso voted down amendments to ensure the elderly don't lose their homes \nand to discourage predatory lending. And they even failed to protect \npeople who have had their identities stolen by criminals who then run \nup huge credit card bills. These are all examples of how Republicans \nare protecting corporate interests at the expense of vulnerable \nindividuals.\n  This bankruptcy bill also stacks the deck against women and children. \nFor example, this bill will make it harder for single mothers to \ncollect the past-due child support they and their children are owed.\n  I am also disappointed that the Senate rejected the Schumer \namendment, which would have assured that those who commit violent \ncrimes at reproductive-health facilities against women and doctors do \nnot escape paying their debts and fines by declaring bankruptcy.\n  Looking at the big picture, this bill fits a pattern of Republican \nproposals that turn the tide against average Americans. Last month, \nRepublicans tipped the scales of justice against working families by \nlimiting their ability to seek compensation for a death or injury \ncaused by a company's negligence. On Monday, Republicans rejected a \nproposal to raise the minimum wage. Taken together, these actions will \nmake life harder for working families and represent a dangerous trend \nthat threatens average Americans.\n  In the past, I have voted for bankruptcy reform legislation, but \ntoday families find themselves in a much different place financially \nbecause of the costs of healthcare and military service. Congress \nshould not punish them for things beyond their control with this \nunbalanced, unfair bill. American families deserve reform, not \nretribution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I cannot vote for this legislation, \nalthough I support bankruptcy reform. It is clear that some people \nabuse the bankruptcy system. However, this bill would make it more \ndifficult for individuals and families who have suffered genuine \nmedical and financial misfortune to get a fresh start. Nearly half of \nall of those studied in a recent research effort by Harvard Law School \nsaid that illness or medical bills drove them to bankruptcy and nine \nout of ten have faced health problems, job loss, divorce or separation. \nA letter to the Chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, \nsigned by nearly a hundred bipartisan bankruptcy law professors from \nlaw schools across the country, said, ``The bill is deeply flawed, and \nwill harm small business, the elderly, and families with children.''\n  I have in the past supported reasonable bankruptcy legislation. The \nlegislation which is before the Senate today could have been greatly \nimproved by a number of reasonable Democratic amendments which have \nbeen offered over the last several days. However, the Republican \nmajority has largely, on a party-line basis, rejected all amendments \nout of hand.\n  I am disappointed that we did not add some reasonable flexibility \nmeasures to the ``means test.'' The purpose of the means test is to \nprevent consumers who can afford to repay some of their debts, from \nabusing the system by filing for chapter 7 bankruptcy. It makes sense \nto require those who are able to repay their debts to do so. However, \nthere are some situations that warrant an exception to the means test. \nFor example, the Senate defeated an amendment that would have exempted \nmembers of the armed services, veterans, and spouses of service members \nwho die while in military service from application of the ``means \ntest'' provisions of the bill. This would have helped them if their \nfamily or their business goes into bankruptcy. That amendment was \ndefeated. Further, an amendment offered by Senator Kennedy that would \nhave exempted from the means test debtors whose severe\n\n[[Page S2469]]\n\nmedical expenses have caused the financial hardship was also defeated. \nSenator Corzine also offered an amendment that would have exempted \neconomically distressed caregivers from the means test, but that \namendment was also defeated by a largely party line vote. The \nRepublican majority even rejected Senator Nelson's common sense \namendment that would have exempted victims of identity theft from the \nmeans test.\n  Further, the Senate defeated amendments that would have protected the \nhomes of our elderly and people forced into bankruptcy after a medical \ncrisis.\n  I am also disappointed that the Senate defeated several amendments \nthat would have closed loopholes used by wealthy individuals seeking \nbankruptcy protection.\n  The Senate had an opportunity to close an increasingly popular \nloophole where the very wealthy shield millions of dollars before \ndeclaring bankruptcy by setting up so-called asset protection trusts. \nSenator Schumer proposed an amendment to put an end to this abuse of \nthe tax system by limiting the use of these trusts to shield assets \nonly up to $125,000. The amendment was defeated 39 to 56.\n  The Republicans also rejected an amendment offered by Senator Durbin \nto curtail the abusive practices of executives at companies like Enron \nand WorldCom who received millions of dollars in compensation shortly \nbefore the companies filed for bankruptcy protection. The chamber also \ndefeated an amendment proposed by Senator Akaka that would have \nprovided credit card users with information to assist them in making \nmore informed choices about their credit card use and repayment. This \namendment would have helped consumers understand the consequences of \ntheir financial decisions, such as making only minimum payments, so \nthat they can avoid the kind of financial pitfalls that lead to \nbankruptcy. Sadly, this amendment was also rejected.\n  The Schumer amendment, which in the past has been strongly supported \non a bipartisan basis by the Senate, was stripped from the bill this \nyear. The amendment, which provides that debts arising from violence \nand threats of violence could not be discharged in bankruptcy \nproceedings, should have been adopted by the Senate.\n  We do need bankruptcy reform, and I wish that the Senate had taken \nthis opportunity to pass equitable reform. This bill does not achieve \nthat goal and therefore I cannot support it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote for \nfinal passage of the bankruptcy reform bill. I have been working on \nthis piece of legislation for a long time, and I am pleased to see that \nwe are nearing the end. This bipartisan bill has been maligned by many, \nand I want to set the record straight. What we are trying to do is fix \na bankruptcy system that has gone awry, where individuals who have the \nability to repay their debts don't do so, and the rest of us are left \nholding the bag.\n  What we have tried to do with this bill is inject some fairness into \nthe system, whereby people who have assets and the ability to repay \nback their debts go into a chapter 13 repayment plan, and people who do \nnot have any means and no ability to repay go into chapter 7. We've \nkept the safety net of full chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge for those \nwho truly need it, and channeled others that can pay their creditors \ninto a repayment plan.\n  This is done through a means test, which is fair and flexible enough \nto take into account all the unique circumstances a debtor and his \nfamily face. The means test takes into account all reasonable and \nnecessary expenses for a debtor and his family. We provide for a court \nto consider ``special circumstances'', so that a debtor can show that \nhe doesn't have the ability to repay, and should stay in chapter 7. The \nbill excludes from the means test poor people, those individuals who \nare below the median income. So if individuals can pay and they really \ndon't have the ability to pay, they will continue to have their debts \nfully discharged in chapter 7 bankruptcy, while those who do have \nassets cannot hide them from their creditors and escape repayment.\n  Let me mention a couple of things this bill does not do. This bill \ndoesn't put the credit card companies first or leaves hard working \nfamilies out to dry, as some of the bill's detractors have claimed. In \nfact, the bill helps women and children and improves their situation \nwhen someone files for bankruptcy because it provides new priorities \nand tools so that child support and alimony will be collected before \nother creditors. We move child support up in priority, up to number one \nfrom number seven in line, and that means that they will be paid before \na lot of other creditors, including the credit card companies. The bill \nmakes staying current on child support a condition of discharge. We \nprovide that debt discharge in bankruptcy is made conditional upon full \npayment of past due child support and alimony.\n  Domestic support obligations are automatically non-dischargeable, \nwithout the costs of litigation. The bill also makes payment of child \nsupport arrears a condition of plan confirmation. The bill provides \nbetter notice and more information to facilitate child support \ncollection, and tracking down deadbeat parents. Further, the bill \nprotects the name of a debtor's minor children from public disclosure \nin a bankruptcy case.\n  This bill also doesn't help credit card companies and other lenders \ntake advantage of honest consumers, as some have alleged. In fact, the \nbankruptcy bill contains some new real and significant consumer \nprotections. The bill requires credit card companies to make new \ndisclosures that benefit customers and prohibits deceptive advertising \nof low introductory rates. It requires credit card companies to provide \nkey information about how much money people owe and how long it will \ntake to payoff their credit card debt by only making a minimum payment. \nThe bill requires lenders to prominently disclose when late fees will \nbe imposed, the date on which introductory or teaser rates will expire, \nand what the permanent rate will be after that time. The bill also \nprohibits lenders from canceling an account because the consumer pays \nthe balance in full each month to avoid finance charges.\n  The bill also provides that consumers will be given a toll-free \nnumber to call where they can get information about how long it will \ntake to payoff their own credit card balances if they only make minimum \npayments on their balance. This will educate consumers about their \nfinancial situations. In addition, the bill allows for more judicial \noversight of reaffirmation agreements, to protect consumers from being \npressured into onerous agreements.\n\n  The bankruptcy bill also includes a debtor's bill of rights to \nprevent bankruptcy mills from preying upon those who are uninformed of \ntheir rights. The bill provides for penalties on creditors who refuse \nto renegotiate reasonable payment schedules outside of bankruptcy. The \nbill provides for penalties on creditors who fail to properly credit \nplan payments in bankruptcy. The bill strengthens enforcement and \npenalties against abusive creditors for predatory debt collection \npractices. Finally, the bill contains credit counseling programs to \nhelp consumers avoid the cycle of indebtedness.\n  So with the bankruptcy bill, we've tried to close loopholes in the \nsystem and eliminate abuses. We've created new consumer protections. \nWe've made chapter 12 permanent. We've made sure that financial markets \nare not subject to risk. Although the bill doesn't contain everything I \nwould have liked to include, it is a good start to putting an end to \nthe abuses.\n  It has been a long haul, but I think we are finally seeing this bill \nthrough to the end. And there are many people that I'd like to thank \nbecause they've been instrumental in getting us to this point. I've \nbeen quite busy lately as chairman of the Finance Committee, working on \nsocial security, medicare and tax reform. I take that responsibility \nvery seriously. Because of Finance Committee markup and hearing \nconflicts, I have had to rely on my colleagues to manage this bill on \nthe floor. But the job has been in very good hands.\n  In' particular, I appreciate Senator Hatch and the diligence that he \nhas shown towards this bill. On more than one occasion, he made sure \nthat the bankruptcy bill made it through the committee process so that \nwe could have it considered on the floor. He has stepped up to the \nplate many a time to manage the bill, work on compromises, and keep the \nengines running. Senator\n\n[[Page S2470]]\n\nHatch is a good friend and colleague, and I respect his perseverance as \nwell as his legal expertise. I'm glad to see that all his hard work \nduring the years has finally come to fruition. Senator Hatch has been a \ntrue stalwart through the years, and I thank him for his dedication to \nbankruptcy reform. I also want to thank his able staff, Perry Barber, \nKevin O'Scanlin and Bruce Artim for all their help on this bill.\n  I especially want to thank Senator Sessions for being a tireless \nchampion of bankruptcy reform here in the Senate. I have relied on his \nintellect and legal prowess for the last eight years that we've been \nworking on this bill. I believe that Senator Sessions has brought a \nunique perspective to the bankruptcy bill with his dedication to \neliminating abuses in the bankruptcy process. He is a firm believer \nthat if you borrow money, you have to pay it back. So I truly am \nthankful for all the work that Senator Sessions has done, especially in \nmanaging this bill on the floor. He is one sharp lawyer, and I am \nhonored to have him as my friend. I also want to thank his staff for \ntheir excellent work, in particular his talented Chief Counsel William \nSmith, Cindy Hayden, Amy Blankenship and Wendy Fleming.\n  I want to thank Chairman Specter for placing this bill at the top of \nthe agenda in the Judiciary Committee, and for moving it so quickly and \nably in this Congress. His staff, Harold Kim, Mike O'Neill, Ivy \nJohnson, Hannibal Kemmerer, Tim Strachan, Brendan Dunn and Ryan \nTriplette have been extremely helpful in getting the job done. I want \nto thank Majority Leader Frist and his staff, Allen Hicks, Eric Ueland, \nSharon Soderstrom and Dave Schiappa, as well as Senator McConnell and \nhis staff, John Abegg, Kyle Simmons, Malloy McDaniel and Brian Lewis.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't thank our friends on the House side, \nand in particular Chairman Sensenbrenner and his staff, Phil Kiko, \nSusan Jensen and Ray Smietanka. Chairman Sensenbrenner has really been \na leader on bankruptcy reform, and a true driving force behind this \nlegislation. I look forward to additional collaborations with him.\n  In addition, I want to thank Senator Carper, Senator Nelson, Senator \nBiden and Senator Johnson. This is truly a bipartisan bill, and it \ncouldn't have gotten done without their help.\n  Finally, I thank my own staff, my Finance Committee Chief of Staff \nand Legislative Director Kolan Davis and my Judiciary Committee Chief \nCounsel Rita Lari Jochum, for their hard work on the bill. I also want \nto thank my former staffer John McMickle, for his expertise and advice \non this important piece of legislation. Good staff is hard to find, and \nI am proud to say that my staff is probably the best in town.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to see the \npassage of S. 256, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer \nProtection Act of 2005. This bill has been under consideration in \nCongress since before I was elected to the Senate. Since my arrival, I \nhave been a proponent of the goals it strives to attain to ensure that \nabuse of America's bankruptcy laws is curtailed and that Americans who \nfind themselves in unanticipated financial duress and have legitimate \nreasons to seek bankruptcy protections will have the opportunity to do \nso.\n  The goal of the bill is to prevent certain abuses of the bankruptcy \nsystem. It includes more than five hundred pages of new and reformed \nlaw, but key provisions include the following.\n  First and foremost, the bill will curb abuse of the bankruptcy system \nby implementing a means test to ensure that those who can afford to \nrepay some portion of their unsecured debts are required to do so. \nBankruptcy petitioners with relatively high incomes could be required \nto file under chapter 13 instead of chapter 7, and repay some of their \ndebt out of future income. The means test takes into account the \npetitioner's income, debt burden, and allowable living expenses, which \ncan vary significantly according to the debtor's place of residence and \nparticular circumstances. Filers who cannot afford to repay at least \n$6,000 will be given unfettered access to chapter 7 liquidation \nproceedings.\n  The bill has a safeguard that will allow judges to consider \nextenuating circumstances in each bankruptcy case. After determining \nthis means test calculation, the judge can then take any ``special \ncircumstances'' into consideration before making a decision to shift \nthe debtor into chapter 13. This will allow judges to consider cases \nwhere catastrophic illnesses or other unexpected financial calamities \nthat have impacted a family or individual to the point where their \ndebts are too heavy a load to carry. This provision made many of the \namendments considered on this bill redundant.\n  The bill implements an important safeguard for family farmers by \nmaking permanent the extension of chapter 12 bankruptcy rules. Chapter \n12 has expired every year, necessitating the need for an extension. \nLast year, Senator Grassley and I worked in a bipartisan fashion to \nsecure the chapter 12 extension. The bill also bumps the exemption \nlevel for family farmers from $1.5 million to nearly $3.24 million, \nwhich will be adjusted periodically for inflation.\n  The bill includes an important provision to safeguard our children. \nIt contains provisions that strengthen the ability of women and \nchildren to collect child support and marital dissolution obligations. \nThis provision will enable some families to continue to provide for the \nneeds of their children.\n  Consumers also benefit from protection measures in this bill. By \nrequiring new minimum payment and introductory rate disclosures for \ncredit cards, consumers will be protected from surprise fees and \nunexpected rate fluctuation. It also contains a `debtor's bill of \nrights' requiring that bankruptcy attorneys and petition preparers \ndisclose their services and fees for those services to consumers.\n  It is important to note that no American will be denied access to the \nbankruptcy system under these reforms. However, those trying to shield \ntheir assets while abandoning their financial responsibilities will \nfind it much more difficult to abuse the system and leave their debts \nfor other Americans to cover through higher interest rates and fees.\n  As I mentioned earlier, there were many amendments to this bill \noffered for consideration. As I considered each of these amendments, I \nmeasured the intended impact of each amendment on the bill. In voting \nagainst many of the amendments I did so knowing that the groups of \nindividuals singled out by the amendments, such as veterans, \nindividuals with chronic health problems, or military personnel, were \nalready adequately protected in the underlying bill.\n  I carefully considered each amendment offered to the bill on a case \nby case basis to determine if the amendment improved the bill. Because \nI believe the bill already covered most of the issues presented in the \namendments, it was my determination than many of the amendments did not \nimprove the bill and thus, I voted against them.\n  Again, this bill includes a safeguard for judges to consider \n``special circumstances'' like medical bills, deployment to war and \nother circumstances. In addition to this safeguard, I supported an \namendment to the bill that clarified the circumstances that might be \nconsidered by a judge. That language provided specific examples a judge \nmight consider including ``a serious medical condition or a call to \norder to active duty in the armed forces.'' I voted for this amendment \nbecause it provided an improvement, in the form of clarity on special \ncircumstances.\n  It is important that creditors, retailers, and small businesses who \nin good faith provide people with credit do not bare the brunt of the \ncost when debtors find themselves unable to pay. It is also critical \nthat we protect consumers who have found themselves in unanticipated \nsituations where their inability to meet their debts is beyond their \ncontrol. And it is important to safeguard consumers against predatory \nlending practices.\n  I worked hard to find the correct balance among these competing goals \non this bill and feel that the Senate did a good job in accomplishing \nthat overriding principal. I am pleased to support this bill because I \nbelieve it provides needed improvements to our bankruptcy protection \nlaws that will benefit every American.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am in opposition to the bankruptcy \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S2471]]\n\n  The financial services industry has become increasingly complex with \nnew technology, products, and services. However, this dated legislation \nhas not had significant changes made to it since the 107th Congress.\n  Predatory lending has surged since the initial development of this \nbankruptcy legislation. In the early 1990s, there were fewer than 200 \npayday lenders nationwide. Now, there are more than 20,000. Payday \nlenders made 100 million loans in 2003. These loans represent more than \n$40 billion. Most alarmingly, according to the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, interest rates on these loans begin at 390 percent.\n  Yet, Congress has failed to act to prevent the exploitation of \nworking families that are short on cash due to unexpected medical \nexpenses or other needs. I am afraid that the passage of this \nlegislation will further reduce the risk for predatory lenders, and as \na result, they will aggressively market their products even more. We \nmust act to protect consumers from these unscrupulous lenders. I remain \ncommitted to restricting all forms of predatory lending, including \npayday loans, and to providing consumers with alternative affordable \nshort-term loans.\n  Access to credit has increased significantly and household debt has \nskyrocketed as a result. Revolving debt, mostly compromised of credit \ncard debt, has risen from $54 billion in January 1980 to more than $780 \nbillion in November 2004. A U.S. Public Interest Research Group and \nConsumer Federation of America analysis of Federal Reserve data \nindicates that the average household with debt carries approximately \n$10,000 to $12,000 in total revolving debt. This legislation tightens \nthe grip that creditors have on consumers, but it fails to restrict the \naggressive marketing practices of credit card companies.\n  In addition, this bankruptcy bill fails to provide adequate, timely, \nand meaningful disclosures for consumers. As we make it more difficult \nfor consumers to discharge their debts in bankruptcy, we have a \nresponsibility to provide additional information so that consumers can \nmake better informed decisions. S. 256 includes a requirement that \ncredit card issuers provide a generic warning about the consequences of \nonly making the minimum payment. This provision fails to provide the \ndetailed information for consumers on their billing statements that my \namendment would have provided. My amendment would have given consumers \nthe detailed personalized information necessary for them to make better \ninformed choices about their credit card use and repayment. It would \nhave required companies to inform consumers of how many years and \nmonths it would take to repay their entire balance and the total cost \nin interest and principal, if the consumer makes only the minimum \npayment. The amendment would also have required consumers to be \nprovided with the amount they need to pay to eliminate their \noutstanding balance within 36 months. Finally, my amendment would have \nrequired that creditors establish a toll-free number so that consumers \ncan access trustworthy credit counselors. Unfortunately, this amendment \nwas defeated.\n  I appreciate the willingness of the Chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, Senator Shelby, to continue to work with me on this very \nimportant consumer awareness issue.\n  I also proposed an amendment that would have required credit card \ncompanies to make concessions to individuals in debt management plans \nso that credit counseling could be a viable alternative to bankruptcy. \nUnfortunately, that amendment was also defeated.\n  I fear that this bill will end up significantly harming families that \nhave suffered financially due to illnesses, the loss of a job, or the \ndeath of a loved one. I supported other reasonable amendments intended \nto protect low-income families, the elderly, and other vulnerable \npopulations from this overly restrictive legislation. However, these \namendments also failed.\n  Instead of making improvements to the legislation, an old, outdated \nbill has been approved by the Senate. It is low-income working families \nthat will be hardest hit by this anti-consumer legislation. After \npassage of this legislation, we will need to take additional steps to \nprevent further exploitation of consumers by unscrupulous lenders and \nto improve relevant and useful information about credit to consumers. I \nwill continue to fight to protect working families from predatory \nlenders and overly aggressive creditors.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I strongly believe that reform of our \nbankruptcy laws is necessary. Too often, bankruptcy is used as an \neconomic tool to avoid responsibility for unsound decisions and \nreckless spending.\n  Last year Americans paid interest on about $690 billion in revolving \ndebt. Most of that debt is credit card debt. According to a Consumer \nFederation of America study, the average household carries between \n$10,000 and $12,000 in credit card debt and has nine credit cards. \nConsumers pay an average interest rate of 12.4 percent or approximately \n$85 billion annually in credit card debt interest.\n  Let me point out that during both the 105th and 106th Congress, I \nsupported legislation to reform bankruptcy laws and end the abuse of \nthe system.\n  However, I am unable to support the Bankruptcy Reform Act before us \ntoday because I believe it is unfair and unbalanced, does far too \nlittle to help consumers and curb creditor abuses, and includes an \ninflexible ``means test'' that will harm many debtors who are genuinely \nin need of the protections and the ``fresh start'' that bankruptcy is \nintended to provide.\n  The Bankruptcy Code currently offers two alternatives for \nindividuals: chapter 7, under which a debtor's assets are sold and the \nproceeds are divided among creditors, and chapter 13, under which \ndebtors who have a regular income develop a repayment plan for a \nportion of the debt. In many cases, debtors filing under chapter 13 \nrepay a greater proportion of their debt than those filing under \nchapter 7.\n  The Bankruptcy Reform bill creates a ``means test'' that will make it \nmore difficult for individuals earning above the median income level to \nerase debts under chapter 7, forcing them to file under chapter 13, \nwhich would require them to repay a greater portion of their debt. I \nbelieve that those who can afford to repay a greater portion of their \ndebts during the bankruptcy process should be required to do so.\n  A narrowly targeted reform bill designed to reduce abuse of the \nsystem would provide bankruptcy judges with the discretion to dismiss \nor convert a case to chapter 7, but would not mandate it. It would have \nprovided creditors the opportunity to ask for a dismissal or conversion \nwithout putting the burden on every filer to prove that he or she \ndeserves the protections of chapter 7.\n  However, the ``means test'' included in the bill is inflexible, and \nit provides no room for a bankruptcy judge to determine whether the \ncircumstances that led to the debtor's financial situation warrant \ntreatment under chapter 7. A parent with a sick child bankrupted by \nmedical bills is treated the same way as a reckless spender who ran up \ndebt on luxury items. That's simply not right.\n  Again and again, Senators offered amendments that sought to increase \nthe flexibility of the ``means test'' and offered other changes to \nimprove many aspects of this legislation. Unfortunately, in almost \nevery case, these amendments were defeated.\n  The Senate voted against giving any relief to families forced into \nbankruptcy by devastating health care costs. One million men and women \neach year turn to bankruptcy protections in the aftermath of a serious \nmedical problem--and three-quarters of them have health insurance. \nSenator Kennedy offered amendments to exempt from the means test \ndebtors who have incurred large medical expenses and other reasonable \nconsiderations. Both his amendments were defeated.\n  The Senate voted against relief for children caught up in their \nparents' bankruptcy. And it voted against relief to help military \nfamilies who are struggling with the burdens in Iraq and around the \nworld.\n  The Senate defeated critical consumer protections that would simply \ngive consumers more information and might help end some of the abusive \nand deceptive practices of some credit card companies. The industry \npushes out an incredible 5 billion solicitations every year. Under \ncurrent regulations companies can change interest rates at almost any \ntime. They market aggressively and, I believe for some, deceptively. \nOnly last year, the Office of the\n\n[[Page S2472]]\n\nComptroller of the Currency issued an advisory letter warning national \nbanks that engaged in deceptive credit card marketing and account \nmanagement practices that they would face compliance and reputation \nrisks.\n  Remarkably the bill does protect the wealthiest Americans by allowing \nthem to continue hiding their assets from creditors during bankruptcy \nand never making good on their debt. Senator Schumer offered an \namendment to eliminate and end this abuse, and it was defeated. And it \ndoes not stop corporate executives from looting their companies and \nleaving workers, stockholders, and creditors holding the bag. How can \nwe target middle-class families and ignore the wealthiest Americans as \nthey hide their assets?\n  This bill is needlessly punitive to families. It is as if we have \ngone out of our way to harm and not help them. For example, when a \ndebtor receives a bankruptcy discharge, the legislation sets up new \nclasses of nondischargeable debt that will compete for payment along \nwith child and family support. Senator Dodd offered an amendment to \nenable parents to better meet the needs of their children during \nbankruptcy. Unfortunately, it was defeated. The credit card companies \nbeat the kids on that vote.\n  This bill is not only detrimental to consumers, but it also hurts our \nsmall businesses. This effort to reform our bankruptcy laws will make \nit more difficult for entrepreneurs to start a small business and \nimposes additional regulations and reporting requirements on small \nbusinesses who file for bankruptcy.\n  I believe we must do everything possible to ensure the viability of \nsmall businesses and to assist in fostering entrepreneurship in our \neconomy. Regulatory and procedural burdens should be lowered for small \nbusiness wherever possible. However, the bill fails to meet this \nchallenge. Instead, this legislation promotes additional red tape and a \ngovernment bureaucracy. It imposes new technical and burdensome \nreporting requirements that are more stringent on small businesses that \nfile for bankruptcy than they are on big business. Further, the bill \nwill provide creditors with greatly enhanced powers to force small \nbusinesses to liquidate their assets.\n  Any big business would have difficulty complying with these new \nburdensome reporting requirements. But think of the difficulties an \nentrepreneur or a mom-and-pop grocery store will have in complying with \nthis dizzying array of new and complex requirements. These small \nbusinesses are the most likely to need, but least likely to be able to \nafford, the assistance of a lawyer or an accountant to comply with \nthese new requirements. I cosponsored an amendment offered by Senator \nFeingold to strike many of the small business provisions in the bill \nbecause they would increase reporting requirements on small businesses \nand make it easier for creditors to force liquidations of small \nbusiness during the bankruptcy process. Unfortunately, that amendment \nwas not adopted.\n  I am pleased that an amendment sponsored by Senator Collins and \nmyself which will extend chapter 12 bankruptcy protections to our \nfamily fishermen, has been included in the bill. The small, family-\nowned fishing businesses are in serious trouble. We are making progress \nin rebuilding stocks; however, the cost of this progress has been \ncarried by fishermen working Georges Bank and the Gulf of Maine. The \nCollins-Kerry amendment will help ensure that fishermen have the \nflexibility under chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code to wait out the \nrebuilding of our commercial fish stocks without back tracking on our \nconservation gains to date. It will help preserve the rich New England \nfishing heritage in Massachusetts.\n  Despite some provisions, which I do believe improve the system, \noverall this bill does not provide bankruptcy reform. Inexcusably, this \nbill helps creditors without helping consumers. It will let the very \nrich continue to hide money in homes and trusts. It gives no relief to \nfamilies hit by medical bills or other financial hardship. It even puts \ncredit card companies ahead of children when debt is allocated to \ncreditors. I will vote no.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today, for me, marks the culmination of \n8 long years of hard work, and I am glad we have finally reached this \npoint, where we will not only pass this bill, but the House will do so \nas well and the President will sign it into law. I believe that we have \neliminated some abuses with this bill. I wish we could have \naccomplished more, but we could not let the perfect be the enemy of the \ngood. Let me say to my colleagues, that there are some issues like \nhomestead and asset trusts that will come back, and I look forward to \nworking on those, but make not mistake about it, this is a good bill \nand I am excited to see it pass.\n  The policy questions we have been addressing are these:\n  (1) whether bankruptcy is a necessary and permitted way to recover \nfrom overburdening debt; and\n  (2) when is bankruptcy being abused and used as an escape valve for \nindividuals capable of repaying some, if not all, of their debt.\n  The goal of this bill has never been to create additional burdens for \nthose who have over-extended themselves for one reason or another, but \nto help them achieve financial responsibility after bankruptcy, so that \nthey can avoid similar setbacks in the future.\n  It is clear to me that when you have statements from debtors that \nthey are using bankruptcy to ``[take] advantage of one of the \nopportunities the Government offers,'' that the responsibility for \nslowing down the 1.6 millions consumer bankruptcy filings per year lies \nwith Congress.\n\n  As we approached this bill, our goal was not to punish those who \nlegitimately need the fresh start that bankruptcy offers. However, our \ngoal was to disallow people from filing bankruptcy simply for the sake \nof taking advantage of a financial opportunity provided by the \ngovernment. People who can afford to pay all or a part of their debts \nover a limited period of time should not get off Scot free.\n  Let me just for a moment, talk about the concept of bankruptcy. The \nterm derived from the medieval Italian phrase ``broken bench.'' \nMerchants would sell their wares in the marketplace from benches. If \nthe merchant ever reached a point where he could not pay his debts, his \ncreditors would seize all of his wares and divide it among themselves. \nThey did not stop with the seizing of wares, however. The creditors \nwould break the merchants' bench, to bankrupt the merchant from \nreopening.\n  Our goal under this legislation was not and we did not ``break the \nbench.'' Instead of trying to prevent merchants or individuals from \nhaving a second opportunity, we accomplished just the opposite. People \nwho need a fresh start under this bill will get one. The people who can \npay some of their debts back will have to do that. Let me just \nhighlight a few of the benefits in this bill.\n\n  First, S. 256 requires that individuals receive credit counseling \nprior to filing for bankruptcy. This counseling will help an individual \ndecide if bankruptcy is the appropriate mechanism to remove debt and \nwill help the individual understand what filing bankruptcy actually \nmeans. In many instances, the deceptive and fraudulent advertising \npractices of bankruptcy mills lure consumers into bankruptcy \nunnecessarily. Debtors should know that there are many ways to get back \non their feet financially--such as entering into voluntary repayment \narrangements.\n  To curb the practice of preying upon debtors, S. 256 establishes the \nDebtor's Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights requires that debt relief \norganizations disclose the nature of the services they offer, explain \nthe alternatives to filing bankruptcy, disclose the rights and \nobligations of debtors who file for bankruptcy, and explain the \nconsequences of filing for bankruptcy.\n  Second, S. 256 establishes a means test to help determine whether \npeople are capable of paying back a meaningful portion of their debts. \nThis test might help the debtor avoid a Chapter 7 filing, where \ncreditors will liquidate the individuals assets and where the debtor \nwill have a very hard time getting creditors to extend credit to them \nin the future. If a debtor files under Chapter 13 and learns how to \nmanage money under a structured repayment plan that requires some \ndiscipline, the debtor learns financial responsibility and should be \nable to avoid future financial turmoil. Chapter 13 bankruptcies allow \ndebtors to keep their assets and pay back a portion of their\n\n[[Page S2473]]\n\ndebts over a 5 year period. In exchange, the remaining portions of \ntheir debt are discharged and the debtor gets a fresh start.\n\n  Third, S. 256 creates new protections for consumers, especially in \nthe area of credit cards. We require credit card companies to disclose \nthe dangers of making only a minimum payment and we prohibit deceptive \npractices like advertising low introductory rates--rates used to bait \nand switch the credit card holder. We also require that a toll-free \nnumber be provided to consumers, where they can obtain information on \nhow long it will take to payoff their credit card balances.\n  The consumer benefits of this bill are enormous. Instead of breaking \nthe bench, this bill promotes financial responsibility. The bill vastly \nimproves the current situation in bankruptcy for certain categories of \nindividuals. For example, it provides special benefits to women and \nchildren, through child support and alimony, and provides parents the \nability to deduct expenses such as school tuition. Make no mistake \nabout it, while the bill provides some increased protection for \nunsecured creditors, it provides more protection for \nconsumers. Logically, there is absolutely no reason to oppose it.\n\n  Mr. President, over time, many people have worked on this bill, and I \nwould just like to take a moment to express my appreciation for their \nwork.\n  First, it has been an honor to work closely with Senators Grassley \nand Hatch to make this legislation a reality. I appreciate both of them \nso much and I believe they both have done yeomen's work on this bill. I \nthank Senator Frist for making this bill one of his top priorities and \nI appreciate the leadership of Senator McConnell.\n  I think it is appropriate that we take just a moment to express \nappreciation to some people who gave extraordinary effort to make this \nsuccessful conclusion.\n  First, I note that in my office it has taken three chief counsels to \nget through this bill. I appreciate the hard work of Kristi Lee, my \nfirst Chief Counsel and currently a magistrate judge in the Southern \nDistrict of Alabama. She did an outstanding job on this bill during the \nfirst years that this legislation was in the Senate. I also appreciate \nthe work of my former Chief Counsel Ed Haden, who is currently doing \nappellate litigation at one of Alabama's outstanding law firms, Balch \nand Bingham. While I also appreciate the work of my current Chief \nCounsel, William Smith, and legislative counsels Amy Blankenship and \nWendy Fleming for their efforts in this endeavor, my Deputy Chief \nCounsel Cindy Hayden has really given an extraordinary effort on this \nbill.\n\n  These fine staffers have worked night and day for two weeks to guide \nthis bill to passage. William Smith has given every ounce of his \nstrength to successful passage. He deserves particular praise.\n  Additionally, I appreciate the work of Lloyd Peeples, a former \ncounsel of mine who has clerked for a bankruptcy judge and now serves \nas an AUSA in the Northern District of Alabama. He provided invaluable \nassistance on this bill.\n  Sean Costello, a former counsel of mine who now works for the Office \nof Justice Programs at the Department of Justice, provided outstanding \nwork to help make this bill a reality.\n  Brad Harris, a former counsel of mine who now works for the Burr and \nForman firm in Birmingham, never failed in working long hours and \nproviding key assistance in seeing this bill through.\n  And finally, Brent Herrin, my former counsel who worked hard on cram \ndown and other issues, did outstanding work. Brent practices tax law \nfor the Deloitte Touche firm in Atlanta.\n  For eight years, these lawyers have all worked on this legislation. I \nknow they are happy to see it come to a conclusion. I am too.\n  In the past I have thanked the former staffers from other offices \nthat have worked on this bill, I will not name them individually today, \nsave John McMickle who served Senator Grassley and played a major role \nin helping to craft this bill. John believes in the underlying \nprinciples in this bill and I appreciate his work.\n\n  I also want to thank Rita Lari Jochum, Senator Grassley's current \nChief Counsel. I have seen very few staffers with her drive and \ndedication and she is to be commended for her efforts on this bill. Her \ngood demeanor has been a source of calm in the storm.\n  I appreciate the work Perry Barber, Brendan Dunn, Kevin O'Scannlain, \nand Bruce Artim of Senator Hatch's staff, and the work of Harold Kim, \nIvy Johnson, Tim Strachman, Mike O'Neill, Hannibal Kemmerer and Ryan \nTriplette of Senator Specter's staff.\n  I must also thank Dave Schiappa, Allen Hicks, Eric Ueland, Sharon \nSoderstrom, John Abegg, Kyle Simmons, Malloy McDaniel and Brian Lewis \nfrom the Leadership staffs of Senators Frist and McConnell, all who \nhave provided tremendous assistance along the way in shaping this bill \ninto its final form.\n  Mr. President, I also want to thank Chairman Sensenbrenner and his \nstaff for their remarkable work in getting this bill done. Phil Kilko \nand Susan Jensen did outstanding work on this bill.\n  I thank the senior Senator from Alabama, Senator Shelby, for his work \non this bill. He guarded his banking jurisdiction like a roaring lion.\n  This is a great day, Mr. President. I thank the Chair and yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote on final passage \nof the bankruptcy reform bill. This bill constitutes the most sweeping \noverhaul of bankruptcy law in 25 years. Like class action, bankruptcy \nreform curbs abuse of the legal system. I am hopeful that it will pass \nwith a strong bipartisan vote.\n  Bankruptcy reform has long been in the works. Similar bills have \npassed the Senate in the 105th, the 106th, and 107th Congresses. Today, \nin the 109th we will finally deliver a package that restores fairness \nand personal responsibility to the bankruptcy system.\n  The House has agreed to take up the legislation, pass it quickly, and \nsend it to the President for his signature.\n  I thank my colleagues for their hard work and leadership. In \nparticular, I would like to thank: Senator McConnell, a good friend and \ncounselor, who has made sure that we have the votes on every amendment \nand who has helped secure final passage; Senator Grassley, the bill's \nlead sponsor, who has been a tireless advocate for bankruptcy reform \nfor nearly a decade; Chairman Specter, who skillfully led the bill \nthrough Committee; Senator Hatch, who, as a floor manager, has led on \nthe substance of each and every amendment; and Senator Sessions, who \nhas led debate on the floor again and again, and who lent his expertise \nto explain the finer points of the law.\n  Like class action, the bankruptcy reform bill is another example of \nbipartisan cooperation. Nearly every vote on every amendment has been \nbipartisan. Our work has been a great example of how thoughtful, \nbipartisan negotiation can deliver meaningful solutions for the \nAmerican people.\n  America has always been a place for second chances. As Americans, we \nvalue innovation, reinvention and risk taking. It's part of our \nnational DNA, part of why we are so spectacularly successful. It's also \nwhy America has long supported generous bankruptcy law. We recognize \nthat sometimes people get in over their head, or are hit with an \nunexpected set back, and they need a fresh start, a second chance.\n  Congress has passed, and courts have upheld, Federal bankruptcy laws \nfor over 100 years. The Constitution gives Congress the express power \nto ``establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout \nthe United States.''\n  As the Supreme Court has stated, ``One of the primary purposes of the \nBankruptcy Act is to give debtors a new opportunity in life and a clear \nfield for future effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement \nof preexisting debt.''\n  Unfortunately, however, the system has veered away from its original \npositive intent. In the past two decades, bankruptcies have \nskyrocketed--actually accelerating during the economic boom years of \nthe 80's and 90's.\n  Last year, we reached an historic high of over 1.6 million filings \nper year. The total number of bankruptcies more than doubled during the \n1980's and then doubled again from 1990 to 2003. Personal bankruptcies \noutnumber business bankruptcies by a multiple of more than 45.\n  We all pay the price for these bankruptcy filings. Every bill you and \nI pay\n\n[[Page S2474]]\n\nincludes a hidden ``bankruptcy tax'' of $400 per year per household. \nThat tax is figured into in every phone bill, electrical bill, mortgage \npayment, furniture purchase, or car loan we pay.\n  For many people, bankruptcy has become a first step rather than a \nlast resort. Opportunistic debtors who have the means to repay use the \nlaw to evade personal responsibility. In some cases, they even plan \ntheir bankruptcy, buying a mortgage and running up credit cards and \nthen declaring they're broke.\n  With this bill, we are putting an end to the abuse. Wealthy debtors \nwho have the means to pay some, or all, of their debt will be required \nto do so.\n  The bankruptcy bill establishes a means test based on a simple, fair \nprinciple: those who have the means should repay their debts. The \nlegislation specifically exempts from consideration anyone who earns \nless than the median income in their state. It allows every filer to \nshow ``special circumstances'' if they cannot handle a repayment plan.\n  And it makes clear that active duty military, low income Veterans, \nand debtors with serious medical conditions are protected by these safe \nharbor provisions.\n  But for those individuals who are abusing the system, they will no \nlonger be able to hide behind the law. Nor will they be able to duck \ntheir family responsibilities. These new reforms make child support a \nhigh priority.\n  Most people who get into financial trouble want to do the right \nthing. They want to make good on their obligations and pay what they \nowe. But they are in over their head and need a fresh start. This \nlegislation will not affect the vast majority of these filers. What it \nwill do is close loopholes that have let unscrupulous debtors slip \nthrough.\n  Today's impending vote is a victory for fairness, compassion and \ncommon sense. It took eight years, but we are finally here.\n  I applaud my colleagues for their leadership. Together with class \naction reform, we are returning fairness and common sense to the legal \nsystem.\n  When the legal system gets off track, it affects us all, consumers, \ncreators, and innovators alike. Jobs are lost. Prices go up. We pay in \nbig and small ways. By reforming the system, we strengthen our ability \nto grow. We keep America moving forward.\n  I look forward to tackling other lawsuit abuse issues including gun \nmanufacturer liability, medical liability, and asbestos reform. I am \nhopeful that we will continue to work together delivering meaningful \nsolutions to the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now \nbe a period for morning business with Senators permitted to speak for \nup to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise for two purposes. The first is to \ndraw attention to a recent program at the Supreme Court on the work of \nJustice Robert Jackson and Thomas Dodd, the father of Senator \nChristopher J. Dodd, dealing with the International Military Tribunals \nat Nuremberg. I was happy to read the remarks of my colleague, Senator \nDodd, at the event, and I was interested to find that many of the \nconclusions he draws from his father's experiences remain essential to \nour conduct of international justice today--and, unfortunately, they \nare all too often forgotten.\n  I would first echo the remarks made by Senator Dodd and salute the \nextraordinary work performed by Justice Robert Jackson and Thomas Dodd \nin their roles as the U.S. Chief Prosecutor and Deputy Prosecutor, \nrespectively, at Nuremberg over 50 years ago.\n  The Nuremberg Tribunal taught us many lessons: that even in the \ndepths of war, justice is not blind; that those who practice terror, \noppression, hatred, and mass murder will be punished. Perhaps equally \nimportant, however, was the notion that they should also be afforded a \ntrial. Indeed, the United States committed itself to overcoming the \npassions of the moment and reaffirming the rule of law. I believe this \naction set an important precedent that is still applicable today.\n  Critically, the Tribunal also helped record the horrific crimes of \nthe Nazi regime so the whole world would see the brutality and \nunderstand the depravity of those unimaginable acts.\n  Unfortunately, crimes against humanity have occurred since the \nNuremberg Tribunals, and they continue to occur today in places such as \nDarfur in Sudan. I believe that it is again necessary to remind \nourselves of the important lessons learned over 50 years ago when \nJustice Robert Jackson and then Thomas Dodd--soon to be Senator Thomas \nDodd--brought before the world the evidence of Nazi atrocities and \nsaid, ``This cannot stand.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the remarks of Senator Dodd at the \nSupreme Court on February 15, 2005, entitled, ``Justice Served, Lessons \nLearned: Robert Jackson, Thomas Dodd and the Nuremberg Trials,'' be \nprinted in the Record following my comments here today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to take the time \nto read this speech and consider this important message and its \napplication today.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Justice Served, Lessons Learned: Robert Jackson, Thomas Dodd, and the \n                            Nuremberg Trials\n\n       It's a privilege to be with you in the Supreme Court \n     Chamber, where cases that have changed the course of our \n     nation's history have been argued and decided.\n\n[[Page S2475]]\n\n       As a United States Senator, it's not often that I make my \n     way across the street to this building and to this branch of \n     government.\n       Two years ago, I was here to observe oral argument in \n     Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs. That case \n     considered the constitutionality of the Family and Medical \n     Leave Act. I was interested because I authored the Family and \n     Medical Leave Act in the Senate.\n       The bill had survived two Presidential vetoes and had taken \n     seven years to become law. But in this institution, these \n     facts were of little consequence. Nothing is quite as \n     humbling as Justices deciding whether or not to strike down a \n     law you labored over for years. I was relieved when the \n     Court, by a margin of 6 to 3, upheld the Act.\n       But that visit, and others I've made over the years, \n     prompted me to think about the differences between the Senate \n     and the Supreme Court.\n       Senators show up to work in suits; Justices wear robes.\n       Senators are under the constant scrutiny of television \n     cameras; Justices have somehow managed to keep them out of \n     this Chamber.\n       And, of course, Senators have to run for re-election every \n     six years; Justices of the Supreme Court have the best job \n     security in the world.\n       So it's understandable why no fewer than 13 United States \n     Senators later served on the Supreme Court. That number \n     includes three Chief Justices--Salmon Portland Chase, Edward \n     Douglass White, and Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut.\n       I tried to comfort myself by finding what I assumed would \n     be an equally long list of Justices who resigned their seats \n     on the Court for the honor and privilege of serving in the \n     U.S. Senate. But that list was exactly one name long.\n       That lone individual, I discovered, was David Davis, U.S. \n     Supreme Court Justice, and later Senator from Illinois. He \n     was appointed to the Court by Abraham Lincoln in 1862, and \n     served here for 15 years before resigning in 1877 when he was \n     elected a Senator by the Illinois state legislature.\n       It should be noted, though, that the U.S. Senate wasn't his \n     first choice. He was a candidate for the presidential \n     nomination five years earlier in 1872. He sought the \n     nomination of what was then known as the ``Liberal \n     Republican'' party. Some might suggest it was that \n     characteristic that would make him most unique today.\n       I'd like to recognize, of course, Justice Souter, who has \n     joined us this evening. And though he isn't here today, I'd \n     also like to recognize Chief Justice Rehnquist.\n       Justice Rehnquist is a wonderful student of history who has \n     done so much to educate our nation and the world about this \n     unique institution. And as I'm sure many of you know, from \n     1952 to 1953 he served as a law clerk for Justice Robert \n     Jackson.\n       Last month I had the honor of participating in the \n     inauguration of President Bush. I don't think anyone watching \n     the ceremony on that day could fail to be moved by the \n     courage and fortitude displayed by Chief Justice Rehnquist. I \n     think I speak for everyone here, and countless others, as \n     well, in wishing him well this evening.\n       I'd like to thank Barrett Prettyman of the Supreme Court \n     Historical Society for his kind introduction, and I'd like to \n     thank Professor John Barrett for his historical notes as \n     well.\n       I'd also like to thank Greg Peterson of the Robert H. \n     Jackson Center for his remarks, and for the invitation to \n     speak to you this evening. And I'd like to welcome members of \n     the Jackson family who have joined us this evening.\n       If Nuremberg was the most profound experience that \n     influenced my father's life, there were few individuals whose \n     words and ideas carried greater weight with my father than \n     those of Robert H. Jackson.\n       Justice Jackson was truly an extraordinary man whose life's \n     journey took him from a farmhouse in upstate New York, to the \n     U.S. Department of Justice, where he served as Solicitor \n     General and Attorney General, to the Supreme Court, to a \n     courtroom in Nuremberg, Germany. Following Nuremberg, he \n     returned to this very chamber where, less than five months \n     before he passed away, he and his eight colleagues voted to \n     end racial segregation in schools across our land.\n       Robert Jackson graduated from neither college nor law \n     school.\n       And prior to his appointment to the Supreme Court, he had \n     never served as a judge. Yet he became one of the most \n     respected jurists of his time, one known for his \n     thoughtfulness, his fairness, his courage, and his \n     eloquently-written opinions. He was an ardent defender of the \n     freedoms articulated in our nation's Bill of Rights.\n       Of particular relevance today, Justice Jackson defended \n     these freedoms even during times of war, and even when he was \n     at odds with many of his fellow justices. He was one of only \n     three justices to dissent in Korematsu v. United States, \n     which allowed the detention of Japanese-Americans in \n     internment camps during World War II--a decision we now \n     regard as a stain on our nation's historical commitment to \n     freedom and justice.\n       Most of all, Justice Jackson was committed to promoting and \n     enforcing the rule of law, not only here in the United States \n     but around the globe, as well.\n       Having witnessed the horrors of Nazi Germany, he had a deep \n     and abiding belief that the law is humanity's strongest and \n     noblest weapon against tyranny and oppression.\n       We gather here this evening two days after the 113th \n     anniversary of Justice Jackson's birth, and just a few months \n     after the 50th anniversary of his passing on October 9, 1954.\n       It's fitting, as well, that we assemble here two weeks \n     after the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.\n       More than any other events, the liberation of Auschwitz and \n     the Nuremberg trials were the two events that laid bare \n     before the entire world the horrors committed by the Nazi \n     regime.\n       At liberation, the Western world saw, for the very first \n     time, the gas chambers, the cattle cars, and the crematoria. \n     They saw gruesome piles of corpses, and the emaciated few who \n     had survived the largest and deadliest of Hitler's death \n     camps. At Nuremberg, the war and the Final Solution were \n     painstakingly and meticulously documented and recorded so the \n     existence of these horrific events would never, ever be in \n     doubt.\n       With each passing day, there remain fewer and fewer of \n     those who can personally bear witness to the atrocities of \n     the Nazi regime. As a result, our generation's responsibility \n     becomes even greater--to ensure that the lessons we learned \n     six decades ago do not fade away into the mist of history.\n       This responsibility was one that my father took very, very \n     seriously--and it was reflected in how he raised his six \n     children. From a very early age, he would tell us about Adolf \n     Hitler and Heinrich Himmler, and describe places like \n     Auschwitz, Buchenwald, and Dachau.\n       My father believed firmly that the value of the Nuremberg \n     experience would not only be in the individual sentences \n     meted out to the named defendants--but, in a larger sense, in \n     the legacy the trial would leave to future generations.\n       In hindsight, some might think it was inevitable that \n     nations like ours would judge criminals like the Nazis \n     according to the rule of law. In reality, there was great \n     debate, both here in the United States and among our allies, \n     over how to handle the Nazi leaders.\n       We know today that as many as four Supreme Court Justices, \n     and many others including the powerful Senator from Ohio, \n     Robert Taft, felt that the trials at Nuremberg would be a \n     case of ex post facto judgment, and would therefore be \n     illegal under our own Constitution. The Chief Justice at the \n     time, Harlan Stone, called Nuremberg a ``high-grade lynching \n     party.''\n       A great many in our nation and around the world advocated a \n     different treatment for captured Nazi officials--one that had \n     long been practiced by nations victorious in war: summary \n     execution. Winston Churchill was said to have supported such \n     a policy.\n       Why, so the argument went, should we show any mercy to \n     these criminals--men who were responsible for the ruthless \n     slaughter of six million Jews, and five million other \n     innocent men, women, and children?\n       Men who razed to the ground entire villages and towns and \n     massacred those who lived in them.\n       Men who launched an aggressive war that eventually claimed \n     over 54 million lives, and turned the European continent into \n     a mass graveyard.\n       The argument was a compelling one. But a different one \n     would win the day. That case was the one advocated by men \n     like Justice Robert Jackson and a young lawyer named Thomas \n     Dodd. These two and others believed that the best way to \n     judge these crimes against humanity, and to deter future \n     crimes, would be a fair, legal trial.\n       They insisted on the rule of law, rather than the rule of \n     the mob.\n       And so in the summer of 1945, Justice Jackson assembled not \n     a team of executioners, but a team of legal professionals who \n     would meticulously use the Nazis' own documents, records, and \n     testimony to prove their guilt. My father was one of the men \n     he chose to be on that team.\n       During his fifteen months at Nuremberg, my father wrote \n     daily letters to my mother. These beautifully written letters \n     always began with the words ``Grace, my dearest one.'' They \n     fill up this volume I hold in my hand--and a second volume of \n     equal length.\n       I had no idea that these letters even existed until the \n     early 1990's. Before reading these letters I, arranged them \n     in chronological order. I finally completed this long process \n     in the summer of 1995.\n       Without any prior awareness, you can imagine my shock when \n     on the evening of July 28, 1995, I sat down to begin reading \n     the letters and realized that the first letter to my mother \n     was written on July 28, 1945--50 years earlier, to the day.\n       My father arrived in Europe on that day with mixed \n     feelings. He knew that he had an opportunity to be part of a \n     historic occasion. But he was reluctant to leave my mother \n     and their children. I was only a year old at the time--and a \n     very active child according to my mother. Sometimes I wonder \n     if I was the reason my father decided to go to Nuremberg.\n       Ultimately, the decision was made to see the job through. \n     As he explained it, ``Sometimes a man knows his duty, his \n     responsibility so clearly, so surely, he cannot hesitate--he \n     dare not refuse it. Even great pain and other sacrifices seem \n     unimportant in such a situation. The pain is no less for this \n     knowledge--but the pain has a purpose at least.''\n       He threw himself into a job he expected would last only a \n     few months. In July 1945,\n\n[[Page S2476]]\n\n     this 38-year-old attorney had no idea that he would be \n     promoted from staff counsel to trial counsel, then to senior \n     trial counsel, and then to Executive Trial Counsel--the \n     deputy prosecutor for the United States.\n       The Nuremberg trials themselves were an absolutely massive \n     undertaking, with so many questions that had to be answered:\n       Who would be the judges?\n       Who would be the lawyers?\n       Would the defendants be tried together or separately?\n       Would the trials be conducted under American or European \n     legal customs?\n       Would they be military or civilian trials?\n       And perhaps the most pressing practical question: Where \n     would the trials be held?\n       My father, like many, expressed reservations about holding \n     the trial in Nuremberg. The city, he said, was ``probably the \n     worst in Germany'' in terms of destruction. He suggested that \n     Heidelberg, which had survived the war essentially intact, \n     would have been a better alternative.\n       But for reasons of principle--if not practicality--he knew \n     that Nuremberg was the right choice. It was, after all, \n     Nuremberg where the Nazis met on September 10, 1935 to codify \n     into law their regime of oppression, terror, and hatred. And \n     so it was totally fitting that in Nuremberg, these Nazis were \n     brought to justice.\n       My father's ambivalent outlook towards his participation in \n     the trial changed dramatically on August 14th, 1945. On that \n     day, he and his fellow prosecutors began interrogating \n     prisoners. He described it as ``a day I shall never forget,'' \n     and the day that followed as ``the most fascinating day of my \n     life.''\n       From August through November 1945, my father spent much of \n     his time face to face with some of the most vital cogs in \n     Hitler's murderous Nazi machine. William Keitel. Hans Frank. \n     Rudolph Hess. Hermann Goering. One by one, each of them would \n     do his best to deflect blame and to deny. My father remarked \n     that ``It would be relieving to hear one of them admit some \n     blame for something. They blame everything on the dead or \n     missing.''\n       Throughout the course of the investigation and trial, my \n     father became one of Justice Jackson's closest associates--\n     and one of his closest friends, as well.\n       There's no question that my father viewed Justice Jackson \n     as much more than a professional colleague. ``I am proud of \n     my association with him,'' he wrote, ``and even more proud of \n     his friendship.''\n       My father admired Jackson greatly for his keen intellect, \n     his quiet dignity, and for his steadfast dedication to seeing \n     the trial through to the end. In a letter he wrote to Justice \n     Jackson's son on the occasion of the Justice's passing in \n     1954, my father called him ``one of a very few great men whom \n     I have been privileged to meet in my lifetime.''\n       I will not go into much detail discussing the proceedings \n     of the trial itself. Much of the trial was actually fairly \n     tedious. For the most part, anyone expecting tearful \n     admissions of guilt was sorely disappointed.\n       My father, for his part, presented several aspects of the \n     prosecution's case, including those on concentration camps, \n     on economic oppression, and on slave labor. He cross-examined \n     numerous witnesses, including six of the defendants. Four of \n     those defendants were ultimately sentenced to death. The \n     other two served lengthy terms in prison.\n       For my father, though, Nuremberg was about much more than \n     the defendants, the evidence, and the sentences. It was about \n     the opportunity, as he put it, ``to write a record that will \n     mark a new point in man's relation with man.''\n       My father returned from Nuremberg with a deep commitment to \n     the rule of law and its role in upholding the basic human \n     rights and human dignity of every man, woman, and child.\n       That commitment is the reason why--as a Congressman and a \n     Senator--he was such a staunch supporter of the civil rights \n     movement. It's the reason he was such an ardent opponent of \n     Communism. And it is the reason why he embraced bold new \n     efforts to eliminate poverty in our nation and throughout the \n     world.\n       My father also left Nuremberg as an ardent believer in the \n     need to create and use law to preserve and promote human \n     dignity.\n       Nuremberg was essentially a trial without precedent. As I \n     mentioned earlier, when Justice Jackson and others were \n     developing the guidelines for the Nuremberg trials, there was \n     a great deal of debate and disagreement over the legality of \n     the proceedings.\n       Justice Jackson spent a great deal of time arguing why, in \n     fact, there was legal precedent in international law for the \n     crime of waging aggressive war.\n       But beyond those legal arguments, there was another, far \n     more fundamental point--a point that Robert Jackson and my \n     father shared. That the crimes committed by the Nazis were so \n     heinous, so unthinkable, that they violated the basic rules \n     by which all of humanity must abide.\n       As Justice Jackson said in his opening statement, ``The \n     wrongs which we seek to condemn and punish have been so \n     calculated, so malignant and so devastating, that \n     civilization cannot tolerate their being ignored because it \n     cannot survive their being repeated.''\n       This idea of a natural law, rooted in basic standards and \n     norms of human behavior, was a powerful argument in favor of \n     the Nuremberg trials. Perhaps no document embodies the idea \n     that such basic standards exist more than our own Declaration \n     of Independence, which affirms that ``all men are created \n     equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain \n     inalienable rights, that among these rights are life, \n     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.''\n       Natural law was a concept for which my father was a \n     strenuous advocate. I can remember a story he told me about a \n     paper he wrote at Yale for a professor of his, Harold Lasky, \n     a renowned socialist. In the paper, my father argued \n     passionately in favor of natural law theory. When he got the \n     paper back, a note was written on the front page: ``I \n     disagree with everything you have written. A Plus.''\n       The Nuremberg trials' lasting legacy, my father believed, \n     would be in international institutions that could punish \n     crimes against humanity, and more importantly, deter those \n     crimes in the future.\n       As he put it, ``By a declaration of criminality against \n     these organizations, this tribunal will put on notice not \n     only the people of Germany, but the people of the whole \n     world. Mankind will know that no crime will go unpunished \n     because it was committed in the name of a political party or \n     a state; that no crime will be passed by because it is too \n     big; that no criminals will avoid punishment because there \n     are too many.''\n       Regrettably, my father's and Robert Jackson's vision has \n     not yet been fully realized.\n       Over the last six decades, we have not witnessed the level \n     of horrific destruction and carnage perpetrated by the Nazis. \n     But we have seen, time and again, terrible crimes against \n     humanity in places like Cambodia, Iraq, Bosnia, Rwanda, and \n     today in the Darfur province of the Sudan.\n       Tragically, many of the individuals involved in these \n     crimes--people like Joseph Stalin, Pol Pot, and Idi Amin--\n     were never brought to justice. In some of these cases, the \n     world did eventually create tribunals--but always, like \n     Nuremberg, temporary, ad hoc courts that were established \n     after the fact.\n       To truly be called effective, a court must not simply \n     punish the guilty, then disband. It must serve as a permanent \n     reminder to any potential criminals that they, too, will be \n     held accountable. Such a court can not only punish crimes--it \n     can deter them.\n       In my view, there is only one kind of institution that can \n     ensure the kind of accountability that can prevent future war \n     crimes--and that is a permanent court empowered to indict, \n     prosecute, and judge international criminals.\n       After many, many years of effort, the International \n     Criminal Court came into existence on July 1, 2002. \n     Unfortunately, rather than lend its support to this effort, \n     the United States has walked away from it.\n       I'm aware that there are complex issues that need to be \n     resolved regarding our nation and the International Criminal \n     Court. But I strongly believe that our nation's interests, \n     and the world's interests, would be far better served if we \n     worked to address those issues rather than abandoning the \n     entire process.\n       What, after all, does it say about a nation that prides \n     itself in upholding freedom, justice, and human rights when \n     it simply disengages itself from an institution whose goal is \n     to promote those values? And what does it say about an \n     institution's power to bring criminals to justice when the \n     most powerful nation in the world refuses to play a part?\n       The tragic events in Darfur today represent exactly the \n     kind of situation in which people like my father and Robert \n     Jackson envisioned international courts playing a prominent \n     role. It is my hope that the current administration will see \n     the Darfur genocide as an opportunity to participate in this \n     institution in some way, rather than simply standing on the \n     sidelines. Otherwise, the cry of ``never again'' will ring \n     tragically hollow.\n       There is another legacy of Nuremberg that is just as \n     powerful as its role in the development of international law. \n     As I mentioned earlier, the decision to hold a trial at \n     Nuremberg--rather than summary executions--was not an easy \n     choice.\n       We rejected the certainty of executions for the uncertainty \n     of a trial. We turned away from violence that was certainly \n     within our ability, and, many would argue, within our right.\n       But what we learned is that our nation became stronger, and \n     more respected, because we took the course that we did.\n       At the heart of that decision was the idea that this nation \n     will not tailor its eternal principles to the conflict of the \n     moment--and the recognition that if we did, we would be \n     walking in the very footsteps of the enemies we despised.\n       This is a principle I believe we would all do well to \n     remember today.\n       This past year, we all were horrified at the images and \n     stories of abuse of prisoners held in places like Abu Ghraib \n     in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n       The abuse itself was shocking. In my view, though, even \n     more troubling are the comments on this issue that we've \n     heard from some who occupy positions of great power in our \n     government.\n       Legal justifications for the use of torture by American \n     troops;\n       For turning over individuals to other nations known to \n     torture detainees;\n       And, perhaps most egregiously, legal justifications that \n     would explicitly exempt any executive branch official from \n     prosecution for torture ``if they are carrying out the \n     President's Commander-in-Chief powers.''\n       Sixty years ago at Nuremberg, the United States and our \n     allies considered the defense\n\n[[Page S2477]]\n\n     ``I was just following orders'' to be so cowardly that it was \n     prohibited under the rules of the trial.\n       Perversely, there are some who consider that defense \n     acceptable for Americans today.\n       The proponents of these rationalizations tell us that we \n     are living in different times.\n       That we are facing enemies who show blatant disregard for \n     human life, and whose organizations transcend international \n     borders.\n       As a result, the argument goes, we must re-evaluate certain \n     conventions and practices that we have long respected.\n       I wonder how men like Robert Jackson and my father would \n     respond to these arguments. Would they be swayed by them? \n     Would they be persuaded somehow that the followers of Osama \n     bin Laden and Saddam Hussein are fundamentally different from \n     the despicable and depraved defendants who swore allegiance \n     to Adolf Hitler?\n       Would these men, who prosecuted the Nazis based on \n     testimony and documentary evidence, be heartened by the \n     argument that the best responses we can muster against evil \n     today are attack dogs and water-boarding?\n       I truly, truly think not. On the contrary, I believe that \n     Robert Jackson and my father would be tremendously \n     disappointed and saddened at some of the actions taken by \n     Americans on behalf of our nation--and by some of the \n     official legal arguments made in support of those actions.\n       I believe that Robert Jackson and Thomas Dodd would see \n     these actions as a reflection of a government that has turned \n     away from the lessons of history and stepped back from the \n     very values of due process and equal justice that we expect \n     of others worldwide.\n       Is the threat of international terrorism a dangerous one? \n     Unquestionably. But we cannot allow that danger to compromise \n     bedrock principles which have stood since the birth of our \n     nation--values like the right to be free from torture or from \n     indefinite detention without a charge.\n       We enshrined these values in our Constitution not simply \n     because we believe Americans are entitled to them. We did so \n     because they affirm a basic sense of human dignity in each \n     and every man and woman. And because we, as a nation, are \n     committed to upholding that dignity--even if others do not.\n       If we cavalierly toss aside those values in response to a \n     particular enemy or threat, it is not our enemies, but we who \n     will pay the ultimate price.\n       As Justice Jackson said at Nuremberg, ``we must never \n     forget that the record on which we judge these defendants \n     today is the record on which history will judge us tomorrow. \n     To pass these defendants a poisoned chalice is to put it to \n     our own lips as well. ``\n       A century and a half ago, in his second State of the Union \n     address, Abraham Lincoln said that in giving or denying \n     freedom to slaves, ``We shall nobly save or meanly lose the \n     last, best hope of earth.''\n       The issue then was how our nation treats the enslaved. \n     Sixty years ago, the question was how to treat Nazi war \n     criminals. Today, we face the same choice with regard to the \n     way we treat international terrorists.\n       If we heed the example set at Nuremberg by people like \n     Robert Jackson and Thomas Dodd, if we treat our enemies \n     according to our standards--not theirs--we feed the flame of \n     liberty and justice that has rightly led our nation on its \n     journey for these past two and a quarter centuries.\n       And we set a shining and lasting example for a true global \n     community--one grounded in the principles of justice, \n     freedom, and peace.\n       And we live up to the great memory of Robert Jackson and of \n     a young counsel named Thomas Dodd.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/10/senate-section/article/S2477-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   tribute to specialist seth garceau\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  Last week, a man pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter for \nkilling a 15-year-old girl at a bus stop. Sakia Gunn, the victim, and \nfour other girls were standing outside a bus stop when the assailant \napproached the girls with an invitation to a party. The girls responded \nthat they were lesbians and were not interested in going. The assailant \nbegan making homophobic insults at the girls and stabbed Sakia Gunn.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/10/senate-section/article/S2478-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2478-S2479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE ABUSE OF FOREIGN DETAINEES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, with this new session of Congress and the \nPresident's new term we are presented with new opportunities for \nchange. Congress and the President have embraced these opportunities on \nmany issues--new cabinet officials have been confirmed and a renewed \neffort is underway by the administration to repair strained \ninternational relationships. Unfortunately, on one important front \nthere has been no change: The administration continues to stonewall on \nthe prisoner abuse scandal and Congress continues to abdicate its \noversight responsibility on this issue.\n  Ignoring this problem will not make it go away. Even without a \ncomprehensive, independent investigation into the abuse of detainees, \nwe continue to learn more about this scandal from press reports and the \ncourt-ordered release of Government documents in response to Freedom of \nInformation Act (FOIA) litigation.\n  The latest set of documents made public through the FOIA case reveal \nnot only more incidents of abuse, but also indicate that soldiers in \nAfghanistan destroyed evidence of detainee mistreatment. One file \ndocuments the Army's investigation into the discovery of a compact disk \nduring an office clean-up in Afghanistan in July 2004. The disk \ncontained photos of U.S. soldiers pointing their handguns and rifles at \nthe heads of bound and hooded detainees. Many of the soldiers \nquestioned about these photos said they were ``joking around'' and that \nthey wanted to have some good pictures to show their friends back home. \nIf the roles were reversed and it was American POWs being used as photo \nprops with weapons pointed at their heads, we would be rightly outraged \nby this conduct.\n  While the photos on this disk are disturbing in their own right, the \ncircumstances surrounding this investigation are even more troubling. \nUnlike the photos from Abu Ghraib, these photos were not investigated \nbecause of an American soldier, in an act of conscious, gave the photos \nto a superior officer. These new photos were discovered by accident. \nThe subsequent investigation into the photos revealed that soldiers in \nthe unit were told by their superiors to delete similar photos of abuse \nto prevent their disclosure.\n  New details have also emerged about one of the infamous Abu Ghraib \nphotos. Many will remember the photo of Manadel al-Jimadi's corpse \npacked in ice with Specialist Charles Graner posing over the body and \ngiving the ``thumbs-up'' sign. We have known for months that this was a \nhomicide, but a recent news report provides additional details about \nal-Jimadi's death. Al-Jimadi, one of the CIA's ghost detainees at Abu \nGhraib, was secretly held at the prison. The International Committee of \nthe Red Cross was denied access to him in violation of the Geneva \nConventions. Now, press reports indicate that he died in a position \nknown as ``Palestinian hanging.'' This barbaric practice entails \ncuffing the detainee's hands behind his back and suspending him from \nthe wrists.\n  President Bush condemned Saddam Hussein for similar practices; the \nPresident should be as outraged when these acts are committed by \nAmerican personnel.\n  Meanwhile, the media continues to reveal details about the \nadministration's use of extraordinary rendition to transfer terrorism \nsuspects in U.S. custody to the custody of countries where they are \nlikely to be tortured. A recent article in The New Yorker, titled \n``Outsourcing Torture,'' provides disturbing details about how the \nadministration embraced the use of renditions after the attacks on \nSeptember 11. The article cites three instances where the U.S. \ntransferred suspected militants from Afghanistan to Uzbekistan. \nAlthough the fate of these men is not known, Uzbekistan is known to use \ninterrogation methods such as partially boiling a detainee's hand or \narm.\n  The State Department recently released its annual human rights \nreport. The report criticized several countries for employing \ninterrogation techniques that the State Department considered to be \ntorture, yet are similar to techniques approved in 2002 by Secretary \nRumsfeld. How can we criticize these countries for using techniques \nthat our own Defense Secretary approved? How can our State Department \ndenounce countries for engaging in torture while the CIA secretly \ntransfers detainees to the very same countries? President Bush said \nthat U.S. personnel do not engage in torture, but transferring \ndetainees to other countries where they will be tortured does not \nabsolve our government of responsibility. By outsourcing torture to \nthese countries, we diminish our own values as a nation and lose our \ncredibility as an advocate of human rights around the world.\n  Even without further government action, this scandal is not going to \ngo away. It is time for us to lead the investigation, rather than wait \nto read about the latest discovery of abuse in the newspaper. As I have \nsaid before, there needs to be a thorough, independent investigation of \nthe actions of those involved, from the people who committed abuses to \nthe officials who set these policies in motion. The investigations \ncompleted thus far provide additional insight into how the prison \nabuses occurred, but their narrow mandates prevented them from \naddressing critical issues.\n  For example, an executive summary of the long-expected report on \ninterrogation policy by Admiral Albert T. Church was released today. \nThe full report, which is classified, reportedly criticizes the \nPentagon for a failure of oversight, yet finds no direct evidence that \nhigh level officials ordered the mistreatment of detainees. The \nexecutive summary contains only a brief reference to the role of \ncontractors in interrogations, and affirms that numerous contracts have \nbeen awarded in an ad hoc fashion and without central coordination. The \nrole of contractors is an area sorely in need of a comprehensive \ninvestigation.\n  Similarly, the unclassified summary leaves many questions unanswered \nabout Department of Defense (DOD) interaction with the CIA. It confirms \nthat approximately 30 detainees were kept ``off the books'' in Iraq. \nThe summary admits that DOD assisted the intelligence agencies with \ndetainee transfers and supported interrogations by ``other government \nagencies''--which is government-speak for the CIA--at DOD facilities. \nWhat is missing from the Church report, however, is\n\n[[Page S2479]]\n\na full exploration of the role of the CIA in detention, rendition, and \ninterrogation. The Agency apparently cooperated with the Church \ninvestigation, but provided information on activities only in Iraq, and \nnot on any of the other nations or facilities where the CIA is holding \nand interrogating detainees.\n\n  A very important piece of information came out of today's hearing on \nthe Church report, however. In his testimony before the Armed Services \nCommittee, Admiral Church was asked by Senator Kennedy about \nunclassified paragraphs of the full report that discuss early meetings \nof the DOD working group on interrogations. That working group produced \na memo that tracked very closely the infamous August 2002 Justice \nDepartment torture memo. The Justice memo claimed that for an action to \nrise to the level of torture it must result in pain equivalent to the \ntype associated with organ failure or even death.\n  Apparently, the working group was briefed by Justice Department \nlawyers who presented the Justice memo's legal analysis as controlling. \nAccording to Senator Kennedy's exchange with Admiral Church, members of \nthe working group protested. They believed that interrogation policy \nshould follow the Geneva Conventions. Admiral Church confirmed that the \nworking group was overruled by the Pentagon's Office of General \nCounsel, which insisted on using the torture memo as the legal \nfoundation for interrogation techniques. Specifically, Admiral Church \nadmitted, the working group was overruled by William J. Haynes, General \nCounsel of the Department of Defense, whom the President has nominated \nto a lifetime appointment as a Federal Circuit Court judge. And still, \ngiven all of this information, the Pentagon claims that abuses did not \nstem from policies generated from the highest levels of this \nadministration.\n  Only a truly independent entity can comprehensively investigate the \npolicy decisions that were made at the top and the abuses that followed \nin the field. There will always be scandals and tragedies in a nation's \nhistory. What makes America unique is that we do not hide from these \nissues; we investigate them, learn from our mistakes, and make sure \nthey do not happen again. I have no doubt that an independent \ninvestigation into the abuse of detainees will be painful, but it is \nalso a necessary step to moving forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/10/senate-section/article/S2479-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  44TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PEACE CORPS\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, as the Peace Corps celebrates its 44th \nanniversary this month, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommend its many wonderful volunteers, past and present, and the \nremarkable work they do. I am very pleased to report that three \nuniversities in Illinois--the University of Illinois at Champaign-\nUrbana, Northwestern University, and the University of Chicago--are \nthree of the top Peace Corps-volunteer producing colleges and \nuniversities in the country. There are currently 295 volunteers from \nIllinois working in countries around the world, and I am tremendously \nproud of the service provided by each and every one of them.\n  The work of the Peace Corps in promoting mutual understanding between \nour country and the rest of the world has never been more relevant than \nit is today. The Peace Corps began in 1961 under President John F. \nKennedy as a unique experiment in humanitarian service and cultural \nexchange and has grown to become one of the most widely respected \nAmerican institutions in the world. Since the founding of the Peace \nCorps, over 178,000 volunteers have served in 138 countries.\n  Peace Corps volunteers share their knowledge, skills, and enthusiasm \nby serving as health educators, youth and agricultural workers, \nteachers, and business advisors. Of the 7,700 volunteers currently \nserving, over 3,100 are working on HIV/AIDS education and prevention \nprojects, and I commend them on their critically important work on this \nglobal crisis.\n  I also would like to honor past volunteers who have helped to build \nthis wonderful program into what it is today, who have empowered and \ngiven voice to individuals and communities in developing countries \naround the world. Individually and collectively, Peace Corps volunteers \nrepresent the very best of our great country, and I am proud to salute \nthem on their 44th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/10/senate-section/article/S2479-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2479-S2480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON DEATHS OF WOMEN IN THE STATE OF CHIHUAHUA, \n                                 MEXICO\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of a \nconcurrent resolution I submitted yesterday which conveys the deepest \nsympathy of the Senate to the families of the young women who have been \ntragically murdered in Ciudad Juarez and throughout the state of \nChihuahua, and urges the Governments of Mexico and the United States to \nwork together to address this issue. This is an issue that has not only \naffected the people of Mexico but has long troubled the border \ncommunities across the entire Southwest region.\n  Last Congress, I submitted a similar version of this resolution in \nconjunction with Representative Hilda Solis in the House of \nRepresentatives, and I am pleased that Senators Cornyn, Corzine, \nDurbin, Ensign, Feingold, Feinstein, Landrieu, Leahy, Levin, Mikulski, \nand Murray, have joined me in resubmitting this resolution.\n  This last Tuesday was International Womens' Day, and I believe that \nas we mark the achievements women have made, we must also recognize the \nchallenges that remain. Stopping violence against women is one such \nchallenge that we face. It is far too prevalent in our country and \naround the world, and we must do all we can to bring it to an end.\n  Since 1993, bodies of young women began appearing in the deserts \noutside the city of Juarez, Mexico, marking the beginning of a \nhorrendous epidemic that has plagued the United States-Mexico border \nregion for more than 10 years. Since then, more than 370 women have \nbeen killed. Many of the young women were abducted in broad daylight in \nwell-populated areas, held captive for several days, and subjected to \nphysical violence, humiliation, and sexual torture before having their \nmutilated bodies discovered days, or sometimes years, later in deserted \nareas. Since 2004, at least 30 women have been killed in the city of \nJuarez in Chihuahua.\n  On May 28, 2004, 14-year-old Luisa Rocio Chavez was found murdered in \nthe state of Chihuahua after disappearing the previous morning on her \nway home from the store. She had been raped and strangled to death, and \nher body was found partially clothed. And before that, on April 26, \n2004, a 33-year-old factory worker, Teresa Torbellin, was found after \nbeing beaten to death and dragged through bushes and desert, eventually \nbeing dumped in a deserted area outside the city. Like these deaths, \nnearly all of the cases remain unsolved. In fact, many of the bodies of \nvictims have yet to be positively identified. One can only imagine how \nmuch pain and suffering this has caused the families and friends of \nthese young women. I want to make sure these deaths are never \nforgotten, and that the Governments on both sides of the border \ncontinue to give this issue the attention it so rightly deserves.\n  Human rights groups have reported that in many cases bodies have been \nmisidentified, evidence contaminated or lost, key witnesses not \nproperly interviewed, and autopsies inadequately performed. And there \nhave been serious allegations of instances of individuals being \ntortured into confessing to these horrible crimes. In one such case, an \nAmerican citizen, Cynthia Kiecker, and her husband Ulises Perzabal were \naccused of killing a young woman and reportedly tortured into \nconfessing. I am pleased that they have since been released.\n  President Vicente Fox has taken steps to address this issue by \nsetting up the Commission to Prevent and Eradicate Violence Against \nWomen, which is responsible for coordinating federal and state efforts \nin preventing violence of women in Ciudad Juarez and Chihuahua, and \nappointing a special prosecutor for punishing those responsible for the \nmurders in Ciuad Juarez. The federal prosecutor, Maria Lopez Urbina, \nhas reviewed over 200 cases and cited 130 Chihuahua public servants for \nnegligence and malfeasance. I am encouraged that the new governor of \nChihuahua, Jose Reyes Baeza Terrazass, has indicated a willingness to \ntake steps to resole these murders.\n\n[[Page S2480]]\n\n  I also want to recognize the efforts of Commissioner Guadalupe Morfin \nOtero, who has done some good work in investigating the issues \nsurrounding these deaths. The Mexican Federal Government has also \nestablished a DNA database to help better identify the victims. While \nobtaining independent verification of victims' remains an outstanding \nissue, the creation of this database is a positive step in the right \ndirection.\n  Although I am pleased that President Fox has taken the initiative on \nthese fronts, I continue to believe that there needs to be a more \ncoordinated effort on the part of the Mexican and U.S. Governments. \nThat is why I have submitted this vitally important resolution. I stand \nready to assist in any way I can, and I believe that the U.S. \nGovernment should be prepared to do so as well. The U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development has begun providing assistance to the state \nof Chihuahua for judicial reform, and I hope that the Mexican and U.S. \nGovernments can work together on other initiatives as well. This \nresolution isn't meant to be a condemnation of Mexico. It is meant to \nexpress that the U.S. Congress stands with the victims of this violence \nand is willing to take constructive steps to assist in preventing these \nmurders in the future.\n  Specicially, this resolution would condemn the abductions and murders \nof young women in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico, express the sincerest \ncondolences and deepest sympathy of the Senate to the families of the \nyoung women, and urge a continued multilateral effort on the part of \nthe Governments of Mexico and the United States to address this issue.\n  To this end, it would urge the Governments of Mexico and the United \nStates to support steps that would allow families to positively \nidentify the remains of the victims, and encourage the Secretary of \nStates to continue to facilitate U.S. participation in such efforts.\n  It would also encourage the Secretary of State to urge the Mexican \nGovernment to ensure fair and proper judicial proceedings for the \nindividuals accused of these abductions and murders, and to impose \nappropriate punishment for those individuals found guilty of such \ncrimes. Additionally, it would condemn threats against human rights \nactivists and the use of torture as a means of investigation.\n  Lastly, this resolution would condemn all senseless acts of violence \nagainst women across the world and express the solidarity of the people \nof the United States with the people of Mexico in the face of these \ntragic and senseless acts.\n  This problem can't be ignored. We have the chance to help end the \nsuffering of these innocent families, and I hope the Senate will join \nme in supporting this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/10/senate-section/article/S2480-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE TIBETAN DAY OF COMMEMORATION\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, Today I rise to commemorate the 46th \nAnniversary of the Tibetan Uprising of 1959.\n  It is my sincere hope that both the Chinese government and the \nTibetan leaders might use this opportunity to reflect on the importance \nof pursuing a viable, long-term solution that provides the Tibetan \npeople the right to enjoy religious, cultural, and social autonomy as \npart of the People's Republic of China.\n  This anniversary marks a sad, but important day in the history of the \nTibetan people.\n  In 1951, two years after the People's Liberation Army first entered \nTibet, Chinese government representatives and Tibetan leaders signed \nwhat has been called the 17 Point Agreement.\n  This agreement, among other things, included the promise of Tibetan \nreligious, cultural, and social autonomy, and preserved the institution \nof the Dalai Lama.\n  Sadly, the Chinese government failed to uphold these promises and \nattempted to force ``revolutionary socialist reforms'' upon the Tibet \npeople and leadership. This ultimately culminated in the 1959 Lhasa \nUprising which saw tens of thousands of Tibetans killed and forced the \nDalai Lama and many others to flee to India.\n  Today human rights abuses continue against Tibetans wishing to \npractice their religion or promote their unique cultural and historical \nidentity. Hundreds have been imprisoned in Tibet, and tens of thousands \nmore have had to flee their homeland.\n  Nevertheless, the Dalai Lama remains steadfast in his desire to find \na long-lasting and viable solution that will provide freedom and \nautonomy for the Tibetan people without pursuing independence.\n  In a speech today to mark this 46th anniversary, he stated:\n\n       We remain fully committed to the Middle Way Approach of not \n     seeking independence for Tibet and are willing to remain \n     within the People's Republic of China.\n\n  He also praised the economic progress and development that has taken \nplace in Tibet over the past 40 years, including the new railroad link \nthat will begin operation this year.\n  I have personally worked for well over two decades to try and bring \nboth the Chinese government and Tibetan leadership together in a spirit \nof cooperation and dialogue to overcome the differences that have \nimpeded progress on a solution for Tibet. And after many conversations \nwith the Dalai Lama, I am fully convinced that he is sincere in his \npromise not to pursue a separate path for Tibet.\n  To that end, several times over the years I have carried messages \nfrom the Dalai Lama to Beijing and communicated regularly with Jiang \nZemin and other Chinese officials on the importance of establishing \ndialogue on the Tibet issue.\n  I have also been pleased to see that discussions between the Dalai \nLama's envoys and Chinese officials have resumed and that a third round \nof meetings took place last September in Beijing.\n  It is my hope that both sides will build upon these meetings and that \nPresident Hu, with his knowledge and understanding of the Tibetan \npeople, will come to appreciate the international goodwill that would \nbe fostered by his willingness to meet with the Dalai Lama and pursue a \nreasonable solution to the Tibet issue.\n  Despite the slow pace of progress over the years, I remain confident \nthat if the Chinese leadership will only sit down with the Dalai Lama \nand listen openly to his views, that a sustainable solution providing \nfor the preservation of the distinctive identity, religious and \ncultural heritage for the Tibetan people can be found.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/10/senate-section/article/S2480-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2480-S2481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    AMERICAN CULINARY FEDERATION'S SOUTHEASTERN REGIONAL CONFERENCE\n\n Mr. ALLEN.

Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \ncongratulate the First Baptist Church of Kansas City, MO, on its 150th \nanniversary.\n  The First Baptist Church has had a long and proud history, coinciding \nwith the history of Kansas City. The church was organized on April 21, \n1855, by a group of 10 men and women in the small settlement along the \nMissouri River incorporated as the City of Kansas. The first pastor was \nthe Reverend R.S. Thomas. In 1859 the congregation completed its first \nbuilding at Eighth and May Streets in downtown Kansas City.\n  In 1880, a new church building was completed on the southwest corner \nof Twelfth and Baltimore, later the side of the Hotel Muehlebach. The \ngrowth of the congregation and the city dictated relocation of the \nchurch in the early 1900s. A new site was chosen at Linwood Boulevard \nand Park Avenue while a West Side Branch of the church was established \nat Thirteenth and Broadway to serve the needs of downtown residents. \nBoth buildings were dedicated in 1909. From 1909 and 1942, First \nBaptist Church ministered in two very different locations. After our \ncountry's entry in World War II, changing conditions and needs brought \nthe decision to end the West Side ministry. The property was sold to \nthe Salvation Army.\n  In 1960, the congregation voted to establish a branch church in the \nsouthern part of Kansas City. The new colonial-style church building \nwas completed in 1963 at the northwest corner of Wornall Road and Red \nBridge Road. There have since been two additions to the original \nstructure. The First Baptist Church of Kansas City was once again \nministering at two locations within the city. In 1982, the Linwood \nBoulevard building was sold to the Metropolitan Missionary Baptist \nChurch. Since that time, the church's single location has been at Red \nBridge and Wornall.\n  Throughout its 150 years, First Baptist Church of Kansas City, MO, \nhas striven to maintain its concern for and involvement in the entire \nKansas City community. Its pastors and members have often assumed \nleadership positions in civic affairs, especially during a time when \nKansas City was fighting to end political corruption within the local \ngovernment and later when Kansas City worked to bring an end to \ndiscrimination in public facilities and housing.\n  The First Baptist Church of Kansas City has strongly supported the \nhome mission and foreign mission programs of their denomination.

Consistent with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice stating that the Iran emergency declared on March 15, \n1995, is to continue in effect beyond March 15, 2005, to the Federal \nRegister for publication. The most recent notice continuing this \nemergency was published in the Federal Register on March 12, 2004 (69 \nFR 12051).\n  The crisis between the United States and Iran constituted by the \nactions and policies of the Government of Iran, including its support \nfor international terrorism, efforts to undermine Middle East peace, \nand acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver \nthem, that led to the declaration of a national emergency on March 15, \n1995, has not been resolved. These actions and policies are contrary to \nthe interests of the United States in the region and pose a continuing \nunusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign \npolicy, and economy of the United States. For these reasons, I have \ndetermined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency \ndeclared with respect to Iran and maintain in force comprehensive \nsanctions against Iran to respond to this threat.\n                                                      George W. Bush.  \n                                       The White House, March 10, 2005.\n\n  Notice--Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Iran\n\n  On March 15, 1995, by Executive Order 12957, the President declared a \nnational emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to the International \nEmergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the \nunusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign \npolicy, and economy of the United States constituted by the actions and \npolicies of the Government of Iran, including its support for \ninternational terrorism, efforts to undermine the Middle East peace \nprocess, and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the means \nto deliver them. On May 6, 1995, the President issued Executive Order \n12959 imposing more comprehensive sanctions to further respond to this \nthreat, and on August 19, 1997, the President issued Executive Order \n13059 consolidating and clarifying the previous orders.\n  Because the actions and policies of the Government of Iran continue \nto pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, \nforeign policy, and economy of the United States, the national \nemergency declared on March 15, 1995, must continue in effect beyond \nMarch 15, 2005. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the \nNational Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 \nyear the national emergency with respect to Iran. Because the emergency \ndeclared by Executive Order 12957 constitutes an emergency separate \nfrom that declared on November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, this \nrenewal is distinct from the emergency renewal of November 2004. This \nnotice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to \nthe Congress.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to direct the \nSecretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to jointly \nconduct a study on the feasibility of designating the Arizona Trail as \na national scenic trail or a national historic trail; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senator \nKyl in introducing the Arizona Trail Feasibility Study Act. This bill \nwould authorize the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior to conduct \na joint study to determine the feasibility of designating the Arizona \nTrail as a National Scenic or National Historic Trail. A companion bill \nis being introduced today in the House of Representatives by \nRepresentative Kolbe and rest of the Arizona delegation.\n  Since 1968, when the National Trails System Act was established, \nCongress has designated 20 national trails. This legislation is the \nfirst step in the process of national trail designation for the Arizona \nTrail. If the study concludes that designating the Arizona Trail as a \npart of the national trail system if feasible, subsequent legislation \ncan be introduced to designate the Arizona Trail as either a National \nScenic Trail or National Historic Trail.\n  The Arizona Trail is a beautifully diverse stretch of public lands, \nmountains, canyons, deserts, forests, historic sites, and communities. \nThe Trail begins at the Coronado National Memorial on the U.S.-Mexico \nborder and ends in the Bureau of Land Management's Arizona Strip \nDistrict on the Utah border. In between these two points, the Trail \nwinds through some of the most rugged, spectacular scenery in the \nWestern United States.\n  For the past 10 years, over 16 Federal, State, and local agencies, as \nwell as community and business organizations, have worked to form a \npartnership to create, develop, and manage the Arizona Trail. \nDesignating the Arizona Trail as a national trail would help streamline \nthe management of the Trail to ensure that this pristine stretch of \ndiverse land is preserved for future generations to enjoy.\n  The corridor for the Arizona Trail encompasses the wide range of \necological diversity in the State, and incorporates a host of existing \ntrails into one continuous trail. The Arizona Trail extends through \nseven ecological life zones including such legendary landmarks as the \nSonoran Desert and the Grand Canyon. It connects the unique lowland \ndesert flora and fauna in Saguaro National Park and the pine-covered \nSan Francisco Peaks, Arizona's highest mountains at 12,633 feet in \nelevation. In fact, the Trail route is so topographically diverse that \na person can hike from the Sonoran Desert to Alpine forests in one day. \nThe Trail also takes travelers through ranching, mining, agricultural, \nand developed urban areas, as well as remote and pristine wildlands.\n  With over 700 miles of the 800-mile trail already completed, the \nArizona\n\n[[Page S2485]]\n\nTrail is a boon to recreationists. The Arizona State Parks recently \nreleased data showing that two-thirds of Arizonans consider themselves \ntrail users. Millions of visitors also use Arizona's trails each year. \nIn one of the fastest-growing states in the U.S., the designation of \nthe Arizona Trail as a National Scenic or National Historic Trail would \nensure the preservation of a corridor of open space for hikers, \nmountain bicyclists, cross-country skiers, snowshoers, eco-tourists, \nequestrians, and joggers.\n  I commend the Arizona Trail Association for taking the lead in \nbuilding a coalition of partners to bring the Arizona Trail from its \ninception to a nearly completed, multiple-use, non-motorized, long-\ndistance trail. Trail enthusiasts look forward to the completion of the \nArizona Trail. Its designation as a national trail would help to \nprotect the natural, cultural, and historic resources it contains for \nthe public to use and enjoy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with Senator \nMcCain in introducing the Arizona Trail Feasibility Study Act. This \nbill would authorize the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to \nconduct a joint study to determine the feasibility and desirability of \ndesignating the Arizona Trail as a National Scenic or Historic Trail. A \ncompanion bill is being introduced today in the House of \nRepresentatives by Representative Kolbe on behalf of the entire Arizona \ndelegation.\n  In 1968, Congress established the National Trails System to promote \nthe preservation of historical resources and outdoor areas. National \nscenic and national historic trails may be designated only by an act of \nCongress. The first step toward national trail designation is the \nfeasibility study process, which this legislation authorizes. When a \nstudy recommends a trail for designation, subsequent legislation will \nbe introduced to bring it into the National Trails System.\n  The Arizona Trail is highly deserving of consideration for national \ndesignation. The trail is a roller coaster ride through the wide range \nof ecological diversity in the State. The Trail corridor begins at the \nCoronado National Memorial on the U.S. Mexico Border, and winds some \n800 miles, ending on the Bureau of Land Management's Arizona Strip \nDistrict on the Utah Border. As it connects these two points, it \ninvites recreationists to explore the State's most renowned mountains, \ncanyons, deserts and forests, including the Grand Canyon and the Sonora \nDesert. This trail is unique in that it was developed to maximize the \nincorporation of already existing public trails into one continuous \ntrail, to showcase some of the most spectacular scenery in the West.\n  The trail is a partnership of over 16 Federal, State and local \nagencies, as well as numerous community and business organizations and \ncountless volunteers, to develop and sustain it as a recreational \nresource for future generations. Authorizing this study and ultimately \ndesignating the Arizona Trail as a national trail will help streamline \nits management, boost tourism and recreation, and preserve a \nmagnificent natural, cultural, and historical experience of the \nAmerican West.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 589. A bill to establish the Commission on Freedom of Information \nAct Processing Delays; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on February 16, shortly before the \nPresident's Day recess in February, the Senator from Vermont and I \nintroduced the OPEN Government Act of 2005--bipartisan legislation to \npromote accountability, accessibility, and openness in government, \nprincipally by strengthening and enhancing the Federal law commonly \nknown as the Freedom of Information Act.\n  When I served as Attorney General of Texas, it was my responsibility \nto enforce Texas's open government laws. I am pleased to report that \nTexas is known for having one of the strongest set of open government \nlaws in our Nation. And ever since that experience, I have long \nbelieved that our federal government could use ``a little Texas \nsunshine.'' I am thus especially enthusiastic about the OPEN Government \nAct, because that legislation attempts to incorporate some of the most \nimportant principles and elements of Texas law into the federal Freedom \nof Information Act.\n  Today, I am pleased to join the Senator from Vermont again, to \ncommence another bipartisan effort to reinforce our national commitment \nto freedom of information and openness in government. Indeed, this is \nan especially appropriate time to promote this important cause, because \nstarting this Sunday, America will observe the first-ever national \nSunshine Week--a celebration of our nation's founding principles and \ncommitment to freedom of information and openness in government. It is \nalso long past due. It has been nearly a decade since Congress has \napproved major reforms to the Freedom of Information Act. Moreover, a \nSenate Judiciary subcommittee hearing that the Senator from Vermont and \nI will lead next Tuesday morning to examine our open government laws \nwill be the first such hearing since 1992.\n  The Faster FOIA Act of 2005 would establish an advisory Commission on \nFreedom of Information Act Processing Delays. The Commission would be \ncharged with reporting to Congress and the President its \nrecommendations for steps that should be taken to reduce delays in the \nadministration of the Freedom of Information Act.\n  The Commission would be comprised of 16 members. Twelve of them would \nbe appointed by members of Congress--three by the chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, three by the chairman of the House \nGovernment Reform Committee, and three each by the ranking minority \nmember of the two committees. These four members of Congress would each \nbe required to appoint at least one member to the Commission with \nexperience submitting FOIA requests on behalf of nonprofit research or \neducational organizations or news media organizations, and at least one \nmember with experience in academic research in the fields of library \nscience, information management, or public access to Government \ninformation. The remaining four positions on the Commission would be \nheld by designees of the Attorney General, the Director of the Office \nof Management and Budget, the Archivist of the United States, and the \nComptroller General.\n\n  The Commission would be responsible for producing a study to identify \nmethods to reduce delays in the processing of FOIA requests and to \nensure the efficient and equitable administration of FOIA throughout \nthe Federal Government. The Commission would also be charged with \nexamining whether the system for charging fees and granting fee waivers \nunder FOIA should be reformed in order to reduce delays in processing \nfee requests. The report would be due no later than one year after the \ndate of enactment of this Act, and would include recommendations for \nlegislative and administrative action to enhance FOIA performance. The \nCommission would expire thirty days after the submission of the report.\n  The Faster FOIA Act is important legislation to strengthen openness \nin our Federal Government, and I am pleased to join with the Senator \nfrom Vermont once again in furtherance of this cause.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 589\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nTexas, Senator John Cornyn, in introducing what is our second \ncooperative action in this Congress to improve the implementation of \nthe Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA. This bill, called the ``Faster \nFOIA Act of 2005,'' responds to commonly voiced concerns of FOIA \nrequestors over agency delay in processing requests.\n  I want to express my appreciation to all of the FOIA officers and \nother Federal employees who work hard to process FOIA requests quickly \nand efficiently. I know that many simple requests are filled within a \nfew days, and I understand that complex requests dealing with national \nsecurity issues can take time for declassification, redaction, or \nrelease, as appropriate.\n  There are, nonetheless, significant delays at many agencies. In 2003, \na non-governmental organization, the National Security Archive, looked \ninto just how long some FOIA requests are left unfulfilled. The group \nfound that the oldest requests dated back to the late 1980s, before the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union. The oldest of these was a request to the \nFBI for information on the Bureau's activities at the University of \nCalifornia. First filed in November 1987, this request was partially \nfulfilled in 1996 after extensive litigation. According to the National \nSecurity Archive, the documents that were released revealed ``unlawful \nFBI intelligence activities and the efforts to cover up such conduct.'' \nAfter a 2002 article in the San Francisco Chronicle, and inquiries from \nSenator Feinstein, the Bureau acknowledged that there were at least \n17,000 pages of records that still had not been produced. Since then, \nsome data has been released, but the requestor recently told me that he \nbelieves more than 15,000 pages remain outstanding.\n  This is an extreme case, but delays are commonplace. Sometimes \nslowdowns are caused by poorly managed or decentralized data systems \nthat result in an agency not knowing what documents are located where. \nOther times, components within a single agency do not effectively \ncommunicate with one another, so that no one can say whether a request \nhas been filled or not. Finally, we have heard anecdotal evidence of \ncertain agencies engaging in protracted disputes over fee waivers \nsought by FOIA requestors. I have worked closely with the Government \nAccountability Office over the past few years to obtain detailed \nanalysis of how fees are collected and how fee waiver requests are \nprocessed. The analysts at GAO have looked long and hard at these \nissues. I am grateful for their efforts and look forward to the results \nof their study later this year.\n  One of the problems faced by GAO, and anyone else who has looked into \nagency delay, is the lack of comprehensive reporting data. We address \nthis problem in our companion bill, S.94, the Open Government Act, by \ncalling for more detailed reporting from agencies on FOIA processing.\n  These issues deserve a closer look in the short term, however. In \nthis bill, we propose to establish a commission to review agency delay \nand to make recommendations for reducing impediments to the efficient \nprocessing of requests. The Commission would also examine whether the \nsystem for charging fees and granting waivers should be modified.\n  The Commission would be made up of government and non-governmental \nrepresentatives with a broad range of experience in both submitting and \nhandling FOIA requests, in information science, and in the development \nof government information policy.\n  I understand that many requests are complex and that the resources \ndevoted to agency FOIA processing are often lacking. Our companion \nbill, S. 394, the Open Government Act, addresses this issue by \nestablishing a FOIA ombudsman requiring the Office of Personnel \nManagement to examine how FOIA can be better implemented at the agency \nlevel. If the Commission finds that limited resources are a significant \nfactor in slowing down the fulfillment of requests, then Congress \nshould address the issue by increasing funding levels for FOIA \nprocessing.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Texas for his diligent work and \nflexibility in crafting a Commission structure that is balanced and \nfair, and that will bring extraordinary expertise to solving these \nnettlesome problems. I urge all of our colleagues to support the Faster \nFOIA Act, which has the potential to help agencies and requestors alike \nin the service of open government.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Burr, Mr. Santorum, \n        Mr. Schumer, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Byrd, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mr. Graham, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Pryor, Mrs. Lincoln, \n        Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Lott):\n  S. 593. A bill to amend title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 to \nprovide that the provisions relating to countervailing duties apply to \nnonmarket economy countries; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, our Nation's manufacturers and their \nemployees can compete against the best in the world, but they cannot \ncompete against nations that provide huge subsidies and other unfair \nadvantages to their producers. I hear from manufacturers in my State \ntime and time again whose efforts to compete successfully in the global \neconomy simply cannot overcome the practices of illegal pricing and \nsubsidies of nations such as\n\n[[Page S2487]]\n\nChina. The results of these unfair practices are lost jobs, shuttered \nfactories, and decimated communities.\n  Consider this one example. The American residential wood furniture \nindustry has experienced devastating losses due to surges of unfairly \npriced furniture imports from China. According to the U.S. Bureau of \nLabor, 34,700 jobs, or 28 percent of the workforce, have been lost in \nthe U.S. furniture industry since 2000. One furniture manufacturer in \nMaine, Moosehead Manufacturing, was forced to eliminate a quarter of \nits employees due to the unfair market conditions it faces.\n  Unfairly priced imports from China are a leading cause in these job \nlosses. China's wooden bedroom furniture exports to the U.S., which \namounted to just $169 million in 1999, reached an estimated $1.2 \nbillion in 2003. By subsidizing investments in furniture manufacturing \nfacilities, China is exploiting the U.S. market to the benefit of its \nproducers and putting our employees at an unfair advantage.\n  This is why I am introducing the ``Stopping Overseas Subsidies Act,'' \na bill I introduced in the 108th Congress. I am pleased to be joined by \nmy good friend and colleague from Indiana, Senator Bayh, who has worked \nclosely with me on this legislation. This bill revises current trade \nremedy laws to ensure that U.S. countervailing duty laws apply to \nimports from non-market economies, such as China.\n  Our Nation's trade remedy laws are intended to give American \nindustries and their employees relief from the effects of illegal trade \npractices. Unfortunately, some countries in the world choose to cheat \ninstead of compete fairly. In these cases, U.S. industries can file \npetitions under U.S. trade remedy laws for relief. Under current \nCommerce Department practice, however, U.S. industries competing with \nthese unfairly advantaged foreign producers can file an anti-subsidy \npetitions against any market economy--such as Canada or Chile--but not \nagainst a non-market economy such as China. As a result, those \ncountries, such as China, that subsidize their industries the most \nheavily and cause the most injury to U.S. industries and workers are \nexempt from the reach of American anti-subsidy laws.\n  It is time that this was changed. It is simply not fair to prevent \nU.S. industries from seeking redress from these unfair trade practices \nbecause our trade remedy laws are outdated.\n  Over the past two decades, there have been significant economic \nchanges in many of the countries classified as non-market economies. \nThis is particularly true in China, one of our largest trading partners \nand the country with which the United States currently runs its largest \ntrade deficit.\n  Beginning in the early 1980's and continuing today, China has \nundertaken major economic reforms. Today, China's economy is not \ncompletely state-controlled. Government price controls on a wide range \nof products have been eliminated. Many enterprises and even entire \nindustries have been allowed to operate and compete in an economic \nsystem that has elements of a free market. And, of course, China has \ntaken steps toward fully integrating into the global trading system by \njoining the World Trade Organization and by working toward the \nestablishment of a modern commercial, financial, legal, and regulatory \ninfrastructure.\n  The problem is not China's economic liberalization and modernization. \nThe problem is this: now that China has the capacity to be a key \ninternational economic player, the country has repeatedly refused to \ncomply with standard international trading rules and practices. And \nthese violations include the use of subsidies and other economic \nincentives that are designed to give its producers an unfair \ncompetitive advantage.\n  Perhaps the most glaring subsidy comes in the form of currency \nmanipulation. By keeping the Chinese yuan pegged to the U.S. dollar at \nartificially low levels, the Chinese undervalue the prices of their \nexports. Not only does this practice provide their producers with a \nprice advantage, but also it violates International Monetary Fund and \nWTO rules. The Chinese government also reimburses many enterprises for \ntheir operating losses and provides loans to uncreditworthy companies.\n  Currently, U.S. industries have no direct recourse to combat these \nunfair practices. They instead must rely upon government-to-government \nnegotiations or on the dispute settlement processes of international \norganizations such as the WTO. While these channels might eventually \nlead to relief, it usually takes years to see results--and by that \ntime, that industry could already be decimated.\n  Unfair market conditions cannot continue to cause our manufacturers \nto hemorrhage jobs. No state understands this more than my home state \nof Maine. According to a recent study by the National Association of \nManufacturers, on a percentage basis, Maine lost more manufacturing \njobs in the previous three years than any other state. This is why \norganizations such as the Maine Forest Products Council and the Maine \nWood Products Association have strongly endorsed my proposal.\n  The Stopping Overseas Subsidies bill is a bipartisan, bicameral bill \nthat has a broad range of support across many industries and \ngeographical areas. A companion bill is being introduced today in the \nHouse by Representatives Phil English of Pennsylvania and Artur Davis \nof Alabama. Last year, the Senate bill had eighteen cosponsors.\n  I am proud that over twenty organizations and a number of private \ncompanies, representing a range of industries, have endorsed this bill. \nSome of these organizations include: The American Forest & Paper \nAssociation, the National Council of Textile Organizations, the \nPrinting Industries of America, the Steel Manufacturers Association, \nand the Catfish Farmers of America. Of particular note, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers has endorsed this bill and has listed it \nas one of its top trade agenda items in 2005.\n  In addition, the United States Economic and Security Review \nCommission, a bipartisan organization established by Congress in 2000 \nto provide recommendations to Congress on the relationship between the \nUnited States and China, has endorsed the goals of this bill. In its \nannual report to Congress in June 2004, the Commission stated, ``U.S. \npolicy currently prevents application of countervailing duty laws to \nnonmarket economy countries such as China. This limits the ability of \nthe United States to combat China's extensive use of subsidies that \ngive Chinese companies an unfair competitive advantage. The Commission \nrecommends that Congress urge the Department of Commerce to make \ncountervailing duty laws application to nonmarket economies. If \nCommerce does not do so, Congress should pass legislation to achieve \nthe same effect.''\n  U.S. industries don't want protection--they want fair competition. \nIllegal subsidies distort fair competition, regardless of the economic \nsystem in which they are used. Our legislation simply levels the \nplaying field by allowing anti-subsidy petitions to be brought against \nnon-market economies in addition to market economies.\n  Countries such as China want to have all the benefits of engaging in \ninternational trading institutions and systems and continue to cheat on \nthe system with no penalties. It is time these countries were held to \nthe same standards as other countries around the world. I ask you to \njoin me in supporting the SOS bill to ensure that all countries are \nheld accountable for their trade practices.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 594. A bill to amend section 1114 of title 11, United States Code, \nto preserve the health benefits of certain retired miners; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, yesterday during consideration of the \nBankruptcy Reform Act of 2005, I offered an amendment regarding a \nserious matter involving the guaranteed health benefits of retired coal \nminers and their families. Unfortunately due to an objection to the \nunanimous consent request for consideration of my amendment, it was not \nconsidered. Therefore, to continue my efforts on behalf of our Nation's \ncoal miners, I have elected today to introduce the Retired Coal Miner \nHealth Benefits Preservation Act.\n  This legislation would reaffirm the commitment stipulated in the Coal \nAct of 1992, which guaranteed health benefits to retired coal miners \nand their families and would clarify the lack of authority of the \nbankruptcy court to\n\n[[Page S2488]]\n\nmodify or terminate statutory obligations required under Section 9711 \nof the Coal Act. This legislation is a direct response to a recent \nbankruptcy court proceeding in which the court determined it had the \nauthority under Section 1114 of the Bankruptcy Code to modify the level \nof benefits required to be provided under Section 9711 of the Coal Act.\n  The Coal Act of 1992 mandated coal operators to fulfill their promise \nto provide their employees and families health benefits and those \nobligations could not be modified. As an original cosponsor to this \nlegislation, I am intimately aware of its effect on the 14,000 retired \ncoal miners and their dependents in Pennsylvania. Nationally, this Act \neffects over 60,000 individuals including every State except for \nHawaii. These health benefits form a central underpinning for the \nmedical care structure of the coal field communities. The promise of \nthe Coal Act applied to a fixed pool of coal miners that was closed as \nof 1994.\n  Additionally, I want to note that there may be some speculation \nraised by my colleagues in reference to the recent bankruptcy of \nHorizon Natural Resources. In this particular bankruptcy proceeding, \nthe court concluded that Section 1114 trumped the Coal Act, which is \nsimply not the case. This or other statutory obligations cannot be \nundermined by the bankruptcy court. Congress intended that Section 1114 \nbe a statutory obligation and not a contractual obligation. Therefore, \nthis egregious court decision unfortunately trumps the true intent of \nthe Coal Act.\n  Finally, I am aware that my colleague, Senator Rockefeller, offered \nlegislation in the 108th Congress to address this issue and I commend \nhim for it. Today, I am continuing his prodigious work by introducing \nthis legislation which reinforces what Congress intended, which was not \nto obstruct the statutory requirements of the Coal Act. I urge my \ncolleagues to strongly support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Smith, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 595. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe work opportunity credit and the welfare-to-work credit; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Baucus in \nthe reintroduction of the Encouraging Work Act of 2005. The Work \nOpportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) and We1fare-to-Work Tax Credit (W-t-W) \nare tax incentives that encourage employers to hire public assistance \nrecipients and other individuals with barriers to employment. The \ncombination of Welfare Reform passed by Congress in 1996 and the \nassistance to employers found in the WOTC and W-t-W has enabled \nexpanded opportunity for many Americans. Yet more can be done. We were \npleased that the Senate JOBS bill passed last year included a permanent \nWOTC/W-t-W provision along with helpful reforms largely supported by \nthe Administration. Unfortunately, it was only extended in another tax \nrelief bill. Without action by Congress WOTC and W-t-W will expire on \nJanuary 1, 2006.\n  Under present law, WOTC provides a 40 percent tax credit on the first \n$6,000 of wages for those working at least 400 hours, or a partial \ncredit of 25 percent for those working 120-399 hours. W-t-W provides a \n35 percent tax credit on the first $10,000 of wages for those working \n400 hours in the first year. In the second year, the W-t-W credit is 50 \npercent of the first $10,000 of wages earned. WOTC and W-t-W are key \nelements of welfare reform. A growing number of employers use these \nprograms in the retail, health care, hotel, financial services, food, \nand other industries. These programs have helped over 2,700,000 \npreviously dependent persons to find jobs.\n  WOTC and W-t-W eligibility is limited to: 1. Recipients of Temporary \nAssistance to Needy Families (TANF) in 9 of the 18 months ending on the \nhiring date; 2. individua1s receiving Supplemental Security Income \n(SSI) benefits; 3. disabled individuals with vocational rehabilitation \nreferrals; 4. veterans on food stamps; 5. individuals in households \nreceiving food stamp benefits; 6. qualified summer youth employees; 7. \nlow-income ex-felons; and 8. individua1s age 18-24 1iving in \nempowerment zones or renewal communities. Eligibility for W-t-W is \nlimited to individuals receiving welfare benefits for 18 consecutive \nmonths ending on the hiring date. More than 80 percent of WOTC and W-t-\nW hires were previously dependent on public assistance programs. These \ncredits are both a hiring incentive--offsetting some of the higher \ncosts of recruiting, hiring, and retaining public assistance recipients \nand other low-skilled individua1s--and a retention incentive, providing \na higher reward for those who stay longer on the job.\n  After eight years of experience with these programs, their value has \nbeen well demonstrated. In 2001, the GAO issued a report that indicated \nthat employers have significantly changed their hiring practices \nbecause of WOTC. With the resources provided by WOTC, employers have \nprovided job mentors, lengthened training periods, engaged in \nrecruiting outreach, and listed jobs or requested referrals from public \nagencies or partnerships. WOTC and W-t-W have become a true public-\nprivate partnership in which the Department of Labor, the Internal \nRevenue Service, the states, and employers have forged excellent \nworking relationships.\n\n  But the challenges for employers and those looking for better \nopportunities are real. The job skills of eligible persons leaving \nwelfare are sometimes limited, and the costs of recruiting, training, \nand supervising low-skilled individuals cause many employers to look \nelsewhere for employees. WOTC and W-t-W are proven incentives for \nencouraging employers to seek employees from the targeted groups. \nDespite the considerable success of WOTC and W-t-W, many vulnerable \nindividuals still need a boost in finding employment. There are several \nlegislative changes that would strengthen these programs, expand \nemployment opportunities for needy individuals, and make the programs \nmore attractive to employers.\n  Combine WOTC and W-t-W. The Administration's FY 2006 budget proposes \nto simplify these important employment incentives by combining them \ninto one credit and making the rules for computing the combined credits \nsimpler. The credits would be combined by creating a new welfare-to-\nwork target group under WOTC. The minimum employment periods and credit \nrates for the first year of employment under the present work \nopportunity tax credit would apply to W-t-W employees. The maximum \namount of eligible wages would continue to be $10,000 for W-t-W \nemployees and $6,000 for other target groups ($3,000 for summer youth). \nIn addition, the second year 50-percent credit under W-t-W would \ncontinue to be available for W-t-W employees under the modified WOTC.\n  Eliminate Requirement to Determine Family Income for Ex-Felons. Under \ncurrent law, only those ex-felons whose annual family income is 70 \npercent or less than the Bureau of Labor Statistics lower living \nstandard during the six months preceding the hiring date are eligible \nfor WOTC. The Administration's FY 2006 budget proposes to eliminate the \nfamily income attribution rule.\n  Permanent Extension of WOTC and W-t-W. Permanent extension would \nprovide these programs with greater stability, thereby encouraging more \nemployers to participate, make investments in expanding outreach to \nidentify potential workers from the targeted groups, and avoid the \nwasteful disruption of termination and renewal. A permanent extension \nwould also encourage the state job services to invest the resources \nneeded to make the certification process more efficient and employer-\nfriendly.\n  Raise the WOTC age eligibility ceiling from 24 to 39 years of age for \nmembers of food stamp households and ``high-risk youth'' living in \nenterprise zones or renewal communities. Current WOTC eligibility rules \nheavily favor the hiring of women because single mothers are much more \nlikely to be on welfare or food stamps. Women constitute about 80 \npercent of those hired under the WOTC program, but men from welfare \nhouseholds face the same or even greater barriers to finding work. \nIncreasing the age ceiling in the ``food stamp category'' would greatly \nimprove the job prospects for many absentee fathers and other ``at \nrisk''\n\n[[Page S2489]]\n\nmales. This change would be completely consistent with program \nobjectives because many food stamp households include adults who are \nnot working, and more than 90 percent of those on food stamps live \nbelow the poverty line.\n  WOTC and W-t-W are also key elements of welfare reform. Employers in \nthe retail, health care, hotel, financial services, and food industries \nhave incorporated this program into their hiring practices and through \nthese programs, more than 2,700,000 previously dependent persons have \nfound work. A recent report issued by the New York State Department of \nLabor bears this out in economic terms. Comparing the cost of WOTC \ncredits, taken by New York state employers during the period 1996-2003 \n(for a total of $192.59 million), with savings achieved through closed \nwelfare cases and reductions in vocational rehabilitation programs and \njail spending (for a total of $199.89 million), the State of New York \nconcluded that WOTC provided net benefits to the taxpayers even without \ntaking into account the additional economic benefits resulting from the \naddition of new wages.\n  In that regard, the New York State analysis concluded that the \nroughly $90 million in wages paid to WOTC workers since 1996 generated \nroughly $225 million in increased economic activity. Perhaps even more \nimportantly, the study found that roughly fifty-eight percent of the \nTANF recipients who entered private sector employment with the \nassistance of WOTC stayed off welfare. I mention the New York State \nstudy because it is the first of its kind; however, I am certain that \nsimilar conclusions would be reached in the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania or any of the other forty-eight states and the District of \nColumbia. These programs work and do so at a net savings to taxpayers. \nIn fact, over a 7-year period there were more than 110,000 \ncertifications for both WOTC and W-t-W in Pennsylvania, alone enabling \nmany to leave welfare and find private sector work. The legislation is \nsupported by hundreds of employers throughout Pennsylvania and around \nthe country. WOTC and W-t-W have received high praise as well from the \nfederal government. A 2001 GAO study concluded that employers have \nsignificantly changed their hiring practices because of WOTC by \nproviding job mentors, longer training periods, and significant \nrecruiting outreach efforts.\n  WOTC and W-t-W are not traditional government jobs programs. Instead \nthey are precisely the type of program that we should champion in a \ntime when we need to be fiscally responsible. These are efficient and \nlow cost public-private partnerships that have as their goal to provide \na means by which individuals can transition from welfare to a lifetime \nof work and dignity.\n  The Work Opportunity Credit and Welfare-to-Work Credit have been \nsuccessful in moving traditionally hard-to-employ persons off welfare \nand into the workforce, where they contribute to our economy. However, \nemployer participation in these important programs can be increased, \nparticularly among small and medium-sized employers. This is due to the \ncomplexity of the credits and the fact that they are both only \ntemporary provisions of the tax code subject to renewal every year or \ntwo. Small, medium, and even some large employers find it difficult to \njustify developing the necessary infrastructure to administer and \nparticipate in these programs when their continued existence beyond one \nor two years is constantly in question.\n  This legislation will remedy this problem by combining WOTC and W-t-W \ninto one, more easily administered tax credit, and by making it a \npermanent part of the tax code. Many organizations including the \nNational Council of Chain Restaurants, National Retail Federation, Food \nMarketing Institute, National Association of Convenience Stores, \nNational Restaurant Association, American Hotel & Lodging Association, \nNational Roofing Contractors Association, National Association of Chain \nDrug Stores, American Nursery and Landscape Association, and the \nAmerican Health Care Association support this legislaiton. \nRepresentatives Jerry Weller R-IL, Charles Rangel D-NY, and Phil \nEnglish R-PA are introducing identical legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this \nlegislation.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nSantorum, in introducing legislation to permanently extend and improve \nupon the Work Opportunity and the Welfare-to-Work tax credits. Last \nyear, I was pleased to successfully add a permanent a extension of \nthese credits to the Senate passed JOBS bill, which combined the \ncredits and made certain improvements. When the expiring tax provisions \nwere considered last year as part of the Working Families Tax Relief \nbill, I offered an amendment to combine both credits and make them \npermanent. While this provision was not retained in conference, I was \nsuccessful in securing an extension of the current program through \nDecember 31, 2005. This extension expires at the end of this year so \nimmediate action is needed to make these credits permanent and make \nseveral reforms in the programs to improve their effectiveness. These \nrecurring lapses and extensions make administration of this credit \nburdensome both for the taxpaying employer, who cannot keep track of \nwho is or isn't qualified, and for the IRS, which needs to ensure \ntaxpayers are complying with the ever-shifting law.\n  Over the past decade, the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, WOTC, and the \nWelfare-to Work, W-t-W, have helped over 2.2 million public assistance \ndependent individuals enter the workforce. Both of these important \nprograms are scheduled to expire on December 31, 2005. These hiring tax \nincentives have clearly demonstrated their effectiveness in helping to \nlevel the job selection playing field for low-skilled individuals by \nproviding employers with additional resources to help recruit, select, \ntrain and retain individuals with significant barriers to work. Many \nvulnerable individuals still need a boost in finding employment, and \nthis is particularly critical during periods of high unemployment. The \nweak economy and rising unemployment give employers many more hiring \noptions because of the larger pool of experienced laid-off workers. \nWithout an extension of these programs, the task of transitioning from \nwelfare-to-work will become even harder for individuals who reach their \nwelfare eligibility ceiling.\n  Because of the costs involved in setting up and administering a WOTC/\nW-t-W program, employers have established massive outreach programs to \nmaximize the number of eligible persons in their hiring pool. The \nStates, in turn, have steadily improved the programs through improved \nadministration. WOTC has become an example of a true public-private \npartnership design to assist the most needy applicants. Without the \nadditional resources provided by these hiring tax incentives, few \nemployers would actively seek out this hard-to-employ population.\n  WOTC provides employers with a graduated tax credit equal to 25-\npercent of the first $6,000 in wages for eligible individuals working \nbetween 120 hours and 399 hours and a 40-percent tax credit on the \nfirst $6,000 in wages for those working over 400 hours. The W-t-W tax \ncredit is geared toward long-term welfare recipients and provides a 35-\npercent tax credit on the first $10,000 in wages during the first year \nof employment and a 50-percent credit on the first $10,000 for those \nwho stay on the job a second year.\n  In my own State of Montana, many businesses take advantage of this \nprogram, including large multinational firms and smaller family-owned \nbusinesses. Those who truly benefit from the WOTC/W-t-W program, \nhowever, are low-income families, under the Food Stamp Program, the Aid \nto Families with Dependent Children, AFDC, and Temporary Assistance for \nNeedy Families, TANF, programs, and also low-income U.S. Veterans. In \nMontana, more than 1,000 people were certified as eligible under the \nWOTC program during an 18-month period, October 2001 through March \n2003, including 476 Food Stamp recipients, 475 AFDC/TANF recipients, \nand 52 U.S. veterans.\n  The bill we are introducing provides for a permanent program \nextension of the two credits. After a decade of experience with WOTC \nand W-t-W, we know that employers do respond to these important hiring \ntax incentives. Permanent extension would provide these\n\n[[Page S2490]]\n\nprograms with greater stability, thereby encouraging more employers to \nparticipate, make investments in expanding outreach to identify \npotential workers from the targeted groups, and avoid the wasteful \ndisruption of termination and renewal A permanent extension would also \nencourage the state job services to invest the resources needed to make \nthe certification process more efficient and employer-friendly.\n  The bill also includes a proposal to simplify the programs by \ncombining them into one credit and making the rules for computing the \ncombined credits simpler. This would be accomplished by creating a new \nwelfare-to-work target group under WOTC. The minimum employment periods \nand credit rates for the first year of employment under present work \nopportunity tax credit would apply to W-t-W employees. The maximum \namount of eligible wages would continue to be $10,000 for W-t-W \nemployees. In addition, the second year 50-percent credit under W-t-W \nwould continue to be available for W-t-W employees under the modified \nWOTC.\n  Finally, there are other changes in the bill that would extend these \nbenefits to more people and help them find work. Because of the \nprogram's eligibility criteria, over 80 percent of those hired are \nwomen leaving welfare. Since men are not eligible for TANF benefits \nunless they are parenting their kids, the fathers of children on \nwelfare receive little help in finding work, even though they often \nface barriers to work just as women on welfare do. We propose to help \nabsentee fathers find work and provide the resources to assume their \nfamily responsibilities by opening up WOTC eligibility to anyone 39 \nyears old or younger in families receiving food stamps or residing in \nenterprise zones or empowerment communities. Raising the eligibility \nlimits in these two categories will extend eligibility to hundreds of \nthousands of at-risk men.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS:\n  S. 596. A bill to reform the nation's outdated laws relating to the \nelectric industry, improve the operation of our transmission system, \nenhance reliability of our electric grid, increase consumer benefits \nfrom wholesale electric competition and restore investor confidence in \nthe electric industry; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce the ``Electric \nTransmission and Reliability Enhancement Act of 2005''. It is my \nintention to build on the competitive wholesale open access policies \nadopted by the Congress in the 1992 Energy Policy Act. My legislation \nwould extend and improve these open, non-discriminatory access \npolicies; remove antiquated federal statutory barriers that stand in \nthe way of competitive wholesale markets; encourage increased \ninvestment in our transmission system and establish enforceable \nreliability standards to help ensure the continued reliability of the \ninterstate transmission system.\n  The Congress has been debating how to update the antiquated statutory \nand regulatory framework governing the electric industry for over eight \nyears. We repeatedly have tried and failed to enact legislation that \nwould provide the right economic signals and regulatory certainty \nnecessary for industry and wholesale market modernization. The loser in \nall of this has been the consumer, who has been denied the full \nbenefits that access provides to fairly priced, reliable supplies of \npower. I have come to the conclusion that if we are to legislate \nsuccessfully, we will have to pare down our wish list to the bare \nessentials plus those issues necessary for the electric industry to \nattract the capital it needs to keep our lights on and ensure that \ncustomers pay no more for their power than is fair and necessary.\n  It seems clear that if truly competitive wholesale markets are to \nexist, there is a need to ensure that all industry participants play by \nthe same rules. While the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has \ntried to ensure this, the Commission's tools are limited. Only Congress \ncan give FERC the tools it needs to ensure that all industry \nparticipants in competitive wholesale markets play by the same rules.\n  Under present federal law FERC has no jurisdiction or authority over \ntransmission facilities owned by public power agencies, municipalities \nand cooperatives. In the West these types of entities own a substantial \nportion, perhaps as much as half of the interstate electric \ntransmission system. As a matter of fact, in the Western Electric \nCoordinating Council, an area that encompasses all or part of 11 \nWestern states and parts of Canada, non-FERC jurisdictional facilities \naccount for 52 percent of transmission miles.\n  My legislation would permit FERC to require certain nonregulated \nutilities to offer transmission service at comparable rates to those \nthey charge themselves, and on terms and conditions comparable to those \napplicable to jurisdictional public utilities. Currently nonregulated \ntransmitting utilities would not be subject to the full panoply of FERC \nregulation under this provision. Instead, a ``light handed'' form of \nregulation would apply and small nonregulated entities, such as those \nthat sell less than 4,000,000 MW/h per year, would be entirely exempt \nfrom these nondiscrimination requirements.\n  It also seems clear that the Public Utility Holding Company Act is \nhindering necessary restructuring of the industry and the deployment of \ncapital into an industry that desperately needs it. Investors are \ndeterred simply because they do not want to deal with the PUHCA rules \nand restrictions. If repealed, utility securities will continue to be \nregulated by the SEC, FERC and most state commissions. Mergers and \nacquisitions of jurisdictional assets would still require FERC and \nstate commission approval and review by the Department of Justice, DOJ, \nand the Federal Trade Commission, FTC. FERC and state commissions would \nstill be able to monitor rates and prevent cross-subsidies.\n  Despite State progress in administering the Public Utility Regulatory \nPolicies Act of 1978, it is clear that PURPA continues to provide \nspecial privileges to certain favored generators at the expense of \nutilities and their customers. Like PUHCA, PURPA is no longer needed in \ntoday's competitive wholesale markets. My legislation prospectively \neliminates the mandatory purchase and sell obligations of PURPA.\n  Over the years the grid has been well protected through voluntary \nstandards established by the North American Electric \nReliability Council. NERC's voluntary reliability standards--which are \nnot enforceable--have generally been complied with by the electric \npower industry. But with the opening of the wholesale power market to \ncompetition, our transmission grid is being used in ways for which it \nwas not designed. New system strains are also being created by the \nbreak-up of vertically integrated utilities and by the emergence of new \nmarket structures and participants. The results of these changes have \nbeen an increase in the number and severity of violations of NERC's \nvoluntary rules.\n\n  My legislation converts the existing NERC voluntary reliability \nsystem into a mandatory reliability system. A North America-wide \norganization would have the authority to establish and enforce \nreliability standards, and take into account regional differences. The \nnew reliability organization will be run by market participants, and \nwill be overseen by the FERC in the U.S. The organization will be made \nup of representatives of everyone who is affected--residential, \ncommercial and industrial consumers; State public utility commissions; \nindependent power producers; electric utilities and others. There is no \nquestion that we need a new system to safeguard the integrity of our \nelectric grid. My legislation would do this, using language that was \nagreed upon in the last Congress by House and Senate conferees for the \nenergy bill.\n  During the last energy debate, efforts were made to address some of \nthe more egregious behavior and attempted market manipulation by \ncertain entities through legislation. While this area is obviously very \ncomplex, we need to address this issue if regulatory gaps truly do \nexist. I realize my attempt might not be perfect, but I wanted to \ninitiate discussion on this very important topic if in fact regulatory \nagencies do need additional authority to police and monitor the \nindustry.\n  My legislation will provide more information on prices of electricity \nand\n\n[[Page S2491]]\n\ntransmission availability, outlaw the practice of round trip trading \nand prohibit reporting of false information for the purpose of \nmanipulating price indices. In addition I've included authority the \nFERC has requested and that would increase civil and criminal penalties \nfor violation of the Federal Power Act and accelerate the refund \neffective date to the date of filing of a complaint.\n  In the end it's about the consumer. It is my hope and vision that \nthis legislation will produce a more reliable and efficient \ntransmission system and that these improvements will result in more \ndependable and affordable electricity for all consumers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 596\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to reauthorize \nTitle VIII of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-\nDetermination Act. Title VIII provides authority for the appropriation \nof funds for the construction of low-income housing for Native \nHawaiians and further provides authority for access to loan guarantees\n\n[[Page S2495]]\n\nassociated with the construction of housing to serve Native Hawaiians.\n  Three studies have documented the acute housing needs of Native \nHawaiians--which include the highest rates of overcrowding and \nhomelessness in the State of Hawaii. Those same studies indicate that \ninadequate housing rates for Native Hawaiians are amongst the highest \nin the Nation.\n  The reauthorization of Title VIII will support the continuation of \nefforts to assure that the native people of Hawaii may one day have \naccess to housing opportunities that are comparable to those now \nenjoyed by other Americans.\n  I would ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 598\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include \ncombat pay in determining an allowable contribution to an individual \nretirement plan; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \ncorrect an injustice in the Internal Revenue Code that is negatively \naffecting our troops.\n  I recently received an e-mail from an active-duty Airman who \nexpressed his dismay that he has been told the law requires him to \nwithdraw the money he had contributed to an IRA previously in the year. \nHere is what he told me:\n\n       I am an active-duty member of the military who has been \n     deployed so much that I have not paid taxes for more than a \n     year now. I also had been contributing to a Roth-IRA. I've \n     been told by tax professionals that I will have to withdraw \n     my contributions because I do not show a taxable income. I've \n     been deployed and put in harm's way many times last year and \n     I am not allowed legally to contribute to an IRA like any \n     other average American.\n       This is an injustice to the soldiers that work so hard \n     under hard conditions. There are thousands of soldiers that \n     are going to be told to take their IRA contributions out \n     since they have been deployed twelve months. This is a slap \n     in the face for those soldiers who have put themselves in \n     danger.\n\n  This injustice results from an unintended, but undeniably unjust, \ninteraction between combat pay and IRA rules. Under IRA contribution \nrules, you can only contribute to a tax-favored retirement account if \nyou have taxable income for the year. Military personnel deployed for a \nfull calendar year or more, however, may have no taxable income because \ntheir earnings while serving in a combat zone are excluded from \ntaxation. These troops are therefore prohibited by law from \ncontributing income to an IRA because, technically, they have not \nearned taxable income.\n  This is indeed an injustice. This is no way to treat the men and \nwomen who have been deployed to combat zones in Iraq and Afghanistan \nfor long periods of time. Rather than discouraging our troops from \nsaving for retirement, we should take steps to ensure that they have \nthe same access to tax-favored retirement savings programs as the rest \nof us.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in correcting this injustice. The bill \nI am introducing today simply amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow \nour dedicated military service men and women to contribute to lRAs, \nregardless of their deployment status.\n  My bill presents an opportunity for the United States Senate to \nsupport retirement savings and our brave military personnel. This is a \nwin-win for all involved. I hope my colleagues will join me in \ncorrecting this injustice and send this bill to the President for his \nquick signature.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Warner, Ms. \nCollins, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Nelson \nof Florida, Ms. Landrieu, Ms. Stabenow, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \nLautenberg, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Boxer, \nMr. Dodd, Mr. Talent, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Lugar, \nMr. Coleman, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Bayh, and Mr. \nRockefeller):\n  S. 602. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to fund \nbreakthroughs in Alzheimer's disease research while providing more help \nto caregivers and increasing public education about prevention; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to speak of the life, \nleadership and the truly remarkable legacy of the 40th President of the \nUnited States, Ronald Reagan.\n  President Reagan was a great communicator with a powerful message. He \npreached the gospel of hope, freedom and opportunity not just for \nAmerica but for the world. Reagan was a genuinely optimistic person who \nbrought that spirit of optimism and hope to the American people and to \nenslaved peoples around the world. He was a man who took disappointment \nand moved on. He was a man of unfailing good humor, care and \nthoughtfulness. Even people who disagreed with his policies across the \nboard could not help but like him.\n  In the U.S., his policies encouraged the return of more tax dollars \nto average Americans and unfettered entrepreneurship to create jobs and \nbuild the economy. Reagan's strong military opposition to the Soviet \nUnion helped bring down the walls that harbored communism and tyranny \nthroughout Eastern Europe and much of the world.\n  In a letter to the American people in 1994 Ronald Reagan announced he \nwas one of the millions of Americans with Alzheimer's disease. One of \nthe most courageous things Ronald and Nancy Reagan did was to announce \npublicly that he had Alzheimer's disease. Through their courage and \ncommitment, the former President and his wife, Nancy, changed the face \nof Alzheimer's disease by increasing public awareness of the disease \nand of the need for research into its causes and prevention.\n  In honor of Ronald Reagan, today my colleague Senator Mikulski and I \nare introducing the Ronald Reagan Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act. This \nbill will increase research for Alzheimer's and increase assistance to \nAlzheimer patients and their families. This bill will serve as a living \ntribute to President Reagan and will: 1. Double funding for Alzheimer's \nResearch at the National Institute of Health; 2. increase funding for \nthe National Family Caregiver Support Program from $153 million to $250 \nmillion; 3. reauthorize the Alzheimer's Demonstration Grant Program \nthat provides grants to states to fill in gaps in Alzheimer's services \nsuch as respite care, home health care, and day care; 4. authorize $1 \nmillion for the Safe Return Program to assist in the identification and \nsafe, timely return of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related \ndementias who wander off from their caregivers; 5. establish a public \neducation campaign to educate members of the public about prevention \ntechniques that can ``maintain their brain'' as they age, based on the \ncurrent research being undertaken by NIH; 6. establish a $3,000 tax \ncredit for caregivers to help with the high health costs of caring for \na loved one at home; and 7. encourage families to prepare for their \nlong term needs by providing an above-the-line tax deduction for the \npurchase of long term care insurance.\n  Ironically it was President Reagan who drew national attention to \nAlzheimer's for the very first time when he launched a national \ncampaign against Alzheimer's disease some 22 years ago.\n  In 1983 President Reagan proclaimed November as National Alzheimer's \nDisease Month. In his proclamation President Reagan said ``the \nemotional, financial and social consequences of Alzheimer's disease are \nso devastating that it deserves special attention. Science and clinical \nmedicine are striving to improve our understanding of what causes \nAlzheimer's disease and how to treat it successfully. Right now, \nresearch is the only hope for victims and families.''\n  Today, approximately 4.5 million Americans have Alzheimer's, with \nannual costs for this disease estimated to exceed $100 billion. Today \nthere are more than 4.5 million people in the United States with \nAlzheimer's, and that number is expected to grow by 70 percent by 2030 \nas baby boomers age.\n\n[[Page S2496]]\n\n  In my home State of Missouri, alone, there are over 110,000 people \nwith Alzheimer's disease. Based on population growth, unless science \nfinds a way to prevent or delay the onset of this disease, that number \nwill increase to over 130,000 by 2025--that is an 18 percent increase.\n  In large part due to President Reagan, there has been enormous \nprogress in Alzheimer research--95 percent of what we know we \ndiscovered during the past 15 years. There is real potential for major \nbreakthroughs in the next 10 years. Baby boomers could be the first \ngeneration to face a future without Alzheimer's disease if we act now \nto achieve breakthroughs in science.\n  President and Mrs. Reagan have been leading advocates in the fight \nagainst Alzheimer's for more than 20 years, and millions of Americans \nhave been helped by their dedication, compassion and effort to support \ncaregivers, raise public awareness about Alzheimer's disease and \nincrease of nation's commitment to Alzheimer's research.\n  This bill will serve as a living tribute to President Reagan and will \noffer hope to all those suffering from the disease today. As we \ncelebrate the life and legacy of Ronald Reagan, we are inspired by his \nlegendary optimism and hope, and today we move forward to confront this \nexpanding public health crisis with renewed vigor, passion, and \ncompassion.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as the Senate co-chair of the Bipartisan \nTask Force on Alzheimer's Disease, I am pleased to join Senators Bond \nand Mikulski in introducing the Ronald Reagan Alzheimer's Breakthrough \nAct of 2005.\n  Alzheimer's is a devastating disease that takes a tremendous personal \nand economic toll on both the individual and the family. As someone \nwhose family has experienced the pain of Alzheimer's, I know that there \nis no more helpless feeling than to watch the progression of this \ndreadful disease. It is an agonizing experience to look into the eyes \nof a loved one only to receive a confused look in return.\n  Ronald Reagan had a profound effect on our Nation in many ways during \nhis Presidency. But what many of us will remember most is the grace and \ndignity with which he and his wife Nancy faced the final battle against \nAlzheimer's--the one campaign they knew he wouldn't win.\n  Ironically, it was President Reagan who first drew national attention \nto Alzheimer's disease when he launched a national campaign against the \ndisease some 22 years ago. In 1983, President Reagan proclaimed \nNovember as National Alzheimer's Disease Month. In his proclamation, \nPresident Reagan said: ``The emotional, financial and social \nconsequences of Alzheimer's disease are so devastating that it deserves \nattention. Science and clinical medicine are striving to improve our \nunderstanding of what causes Alzheimer's disease and how to treat it \nsuccessfully. Right now, research is the only hope for victims and \ntheir families.''\n  An estimated 4.5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, more \nthan double the number in 1980. Moreover, Alzheimer's disease costs the \nUnited States more than $100 billion a year, primarily in nursing home \nand other long-term care costs. This figure will only increase \nexponentially as the baby boom generation ages. As the baby boomers \nmove into the years of highest risk for Alzheimer's disease, a strong \nand sustained research effort is our best tool to slow down the \nprogression and prevent the onset of this terrible disease.\n\n  Our investments in Alzheimer's disease research have begun to pay \ndividends. Effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease and a possible \nvaccine are tantalizingly within our grasp. Moreover, if scientists can \nfind a way to delay the onset of this devastating disease for even five \nyears, our Nation will save at least $50 billion in annual health and \nlong-term care costs and an incalculable amount in human suffering.\n  If we are to keep up the momentum we have established, we must \nincrease our investment in Alzheimer's disease research. Millions of \nAmericans, including the families of Alzheimer patients, are profoundly \ngrateful for our historic accomplishment of doubling funding for \nbiomedical research at the National Institutes of Health. We have made \ntremendous progress, but more must be done. The bill we are introducing \ntoday therefore doubles the authorization levels for Alzheimer's \nresearch at the NIH from the current funding level of $700 million to \n$1.4 million.\n  In addition to increasing funding for research, our bill provides \nmuch needed support for Alzheimer's patients and their families by \nincreasing funding for the National Family Caregiver Support Program \nand by providing a tax credit of up to $3,000 to help families meet the \ncosts of caring for a loved one with long-term care needs.\n  The Ronald Reagan Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2005 will serve as \na living tribute to President Reagan and will offer hope to all of \nthose suffering from the disease today. It is now time for Congress to \npick up the banner and pass this important legislation, and I urge all \nof my colleagues to sign on as cosponsors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/10/senate-section/article/S2496-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2496-S2497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 79--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE IN MARKING THE \n  DEDICATION ON MARCH 15, 2005, OF THE EXPANDED MUSEUM COMPLEX AT YAD \n   VASHEM, THE HOLOCAUST MARTYRS AND HEROES REMEMBRANCE AUTHORITY IN \nISRAEL, IN FURTHERANCE OF YAD VASHEM'S MISSION TO DOCUMENT THE HISTORY \n OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE DURING THE HOLOCAUST, TO PRESERVE THE MEMORY AND \n  STORY OF EACH OF THE VICTIMS, IMPART THE LEGACY OF THE HOLOCAUST TO \n   FUTURE GENERATIONS, AND RECOGNIZE THE RIGHTEOUS AMONG THE NATIONS\n\n  Mr. CORZINE (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Con. Res. 17\n\n       Whereas the Government of Sudan continues to commit crimes \n     against humanity and engage in genocidal acts in the Darfur \n     region of Sudan;\n       Whereas the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement \n     between the government in Khartoum and the Sudanese People's \n     Liberation Army on January 9, 2005, has not resulted in an \n     improvement of the security situation in Darfur;\n       Whereas, on January 26, 2005, the Government of Sudan \n     bombed the village of Rahad Kabolong in the state of North \n     Darfur, killing an estimated 100 people;\n       Whereas, in February of 2005, the African Union reported \n     that the security situation in Darfur had deteriorated over \n     the course of the previous four months;\n       Whereas, in March 2005, Doctors Without Borders issued a \n     report that stated that rape of women in Darfur continues \n     unabated;\n       Whereas United Nations officials have stated that at least \n     70,000 people have died due to violence and insecurity in \n     Darfur, but that the total is likely higher;\n       Whereas, according to the United Nations, the number of \n     people internally displaced due to the conflict in Darfur has \n     risen over the past year to nearly 1,850,000, and over \n     200,000 people are refugees in neighboring Chad;\n       Whereas aid organizations believe that approximately 1,000 \n     people per day are dying as a direct and indirect result of \n     the conflict in Darfur;\n       Whereas neither the mandate nor the troop strength of the \n     African Union Mission in Sudan is adequate to protect \n     civilians in that country; and\n       Whereas all members of the international community must \n     participate in efforts to stop genocide, war crimes, and \n     crimes against humanity in Darfur: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) strongly condemns the continued attacks on civilians in \n     Darfur;\n       (2) calls on all parties to abide by the terms of the April \n     8, 2004, N'Djamena cease-fire agreement;\n       (3) calls on the Government of Sudan to immediately \n     withdraw all military aircraft from the region and disarm the \n     janjaweed militias;\n       (4) commends the Africa Union Mission in Sudan for its \n     actions to date in monitoring the implementation of the \n     N'Djamena cease-fire agreement in Darfur;\n       (5) urges the President to immediately direct the United \n     States Permanent Representative to the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization to propose in the North Atlantic Council that \n     NATO assess and report to members on the potential \n     effectiveness of and requirements for a NATO-enforced no-fly \n     zone across the Darfur region of Sudan; and\n       (6) calls upon NATO allies to support the dispatch of such \n     an assessment mission.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the second reason I rise is literally a \ncoincidental but important offshoot of what Christopher Dodd, Senator \nDodd's father, did at the Nuremberg Trials. What they did--he and \nJustice Jackson--was they understood that you could uncover, deal with, \nand expose to the world atrocities humanity commits upon humanity and \nat the same time do it under the rule of law, give people a fair trial, \nactually abide by what we say we stand for.\n  All of us are aware of the genocide now taking place in the Darfur \nregion of Sudan. We passed a resolution last July which called \nKhartoum's abuses in Darfur genocide, which is what they were, what \nthey are, and what they continue to be. The then-Secretary of State \nColin Powell made the same assessment in testimony before the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee in September of 2004.\n  The President of the United States, President Bush, signed \nlegislation imposing sanctions on Khartoum for the actions in Darfur \nthis past December. With the signing of the North-South Peace Agreement \non January 9, administration officials believed the situation in Darfur \nwould improve. Unfortunately, they have only gotten worse.\n\n[[Page S2498]]\n\n  The Government of Sudan and its proxy militia continue to attack \ncivilians with impunity. An estimated 100 people were killed in an \naerial bombardment in Sudan at the end of January.\n  In February, the African Union officials reported that the security \nsituation in Darfur had deteriorated over the past 4 months and said \nthat the government and its allied militias were primarily to blame.\n  This month, Doctors Without Borders has reported that rape continues \nas a routine practice, routinely used as a weapon against the women in \nthe region with no sign of abating.\n  The insecurity continues to hamper aid efforts, and on March 6, the \nUnited Nations forbade its workers from traveling to certain areas--the \nlatest in a series of security measures put in place after aid workers \nwere kidnapped and then killed. Aid organizations report that as many \nas 1,000 people a day are dying because of the lack of access to food \nand medicine.\n  All told, violence and insecurity have resulted in at least 70,000 \ndeaths, although some believe the total to be much higher. The number \nof internally displaced persons has risen to nearly 2 million people. \nThere are over 200,000 refugees in Chad alone. The current registration \nbeing conducted reveal that there are far more than the 20,0000 \nrefugees in neighboring Chad.\n  The African Union Force in Darfur has made a noticeable difference in \nthe areas they are able to reach, but it does not have the size, the \nmandate, or the capability to protect civilians in Darfur. AU monitors \nhave come under fire from government allied forces and, in some \ninstances, have been prevented from investigating allegations of cease-\nfire violations.\n  The AU faces a serious lack of capacity both at the headquarters \nlevel and at the level of member states. Out of a mandated 3,000 \ntroops, fewer than 2,000 are on the ground. And even at full strength, \n3,000 soldiers is not enough to prevent further abuse of civilians and \nto investigate cease-fire allegations in the area the size of France.\n  It is evident to me that the administration--our administration--\nneeds to devote some focused time and attention to addressing the \ngenocide in Darfur. Our current policy has not turned the tide. We need \nto redouble our efforts and bring an end to the genocide in Darfur. The \nquestion will be 5 years from now to all of us: Where were we? Where \nwere we? What did we do when this genocide unfolded? There will be \nanother Academy Award-nominated movie about the god-awful genocide that \nis taking place, the routine rape, the systematic elimination of a \nwhole people.\n  Today, I sent a letter to the President of the United States urging \nhim to instruct our permanent representative at the NATO alliance, the \nso-called NAC, the North Atlantic Council, to propose that NATO assess \nand report immediately to members on the potential effectiveness of and \nrequirements for a NATO-enforced no-fly zone across Darfur in the \nregion of the Sudan. The reason I sent the letter is I am absolutely \ncertain of what NATO will say. They are fully, totally capable of \nenforcing a no-fly zone out of Chad. The French could do it now.\n  I have been one who has been critical of this administration. I \napologize for discussing this in the middle of a bill we have been \nworking on for a long time but, literally, events are overtaking us.\n  I am confident that NATO will point out they are fully physically \ncapable of taking and imposing a no-fly zone in the region. That will \nbe significant. My friend from New Jersey has been a leader on this \nsubject and this issue. He has been banging us about the head to do \nmore. He has a much more expansive proposal, which I support, than what \nI am proposing today.\n  I have stood in this Senate and defended our European allies against \nsome of the broader allegations in the Bush allegation, but I must say \ntoday, I am tired of our French friends and others bleeding all over us \nabout the plight of the people in Iraq, the plight of the people in \nother parts of the world, when it is fully within their capability \nright now that France could do this all by itself. Right now. They have \nthe wherewithal, they have the aircraft, they are positioned, and they \nvery much want to make sure that they are recognized as a major player \nin Africa.\n  I am, quite frankly, more than disappointed--appalled--for all their \ntalk that they are not acting at all. That does not relieve us of \nresponsibility. The fact that another nation has the capacity and has a \nhistory that would warrant it taking the action that needs to be taken \nnow, and does not, does not free us of an obligation.\n  Today's Washington Post editorial page says that enforcing the no-fly \nzone in Darfur would require ``one squadron of 12 to 18 fighter \naircraft backed up by 4 AWAC planes,'' and cites a retired Air Force \ngeneral as their source for believing such. Let's find out whether they \nare right. I believe they are. I have no reason to doubt that this Air \nForce general has talked not only to them but to others. But let's make \nit official. Let's do an assessment. Let's force the NAC to make an \nassessment now. I believe they will come back with exactly what I have \njust stated--a squadron, backed up by AWAC, that will be able to take \nout those gunships that are being used now to decimate entire villages.\n  As I said, my friend from New Jersey witnessed--I don't think he \nwitnessed the actual gunships in action, but he witnessed the results. \nLet's find out now so we cannot kid around with ourselves, so we do not \ndo what we are doing today, what we were doing last week and last \nmonth. We think this is an awful occurrence; we condemn it; but it is \nbeyond our capacity to effect an outcome.\n  That is what they said to me in 1993 in Bosnia. That is what they \nsaid in 1997 in Kosovo. That is what we didn't do in Rwanda. This is \ntime to act. It is within our capacity to do so. I believe it is \ntotally consistent with the President's call for freedom, totally \nconsistent with the President's Inaugural speech, which I applaud, \ntotally consistent with what I believe and hope is in his heart, to be \nable to stop this kind of action.\n  The question is, why propose sending the NATO mission to Darfur? A \nNATO mission will do three things. First, it will provide immediate \nsecurity for the people of Darfur by preventing area bombardment on the \nground by the government of Sudan. Second, it will bolster the ability \nof the African force on the ground by discouraging attacks in the AU \npersonnel and helicopters. Finally, it will send an unequivocal message \nto the international community that we will no longer tolerate \nKhartoum's actions.\n  Some may say, Why aren't you going to the U.N.? This is a point I \nwant to make again and again, one I made back in 1993, 1995, 1997 and \n1998. When that body does not act responsibly and when there is a \ngenocide underway, it is fully within our rights--and I will argue our \nobligation--to act, hopefully, with others, with the strongest alliance \nin the history of the modern world, NATO. But even if they don't, we \nhave a right, for I would argue and I say that which I am not supposed \nto say: If you engage in genocide, the world should reach a conclusion \nthat you forfeit your sovereignty. You forfeit your sovereignty if you \nengage in genocide. That should be a principle we should state loudly \nand clearly. That warrants, if the capacity exists, the use of whatever \naction is possible to stop the genocide.\n  I realize we have 12 divisions, 10 of which are coming or going to \nIraq. But we are not talking about a division here. We don't need a \ndivision here. We are going to look back and find a squadron of \naircraft, possibly several thousand American forces. That is what I \nwould do, by the way. I think we should put ground forces in as well, \nbut I am not asking that. All I am asking is, quite frankly, prick \nNATO's conscience and have them give us an honest assessment of what \nwould, in fact, be required to enforce a no-fly zone.\n  I send a resolution to the desk. I apologize I have not circulated \nthis, but I know my colleague from New Jersey, as I say, has been heard \non this and wants to be added. I know Senator Durbin does.\n  I ask unanimous consent it remain open for the remainder of the day \nfor me to be able to add cosponsors on both sides.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues for their indulgence.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/10/senate-section/article/S2499-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2499]]\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 139.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask \nunanimous consent that when the nomination for the Assistant Secretary \nfor Civil Works is received by the Senate, it be referred to the \nCommittee on Armed Services; provided that when the Committee on Armed \nServices reports the nomination it be referred to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works for a period of 20 days of session; \nprovided further that if the Committee on Environment and Public Works \ndoes not report the nomination within those 20 days, the committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of the nomination and the \nnomination be placed on the Calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. This order is a joint request by the chairmen and ranking \nmembers of the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works. As Chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, and as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I \nwant\n\n[[Page S2500]]\n\nto thank Chairman Warner and Senator Levin for working together with \nSenator Jeffords and myself on this order.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank Chairman Inhofe and as Chairman of the Committee \non Armed Services, I am pleased to join him and our Committees' ranking \nmembers in supporting this order. I note that the issues for which the \nAssistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works is responsible fall \nwithin the jurisdiction of both the Armed Services Committee and the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the Assistant Secretary of \nthe Army for Civil Works has played an increasingly important role \nwithin the Department of Defense and the Department of the Army for \nhomeland defense and homeland security. The Army protects and supports \nthe American people in the event of natural and man-made disasters and \nemergencies. Army programs provide public works and engineering \nassistance to protect human life, reduce suffering, and mitigate \ndamage, and Army response activities supplement State and local \nefforts. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works also has \nresponsibilities, in concert with the Chief of Staff of the Army, in \ndirecting the foreign activities of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nand formulating and overseeing the budget of the Arlington National \nCemetery, matters of great concern to the Armed Services Committee.\n  I note, as well, that there are matters under the Assistant Secretary \nof the Army for Civil Works' purview which are of concern to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works. Army programs for \nconservation and development of national water resources, including \nflood control, navigation, and shore protection, come to mind. \nConsequently, I fully support this initiative noting that the order is \nidentical to orders by the Senate in the 107th and 108th Congress.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I too support this order and I want to thank my \ncolleagues on both the EPW Committee and Armed Services for working \ntogether on this joint request.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I want to thank my colleagues and I am pleased to join \nthem in supporting this joint request.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/10/senate-section/article/S2500-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF MICHAEL JACKSON, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE DEPUTY SECRETARY OF \n                           HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Res. 69\n\n       Whereas the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe (OSCE) evolved from the Conference on Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), which was established in 1975, \n     and the official change of its name from CSCE to OSCE became \n     effective on January 1, 1995;\n       Whereas the OSCE is the largest regional security \n     organization in the world with 55 participating States from \n     Europe, Central Asia, and North America;\n       Whereas the 1975 Helsinki Final Act, the 1990 Charter of \n     Paris, and the 1999 Charter for European Security adopted in \n     Istanbul are the principal documents of OSCE, defining a \n     steadily evolving and maturing set of political commitments \n     based on a broad understanding of security;\n       Whereas the OSCE is active in early warning, conflict \n     prevention, crisis management, and post-conflict \n     rehabilitation;\n       Whereas Russia and Georgia agreed at the 1999 OSCE Summit \n     in Istanbul on specific steps regarding the withdrawal from \n     Georgia of Russian forces, including military equipment \n     limited by the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe \n     (CFE), and committed to resolve other key issues relating to \n     the status and duration of the Russian military presence in \n     Georgia;\n       Whereas Russia has completed some of the withdrawal from \n     Georgia of military equipment limited by the CFE Treaty in \n     excess of agreed levels, but has yet to agree with Georgia on \n     the status of Russian forces at the Gudauata base and the \n     duration of the Russian presence at the Akhalkalaki and \n     Batumi bases;\n       Whereas Russia completed the withdrawal from Moldova of its \n     declared military equipment limited by the CFE Treaty, but \n     has yet to withdraw all its military forces from Moldova, as \n     Russia committed to do at the 1999 OSCE Summit in Istanbul;\n       Whereas Russia made virtually no progress in 2004 toward \n     its commitment to withdraw its military forces from Moldova;\n       Whereas Moldova has called for a genuinely international \n     peacekeeping force to replace the Russian forces, and insists \n     on the\n\n[[Page S2501]]\n\n     implementation by Russia of its commitment to withdraw its \n     remaining military forces from Moldova;\n       Whereas Secretary of State Colin Powell stated at the \n     December 2004 OSCE Ministerial in Sofia, Bulgaria, that \n     ``Russia's commitments to withdraw its military forces from \n     Moldova, and to agree with Georgia on the duration of the \n     Russian military presence there, remain unfulfilled. A core \n     principle of the CFE Treaty is host country agreement to the \n     stationing of forces. The United States remains committed to \n     moving ahead with ratification of the Adapted CFE Treaty, but \n     we will only do so after all the Istanbul commitments on \n     Georgia and Moldova have been met. And we stand ready to \n     assist with reasonable costs associated with the \n     implementation of those commitments.'';\n       Whereas since June 2004, Russia has called for the closure \n     of the OSCE Border Monitoring Operation (BMO), the sole \n     source of objective reporting on border crossings along the \n     border between Georgia and with the Russian republics of \n     Chechnya, Dagestan, and Ingushetia;\n       Whereas OSCE border monitors took up their mission in \n     Georgia in May 2000, and prior to the failure to extend the \n     mandate for the BMO in December 2004, OSCE border monitors, \n     who are unarmed, were deployed at nine locations along that \n     border;\n       Whereas the current rotation of the BMO includes 65 border \n     monitors from 23 countries, including Austria, Azerbaijan, \n     Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, \n     Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, \n     Macedonia, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, \n     Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States;\n       Whereas at the December 2004 OSCE Ministerial, Russia \n     blocked renewal of the mandate for the BMO in Georgia;\n       Whereas Russia has stated that the BMO has accomplished \n     nothing, but it has in fact accomplished a great deal, \n     including observing 746 unarmed and 61 armed border crossings \n     in 2004 and serving as a counterweight to inflammatory press \n     reports;\n       Whereas in response to Russian complaints about the cost-\n     effectiveness of the BMO, the OSCE agreed in December 2004 to \n     cut the number of monitors and thereby reduce the cost of the \n     BMO by almost half;\n       Whereas the BMO began shutting down on January 1, 2005;\n       Whereas the staff of the BMO is now dismantling facilities \n     and is not performing its mission;\n       Whereas the shutdown of the BMO will become irreversible in \n     the second half of March 2005 and is currently scheduled to \n     be completed by May 2005;\n       Whereas the United States has reiterated its disappointment \n     over the failure of the Permanent Council of the OSCE to \n     reach consensus on renewing the mandate of the BMO, despite \n     request of Georgia, the host country of the BMO, that the \n     OSCE continue the border monitoring operation, and the \n     consensus of all states but one to extend the mandate for the \n     BMO; and\n       Whereas United States Ambassador to the United States \n     Mission to the OSCE, Stephan M. Minikes, said in a statement \n     to the OSCE Permanent Council in Vienna on January 19, 2005, \n     that ``we believe that the closure of the BMO would remove a \n     key source of peaceful relations and of objective reporting \n     on events at the sensitive border and increase the likelihood \n     of heightened Russia-Georgia tensions.'': Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     United States should--\n       (1) urge Russia to live up to its commitments at the 1999 \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) \n     Summit in Istanbul regarding Georgia and Moldova;\n       (2) in cooperation with its European allies, maintain \n     strong diplomatic pressure to permit the OSCE Border \n     Monitoring Operation (BMO) in Georgia to continue; and\n       (3) if the BMO ceases to exist, seek, in cooperation with \n     its European allies, an international presence to monitor \n     objectively border crossings along the border between Georgia \n     and the Russian republics of Chechnya, Dagestan, and \n     Ingushetia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/10/senate-section/article/S2501-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL SAFE PLACE WEEK\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise today to mark the anniversary of \nthe death of a young woman whose courage and willingness to help others \nshould inspire us all. Fern Holland, who was murdered near the Iraqi \ncity of Karbala at the age of 33 a year ago today, lived her life to \ncreate the most equal and just global society obtainable. In light of \nInternational Women's Day, which was yesterday, I think it is only \nfitting that we honor the life of someone who led the fight to protect \nwomen throughout the world. Fern Holland realized the importance of \nhelping others early in her life, which is exemplified by the path she \nchose.\n  There are hundreds of people whose lives have been touched by Fern \nHolland and I believe her legacy will live long beyond her years on \nEarth. In the January before her death Holland wrote in an e-mail to \nher former boss, Tulsa lawyer Stephen Rodolf. ``I love the work and if \nI die, know that I'm doing precisely what I want to be doing--working \nto organize and educate human rights activists and women's groups.\n  I urge my colleagues to remember Fern Holland when they have lost the \nstrength to continue to work for the good of all people. We must \ndiligently work to sustain the passion Fern Holland possessed. As a \nliving memorial to her, I challenge each of my colleagues to continue \nto work for a better future for all people, particularly those without \ntheir own voice. I would like to extend my deepest sympathy to her \nfamily who are feeling this loss more than anyone else.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and use this day as a \ntime to remember Fern Holland's extraordinary life and to use her \nexample to recommit ourselves to the better good of all people.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the life \nand memory of a great singer/songwriter, rodeo champion and true \ncowboy, Chris LeDoux. Sadly, Chris passed away on March 9 at the age of \n56 in Casper, WY.\n  Chris was a loyal son, devoted husband and loving father. As a member \nof an air force family, Chris lived in many places throughout his \nchildhood. He finally found his home in Wyoming while a sophomore in \nhigh school. In 1972, he married his lovely wife Peggy in Kaycee, WY, \nwhere he eventually built his ranch and fathered five wonderful \nchildren.\n\n[[Page S2503]]\n\n  Chris was a cowboy through and through. He began riding in junior \nrodeos when he was only 13. He tried his hand at several rodeo events, \nbut before too long, it became apparent he was best on bareback broncs. \nAfter winning the Wyoming State High School Bareback Riding \nChampionship and the National Intercollegiate Bareback Riding \nChampionship, he joined the rodeo circuit full time. This choice \nbrought many injuries and tough days on the road, but all his hard work \npaid off in December of 1976 when he won the world championship title \nfor bareback bronc riding at the National Rodeo Finals in Oklahoma \nCity.\n  While on the rodeo circuit, Chris wrote songs about cowboys and the \nrodeo life he was leading. His songs were filled with both his love of \nmusic and his love of the West. In past interviews, Chris expressed \nthat next to family, freedom was his most valued asset.\n  Just as he cherished the freedom of his western life, Chris was \nadamant about his musical freedom. He was determined to produce music \nin his own way rather than be ``owned by a big company.'' By 1989, \nChris had released 22 albums, mostly cassette tapes produced by his \nparents that he sold at concerts and rodeos. That same year, Garth \nBrooks had a hit with, ``Much Too Young,'' which included a line about \n``a worn-out tape of Chris LeDoux.'' Chris soon became the country star \nhe was always meant to be.\n  Chris LeDoux was not only a world class entertainer, he was a friend. \nMy wife Susan fondly recalls his great love for his family and his warm \nsmile. He will be greatly missed by his family, friends and his loyal \nfans.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Mr. President, for the benefit of our colleagues, \ntomorrow the Senate will be in a period of morning business. As I \nannounced earlier, there will be no rollcall votes during tomorrow's \nsession. The next vote will occur Monday afternoon around 5:30 p.m.\n  A few moments ago, we completed action on the bankruptcy bill. I want \nto particularly thank all of our colleagues for the work on the bill \nand, in particular, Senator Grassley, Senator Hatch, Senator Sessions, \nand others on both sides of the aisle who have been working on this \nlegislation for, lo, these many years--7 or 8 years, I was told by \nSenator Biden a while ago.\n  Next week, we will be considering the budget resolution. We will have \nlong, long evening sessions, and many, many rollcall votes throughout \nthe week.\n  I ask, on behalf of myself and the majority leader, for Senators to \nmake themselves available throughout the week. And I particularly want \nto emphasize that next Friday, the end of the week, could be a long \nday. I want to let all Members know there is an overwhelming likelihood \nthat Friday will be a full day. Members should expect to be here \nthroughout the day next Friday. We will go up into the evening. It will \nbe an unusual Friday. We don't have many of those in the course of a \nyear. But next Friday will be an unusual Friday, and people should make \nplans accordingly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I would like to \nsay on behalf of those who didn't support the bankruptcy bill that, in \nall fairness, I think it was a spirited and a very positive debate, \nduring the course of the debate for over 2 weeks. But that really \nboiled down to about 6 or 7 days. We entertained 30 amendments to the \nbankruptcy bill. Not one amendment went on extraordinarily long. \nMembers took a limited amount of time, expressed themselves, debated \nquickly and thoroughly, and voted.\n  I hope that we can continue to follow that model. I think, as I have \nsaid, we got perilously close to debate in the U.S. Senate, which \nhardly ever happens around here. I hope that we can continue along \nthose lines in the future.\n  I thank the Senator from Kentucky for yielding.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I could just say to my friend, I \ncouldn't agree more. I think the debate was handled very nicely. \nMembers got an opportunity to have their say, to get their votes, and \nthe Senate has done itself proud. In spite of the mixed views about the \noutcome, the Senate did itself proud with the first two bills this \nyear, and I hope it is a good recipe for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/10/senate-section/article/S2503-3", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
