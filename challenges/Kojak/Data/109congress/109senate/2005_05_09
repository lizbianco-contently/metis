Mr. President, today we will shortly resume consideration \nof the highway bill. There are a couple of Members desiring to speak on \nother subjects prior to going back to the highway legislation, and we \nwill accommodate those statements. I will have a brief statement. The \nDemocrat leader has a statement, as well.\n  Chairman Inhofe will be managing the highway bill today. As we \nannounced prior to the recess, we expect a vote this evening at \napproximately 5:30 p.m. That vote will be in relation to an amendment \non the highway bill. Several Senators have indicated they would be \navailable today to offer amendments. We hope to schedule one of those \nfor a vote this evening.\n  We are now beginning our second week of work on the highway bill. The \nmanagers have patiently waited for Members to come to the Senate to \noffer their amendments. I am concerned about the pace of the bill. We \nneed to finish the bill this week. I put our colleagues on notice that \nwe will use cloture if necessary to bring this bill to conclusion.\n  Having said that, be prepared for full sessions to consider and \ndispose of highway amendments over the next few days. As I think about \nit, I want to make it clear to our Members, we will be voting \nthroughout this week, including Friday.\n  With respect to the emergency supplemental appropriations bill, that \nshould now be at the desk. Our expectation is to begin debate on that \nconference report this evening. I hope any Member who wants to speak \nwill stay this evening for debate in order to schedule a vote on the \nemergency supplemental appropriations conference report sometime \ntomorrow, hopefully early tomorrow. I will be consulting further with \nthe Democrat leader on the exact timing but, again, we want to vote as \nearly as possible on Tuesday so we can get back to the highway bill.\n  I thank our colleagues in advance for their help on these two \nimportant measures.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could make a brief comment on the \nhighway bill: I agree with the distinguished leader that we need to \nmove forward on this bill. I have been advised over the last several \ndays, and had a couple calls this morning, that they are having \nproblems with the transit section of the bill. Senators Shelby and \nSarbanes want a little different formula than is in the bill. They are \nworking on that now as we speak. I hope they can get that worked out. A \nsignificant amount of work has gone into the bill not only by members \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee and the Banking \nCommittee, which has jurisdiction over transit, but also by the Finance \nCommittee. It is a very complicated bill.\n  I underscore what the distinguished Republican leader said. It is my \nunderstanding that Senators Baucus and Grassley are going to lay down \nan amendment today. I hope everyone would offer their amendments on \nthis bill. I have had a lot of comments from\n\n[[Page S4612]]\n\nMembers saying they have concerns about what is in the bill. This is an \nopportunity to lay down the amendments. We have been told by the \ndistinguished Republican leader today that if there is no progress on \nthis bill he is going to file cloture. This is the highway bill. This \nis not a bill where cloture will not be invoked. There is wide-ranging \nsupport for this bill.\n  I hope everyone follows the admonition the Republican leader just \ngave and be ready with amendments because, if we wind up waiting much \nlonger, we will not have an opportunity to do that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/09/senate-section/article/S4612-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, 4 years ago today President Bush nominated \nMiguel Estrada to the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals. \nHis nomination should have gone smoothly. The American Bar Association \npronounced him highly qualified, a rating my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle once called the gold standard. He clerked for a \nSupreme Court Justice and worked in both the Bush and Clinton \nadministrations.\n  The Honduran immigrant then won top honors at Columbia University and \nHarvard Law School. Miguel Estrada epitomized the American dream. But \nMiguel Estrada's nomination never received an up-or-down vote. A \nminority of Senators used the filibuster to stop the Senate from \nexercising its constitutional duty to advise and consent.\n  Senators supporting his nomination made seven attempts to bring his \nnomination to a vote. Each time the effort failed. Finally, after \nenduring 2 years of obstruction, Miguel Estrada withdrew his name from \nconsideration.\n  Unfortunately, today marks the fourth anniversary of another \ncandidate whose nomination is, likewise, being blocked. Priscilla Owen, \nwho has served on the Texas Supreme Court for 10 years, has earned the \npraise of both Republicans and Democrats. Judge Owen won reelection to \nthe Texas bench with 84 percent of the vote and the endorsement of \nevery major newspaper in the State.\n  Former justice Raul Gonzalez, a Democrat, says:\n\n       I found her to be apolitical, extremely bright, diligent in \n     her work, and of the highest integrity. I recommend her for \n     confirmation without reservation.\n\n  Still, a minority of Senators is using the filibuster to stop this \nSenate from exercising its constitutional duty to advise and consent, \nto vote up or down, to vote yes or no, to vote, confirm or reject.\n  This campaign of obstruction is unprecedented. Before Miguel Estrada, \nthe Senate had never denied a judicial nominee with majority support an \nup-or-down vote. In the last Congress, the President submitted 34 \nappeals court nominees to the Senate. Ten of those nominees continue to \nbe blocked. Each has been rated ``qualified'' or ``well-qualified'' by \nthe American Bar Association, each has the majority support of the \nSenate, and each would be confirmed if brought to the Senate floor to a \nvote.\n  Meanwhile, the other side threatens to shut down the Senate and \nobstruct government itself if it does not get its way. Instead of \nthoughtful deliberation and debate, a small minority is attempting to \nchange 225 years of constitutional history. Former Senate majority \nleader Bob Dole is correct when he says:\n\n       By creating a new threshold for the confirmation of \n     judicial nominees, the Democratic minority has abandoned the \n     tradition of mutual self-restraint that has long allowed the \n     Senate to function.\n\n  Precedent has been replaced with partisanship, and respect for the \nseparation of powers tossed aside.\n  Now, 12 of the 16 court of appeals vacancies have been officially \ndeclared judicial emergencies. The Department of Justice tells us that \nthe delay caused by these vacancies is complicating their ability to \nprosecute criminals. The Department also reports that due to the delay \nin deciding immigration appeals, it cannot quickly deport illegal \naliens who are convicted murderers, rapists, and child \nmolesters. Additionally, there are notoriously long delays in deciding \nhabeas petitions, meaning that both victims' families and prisoners \noften wait years before getting final resolution on murder convictions.\n\n  All of this obstruction must stop. It is hurting the nominees. It is \nhurting the Senate. It is hurting the American people.\n  For most of the 20th century the same party controlled the White \nHouse and the Senate. Yet until the last Congress, no minority ever \ndenied a judicial nominee with majority support an up-or-down vote. \nThey treated judicial nominees fairly. They respected the Senate's role \nin the appointments process designed by the Framers.\n  Before the recess, I came to the Senate to offer a compromise. That \nproposal was simple: Appeals court judicial nominees should get a fair, \nopen, and exhaustive debate, and then they should get an up-or-down \nvote. Whether on the floor or in committee, it is time for judicial \nobstruction to end no matter which party controls the White House or \nthe Senate.\n  Senate tradition is comprised of shared values based on civility and \nrespect for the Constitution. I sincerely hope that Senate tradition \ncan be restored. It is a matter of fairness. It is a matter of honor. \nIt is our constitutional duty to give these nominees a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/09/senate-section/article/S4612-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, of the initial Bush nominees, the 10 or 11 \nwe are talking about today, 8 have been confirmed; only 3 were not. Of \ncourse, one of those, Miguel Estrada, has not been renominated. \nAnother, Terrence Boyle, has never been reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee, even after 4 years of Republican control. So only one of the \ninitial nominees, Priscilla Owen, is currently on the calendar.\n  I think the Democrats have been responsible and reasonable in \nexercising advice and consent regarding this initial nominee.\n  Regarding Priscilla Owen, she served on the Texas Supreme Court with \nthe President's lawyer, Alberto Gonzales, who is now the Attorney \nGeneral. Judge Gonzales wrote that several of Judge Owen's opinions \nwere acts of unconscionable activism.\n  I am concerned the Senate is heading toward an unnecessary showdown \nover judicial nominations. One of the Hill newspapers recently reported \nthat my distinguished friend, the majority leader, is under enormous \npressure from right-wing groups to trigger the so-called nuclear \noption. So many of our colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, have \ncontacted me and, I am sure, the majority leader, saying: Let's try to \nwork something out. They want to avert this damaging confrontation \nbecause it would be bad for the Senate and bad for the country. So we \nneed to take every step we can to avoid this confrontation.\n\n  We are prepared to be reasonable even with respect to these \ncontroversial nominations that are now before the Senate. But it seems \nthat the White House, and maybe the Senate leadership, will not give \nthe Senate a chance to put this issue behind us.\n  It is important to understand that this manufactured crisis has been \nforced upon the Senate by the White House. During President Bush's \nfirst term, the Senate confirmed 205 of his judicial nominations and \nturned back only 10. This is a significant, strong percentage--more \nthan 95 percent.\n  The President could have accepted that success and avoided \nconfrontation by choosing not to resubmit the names of those who were \nrejected. Instead, the President sent back 7 of the 10 nominees the \nSenate declined to confirm, including: the very controversial \nnominations of Priscilla Owen, whom I briefly commented about; William \nMyers, who, by the way, is the first nominee to the Federal bench that \nAmerican Indians have ever opposed; William Pryor; Janice Rogers Brown; \nand Henry Saad.\n  In fact, this whole crisis is really about five people. I have \nmentioned the five. Of the 10 previously rejected nominees, 3 were not \nrenominated, and 2 are tied up in a separate controversy over the Sixth \nCircuit involving procedural matters. So we are talking only, I repeat, \nabout 5 judges, 5 out of the\n\n[[Page S4613]]\n\n218. But this historically high percentage the President has obtained, \ncreating one of the lowest vacancy rates in the entire history of the \nFederal judiciary, is not good enough for some. They have to have it \nall.\n  Meanwhile, the President has failed to send us new nominations. In \nthe more than 4 months since he was sworn in to a second term, the \nPresident has sent the Senate only one new judicial nomination. Other \nthan that one nominee to the District Court of Nevada, Brian Sandoval, \nevery single one of the President's judicial nominees has been here \nbefore. I have said to everyone who will listen that Senate Democrats \nwill be careful and judicious in the use of our procedural rights. I \nhave said that judicial filibusters will continue to be rare. So why \ndoesn't the White House test our willingness to be reasonable by \nsending new nominees who we can consider anew and fresh, instead of old \nnominees who have run into trouble before?\n  It is clear that the White House would rather pick fights than pick \njudges. One reason the White House will not send new judges to the \nSenate is that they do not want to give Senate Democrats a chance to \nshow we are reasonable. They do not want the confirmation rate to \nincrease from 95 percent to 96 or 98 percent. They want to paint us as \nobstructionists. But the facts are that the judicial confirmation rate \nthis year is 100 percent and that there has not been a single \nfilibuster of the four nominees the majority leader has brought before \nthe Senate this year. But the radicals on the far right do not want to \ngive us an opportunity to continue that cooperation because it would \nundercut their argument justifying the nuclear option. Maybe the White \nHouse wants to force the nuclear option on the Senate because it wants \nto clear the way for a Supreme Court nominee, because they are afraid \nthe person they will submit is not going to be reasonable.\n  There are lots of reasonable people around. There are Members sitting \nin this Senate today who could be a Supreme Court nominee of President \nBush. They do not want a David Souter, a Republican, or an Anthony \nKennedy, a Republican, or a Sandra Day O'Connor, a Republican, or a \nRuth Bader Ginsberg, or a Stephen Breyer.\n  So, Mr. President, I want a chance to prove that Senate Democrats are \nreasonable. There is a nominee on the Executive Calendar named Thomas \nGriffith. Mr. Griffith is a controversial nominee to an important \nappellate court. But if he is brought before the Senate, I believe he \nwill be confirmed. He is the former Senate legal counsel. He was here \nduring the impeachment proceedings. His nomination to the DC Circuit \nwas reported from the Judiciary Committee by a 14-to-4 vote. Ranking \nMember Leahy and other Senators who opposed Griffith were concerned, \namong other things, that he had failed to obtain a license to practice \nlaw in either the District of Columbia or Utah during the time he was \nworking as a lawyer in those jurisdictions.\n  A number of Democrats will vote against confirmation on the floor, \nfor these reasons and other reasons. But we on this side know the \ndifference between opposing nominees and blocking nominees. We will \noppose bad nominees, but we will only block unacceptable nominees. \nDemocrats will use extended debate responsibly, and there is no cause \nfor the majority to break the rules and 217 years of Senate traditions \nto take that right away. Mr. Smith should still be able to come to \nWashington, with either a Democratic or Republican Senate.\n  I emphasize that Mr. Griffith is nominated to the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals. This is the most important appellate court, separate and apart \nfrom the Supreme Court. Republicans say that our 95-percent \nconfirmation rate is not relevant because many of the 208 judges we \nhave confirmed are district court nominees--trial court judges, not \nappellate court judges. Well, here is a nominee to the most important \nFederal appellate court in the country, with the exception of the \nSupreme Court, and we are prepared to move forward. So I ask, do we get \nextra credit that this nominee is to the DC Court of Appeals?\n  Let me note that this same courtesy was not extended to President \nClinton's nominees to the DC Circuit. Republicans held up the \nnomination of Justice Department official Merrick Garland for years \nbefore finally confirming him.\n  President Clinton then nominated two distinguished lawyers to the \ncourt: Elena Kagan, now dean of the Harvard Law School, and Allen \nSnyder, a partner in the law firm of Hogan & Hartson and a former clerk \nto Chief Justice Rehnquist. Both of these nominations were buried in \nthe Judiciary Committee and were never given an up-or-down vote in \ncommittee or on the Senate floor.\n\n  I have heard my Republican friends say so many times this year that \nnominees are entitled to an up-or-down vote. I would defy them to \nexplain why Kagan and Snyder were denied votes on the Senate floor and \nwhy 69 Clinton nominees were buried and lost in the judiciary \ncommittee. But we want to move forward. To demonstrate our good will, \nwe want to move forward on a controversial nominee to the DC Circuit. I \nwant the majority leader to know that Democrats are prepared to enter \ninto a unanimous consent agreement to move to the Griffith nomination. \nUnder this unanimous consent agreement, we would proceed to the \nGriffith nomination immediately upon disposition of the supplemental \nappropriations bill. We would then have up to 10 hours of debate on \nthat nomination, equally divided. Following that debate, we would be \nwilling to have an up-or-down vote on this controversial nominee to the \nDC Circuit.\n  Let's take a step away from the precipice. Let's arrive at this step \nand have a decision made on Griffith and then move on. Let's try \ncooperation rather than confrontation, which seems to be the hallmark \nof what we have been doing here lately.\n  I just remind everyone: This has been a pretty good year for work \nbeing done in the Senate. My friend, the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer, served in the House of Representatives where you can ram \nthings through the House. If you are in the majority there, things go \nvery quickly. But that is not how it works in the Senate. So we have \nbeen very fortunate this year to move legislation--important, landmark \nlegislation, legislation that many of my colleagues on my side of the \naisle did not especially like: class action legislation, bankruptcy \nlegislation.\n  We have done a lot of work here. We are going to do the supplemental \nappropriations bill. We have finished the budget. We have done a lot of \nwork. We are on the highway bill. So I would think we should move \nforward. I say to those people who are interested in moving forward and \nwho are interested in cooperation rather than confrontation, let us \nmove forward on a unanimous consent request--which I would be happy to \npropound at a subsequent time, or the majority leader could do it--to \nmove forward on Griffith. We want 5 hours on our side to talk about \nthis man. They could have whatever time they want on their side. And we \nwould move forward on an up-or-down vote on a DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals judge. I would think that would get us down the road to doing \nwork that needs to be done in the Senate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield to the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is it my understanding, Mr. President, the distinguished \nDemocratic leader is saying he is prepared to ask consent to move \nforward on the nomination of Tom Griffith to the DC Circuit?\n  Mr. REID. I answer my friend: the answer is yes, even though this man \nis a controversial nominee. I know my distinguished friend, the senior \nSenator from Vermont, has on a number of occasions criticized this \nnomination. I have mentioned already a number of the reasons, including \nhis practice of law without a license in a couple of different \njurisdictions. But I have stated that I would be willing to move \nforward on this nomination. We would have adequate time on our side--up \nto 5 hours--to talk about the merits or demerits of this gentleman, and \nthe majority could have whatever time they wanted. We would move to an \nup-or-down vote on this man. I think this would be an appropriate way \nto move forward and--again, I repeat for the third time--have in this \nbody cooperation rather than confrontation.\n\n[[Page S4614]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield further for a \nquestion, the Senator has stated he realizes Mr. Griffith practiced law \nillegally, first in one jurisdiction for 3 or 4 years, then in a second \njurisdiction for 3 or 4 years, but that he is the President's choice \nfor going on the DC Circuit.\n  I am sure the Senator is aware that during the last administration, \nseveral nominees for that same seat were blocked by pocket filibusters \nby the Republicans--one was Elana Kagan, who is now the dean of the \nHarvard Law School. Another was Allen Snyder, a former Supreme Court \nlaw clerk to Chief Justice Rehnquist.\n  I voted against Mr. Griffith because I felt on the second highest \ncourt of the land it is not a good example to have a person, whatever \nhis other qualifications might be, who was so cavalier as to practice \nlaw illegally in two different jurisdictions.\n\n  I ask the Senator, is the Senator aware I did work with the \ndistinguished Chairman of the committee, Senator Specter, to allow the \nhearing to go forward with Mr. Griffith and to allow a vote to go \nforward without delay in the committee? While I voted against Mr. \nGriffith because of the practice of law, primarily, and while, I felt \nconcern that Chief Justice Rehnquist's former law clerk and Dean Kagan \nwere blocked by the Republican pocket filibuster, I ask the leader if \nhe understands that I will certainly have no objection nor do I know of \nany Democrat who would object to moving forward and having a real \ndebate and the up-or-down vote that was denied to a Democratic \nPresident's nominees? Does the Senator understand that not withstanding \nthe fact that I would vote against that nominee, I would support him \nbringing this nomination forward? I suspect he would get a majority of \nthe votes in the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. Let me say to my friend through the Chair, there is no \nquestion that Elana Kagan is qualified--she is the dean of the No. 1 \nrated law school in the country, No. 1. Yale and Stanford come close, \nbut Harvard is the No. 1 law school in the country. She is the dean of \nthat school. But the Republicans controlled the Judiciary Committee, \nand they would not allow this woman to come to this floor.\n  I would love to have had her on the floor so somebody could have \nfiled a cloture motion. I would have loved to vote on that, but they \nwould not even bring that nomination to the floor for a vote. They \nwould not let it come to a vote in the committee, because this woman \nwas eminently qualified, not only by her legal experience and her \neducation, but by her demeanor and personal attitude toward the law. So \nshe would have been really good for the second highest court in the \nland.\n  And I say about the other person----\n  Mr. LEAHY. Allen Snyder.\n  Mr. REID. Allen Snyder, this man clerked for Chief Justice Rehnquist. \nAgain, there was not even the courtesy of having a vote in the \ncommittee. They come to the floor and cry crocodile tears about up-or-\ndown votes. We would have taken a cloture vote on either one of these \npeople. But they were unwilling to bring this person before the \ncommittee or the floor.\n  So I say to my friend, you are absolutely right, there is a different \nstandard now than there was. We are bringing people to the court. They \nsay there has not been an up-or-down vote. There has been a vote. Every \none of President Bush's nominees has come before the Senate for a vote. \nAnd I think it is on 69 different occasions that President Clinton had \na nominee turned down on even a hearing in the Judiciary Committee, \neven a vote in the Judiciary Committee, let alone coming to the floor.\n  So my distinguished friend is absolutely right.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished leader through the \nChair----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. If the Senator from Vermont would \nsuspend for a second. The Chair would remind both the Senators that \nSenators may yield time for the purposes of a question only.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am posing a question.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to my friend for a question.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would ask if the Senator would yield for the purpose of \na question. When we talk about votes, 40 is the threshold on \nfilibusters. Of course, the Senate sets the rules. The Senate could \nsay: You require 95 votes. Or it could say: You require 2 votes. There \nis nothing magic about 50, 40, 60, or anything else. But be that as it \nmay, I would ask, through the Chair, whether the Senator from Nevada is \naware of numerous instances in which Democrats have proceeded to debate \nand vote on the President's nominees against which there were more than \n40 negative votes--I can think of three significant judicial \nnominations where there were 41 Democratic votes against allowing them \nto go forward: Timothy Tymkovich was confirmed to the Eighth Circuit \nalthough 41 Senators voted against him; Jeffrey Sutton was confirmed to \nthe Sixth Circuit although 41 Senators voted against him; J. Leon \nHolmes was confirmed to the district court in Arkansas although 46 \nSenators from both parties voted against him. In addition, Senate \nDemocrats proceeded to debate and vote on the controversial nomination \nof former Attorney General Ashcroft, who was confirmed although 42 \nSenators voted against his confirmation; Ted Olson, who was confirmed \nto be Solicitor General although 47 Senators voted against his \nconfirmation; Victor Wolski, who was confirmed to the Court of Claims \nalthough 43 Senators voted against his confirmation.\n\n  Most recently, a number of us voted for cloture on the nomination of \nStephen Johnson to head the EPA. He was confirmed with only 61 votes in \nsupport. I was one of those who voted for cloture so we could go \nforward with the President's nomination.\n  Was the Senator from Nevada aware of all those?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the answer is yes. As I said earlier, we \nknow the difference between opposing nominees and blocking nominees. I \nbelieve this is the time to put all of this behind us. Eight years of \nPresident Clinton, four years of President Bush, let's move forward. \nThat is what this proposal is all about. Let's move forward. After we \nfinish that, let's see where we are and see what else we can do. I \nthink it is time to move forward. Again, I have no problem \ndistinguishing between what happened to the 69 Clinton would-be judges \nwho never showed up, never saw the light of day, and all those we have \ndealt with in the normal process in the 4 years President Bush has been \nPresident.\n  We have been very selective in those we have opposed. We think we are \nright on every one of them. Hindsight will tell.\n  This whole dispute is over 5 judges, 5 out of 218. It seems that \npeople of goodwill can agree, as my distinguished friend from Nebraska \nSenator Hagel indicated this weekend on television, when he said: We \nshould be able to work this out. We should. The world is watching us. \nWe should not be changing the rules by breaking the rules. We should \nnot do that. I hope the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, the \nmajority leader, my friend, will accept the gesture of goodwill we have \nmade. It is a step in the right direction. I hope we can let bygones be \nbygones and move forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/09/senate-section/article/S4614-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4614-S4637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRANSPORTATION EQUITY ACT: A LEGACY FOR USERS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Priscilla Owen\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, 4 years ago, the President nominated Texas \nSupreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen to serve on the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Justice Owen is an exceptional \njurist, a devoted public servant, and an extraordinary Texan. Yet after \n4 years, she still awaits an up-or-down vote on the floor of the \nSenate. Four years today and we are still waiting for a vote.\n  Although a bipartisan majority of the Senate stands ready to confirm \nthis outstanding nominee, a partisan minority obstructs the process and \nrefuses to allow that vote on her nomination. What is more, the \npartisan minority now insists, for the first time in history, that she \nmust be supported by a supermajority of 60 Senators rather than the \nconstitutional standard and the Senate tradition of majority vote.\n  I know Justice Owen personally, having served with her on the Texas \nSupreme Court for 3 years. She is a distinguished jurist and public \nservant who has excelled at virtually everything she has set out to do. \nShe was a top graduate of Baylor Law School at the remarkable age of 23 \nand scored the top score on the Texas bar exam. She entered the legal \nprofession at a time when relatively few women did. After a \ndistinguished record in private practice, she reached the pinnacle of \nthe Texas bar, the Texas Supreme Court. In doing so, she was supported \nby a larger percentage of Texans than any of her colleagues during her \nlast election, receiving around 84 percent of the vote, after enjoying \nthe endorsement of virtually every newspaper in Texas. She has been \nhonored as the Baylor Young Lawyer of the Year and the Baylor \nUniversity Outstanding Alumna.\n  Priscilla Owen enjoys significant bipartisan support. Three \nDemocratic judges on the Texas Supreme Court and a bipartisan group of \n15 presidents of the State Bar of Texas support her nomination.\n  The Houston Chronicle, in September of 2000, called Owen ``[c]learly \nacademically gifted,'' stating that she ``has the proper balance of \njudicial experience, solid legal scholarship and real-world know-how to \ncontinue to be an asset on the high court.''\n  The Dallas Morning News wrote in support of Owen on September 24, \n2002:\n\n       She has the brainpower, the experience and temperament to \n     serve ably on an appellate court.\n\n  The Washington Post wrote on July 24, 2002:\n\n       She should be confirmed. Justice Owen is indisputably well \n     qualified.\n\n  Lori Ploeger, Justice Owen's former law clerk, wrote in a letter to \nSenator Leahy on June 27, 2002:\n\n       During my time with her, I developed a deep and abiding \n     respect for her abilities, her work ethic, and, most \n     importantly, her character. Justice Owen is a woman of \n     integrity who has profound respect for the rule of law and \n     our legal system. She takes her responsibilities seriously \n     and carries them out diligently and earnestly.\n\n  Ms. Ploeger continued:\n\n       Justice Owen is a role model for me and for other women \n     attorneys in Texas.\n\n  Mary O'Reilly, a lifetime member of the NAACP and a Democrat, in a \nletter to Senator Dianne Feinstein, dated August 14, 2002, wrote:\n\n       I met Justice Owen in January of 1995, while working with \n     her on the Texas Supreme Court Gender Neutral Task Force . . \n     . I worked with Justice Owen on Family Law 2000, an important \n     state-wide effort initiated in part by Justice Owen . . . In \n     the almost eight years I have known Justice Owen, she has \n     always been refined, approachable, even-tempered and \n     intellectually honest.\n\n  Priscilla Owen is not just intellectually capable and legally \ntalented; she is also a fine human being with a big heart. The depth of \nher humanity and compassion is revealed through her significant free \nlegal work and community activity.\n  Priscilla has spent much of her life devoting time and energy in \nservice of her community. She has worked to ensure that all citizens \nare provided access to justice as the court's representative on the \nTexas Supreme Court Mediation Task Force and to statewide committees, \nas well as in her successful efforts to prompt the Texas legislature to \nprovide millions of dollars per year in legal services for the poor. \nShe was instrumental in organizing a group Ms. O'Reilly spoke of known \nas Family Law 2000 which seeks to find ways to educate parents about \nthe effect divorce can have on children and seeks to lessen the \nnegative impacts it has on them. She also teaches Sunday school at St. \nBarnabas Episcopal Mission in Austin, TX, where she is an active \nmember.\n  It is plain from these and so many other examples that Justice Owen \nis a fine person and a distinguished leader in the legal community. One \nwould think that after 4 long years, she would be afforded the simple \njustice of an up-or-down vote. I remain optimistic. While I know the \nDemocratic leader has offered a UC to consider the nomination of one of \nthe justices currently being filibustered, I don't see why that same \nprinciple would not apply to all of the justices, and we would just say \nthat any nominee of any President, whether they be Republican or \nDemocrat, where a bipartisan majority stands ready to confirm them, \nshould receive that up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. I remain \nhopeful the current 4-year violation of long-term Senate tradition, the \nimposition of this new supermajority requirement, will be laid aside in \nthe interest of proceeding with the people's business, a job my \ncolleagues and I were elected to faithfully execute.\n  For more than 200 years, it was a job that we did indeed execute. \nSenators from both sides exercised mutual restraint and did not abuse \nthe privilege of debate out of respect for two coequal branches of \ngovernment--the executive that has the constitutional right to choose \nhis or her nominees and an independent judiciary. Indeed, until 4 years \nago, colleagues on both sides of the aisle have consistently opposed \nthe use of the filibuster to prevent nominees from receiving an up-or-\ndown vote where they clearly had bipartisan majority support.\n  Senator Kennedy, the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts, \nsaid in 1998:\n\n       Nominees deserve a vote. If our . . . colleagues don't like \n     them, vote against them. But don't just sit on them--that is \n     obstruction of justice.\n\n  And Senator Leahy, the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, who was just on the floor, said in 1998:\n\n       I have stated over and over again on the floor that I would \n     refuse to put an anonymous hold on any judge; that I would \n     object and fight against any filibuster on a judge, whether \n     it is somebody I opposed or supported; that I felt the Senate \n     should just do its duty.\n\n  I could not agree more with these comments made by Senator Leahy and \nSenator Kennedy. But today we are doing a disservice to this fine \nnominee in our failure to afford her that up-or-down vote that they \nadvocated a few short years ago. The new requirement this partisan \nminority is now imposing, that nominees won't be confirmed without \nsupport of 60 Senators, is, by their own admission, wholly \nunprecedented in Senate history.\n  The reason for this is simple: The case for opposing this fine \nnominee is so weak that using a double standard and changing the rules \nis the only way they can defeat her nomination. What is more, they know \nit, too.\n  Before her nomination got caught up in this partisan fight, the \nranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee\n\n[[Page S4616]]\n\npredicted that Justice Owen would be swiftly confirmed. On the day of \nthe announcement of the first group of nominees, 4 years ago, including \nOwen, he said he was ``encouraged'' and that ``I know them well enough \nthat I would assume they would all go right through.''\n  Notwithstanding the change of attitude by the partisan minority, this \ngridlock is not really about Priscilla Owen, certainly not about \nPriscilla Owen the person. Indeed, just a few weeks ago, the Democratic \nleader announced that Senate Democrats would give Justice Owen an up-\nor-down vote, albeit only if other nominees were defeated or withdrawn \nor simply thrown overboard.\n  Obviously, this debate is not about principle. It is all about \npolitics. It is shameful. Any fair examination of Justice Owen's record \ndemonstrates how unconvincing the critics' arguments are.\n  For example, Justice Owen is accused of ruling against injured \nworkers, against those seeking relief from employment discrimination, \nand other sympathetic parties on some occasions. Never mind, however, \nthat good judges such as Judge Owen do their best to follow the law \nregardless of which party will win and which party will lose. Never \nmind that many of her criticized rulings were unanimous or near \nunanimous decisions of a nine-member Texas Supreme Court. Never mind \nthat many of these rulings simply followed Federal precedent authored \nand agreed to by appointees of Presidents Carter and Clinton or by \nother Federal judges unanimously confirmed by the Senate. Never mind \nthat judges often disagree, especially when the law is ambiguous and \nrequires careful and difficult interpretation.\n  The Democratic leader raised the frequent objection and that is \ncriticized Justice Owen for attempting to interpret and enforce a \npopular Texas law requiring parental notification before a minor can \nobtain an abortion. Her opponents allege that in one parental \nnotification case, then-Justice Alberto Gonzales accused her of \njudicial activism. That charge is untrue. I read myself the opinions \nagain this weekend and the charge is simply untrue. Gonzales did not \naccuse Owen of judicial activism. Not once did he say Justice Owen was \nguilty of judicial activism. To the contrary, he never mentioned her \nname or her opinion in the opinion the critics cite.\n  Furthermore, our current Attorney General has since testified under \noath that he never accused Owen of any such thing. What is more, the \nauthor of the parental notification law in question supports Justice \nOwen, as does the pro-choice Democratic law professor who was appointed \nto the Texas Supreme Court's advisory committee to implement that law. \nIn other words, Owen simply did ``what good appellate judges do every \nday. If this is activism, then any judicial interpretation of a \nstatute's terms is judicial activism.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the \nRecord at the close of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1).\n  Mr. CORNYN. The American people know a controversial ruling when they \nsee one, be it the redefinition of a traditional institution such as \nmarriage, the expulsion of the Pledge of Allegiance, and other \nexpressions of faith from the public square, the elimination of the \n``three strikes and you're out'' law, and other penalties for convicted \ncriminals, or the forced removal of military recruiters from college \ncampuses. Justice Owen's rulings fall nowhere near this standard or \ncategory. There is a whole world of difference between struggling to \ninterpret the ambiguous expressions of a legislature and refusing to \nobey a legislature's directives altogether.\n  It is clear Justice Owen deserves the broad bipartisan and \nenthusiastic support she obviously enjoys across the political \nspectrum. It is equally clear her opposition comes only from a narrow \nband on the far left fringes of that political spectrum. If the Senate \nwere merely to observe 200 years of consistent Senate and \nconstitutional tradition dating back to our Founders, there would be no \nquestion about her ability to be confirmed. She would be sitting on the \nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Legal scholars across the political spectrum have long concluded what \nwe in this body know instinctively, and that is to change the rules of \nconfirmation as a partisan minority has done badly politicizes the \njudiciary and hands over control of the judiciary to special interest \ngroups. One Professor Michael Gerhardt, who advises Senate Democrats on \njudicial confirmation, has written that a supermajority requirement for \nconfirming judges would be ``problematic, because it creates a \npresumption against confirmation, shifts the balance of power to the \nSenate, and enhances the power of special interests.''\n  DC Circuit Judge Harry Edwards, a respected Carter appointee, has \nwritten that the Constitution forbids the Senate from imposing a \nsupermajority rule for confirmation. After all, otherwise, ``the \nSenate, acting unilaterally, could thereby increase its own power at \nthe expense of the President'' and ``essentially take over the \nappointment process from the President.'' Judge Edwards thus concluded \nthat ``the framers never intended for the Congress to have such \nunchecked authority to impose supermajority voting requirements that \nfundamentally change the nature of our democratic process.''\n  Mr. President, I think I have about 5 more minutes of my remarks. I \nask unanimous consent that I be given an additional 5 minutes and the \nSenator from Vermont be given the same.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have no objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  Georgetown Law Professor Mark Tushnet has written that ``the \nDemocrats' filibuster is a repudiation of a settled preconstitutional \nunderstanding.'' He has also written, ``There's a difference between \nthe use of the filibuster to derail a nomination and the use of other \nSenate rules--on scheduling, on not having a floor vote without prior \ncommittee action, etc.--to do so. All those other rules can be \noverridden by a majority of the Senate whereas the filibuster cannot be \noverridden in that way. A majority of the Senate could ride herd on a \nrogue Judiciary Committee chair who refused to hold a hearing on some \nnominee; it can't do that with respect to a filibuster.''\n  Georgetown Law Professor Susan Bloch has condemned supermajority \nvoting requirements for confirmation, arguing that they would allow the \nSenate to ``upset the carefully crafted rules concerning appointment of \nboth executive officials and judges and to unilaterally limit the power \nthe Constitution gives the President in the appointment process. This, \nI believe, would allow the Senate to aggrandize its own rules and would \nunconstitutionally distort the balance of powers established by the \nConstitution.''\n  In summary, the record is clear. The Senate tradition has always been \nmajority vote, at least up until the last 4 years. The desire by some \nto alter that Senate tradition has been roundly condemned by legal \nexperts across the political spectrum. And now the 100 Members of this \nbody have a decision to make. Do we accept this dramatic and dangerous \ndeparture from 200 years of Senate precedent or do we work to restore \nthe tried and true Senate tradition and practice?\n  I know the majority leader and, indeed, the Democratic leader have \nbeen working trying to find a way. I prefer, though, a way that would \nallow our nominees, all nominees, whether they be Republican or \nDemocrat, to receive an up-or-down vote where a majority of the Senate \nstands ready to confirm them. I believe we should choose collaboration \nover contention any day of the week, if possible. But bipartisanship is \na two-way street. Both sides must agree to certain fundamental \nprinciples and the most fundamental principle is fairness. Fairness \nmeans the same rules apply, the same standards, whether the President \nis a Republican or Democrat. But bipartisanship is difficult when long-\nheld understandings and the willingness to abide by basic agreements \nand principles have unraveled so badly. When fairness falters, \nbipartisanship, too, will fail.\n  So I ask my colleagues what are we to do when these basic principles, \ncommitments, and understandings have been so badly trampled upon? What \nare\n\n[[Page S4617]]\n\nwe to do when nominees are attacked for doing their jobs, when they are \nattacked for following precedents adopted and agreed to by Presidents \nCarter and Clinton, and when they are singled out for rulings agreed to \nby a unanimous, or near unanimous court? What are we to do when these \nnominees are demonized and caricatured beyond recognition, when they \nare condemned as unqualified while at the same time they are deemed \nunanimously well qualified by organizations Democrats used to revere? \nWhat are we to do when Senate and constitutional traditions are \nabandoned for the first time in more than two centuries, when both \nsides once agreed nominees should never be blocked by filibuster and \nthen one side denies the existence of that very agreement, when their \ninterpretation of Senate tradition changes based on who is in the Oval \nOffice?\n  It is time to fix the broken judicial confirmation process. It is \ntime to end the blame game and fix the problem and move on. And it is \ntime to end the wasteful and unnecessary delay in the process of \nselecting judges that hurts our justice system and harms all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Vermont \nand yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                Southern Methodist University,\n\n                                          Dallas, TX, May 3, 2005.\n     Re Priscilla Owen\n\n     Senator John Cornyn,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: I write in support of the nomination \n     of Priscilla Owen to the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the Fifth Circuit. I write as a law professor who specializes \n     in constitutional law. I write as a pro-choice Texan, who is \n     a political independent and has supported many Democratic \n     candidates. And I write as a citizen who does not want the \n     abortion issue to so dominate the political debate that good \n     and worthy judicial candidates are caught in its cross hairs, \n     no matter where they stand on the issue.\n       Justice Owen deserves to be appointed to the Fifth Circuit. \n     She is a very able jurist in every way that should matter. \n     She is intelligent, measured, and approaches her work with \n     integrity and energy. She is not a judicial activist. She \n     does not legislate from the bench. She does not invent the \n     law. Nothing in her opinions while on the Texas Supreme Court \n     could possibly lead to a contrary conclusion, including her \n     parental notification opinions. I suspect that Priscilla \n     Owen's nomination is being blocked because she is perceived \n     as being anti-choice on the abortion issue.\n       This perception stems, I believe, from a series of opinions \n     issued by the Texas Supreme Court in the summer of 2000 \n     interpreting the Texas statute that requires parental \n     notification prior to a minor having an abortion. The statute \n     also provides for what is called a ``judicial bypass'' to \n     parental notification. Justice Owen wrote several concurring \n     and dissenting opinions during this time. She has been \n     criticized for displaying judicial activism and pursuing an \n     anti-choice agenda in these opinions. This criticism is \n     unfair for two reasons.\n       First, the Texas statute at issue in these cases contains \n     many undefined terms. Further, the statutory text is not \n     artfully drafted. I was a member of the Texas Supreme Court's \n     Advisory Committee that drafted rules in order to help judges \n     when issuing decisions under this parental notification \n     statute. My involvement in this process made it clear to me \n     that in drafting the parental notification statute, the Texas \n     Legislature ducked the hard work of defining essential terms \n     and placed on the Texas courts a real burden to explicate \n     these terms through case law.\n       Moreover, the statute's legislative history is not useful \n     because it provides help to all sides of the debate on \n     parental notification. Several members of the Texas \n     Legislature wanted a very strict parental notification law \n     that would permit only infrequent judicial bypass of this \n     notification requirement. But several members of the Texas \n     Legislature were on the other side of the political debate. \n     These members wanted no parental notification requirement, \n     and if one were imposed, they wanted courts to have the power \n     to bypass the notification requirement easily. The resulting \n     legislation was a product of compromise with a confusing \n     legislative history.\n       In her decisions in these cases, Justice Owen asserts that \n     the Texas Legislature wanted to make a strong statement \n     supporting parental rights. She is not wrong in making these \n     assertions. There is legislative history to support her. \n     Personally, I agree with the majority in these cases. But I \n     understand Justice Owen's position and legal reasoning. It is \n     based on sound and clear principles of statutory \n     construction. Her decisions do not demonstrate judicial \n     activism. She did what good appellate judges do every day. \n     She looked at the language of the statute, the legislative \n     history, and then decided how to interpret the statute to \n     obtain what she believed to be the legislative intent.\n       If this is activism, then any judicial interpretation of a \n     statute's terms is judicial activism. Justice Owen did not \n     invent the legislative history she used to reach her \n     conclusion, just as the majority did not invent their \n     legislative history. We ask our judges to make hard decisions \n     when we give them statutes to interpret that are not well \n     drafted. We cannot fault any of these judges who take on this \n     task so long as they do this work with rigor and integrity. \n     Justice Owen did exactly this.\n       Second, we must be mindful that the decisions for which she \n     is being criticized had to do with abortion law. I do not \n     know if Justice Owen is pro-choice or not, but it does not \n     matter to me. I am pro-choice as I stated before, but I would \n     not want anyone placed on the bench who would look at \n     abortion law decisions only through the lens of being pro-\n     choice. Few categories of judicial decisions are more \n     difficult than those dealing with abortion. A judge has to \n     consider the fact that the fetus is a potential human, and \n     this potential will be ended by an abortion. All judges, \n     including those who are pro-choice, must honor the spiritual \n     beauty that is potential human life and should grieve its \n     loss. But a judge has other important human values to \n     consider in abortion cases. A judge also has to consider \n     whether a woman's independence and rights may well be \n     unconstitutionally compromised by the arbitrary application \n     of the law. All this is further compounded when a minor is \n     involved who is contemplating an abortion. I want judges who \n     will make decisions in the abortion area with a heavy heart \n     and who, therefore, will make sure of the legal reasoning \n     that supports such decisions.\n       I think the members--all the members--of the Texas Supreme \n     Court did exact1y this when they reached their decisions in \n     the parental notification cases. I was particularly struck by \n     the eloquence of Justice Owen when she discussed the harm \n     that may come to a minor from having an abortion. She \n     recognized that the abortion decision may haunt a minor for \n     all her life, and her parents should be her primary guides \n     in making this decision. Surely, those of us who are pro-\n     choice have not come to a point where we would punish a \n     judge who considers such harm as an important part of \n     making a decision on parental notification, especially \n     when legislative history supports the fact that members of \n     the Texas Legislature wanted to protect the minor from \n     this harm. As a pro-choice woman, I applaud the \n     seriousness with which Justice Owen looked at this issue.\n       If I thought Justice Owen was an agenda-driven jurist I \n     would not support her nomination. Our founders gave us a \n     great gift in our system of checks and balances. The judicial \n     branch is part of that system, and it is imperative that it \n     be respected and seen as acting without bias or predilection, \n     especially since it is not elected. Any agenda-driven \n     jurist--no matter the issue--threatens the honor accorded the \n     courts by the American people. This is not Priscilla Owen. So \n     even though I suspect Justice Owen is more conservative than \n     I am and even though I disagree with some of her rulings, \n     this does not change the reality that she is an extremely \n     well-qualified nominee who should be confirmed.\n       It would be unfair to place Priscilla Owen in the same \n     category with other nominees who, in my opinion, are judicial \n     activists and who I do not support. Some of these other \n     nominees appear to want to dismantle programs and policies \n     based on a political or economic agenda not supported by \n     legal analysis or constitutional history. They appear to want \n     to push their views on the country while sitting on the \n     bench. Priscilla Owen should not be grouped with them. \n     Justice Owen possesses exceptional qualities that have made \n     and will make her a great judge. I strongly urge her \n     confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Linda S. Eads,\n                                       Associate Professor of Law.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized under unanimous consent.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Oregon wishes \nto make a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning \nbusiness after the distinguished Senator from Vermont has completed his \nremarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Reserving the right to object, I would ask the Senator \nthrough the Chair whether he would agree Senator Lott be recognized to \nspeak after the Senator from Oregon on the same basis. He also \napparently wishes to come to the floor and speak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Would the Senator so modify his \nrequest.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I would modify my request, Mr. President, that after the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont has completed his remarks, I would \nbe next for 20 minutes, and the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Lott, \nwould come after me.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n[[Page S4618]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, could the Senate always be so agreeable in \nmoving things along, we in the country would be better off.\n  I listened to this discussion of nuclear option and judges and all \nthat. It may seem arcane. There is nothing in the Constitution that \nsays 50 votes or 40 votes or 60 votes or 80 votes. It is up to the \nrules of the Senate. It is when the rules are either reviewed or \nignored that you have a problem. As I mentioned earlier today, when \nPresident Clinton was in office, the Republicans used the rules to say \nif one Republican, one objected, then you would not have a vote on the \nnominee. 61 of President Clinton's nominees for judgeships were not \nallowed to move because one Republican objected. Actually a couple \nhundred of his executive nominations, by the same token, because one \nRepublican objected. So there they are requiring 100 votes to confirm \nsomebody.\n  So you wonder when you are talking about a tiny handful of judges--\nand no President in history, from George Washington on, has ever gotten \nall judges through the Senate--why there is so much attention on this. \nI was thinking about it and I thought, you know, this all began about 4 \nyears ago when we started talking about this. Four years ago things \nwere a lot different in this country. Let's look at the differences.\n  In the last 4 years--and maybe this is why they would rather talk \nabout judges instead of talking about what's going on--in the last 4 \nyears under President Bush, unemployment has gone up 26 percent. During \nthis same time, this last 4 years, the price of gas has gone up 57 \npercent. You can hold hands with all the Saudi princes you want, but it \nhas still gone up. The number of uninsured in this country has gone up \n10 percent. The budget deficit has gone up $50 billion. Actually, \nPresident Bush inherited the largest budget surplus of any President in \nthe history of the United States. President Clinton had followed the \nReagan and Bush administrations, which tripled the national debt and \ncreated huge deficits. President Clinton's administration not only \nbalanced the budget, but created a surplus, and started paying down the \ndebt. President Bush inherited the largest surplus of any President in \nour whole history and he has turned it into the largest deficit.\n  Then there is the trade deficit. That has gone up 69 percent. I \nmention these things that have gone up under the Bush Presidency. \nObviously they don't want to talk about it. It means the Saudis and the \nChinese, Japanese, Koreans, and others who are holding our debt thus \ninfluence our foreign policy.\n  We will not just be holding hands with Saudi princes, we will \nprobably be holding hands with everybody from all these other \ncountries, too, so they do not call our IOUs.\n  During those 4 years, unemployment has gone up by 26 percent, the \nprice of gas has gone up by 57 percent, the number of uninsured \nAmericans has gone up by 10 percent, the budget deficit has increased \nby $350 billion, and the trade deficit has gone up by 69 percent. But \nthere is one indicator that has shown improvement: the number of \njudicial vacancies has dropped 48 percent.\n  So why are they complaining they are not getting enough judges? \nDuring those 4 years of President Bush's Presidency, the number of \njudicial vacancies has gone way down because we confirmed so many \njudges. In fact, 4 years ago, the vacancy rate in our Federal courts \nwas nearly 10 percent, and now it is around 5 percent. Mr. President, \n95 percent of the Federal judiciary is filled. Most people would \nconsider 95 percent a pretty good record.\n  I remember talking with President Bush 4 years ago. I said: You might \nget 90, 95 percent of your judges through. He thought that was pretty \ngood. He wished he had a record like that when he owned a baseball \nteam.\n  Four years ago today, I went to the White House in a gesture of \ncooperation to hear the President announce his first judicial \nnominations. Some criticized me for going, but I said I wanted to help. \nThe President, during his campaign, said he wanted to be a uniter, not \na divider, and now was the time to do so, and I said I would help.\n  Unfortunately, that is not what President Bush had in mind. The \nnominations he announced that spring day 4 years ago were largely \ncontroversial, confrontational choices. Typically, when a President--\nRepublican or Democrat--selects nominations to the circuit courts, he \nconsults at length with home State Senators and the Senate leadership \nto be sure those selected will be considered favorably by the Senate. \nThis President has not done that. In fact, President Clinton, his \npredecessor, and his White House Counsel and staff were in regular \ncontact with the Republican leadership. Senator Hatch talked in his \nbook about how much President Clinton consulted with the Republicans.\n  Instead, here my Republican colleagues say: No, we do not want the \nchecks and balances of the Senate; we do not want an independent, \nnonpartisan judiciary; we are going to put a Republican stamp on the \njudiciary.\n  Remember, the Federal judiciary should not be Democratic or \nRepublican, it should be independent and free of political pressure.\n  They say: No, we cannot do that. We will break all the rules possible \nand make sure that we get rid of checks and balances.\n  This effort by the Republicans also, of course, belies what has \nhappened. Back 4 years ago in June, with the change in the Senate, I \nbecame chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Even though it was \nalready June and the Republicans had been in charge since the beginning \nof the year, there had not been a single judicial nomination hearing \nheld on President Bush's nominations. I inherited what seemed to be an \nimpossibly large number of 110 vacancies. There were so many because, \nof course, there had been pocket filibusters of over 60 of President \nClinton's nominations. But we worked hard, and in 17 months we were \nable to whittle that number down to 60 vacancies.\n  Incidentally, it is interesting that with the Republican majority, \nlook how the vacancies skyrocketed in the judiciary. The Democrats came \nin and they shot down. Now, of course, they are heading back up under \nRepublican leadership.\n  It takes a lot of work to lower the number of vacancies. I held \nhearings during recess periods and confirmed President Bush's nominees. \nSenator Daschle and I received a deadly anthrax attack, so deadly that \npeople who touched the outside of the envelopes of letters addressed to \nus that we were supposed to open were killed. They were murdered, and \nwe still held the hearings. We held hearings in the aftermath of the 9/\n11 attacks when the airlines were shut down. We had a nominee volunteer \nto drive from Mississippi to Washington to be included in a hearing I \nwas holding. We had the anthrax attacks, the PATRIOT Act, and all the \nrest, and we kept on going, and in 17 months we confirmed 100 of \nPresident Bush's judges.\n  The Republicans took nearly twice as long when they were in control \nto confirm the same number of judges for President Bush. They say we \nare the ones holding things up? They ought to be ashamed of themselves. \nMaybe they ought to work as hard as we did to get them through. In \nfact, when Congress adjourned last December, there were only 27 \nvacancies out of 875 Federal judgeships, the lowest number in over a \ngeneration. In President Bush's first term, 204 judges were confirmed--\nmore than confirmed in either of President Clinton's two terms, more \nthan during the term of the President's father, more than in Ronald \nReagan's first term when he had a Republican Senate. We confirmed a \ncouple more nominees before we broke a week ago, and the distinguished \nDemocratic leader has suggested we bring up another one of President \nBush's nominees for a vote.\n  We have seen the talking points that have come out from the \nRepublicans. They say we are holding up Thomas Griffith. The record is \nclear that I have--we have objected to him. After all, he did practice \nlaw illegally for 4 years in one jurisdiction and practiced law \nillegally in another jurisdiction, and the President wants to put him \non the second highest court in the land. We said that should be an \nimpediment. In any other administration, it would be an impediment. \nThey want to go forward with him. The record is equally clear that I do \nnot intend to support a filibuster of this nomination.\n  The distinguished Democratic leader said: Fine, bring him up. We will \ngive you a time agreement and vote on it. He will either be confirmed \nor will not\n\n[[Page S4619]]\n\nbe confirmed. If he is confirmed, it shows what the standards are of \nthis administration.\n\n  We can look at all the people turned down on the other side, but we \nnever heard this complaint. We are prepared to move forward on Mr. \nGriffith's nomination despite the fact that the Republicans pocket \nfilibustered 61 of President Clinton's nominees, even though those \nnominees included the current dean of Harvard Law School, a former \nattorney general from Iowa, a former clerk to Chief Justice Rehnquist, \nwomen, men, Hispanics, African Americans, and many others.\n  We heard talks about Judge Owen this afternoon. One of her opinions \nwas criticized by Alberto Gonzales when he served on the Texas Supreme \nCourt. However, we held a hearing for her, a very fair hearing. The \nSenator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, conducted it. It was \nacknowledged by both Republicans and Democrats as being totally fair. \nShe was voted down in the committee, and for the first time in history, \na nominee voted down in committee was resubmitted by the President.\n  This is not a time to be breaking the rules of the Senate. The rules \nare there because we want a check and balance. That is all we are \nsaying. For example, a home State newspaper of one of the nominees \nreferred to a speech she gave recently that sounded as if it came from \nan Islamic jihadist, a very activist judge, who believes that child \nlabor laws, minimum wage laws, even Social Security represent something \nwrong in this country. I am not really sure that is the sort of person \nwe want on the bench making decisions about child labor laws, Social \nSecurity, and minimum wage.\n  Let's forget this end justifies the means. Let the Senate be what it \nalways has been: A check and balance, whether it is a Democratic \nPresident or Republican President, a real check and balance but an \nhonest one.\n  Do away with anonymous holds. I said that before. Do away with the \nsecret one-person filibuster. I know the distinguished Senator from \nOregon has spoken consistently that way, I believe from the very first \nday he entered this great body. Do away with the anonymous holds. Do \naway with those things, but follow the Senate rules. Do not violate the \nrules. Do not let us, those who are supposed to judge the judges, break \nour own laws and our own rules.\n  As I have noted, 4 years ago today, on May 9, 2001, I went to the \nWhite House in a gesture of cooperation to hear the President announce \nhis first judicial nominations. Some criticized me for going, but I \nwanted to indicate my willingness to work with the new President. After \nall, during the campaign he had told the American people he wanted to \nbe a uniter, not a divider. He had lost the popular vote in a much-\ndisputed 2000 election, and the country was deeply divided. I hoped \nthat he would be a President who would understand the need to work \nacross the aisle and to bring people together and to consult with both \nDemocratic and Republican Senators. I thought that judicial \nnominations, particularly those to the important circuit courts where \nRepublicans had prevented almost two dozen of President Clinton's \nqualified and moderate nominees from being considered, would be a good \nplace to start.\n  Unfortunately, that was not what President Bush had in mind. The \nnominations that President Bush announced that spring day, years ago, \nwere largely controversial, confrontational choices. Although I was \nthen the Ranking Democratic Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nand was soon to become the Committee's Chair, the White House had not \nreached out to discuss any of these controversial nominees beforehand. \nBy and large, home-state Senators had not been consulted about the \nnominees, nor had any sort of bipartisan, independent group of \nattorneys or legal scholars. That was the President's choice and has, \nunfortunately, remained his way of identifying and selecting nominees \nto be lifetime judicial appointments to the federal bench. This White \nHouse appears to rely on a tight circle of Federalist Society members, \nRepublican Party activists and law professors steeped in ideology. This \nPresident has nominated what may be the most ideological-driven group \nof nominees ever presented to the Senate at one time.\n  Typically, when a President selects nominations to the circuit \ncourts, he consults at length with home-state Senators and the Senate \nleadership to ensure that those selected will be considered favorably \nby the Senate and confirmed. That has not been the true with this \nAdministration. By way of example, I cannot recall a single occasion \nduring which this President picked up the phone to discuss these \njudicial nominations during the entire four and a half years that he \nhas been President--not at the beginning of his Administration, not \nduring the 17 months that I chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee, and \nnot since.\n  That stands in sharp contrast to traditional practice dating back to \nGeorge Washington and, in particular, to the manner in which President \nClinton had worked with Senator Hatch when he was the Ranking Minority \nMember of the Senate Judiciary Committee or its Chair. Not only were \nPresident Clinton, his White House Counsel and his staff in regular \ncontact with Senator Hatch and his staff; with respect to the most \nimportant nominations, the President and he had direct, meaningful \nconsultation. In his book, ``Square Peg,'' for example, Senator Hatch \nwrote that he ``had several opportunities to talk privately with \nPresident Clinton about a variety of issues, especially judicial \nnominations.''\n  He described how, when the first Supreme Court vacancy arose during \nthe Clinton presidency in 1993, ``it was not a surprise when the \nPresident called to talk about the appointment and what he was thinking \nof doing.'' Senator Hatch went on to describe that the President was \nthinking of nominating someone who would require a ``tough, political \nbattle'' but that he advised President Clinton to consider other \ncandidates.\n  According to his book, Senator Hatch suggested then-D.C. Circuit \nJudge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, as well as then-First Circuit Judge Stephen \nBreyer. They were nominated to fill the vacancies that arose on the \nSupreme Court in 1993 and 1994. Both were approved by the Senate with \nstrong, bipartisan support. Justice Ginsburg was confirmed by a vote on \n96-3. Justice Breyer was confirmed by a vote of 87-9.\n\n  That sort of consultation did not occur before this President's \ninitial nominations were made 4 years ago, and I am sorry it did not.\n  Sadly, this lack of consultation was not just the situation for these \nfirst nominations, it has continued to this day. Senate Democrats have \nnot stopped trying to offer the advice called for by the Constitution \nand have never stopped being available to help in the selection \nprocess. Just a few weeks ago, on April 11, the Democratic Leader and I \nwrote to the President offering to help with the more than two dozen \ncurrent judicial vacancies for which the President has not yet sent a \nnomination to the Senate. We urged him to disavow the ``nuclear \noption'' in favor of working with us to identify consensus judicial \ncandidates who could be confirmed easily and who would be fair, \nimpartial judges that would preserve the independence of the judiciary. \nThe number of current judicial vacancies without a nominee has since \nrisen to 29. It is now May, we are more than a third of the way through \nthe year, and the President has still sent only one new judicial \nnomination to the Senate all year. Meanwhile almost a month has passed \nand Senator Reid and I have yet to receive the courtesy of a reply to \nour offer to help and to work together. Unilateralism has become their \nstandard operating practice, and abuse of power has become increasingly \ncommon. Indeed, to this day I have yet to meet, talk to or even receive \na telephone call from the President's new White House Counsel. The go-\nit-alone conduct of this Administration makes clear that this President \nhas little use of the Senate's role in the constitutional process of \nselecting federal judges.\n  Under pressure from the White House, over the last 2 years, the \nformer Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee led Senate \nRepublicans in breaking with longstanding precedent and Senate \ntradition. With the Senate and the White House under control of the \nsame political party we have witnessed Committee rule after Committee \nrule broken or misinterpreted away. The Framers of the Constitution\n\n[[Page S4620]]\n\nwarned against the dangers of such factionalism, undermining the \nstructural separation of powers. Republicans in the Senate have utterly \nfailed to defend this institution's role as a check on the President in \nthe area of nominations. It surely weakens our constitutional design of \nchecks and balances.\n  As I have detailed elsewhere, the list of broken rules and precedents \nis long--from the way that home-state Senators were treated, to the way \nhearings were scheduled, to the way the Committee questionnaire was \nunilaterally altered, to the way the Judiciary Committee's historic \nprotection of the minority by Committee Rule IV was repeatedly \nviolated. In the last Congress, the Republican majority of the \nJudiciary Committee destroyed virtually every custom and courtesy that \nhad been used throughout Senate history to help create and enforce \ncooperation and civility in the confirmation process.\n  We suffered through 3 years during which Republican staff stole \nDemocratic files off the Judiciary computers during what has been a \n``by any means necessary'' approach. Their approach to our rules and \nprecedents follows their own partisan version of the Golden Rule, which \nis that ``he with the gold, rules.'' That has not been helpful to the \nprocess, the Senate or the country. It is as if those currently in \npower believe that that they are above our constitutional checks and \nbalances and that they can reinterpret any treaty, law, rule, custom or \npractice they do not like or they find inconvenient.\n  Some of these interpretations are so contrary to well-established \nunderstandings that it is like we have fallen down the rabbit hole in \n``Alice in Wonderland.'' I am reminded that the imperious Queen of \nHearts rebuked Alice for having insufficient imagination to believe \ncontradictory things, saying that some days she had believed six \nimpossible things before breakfast. I have seen things I thought \nimpossible on the Judiciary Committee during the last few years, things \nimpossible to square with the past practices of Committee and the \nhistory of the Senate. Our Committee is entrusted by the Senate to help \ndetermine whether judicial nominees will follow the law. It is \nunfortunate that the Committee that judges the judges has not followed \nits own rules but has bent or broken them to achieve a predetermined \nresult.\n  Under our Constitution, the Senate has an important role in the \nselection of our judiciary. The brilliant design of our Founders \nestablished that the first two branches of government would work \ntogether to equip the third branch to serve as an independent arbiter \nof justice. As columnist George Will once wrote:\n\n       A proper constitution distributes power among legislative, \n     executive and judicial institutions so that the will of the \n     majority can be measured, expressed in policy and, for the \n     protection of minorities, somewhat limited.\n\n  The structure of our Constitution and our own Senate rules of self-\ngovernance are designed to protect minority rights and to encourage \nconsensus. Despite the razor-thin margin of recent elections, the \nmajority party is not acting in a measured way but in complete \ndisregard for the traditions of bipartisanship that are the hallmark of \nthe Senate. It has acted to ignore precedents and reinterpret \nlongstanding rules to its advantage. This practice of might makes right \nis wrong.\n  Now the White House's hand-picked majority leader seems intent on \nremoving the one Senate protection left for the minority, the \nprotection of debate in accordance with the longstanding tradition of \nthe Senate and its Standing Rules. In order to remove the last \nremaining vestige of protection for the minority, the Republican \nmajority is poised to break the Senate Rules and end the filibuster \nwith the votes of the barest of majorities. They seem intent on doing \nthis to force through the Senate this President's most controversial \nand divisive judicial nominees.\n\n  As the Reverend Martin Luther King wrote in his famous Letter from a \nBirmingham Jail: ``Let us consider a more concrete example of just and \nunjust laws. An unjust law is a code that a numerical or power majority \ngroup compels a minority group to obey but does not make binding on \nitself. This is difference made legal. By the same token, a just law is \na code that a majority compels a minority to follow and that it is \nwilling to follow itself. This is sameness made legal.'' Fair process \nis a fundamental component of the American system of law. If we cannot \nhave a fair process in these halls or in our courts, how will the \nresulting decisions be viewed? If the rule of law is to mean anything \nit must mean that it applies to all equally.\n  In the last Congress, I am sorry to report that the rule of law was \nbroken, spindled and mutilated to serve the interests of President \nGeorge W. Bush and his party. No man and no party should be above the \nlaw. That has been one of the strengths of our democracy. Our country \nwas born in reaction to the autocracy and corruption of King George, \nand we must not forget our roots as a nation of both law and liberty. \nThe best guarantee of liberty is the rule of law, meaning that the \ndecisions of government are not arbitrary and that rules are not \ndiscretionary or enforced to help one side and then ignored to aid \nanother. James Madison, one of the Framers of our Constitution, warned \nin Federalist Number 47 of the very danger that is threatening our \ngreat nation, a threat to our freedoms from within:\n\n       [The] accumulation of all powers legislative, executive and \n     judiciary in the same hands . . . may justly be pronounced \n     the very definition of tyranny.\n\n  Our freedoms as Americans are the fruit of too much sacrifice to have \nthe rules broken in the United States Senate by a party colluding with \nthe White House to try to appoint loyalists to courts who have been \nchosen with the hope that they will re-interpret precedents and \noverturn the very laws that have protected our most fundamental rights \nas Americans. The American people deserve better than we have seen with \nthe destruction of rule after rule by a majority willing to sacrifice \nthe role of the Senate as a check and balance in order to aid a \nPresident determined to pack the federal courts.\n  How does the record of judicial confirmations for President George W. \nBush compare to administrations before his? Very well. In President \nBush's first term, the 204 judges confirmed were more than were \nconfirmed in either of President Clinton two terms, more than during \nthe term of this President's father, and more than in Ronald Reagan's \nfirst term when he was being assisted by a Republican majority in the \nSenate. With the four judges confirmed so far this year, the total \nnumber of confirmations of this President's judicial nominees has risen \nto 208. It would rise further and faster yet, if the White House would \nonly work with us to identify qualified, consensus nominees for the 29 \ncurrent vacancies without a nominee. The President has sent only one \nnew nominee to the Senate so far this year, and it is already May. If \nthe President wanted to pick judges instead of fights, he could work \nwith us rather than divide us.\n  And what happened to those 11 nominees the President started us off \nwith 4 years ago? Considering the strong ideological bent of this \ngroup, the President has been quite successful. One has been withdrawn \nfrom consideration and 8 of the remaining 10 have been confirmed, 80 \npercent. The confirmations of Clinton circuit court nominees during his \nsecond term, from 1997-2000, while a Republican Senate majority was in \ncontrol, were nowhere near as successful. Over those 4 years 35 of 51 \nCircuit Court nominees were confirmed, 69 percent.\n  If we looked at 1999 and 2000, the 106th Congress, the numbers are \neven worse. Fewer than half of the President's circuit court nominees \nwere confirmed, 15 of 34. Outstanding and qualified nominees were never \nallowed a hearing, a committee vote or Senate consideration of any \nkind. These nominees include the current dean of the Harvard Law \nSchool, a former attorney general from Iowa, a former clerk to Chief \nJustice Rehnquist and many others--women, men, Hispanics, African \nAmericans, a wide variety of qualified nominees.\n  So on this anniversary, let us understand that 8 of the 10 nominees \nwe will hear complaints about have been confirmed.\n  With respect to the remaining two, I should note that in the years \nthat Republicans held the Senate majority and Senator Hatch was the \ncommittee chair, Judge Terry Boyle was one of\n\n[[Page S4621]]\n\nthe very few nominees he chose not to consider. Thus, Judge Boyle is \nstill before the Judiciary Committee. Senator Specter held a hearing on \nthat controversial nomination and the committee is still receiving \ncopies of Judge Boyle's unpublished opinions for its review.\n  The remaining nominee is one whose opinions were criticized by \nAlberto Gonzales when he served on the Texas Supreme Court with her. \nIndeed, many of her positions were too conservative and activist for \nher conservative Republican colleagues on the Texas Supreme Court. When \nI chaired the committee in 2002, in another gesture of good will, I \nproceeded on a number of controversial nominations in spite of the \nrecent mistreatment of President Clinton's nominees. One of those \nhearings was for Priscilla Owen.\n  I was not required to schedule that hearing. I could have followed \nthe example of my immediate predecessor and denied her consideration \nbefore the committee. It would have been a much easier path than the \nalternative I chose. Instead, I proceeded. Senator Feinstein conducted \nthe hearing in a fair manner. After the hearing, I then did something \nelse that my predecessor as Chair so often did not: I proceeded to have \nthe committee consider the nomination on its merits even though I knew \nI would not support it. The committee debated the nomination fairly and \nopenly. Objections to her confirmation, based on her record as a \nJustice on the Texas Supreme Court, were aired and honestly debated. A \nvote was taken and instead of hiding behind anonymous holds or hidden \nblue slips, Senators put themselves on the record. The result was that \nthe Owen nomination was rejected by a majority of the committee and not \nrecommended to the Senate.\n\n  Since that time much of what has happened has been unprecedented. \nDespite the rejection of the nomination by the committee, the President \nresubmitted the nomination the next year. I do not believe that had \never been done before in our history. Then, on a party-line vote, \nRepublicans forced the nomination to the floor. It was debated \nextensively and the Senate withheld its consent. After a series of \ncloture votes, cloture was not agreed upon in accordance with the rules \nof the Senate. Nonetheless, the President took further unprecedented \naction in, again, resubmitting the nomination to the Senate. That \nnomination is now pending, again, on the Senate Executive Calendar.\n  By any measure the President's first nominees were treated fairly. \nJudge Parker, Judge Shedd, Judge Clement, Judge Cook, Judge Sutton, \nJudge McConnell, Judge Gregory and Judge Roberts are each serving \nlifetime appointments on important circuit courts. The first slate of \nnominees has now all been accorded hearings. All but Judge Boyle have \nbeen considered by the Judiciary Committee. All but one of those has \nbeen confirmed.\n  This is no basis on which to break the rules of the Senate. This is \nnot justification to end the Senate's role as a check and balance on \nthe Executive. This is not reason for the majority to take the drastic \nand irreversible step of ending protection of the minority through the \ntradition of extended debate in the Senate.\n  The White House and the Senate Republican leadership's campaign for \n``nuclear option'' seeks to end the role of the Senate serving as a \ncheck on the Executive. But that is precisely what the Constitution \nintends the Senate to provide. Supporters of an all-powerful Executive \nhave gone so far as to seek to inject an unconstitutional religious \ntest into the debate and to characterize those who oppose the most \nextreme of the President's nominees as ``against people of faith'' and \nto call for mass impeachments of judges and other measures to \nintimidate the judiciary. Our independent judiciary is an essential \ncheck on the political branches.\n  Pat Robertson says that he believes that federal judges are ``a more \nserious threat to America than Al Qaeda and the September 11 \nterrorists'' and ``more serious than a few bearded terrorists who fly \ninto buildings'' and ``the worst threat America has faced in 400 \nyears--worse than Nazi Germany, Japan and the Civil War.'' This is the \nsort of incendiary rhetoric that is paving the way to the ``nuclear \noption.'' It is wrong, it is destructive and it is short-sighted.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist is right to refer to the federal judiciary as \nthe crown jewel of our system of government. It is an essential check \nand balance, a critical source of protection of the rights of all \nAmericans, including our religious freedoms. In ``A Man For All \nSeasons'' Sir Thomas More speaks about the rule of law and the need for \nits protections. When his family confronts him and demands that he \nbreak the law to get at the Devil, he replies:\n\n       What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get \n     after the Devil? . . . And when the last law was down, and \n     the Devil turned 'round on you, where would you hide, Roper, \n     the laws all being flat?\n       This country is planted thick with laws, from coast to \n     coast, Man's laws, not God's! And if you cut them down . . . \n     do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that \n     would blow then?\n       Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's \n     sake!\n\n  Our Federal judges are not the Devil and are not in the service of \nthe Devil. Democratic Senators are not the Devil and are seeking to \nuphold the Senate as a check on the most extreme actions of the \nExecutive. I pray that Republican Senators will think about that and \nreflect on the protections that our constitutional checks and balances \nprovide. I trust that they will honor the protections of the minority \nthat make this institution what it is. I hope that they will show the \ncourage to protect the Senate and the minority that the senior Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania spoke about in his important statement a few weeks \nago.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as the Senate resumes debating the nuclear \noption for resolving the debate about judges, I would like to ask that \nthe Senate pursue a conventional option, the disappearing art of \nbipartisanship. Rather than calling for breaking out the nuclear \nweapons, I believe the Senate should call for breaking out some \nbipartisanship, and I want to give an example this afternoon of what \nthe possibilities could be for real bipartisanship in this area of \njudicial nominations.\n  When President Clinton was elected, even though I was a Member of the \nHouse, I was the senior Democrat in my State. So I was faced with the \nchallenge then as a Member of the other body of working with two \nSenators with close to 60 years of experience in the Senate--Mark \nHatfield and Bob Packwood. Both of them were extremely gracious in \ntheir efforts to work with me.\n  I created a formal judicial selection committee. I gave Senators \nHatfield and Packwood representation on that committee. We worked \ntogether in a bipartisan way and my first selection was confirmed \nwithout controversy.\n  I continued that bipartisan selection committee when I was elected to \nserve in the Senate. Three of my recommendations are now serving on the \nFederal bench thanks, in great measure, to the bipartisan cooperation \nof my friend and colleague Senator Gordon Smith.\n  After President Bush was elected in 2000, Senator Smith retained a \nsimilar bipartisan judicial selection process, and I was pleased to be \nable to assist him and the Bush administration in moving their nominee \nthrough the process.\n  Now our bipartisanship has been put to the test. In fact, twice, both \nwith respect to myself and with respect to Senator Smith, we had \nnominees who proved to be controversial to some Senators. In each case, \nthe Senator in the minority party upheld his commitments and shepherded \nthese individuals through the Senate. Doing tough bipartisan work at \nthe front end of the judicial selection process, neither Senator Smith \nnor I were pulled into a partisan squabble later on as the process went \nforward.\n  This is precisely the sort of bipartisan cooperation that is now \nmissing between the White House and the Senate, and what is needed is \nmore bipartisan conventional options for resolving this judicial debate \nand fewer nuclear threats.\n  It seems to me, going nuclear will change the Senate in a very \ndramatic way. I think it will make it harder, for example, to have \nbreakthroughs in health care such as Senator Hatch helped me achieve \nwhen we passed the Health Care That Works for All Americans law. I \nthink it is going to make it\n\n[[Page S4622]]\n\nharder to have a bipartisan breakthrough to producing a new energy \npolicy. If ever there was a red, white and blue issue for our country, \nit is getting a new bipartisan energy policy that would shake us free \nof our dependence on foreign oil.\n  As I held open community meetings last week at home in Pendleton, \nIrrigon, Monroe, Fossil, Tillamook, and throughout my home State, there \nwere no rallies and citizens calling for the use of a nuclear option. \nThere were an awful lot of people asking: What are you going to do \nabout health care costs that are going through the stratosphere? And I \ntalked to them about the efforts that I and Senator Hatch have put in \nplace.\n  They wanted to know about what is going to be done to deal with \ncrumbling roads. I see our friend from Oklahoma who would like to pull \ntogether a bipartisan bill to deal with our country's infrastructure.\n  So folks were talking about health care, creating jobs and a fresh \nenergy policy. They know the only way the Senate is going to achieve \nany of that is through bipartisanship.\n  I also see the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, my \nfriend Senator Specter. Today the Senate has a choice. Tomorrow or the \nnext day there may not be a choice. I hope my colleagues will choose \nthe conventional option we have been using in Oregon that Senator \nHatfield and Senator Packwood assisted me with and that Senator Gordon \nSmith has assisted me with. I hope we will choose what I call the \nOregon conventional option and seek a renewed bipartisan commitment to \nresolving this matter.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Mississippi is to be recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have been in the cloakroom waiting for the opportunity to \nspeak on the highway bill and to speak on behalf of the commerce safety \nportion of that highway bill. Are we now going to turn to the highway \nlegislation?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are on the highway legislation. \nWe were under a unanimous consent request, with the Senator recognized \nto speak next.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased this afternoon to talk about \ntitle VII of this very important Surface Transportation Improvement Act \nof 2005. I remind my colleagues that the highway and transportation \nlegislation, TEA-21, that we passed back in 1998, effectively expired \nSeptember of 2003--not 2004 but 2003. We are now on the sixth extension \nof this very important legislation. This week we need to complete \naction on this very important bill.\n  It is about building decent highways and bridges and transit \nauthorities, but it is about more than that. If we do not have decent \ninfrastructure, if we do not have decent highways and bridges, if we do \nnot have transit capability, if we do not have border roads, we are not \ngoing to have economic development. Most importantly, and that is why I \nam here as the chairman of the Surface Transportation and Merchant \nMaritime Subcommittee, safety provisions are not improved and extended. \nWe should care an awful lot about this.\n  The safety portion of the legislation was reported out of the \nCommerce Committee, with the support of Chairman Ted Stevens and the \nranking Democrat, who is referred to in our committee as cochairman, \nSenator Inouye. It is bipartisan, and I believe it is very strong \nlegislation.\n  I care about the safety portion of it, and maybe I care about the \nsafety provisions more than some people because I have had a family \ntragedy myself that has affected my thinking on this. My father was \nkilled in an automobile accident, without a seatbelt, involving \nalcohol, on a narrow, two-lane, hilly road. This section of this \nlegislation would affect all of that. It would give additional \nincentives for States to do more to stop driving while under the \ninfluence of alcohol. It would give incentives for people to use \nseatbelts. It would improve our roads and bridges and widen our roads. \nSo this is personal with me, and I care an awful lot about it.\n  Before I get to that section of the legislation, I want to talk about \nthe broader perspective. When we look at history and at infrastructure \nand the ancient Roman Empire, many would say it was their advanced \ninfrastructure and efficient highways that allowed them to build the \nempire that they had. That highway system was critical to the expansion \nand protection of their empire. It allowed rapid troop movement. It \nfacilitated trade. It enabled ease of movement for diplomats and \ncouriers. It provided rapid expansion of the Roman sphere of influence. \nIt afforded military protection from invaders and facilitated \ncommunication between distant parts of the empire.\n  We do not want to replicate everything we saw in the Roman Empire, \nbut it also is interesting to note that that empire eventually went \naway, and some people say it was partially attributable to the fact \nthat they quit building the infrastructure; they let the country start \ndecaying and the infrastructure go into disrepair. I think that is what \nwe are beginning to experience in America.\n  One of the reasons why we have been able to continue to grow, do \nwell, and move around this country is because of our infrastructure: \nhighways, bridges, railroads and ports and harbors. The whole package \nis critical. It is what enables America to have our great system. \nWhether people are from Maine, Mississippi, California, Virginia, \nFlorida or Washington, we have access to virtually all the same \nproducts, and it is because of our infrastructure.\n  On September 11 and in the days immediately following, we saw that \nour highways were absolutely critical to movement of goods and our \npeople and that we need to have a balanced and complete infrastructure \npackage. So it is time that we act. Our interstate system in America is \n50 years old. States have been doing their part, but a lot of the \nStates are struggling with their budgets and a lot of the highway \ndepartments have been living on these extensions. So we have lost an \nopportunity. We have lost ground.\n  Thirty-two percent of our major roads are in poor or mediocre \ncondition, almost a third. Almost 30 percent of our Nation's bridges \nare structurally deficient and obsolete. Quite frankly, I am afraid \nwhere we are headed. If we do not do something about this, there will \nbe a loss of the jobs that would have been generated, and it would \ncontribute to the slowing down of our economy.\n  TEA-21 did an awful lot for our country, but it is time that we move \nto the next step. The U.S. Department of Transportation has said that \nfor every $1 billion in Federal transportation infrastructure \ninvestment, 47,500 jobs would be created. So just think about that when \nlooking at what is involved in this bill. We are talking about many \nthousands of jobs being created. We need to have this 5-year extension. \nIn the general sense, I urge my colleagues to work together in a \nbipartisan way and work with the administration to get this legislation \ncompleted before this next extension expires.\n\n  The portion of the bill that I am directly responsible for is from \nthe Commerce Committee, and it is the safety provisions that would be \nin the reauthorization. I will describe what is in this Safety \nImprovement Act of 2005. It is a comprehensive reauthorization of many \nof the Department of Transportation safety programs that we passed in \n1998. It includes trucking and bus safety, highway and vehicle safety \nand hazardous material safety. The bill also includes provisions to \nprotect consumers from fraud in the moving industry and to reauthorize \nthe boat safety and sport fishing programs. It is designed to improve \nthe safety of all of our constituents and its enactment will save lives \nand reduce injuries.\n  Just last month, the Department of Transportation released \npreliminary traffic fatality data for 2004. The good news is the \nfatality rate on our highways is down slightly, but that data still \nshows there is much to be done. The programs authorized in this bill \nare authorized to do that.\n  Through the leadership of Chairman Stevens, we have met with all of \nthe interested parties in business, labor, safety advocates, as well as \nState representatives. We made sure everybody had some input in the \ndrafting of this legislation.\n\n[[Page S4623]]\n\n  We still have to make note of the almost 18,000, or 56 percent, of \nthe people who died last year in highway accidents were not wearing a \nseatbelt. The quickest and most effective way of increasing safety is \nto get people to wear their seatbelts. So we have included a program to \ngive States incentive grants to pass primary seatbelt enforcement laws. \nSome people would like to turn this around and say if States do not \npass the seatbelt acts, we are going to take money away from them. That \nsort of approach has been tried in the past. It did not work, and it \nwill not work now.\n  I believe in States such as mine, with an incentive to pass these \nprimary seatbelt laws, there is a good chance we would comply. But if \nwe are told we are going to be punished if we do not, the odds are we \nwill not. So we have drafted this in a way that I believe every State \nwill strive to have significant increases in their safety numbers and a \ndecline in the fatalities on their highways. So we will be supporting \nthis provision in our part of the highway bill.\n  The data also shows that alcohol is a factor in almost 40 percent of \nall crashes. Funds are included for States to enforce drunk driving \nlaws and include incentives to toughen their laws. These safety \nprograms should have been authorized almost 2 years ago, but due to \ndisputes we have not been able to improve our safety provisions, \nimprove our safety incentives, and therefore some of the culpability \nfor the amount and severity of accidents and the deaths should be \nplaced at our doorsteps. We need to work with the States to ensure \nthese programs make sense and they are carried out effectively. We \nshould have funding levels that reflect the commitment that we are \nmaking to highways and to safety on our highways.\n\n  I hope the Senate will pass this legislation this week and that \nCongress will pass the final conference report this month so the States \ndo not miss the summer's construction season.\n  I again thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for working \nwith us to develop the safety provisions that will be included in the \nsubstitute package I believe the chairman will offer.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we are overdue getting on the highway \nbill. We are preparing right now to offer a substitute amendment. We \nare prepared to do that, but Senator Specter had said he wanted to \nspeak for a period of time as in morning business. He has been planning \nto do that, and I will yield 15 minutes to him for that purpose.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, will the chairman yield? Mr. Chairman, we \nare ready. We are open to do business. There have been a great many \ndiscussions about the highway title. We have people ready to take those \namendments who are ready to discuss those with our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle to see which ones we can accept. Is it my \nunderstanding that we only have 3\\1/2\\ days to complete work on this \nvery complex bill that covers not only the EPW section but commerce, \nfinance, and the other sections? Is that correct?\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is my understanding. You remained here with me all \nlast week inviting Members to bring their amendments down. We said we \nwould be getting close. Who knows, we may even get a cloture vote, and \nthen at the last minute hysteria will set in. Now is the time to bring \nthem down and consider them.\n  Let me comment on the great work the chairman of the transportation \nsubcommittee, Senator Bond, has done. We need to get to it now. This is \nprobably very likely the most important single bill of this session.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the chairman. I hope we can get on with it while \nour colleague is speaking. I hope other Members and staff will come to \nthe floor and share their amendments and begin the discussion that is \ngoing to have to move very quickly if we are to finish this bill this \nweek and stay on schedule to try to avoid another extension.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Pennsylvania is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for the recognition, \nbut 15 minutes--if I could have the attention of the chairman of the \ncommittee, my colleague, Senator Inhofe? Fifteen minutes is \ninsufficient. I had been seeking time since last week and had been \nassured by the floor staff that I could have 45 minutes starting at \n3:10.\n  I understand the importance of the highway bill. I am here to talk \nabout the constitutional or nuclear option in my capacity as chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee. I know the highway bill is important, and I \nhave been pressing to bring it up, but the matter I wanted to speak on \nis perhaps of greater importance.\n  I had asked for 45 minutes and thought I might do it in 25, but it \nwas reduced in a negotiating session with Senator Inhofe to 15, and I \ncannot do it in 15. So I will be back another time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in a few minutes it is our intention to \nbring up the substitute amendment, to have the pending amendment \nwithdrawn and bring up the substitute amendment. We are not quite ready \nfor that. We are waiting for a few things to be done in a few minutes. \nI think it will be worked out, but the managers' amendment is going to \ndo a lot of things to offset some of the problems people had with the \nbill. When that time comes, we want a chance to go over it in detail \nand make this a reality.\n  The amendment is going to bring the total size of the bill up to $251 \nbillion. This includes $199 billion for highways, $5.8 billion for \nhighway safety, and $46.6 billion for mass transit. This amendment \nwould add $6.8 billion in additional receipts to the highway account of \nthe highway trust fund, all of which are offset in the amendment--also, \nthanks to the good work of Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus of the \nFinance Committee. They have made a yeoman effort and have been able to \nhave us increase this highway funding and have it paid for.\n  Highway funding would increase by $8.9 billion over the EPW-reported \nbill. That is the bill that came out of our committee. It includes a \n5.1-percent increase in both apportioned and allocated programs. It \nalso increases the minimum rate of return to donor States to 91 percent \nimmediately. Right now, as you know, it is 90.5 percent. It would raise \nit to 91 percent in 2006 through 2008. This increases the growth \nceilings so more States get to 92 percent more quickly.\n  In other words, we are to go to 91 percent immediately, and in 2006, \nand then eventually all States will be at 92 percent in this period of \ntime.\n  The donee States, the ones that are actually getting back an amount \nthat is in excess of the amount that is paid in, they would have a \nguaranteed minimum growth rate being increased from 10 percent to 15 \npercent every year. The average growth rate increases from just under \n25 percent to almost 31 percent.\n  The amendment also includes firewalls to ensure the highway trust \nfund dollars are spent on this Nation's transportation needs. There has \nbeen a problem over a long period of time. People have been very \noffended by the fact that these trust funds have been raided and \nsomehow these moneys are diverted to other causes. Senator Bond and I, \nand I think the vast majority, and certainly 76 percent of this Senate, \nagree that we should have firewalls; we should protect that money and \nmake sure it goes to highway spending.\n  Finally, the mass transit funding increased by $2.3 billion to $46.6 \nbillion. This represents a dramatic increase in the transit share of \nthe bill from 18.18 percent under TEA-21--that is what it was when we \npassed it 7 years ago--to 18.48 percent. The safety programs have \nincreased, which Senator Lott has talked about in the purview of his \ncommittee. They have increased their funding over levels in S. 1072, \nlast year's bill, which was funded at $318 billion.\n  Last year, during consideration of the $318 billion Transportation \nbill, the Senate voted 76 to 21 in favor of funding the highway bill at \n$255 billion, in mass transit at $56 billion. This vote should be even \nmore of a resounding victory for adequate funding levels for \ntransportation, especially considering this bill is funded at a lower \nlevel.\n\n[[Page S4624]]\n\n  I remind my colleagues of the vote on the Talent amendment to this \nbudget resolution which received over 80 votes from Senators who voted \nto support it.\n  This amendment gave flexibility to increase the funding for the bill \nas long as it was offset, which is exactly what Senators Grassley and \nBaucus have done in their portion of this amendment.\n  This is the amendment we do want to bring up. We are not quite ready \nto seek unanimous consent to bring it up.\n  I ask Senator Bond, the subcommittee chairman, if he seeks \nrecognition now. Let me have him recognized. If he wants to yield to \nSenator Inouye, he can do that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I was going to do what the chairman of the \nfull committee said, but I see our friend from Hawaii is here. We have \nalready had a discussion of the commerce title. I am happy to defer to \nmy colleague from Hawaii.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking Surface \nTransportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee Chairman Trent Lott and \nCommerce Committee Chairman Ted Stevens for their efforts to develop a \nconsensus, bipartisan bill to reauthorize highway safety and boating \nsafety programs under the Commerce Committee's jurisdiction.\n  Together, with the help of other members of our committee, including \nSenators Mark Pryor, Jay Rockefeller, Conrad Burns, Byron Dorgan, Frank \nLautenberg, and Barbara Boxer, we have crafted legislation that \nadvances the safety of all motorists on our Nation's highways.\n  Our committee considered the Surface Transportation Safety \nImprovement Act of 2005 on April 14 and reported this measure without \namendment.\n  Our national highway transportation network is a tremendous national \nasset and a first-class system. It allows us the freedom to travel and \nfosters economic growth. The benefits of mobility that our highways \nprovide, however, come with a staggering cost of injury, property \ndestruction, and death.\n  Recent safety trends indicate that the dangers of operating a vehicle \non this network are still disturbingly high. According to the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration, highway fatalities and injuries \nincreased from 42,643 in 2003 to 42,800 in 2004. Large truck crash \nfatalities increased by 3.7 percent from 4,986 in 2003 to 5,169 in \n2004.\n  To put these numbers in context, the United States suffered more than \n58,000 casualities during the entire Vietnam War. We are now losing \nnearly 43,000 Americans on our highways every year.\n  As we consider ways to improve the infrastructure and operation of \nour highways, we must do more to increase the safety of cars and \ntrucks, and their drivers.\n  The Commerce Committee's section of H.R. 3 incorporates many of the \nadministration's recommendations, and those of safety advocates, \nregarding auto and truck safety, as well as the safety of hazardous \nmaterials transportation. The bill also strengthens consumer \nprotections for those who entrust their belongings to a moving company, \nand provides more robust, predictable funding for boating safety and \nsport fish restoration programs.\n  We have been at loggerheads with the administration over the funding \nlevels needed to improve our transportation system for more than a \nyear. I am hopeful that these disagreements can be resolved so that we \nmay finalize this important safety bill this session. I support more \nresources for all of our surface transportation programs and believe \nthat we should seek funding closer to the levels that a majority of \nthis chamber supported last year.\n  If we do provide additional funding, a pro-rata share should be \nallocated to our Nation's transportation safety programs.\n  The Commerce Committee's titles of the highway bill have received \nbroad support by incorporating many initiatives proposed by the \nadministration, industry, and safety advocates. However, we are always \nsearching for ways to improve the bill and to reduce the risk of death \nand injuries on our Nation's highways.\n  I encourage those who might have amendments to offer to the Commerce \nCommittee's titles to come forward so that we may work to incorporate \nthese requests, to the extent possible.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to support the significant safety \nprovisions contained within our section. The safety of the traveling \npublic depends on it.\n  Mr. President, I request unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a document which summarizes each of the bill's key provisions.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Summary of Commerce Committee Titles\n\n\n                     Title 1--Motor Carrier Safety\n\n       Title 1 of our bill focuses on truck and bus safety. The \n     Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) is the \n     federal agency responsible for truck safety through strong \n     enforcement of safety regulations, targeting high-risk motor \n     carriers and commercial motor vehicle drivers. While much \n     progress has been made in motor carrier safety, accidents \n     involving large trucks remain a significant safety and \n     economic concern. To improve truck safety, our bill:\n       Reauthorizes the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program \n     (MCSAP) for the years 2006 through 2009 at an average annual \n     funding level of $200 million, more than double the \n     Transportation Equity Act (TEA 21) level, and consistent with \n     the Administration's proposal. Grants from this program are \n     distributed via formula to states to enforce motor carrier \n     safety rules and regulations.\n       Provides $20 million to modernize the Commercial Driver's \n     License Information System (CDLIS). This system is the \n     primary method for tracking the safety and qualification of \n     truck and bus drivers. The funding will be used to modernize \n     an outdated computer system and will help efforts to prevent \n     truckers from holding multiple driver's licenses.\n       Updates the medical program for commercial drivers in the \n     wake of several high-profile truck accidents that raised \n     concerns about the current process. The bill establishes a \n     Medical Review Board to recommend standards for the physical \n     examinations of commercial drivers and a registry for \n     qualified medical examiners. Medical examiners who perform \n     the exams are required to receive training to be listed on \n     the registry.\n       Replaces the current Single State Registration System \n     (SSRS) with a new system that requires truckers to register \n     in only one state, while preserving state revenues collected \n     through the current system.\n       Improves the maintenance and safety of intermodal chassis. \n     For many years, there has been a dispute about who should be \n     responsible for the safety of truck trailers, known as \n     intermodal chassis, that are owned by railroad and steamship \n     companies, but are hauled by truckers. The bill contains \n     provisions, agreed to by the trucking, railroad, and \n     steamship companies, that delineates responsibility for \n     safety among the various parties.\n       Requires the FMCSA to provide outreach and training to \n     ensure that states are properly enforcing operating authority \n     requirements for foreign commercial vehicles. It also \n     requires a study of whether current or future Canadian and \n     Mexican truck fleets that operate or are expected to operate \n     in the United States meet U.S. truck safety standards.\n\n\n                 TITLE II--HIGHWAY AND VEHICULAR SAFETY\n\n       This title reauthorizes highway safety programs designed to \n     reduce deaths and injuries resulting from motor vehicle \n     crashes. These programs are administered by the National \n     Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which was \n     established by the Highway Safety Act of 1970. To improve \n     highway safety, our bill:\n       Provides $700 million a year in grants to states to \n     increase seat belt use and reduce drunk driving. Grants are \n     awarded to states that enact primary seat belt laws and enact \n     specific strategies to combat drunk driving.\n       Provides $24 million a year for national advertising \n     campaigns to increase seat belt use known as the ``Click-It-\n     Or-Ticket'' campaign, and to reduce drunk driving. These \n     advertising campaigns purchased at the national level are \n     complimented by states coordinating police enforcement at the \n     local level.\n       Provides substantial funding for NHTSA to conduct research \n     on reducing traffic deaths and injuries. States rely on this \n     research to target safety strategies in the most cost-\n     effective way.\n       Requires NHTSA to issue a rule by 2009 that requires \n     automobiles sold in the United States to have new stability \n     control technologies that reduce the likelihood of rollover \n     crashes, better door locks to reduce the likelihood of \n     passenger ejection in a rollover crash, and stronger roofs to \n     protect occupants in a rollover crash.\n       Requires NHTSA to issue a rule by 2008 that sets new safety \n     standards for automobiles sold in the United States to better \n     protect occupants in a side-impact crash.\n       Requires window stickers on new cars to display safety \n     ``star'' ratings in a similar manner that gas mileage is \n     displayed on window stickers.\n\n\n          TITLE III--HAZARDOUS MATERIALS TRANSPORTATION SAFETY\n\n       Title III of our bill is designed to improve the safety and \n     security of the transportation\n\n[[Page S4625]]\n\n     of hazardous materials. The hazardous materials (HAZMAT) \n     transportation safety programs, now administered by the \n     Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration \n     (PHMSA), have gone unauthorized since 1998. In 2004, there \n     were 14,515 HAZMAT incidents, resulting in 8 deaths and 206 \n     injuries and in the aftermath of recent HAZMAT accidents in \n     South Carolina and heightened security concerns in this new \n     era of global terrorism, reauthorization of these programs is \n     a Committee priority. Title III:\n       Reauthorizes the Department of Transportation's (DOT) \n     HAZMAT safety programs at $25 million in FY 2005, $29 million \n     in FY 2006, and $30 million for each fiscal year from FY \n     2007-2009.\n       Provides $21,800,000 annually for community HAZMAT planning \n     and training grants and allows states flexibility to use some \n     of their planning money for training programs as needed. \n     Additionally, the bill provides $4 million annually for \n     HAZMAT ``train the trainer'' grants, and allows these funds \n     to be used to train HAZMAT employees directly.\n       Requires Mexican and Canadian commercial motor vehicle \n     operators transporting HAZMAT in the U.S. to undergo a \n     background check similar to those for U.S. HAZMAT drivers. \n     Additionally, the bill improves current HAZMAT background \n     check procedures and requires a study on background check \n     capacity.\n       Increases civil penalties to up to $100,000 for HAZMAT \n     violations that result in severe injury or death and raises \n     the minimum penalties for violations related to training.\n       Authorizes $5 million for FY 2005-2009 for the Operation \n     Respond Emergency Information System to improve the real time \n     delivery of information about HAZMAT in transportation to \n     first responders.\n       Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to establish a \n     program of random inspections to determine the extent to \n     which undeclared HAZMAT is transported in commerce through \n     U.S. points of entry. It also creates a HAZMAT research \n     cooperative through the National Academy of Sciences' \n     Transportation Research Board.\n       Streamlines federal responsibilities for ensuing the safety \n     of food shipments. Primary responsibility is transferred from \n     DOT to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) \n     which would set practices to be followed by shippers, \n     carriers, and others engaged in food transport. Highway and \n     railroad safety inspectors would be trained to spot threats \n     to food safety and to report possible contamination.\n\n\n                       TITLE IV--HOUSEHOLD GOODS\n\n       The purpose of Title IV is to provide greater protection to \n     consumers entrusting their belongings to a moving company. \n     While most of movers operate reputable businesses, a small \n     number of ``rogue'' movers continue to defraud thousands of \n     consumers annually. The oversight of the interstate household \n     goods moving industry is the responsibility of the Federal \n     Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). FMCSA is tasked \n     with issuing regulations, conducting oversight activities, \n     and taking enforcement actions on consumer complaints that \n     have averaged about 3,000 per year since 2001. Title IV:\n       Allows a state authority that enforces state consumer \n     protection laws and State Attorneys General to enforce \n     federal laws and regulations governing the transportation of \n     household goods in interstate commerce.\n       Authorizes a penalty, of not less than $10,000, for a \n     broker who provides an estimate to a shipper before entering \n     into an agreement with a carrier to move the shipper's goods. \n     A $10,000 penalty and up to a 24-month suspension of \n     registration are authorized also for failure to give up \n     possession of a shipper's household goods, and if convicted, \n     that person shall be fined or imprisoned for up to five \n     years.\n       Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to register a \n     person to provide transportation of household goods only \n     after that person meets certain requirements. In addition, \n     the bill authorizes a penalty, of not less than $25,000, for \n     carriers and brokers who transport household goods but do not \n     register with DOT.\n       Codifies existing regulations that require a carrier to \n     give up possession of the household goods provided the \n     shipper pays the mover 100% of a binding estimate of the \n     charges or 110% of a non-binding estimate of the charges. The \n     bill permits a carrier to charge only a prorated amount for \n     the partial delivery of a shipment in the case of a lost or \n     damaged shipment, and limits the amount of impracticable \n     charges that must be paid upon delivery.\n       Establishes that a carrier is liable for the pre-determined \n     total value of goods shipped unless otherwise authorized by \n     the shipper. The current standard liability is at a rate of \n     60 cents per pound of a consumer's goods.\n       Directs the Secretary of Transportation to modify existing \n     regulations to require a carrier's or broker's website to \n     provide certain information. In addition, the Secretary would \n     be required to establish a system and database for complaints \n     and solicitation of State information regarding the number \n     and type of complaints about a carrier. The bill directs the \n     carrier to provide the shipper information about their \n     rights.\n\n\n         title v--aquatic resources trust fund reauthorization\n\n       Title V reauthorizes activities funded by two of the \n     Nation's most effective ``user-pay, user-benefit'' programs--\n     the Sport Fish Restoration Fund, administered by the Fish and \n     Wildlife Service, and the Recreational Boating Safety Fund, \n     administered by the U.S. Coast Guard. These programs \n     constitute the ``Wallop-Breaux'' program, which is funded \n     through the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund. This \n     reauthorization will allow continued funding of programs that \n     benefit boating safety, coastal wetland protection and \n     restoration and sportfish restoration, as well as Clean \n     Vessel Act grants that help to keep our waterways clean. The \n     title is supported by a large coalition of recreational and \n     boating groups, who are members of the American League of \n     Anglers and Boaters.\n       As our nation's coastal population and tourism industry \n     grows, these coastal programs are more popular than ever. But \n     boating safety is also vitally important. State programs are \n     nearly 100% funded through the Boating Safety fund, which \n     allows state law enforcement to perform boating safety \n     patrols, as well as train recreational boaters. The presence \n     of these law enforcement boats on the water not only benefits \n     recreational boaters, but also helps meet Coast Guard needs \n     and enforce port security. Title V:\n       Renames the Trust Fund the Sport Fish Restoration and \n     Boating Trust Fund, and eliminates the separate Boating \n     Safety Account.\n       Reauthorizes the Marine Sanitary Devices pump-out program, \n     the Boating Infrastructure Grant Program, and Outreach \n     programs.\n       Increases the Boating Safety Grants to a three-to-one \n     match, the same match as the Sport Fish Restoration grants.\n       Funds most of the programs on a percentage basis, which \n     provides both simplicity and fairness. Conforming changes to \n     the Internal Revenue Code will be included in the sections \n     offered by the Finance Committee.\n       Annual revenues to the Fund total approximately $500 \n     million, but the amounts vary from year to year. Under the \n     new agreement, all programs will share in the rise and fall \n     of these revenues, less the $9 million set aside for \n     administration, and the $3 million set aside for multi-state \n     grants. Title V establishes the following funding shares for \n     the Trust Fund programs:\n       Sport Fish Restoration, 57% (including 15% for Boating \n     Access); Boating Safety Grants, 18.5%; Coastal Wetlands Act, \n     18.5%; Boating Infrastructure, 2.0%; Outreach, 2.0%; Clean \n     Vessel Act, 2.0%.\n       The growing popularity of recreational boating and fishing \n     has created safety, environmental, and access needs that have \n     been addressed successfully by the Recreational Boating \n     Safety and Sport Fish Restoration programs. The Trust Fund \n     program reauthorizations and funding adjustments contained in \n     Title V are important for the safety of boaters, the \n     continued enjoyment of fishermen, and improvement of our \n     coastal areas and waterways.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Hawaii. I am \nhoping we can get started on this bill as quickly as possible because \nthis time during this week has been set aside for the bill with all of \nthe titles--EPW, commerce, finance--and we have a very complex bill. We \nneed to work on these amendments right away.\n  There is discussion about holds on both sides. I hope if anybody has \na problem with the bill they will come down and work with us and not \nhold up the bill because we cannot do our job and get this measure \npassed if we are blocked from bringing it up by people phoning in their \nholds.\n  I would like to have any Member who has a problem to talk to our \nstaffs, realize there are lots of things that many people want to \nchange, but that is what this whole process is about. We are trying to \ncraft a bill that has been reported out of several different \ncommittees. Our highway title has been out there for 10 days, and \neveryone has had a chance to work on it. We have cleared numerous \namendments on both sides of the aisle to take care of needs that \nvarious Members have. We cannot get this bill completed if people phone \nin holds and say: No, we are not going to let you go to the floor. It \nis very important that Members come down. This is going to be a very \ndifficult bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BOND. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. What is the present situation that would block the Senate \nfrom moving forward with this legislation and amendments being offered? \nCan't you just ask consent to go to the legislation?\n  Mr. BOND. My understanding from the cloakrooms is there are Members \nwho have phoned in their concerns about moving to it.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will further yield, who is \nthe cloakroom--is he a Senator? This is highway legislation that has \nbeen held up for 2\\1/2\\ years that is causing people to get killed, \nthat is keeping us from creating jobs.\n  The Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Oklahoma and all other\n\n[[Page S4626]]\n\nSenators trying to manage this legislation have been very effective, \nvery helpful of everyone, very considerate, but it is time we get this \nlegislation going. The very idea that a Senator on Monday afternoon is \ncalling in here or hiding out in his office or calling from some \nairport saying they object to us going to this legislation--I would \nlike for them to explain that to their constituents. The Senate has \nbeen playing around long enough this year delaying everything, slow-\nwalking everything.\n  By the way, this is not partisan; it is on both sides. This \nlegislation is critical. It is time the Senate starts acting as a \nSenate instead of a kindergarten. I hope the Senators will give the \nconsent this Senator from Missouri needs to get on this legislation and \nget it out of here. If we do not, our constituents are going to know \nwho is the problem and why we are not getting this job done. It is time \nwe get some Senators by the nape of the neck and tell them to put up or \nshut up because this legislation is critical. It is time to get it \ndone. We ought to be having votes on amendments this afternoon. The \nvery idea of Senators hiding in their offices saying, I am not ready, \nor I don't want to come, or I object--get over here and legislate and \nstart acting like adults.\n  I thank the Senator from Missouri for yielding to me for that calm \nexpression of concern.\n  Mr. BOND. I certainly hope the Senator from Mississippi feels better. \nI feel better because he has expressed my sentiments very clearly. We \nhave been waiting 2\\1/3\\ years to have this bill in the Senate, and we \nhave plenty to work on. I hope we are ready to move forward.\n  I will add to what the chairman of the EPW committee, my colleague \nfrom Oklahoma, has said. Recognize that last year during the \nconsideration of the Transportation bill, the Senate voted 76 to 21 in \nfavor of funding the highway bill at $255 billion, mass transit at $56 \nbillion. This vote was a strong signal that the Members of the Senate \nbelieve we need to spend more dollars for safety, for our economy, for \njobs, for our long-term growth and future on highways.\n  We did adopt in this budget resolution the provision presented by my \ncolleague, Senator Talent, and the Senator from Michigan, to give the \nFinance Committee the opportunity to increase funding for the bill as \nlong as it was properly offset, and 80 Senators voted in support of it. \nThat is exactly what the chairman and the ranking member, Senators \nGrassley and Baucus, have done in their amendment.\n  I urge we support this amendment because we are still going to be \nshort of where we were last time. No one is going to be able to get, \nfor their particular areas of interest, their particular priorities, \nthe same amount of money that would have been available under $318 \nbillion. This measure does increase the funding somewhat over the \nfigure written into the budget, but it is in pursuant to the provision \nincluded in the transportation section of the highway bill that there \ncould be an add-on.\n  I hope people will see this is a critical time to move forward on \nthis measure. If there are people who have amendments, I hope they will \nbe ready to come forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Just for a question.\n  I came to the Senate and heard Senator Lott. He was exasperated and \nfrustrated. He said Members were not offering amendments, so I came to \nthe Senate quickly to find out the extent of it.\n  Would the Senator from Oklahoma clarify, is it not true that we now \nhave, in effect, a new bill--about 1,000 pages, the substitute--that is \nbeing copied now and being shared for the first time? Members who seek \nto amend the bill should at least be given a chance to review this new \nversion of the bill so their amendments are in order.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I respond to the Senator from Illinois, I am not sure \nwhat was shared with all the Democrats. I do know that Senator Jeffords \nand Senator Baucus--we have been working together. They are the ranking \nmembers of the subcommittee and whole committee. We have done this \njointly. This has been done all together. Whether that was shared with \nall the Members, I have no way of knowing.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield, I share the sentiment and \nunderstand his frustration 3 years into this process still trying to \ncome up with a bill. I want to see this done as quickly as possible. I \nwill urge the staff that is now reviewing this new substitute \namendment--some are just seeing it for the first time--to move quickly \nand to urge all colleagues on both sides, Democrats and Republicans, to \nbring their amendments to the floor and let's get on with it.\n  I say to the Senator, I understand his feelings, and if it is in the \nform of a question, does the Senator believe he is deserving of my \nempathy?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  I remind the Senator, as chairman of this committee I went first to \nIllinois before going anywhere else to have a field hearing, which we \nhad in Chicago and went over some of the needs. They made it very clear \nto me that there are needs in Illinois, and the Senators from Illinois \nare very anxious to get this bill under consideration.\n  Again, the only frustration I have on amendments is that for 4 days \nlast week we talked about this, begging people to bring down \namendments.\n  The Senator from Illinois knows as well as I know what could very \nwell happen: we could get into a cloture situation where then we would \nbe out of time.\n  It seems as if it is the nature of the Senate that you just do not do \nanything until you have to do it. Now you have to do it. So we want \nthem to come down. It is our hope now to get to the managers' \nsubstitute. We are not in a position to quite do that yet; however, we \ncan certainly entertain amendments and have amendments discussed and \nlined up. Then we can talk about the necessity of having this bill. \nThat is essentially what we are doing right now.\n  I can assure the Senator from Mississippi, his frustration is no \ngreater than mine because I will have people stop and talk to me about \namendments--fine, bring them down; let's discuss them--and they do not \nshow up. That is what we want to make sure happens.\n  I think the Senator from Illinois is right. We are on our sixth \nextension now. We worked on this bill for 2 years prior to the time we \nbrought it to the floor last year. So this has been a 3-year process. \nMy concern is if we end up just getting another extension, we are not \ngoing to get anything done that really needs to be done. If we are \nconcerned about doing something for donor States, we are not going to \ndo it with an extension because it is going to be the same thing as we \nhave been having under TEA-21 as of 7 years ago.\n  If our concern is about the Safety Corps, the Senator from \nMississippi is right. It is his committee that deals with the Safety \nCorps programs. Certainly the State of Oklahoma is high on the list of \ndeaths on the highways. We have to get this done.\n  I suggest it is a matter of life and death that we get a bill because \nif we operate off of extensions, we are not going to do anything to \nimprove safety on the highways. The Senator from Mississippi made that \nvery clear. We are not going to have any real streamlining of \nenvironmental reviews. We have some good elements in this bill that are \ngoing to be able to help us build roads faster with less money than we \ncould on an extension. If we are operating on an extension and do not \nhave a bill, we are not going to have any increase in our ability to \nhave innovative financing thereby giving the States more tools.\n  What we have tried to do in this bill is to give a lot more of the \npower back to the States. It has been my belief, and I think shared by \nmost members of my committee, that the closer you get to home, the more \npeople are aware of their specific needs. There are a lot of people who \nhave some excellent ideas on innovative financing that the States are \ngoing to be able to do. This is in the bill.\n  The Safe Routes to School Program--the Senator from Vermont is very \nmuch interested in that. It is one that is handled in this bill. \nHowever, if we go on an extension, extension No. 7, we are not going to \nhave the Safe Routes to School Program.\n  The States are considered to have uncertainty. We have come back from\n\n[[Page S4627]]\n\nabout a 7-day recess. I talked to our people, our highway people, our \ndepartment of transportation in Oklahoma, and they cannot have any kind \nof planning for any kind of certainty as to knowing what is going to \nhappen in the next year and the year after that and for the next five \nyears unless we pass this bill. They are begging, pleading: Why can't \nyou get this done because it has to be done in order for us to plan for \nthe future.\n  I am particularly concerned about this because as to bridges, for \nexample, in my State of Oklahoma, we are dead last in the Nation in \nterms of the condition of our bridges. And we cannot get anything done \nand plan for the future unless we get a bill.\n\n  There are a lot of people in a lot of States who are concerned about \nthe borders program. It is critical to the border States that are \ndealing with the NAFTA traffic. This bill deals with that. With an \nextension, it is not going to happen. If we do not do this bill, we \nwill have a delay in the establishment of this national commission to \nexplain new ways to fund transportation.\n  I can tell you we have not done it any differently than when Dwight \nD. Eisenhower was President of the United States. He came along and \nrecognized a problem in our transportation system as a result of the \nproblem he had during World War II in moving troops and equipment \naround. Looking at our transportation system, the first thing he did \nwhen he became President of United States was to set up a National \nHighway Program and get it started. We have been funding our roads and \nour highways and our improvements and our bridges and infrastructure \nthe same as we did during the Eisenhower administration. The bill sets \nup a national commission to go over some creative types of changes in \nfunding where we can do a better job.\n  Right now, we are looking at the consideration, shortly, of the \nmanagers' amendment. If we do, it has been reported that even that \namount, which is higher than the amount that was reported out of my \ncommittee, is going to do nothing more than just maintain what we have \ntoday. It is not really going to provide anything new. So we need to \nrecognize that.\n  I have to say this, too. There are a lot of different philosophies \nthat are represented in this Chamber. I am one of the most conservative \nMembers. Yet there are some areas where conservatives do spend more \nmoney, and one is in infrastructure, which is what we are supposed to \nbe doing here. We do not want to delay this national commission we set \nup in this legislation. I believe it is time to make a change for the \nbetter.\n  With the bill, we have increased the opportunity to address the \nchokepoints for intermodal transportation. This is kind of interesting. \nPeople do not realize this is not just a roads bill. This is an \nintermodal bill that considers chokepoints between channels and \nrailroads and roads. We deal with that. It is an intermodal bill. A lot \nof people are not aware of the fact that in my State of Oklahoma, we \nare actually navigable. We have a navigation channel. This bill deals \nwith the chokepoints between rail, road, water, and other air \ntransportation.\n  And there is the firewall. If there is one thing that has bothered me \nover the years I have been on this committee--I have been on this \ncommittee for 11 years; and before that, in the other body, I was on \nthe Transportation Committee for 8 years, so that is 19 years. During \nthat time, when I have gone back to my State, the thing people are \noffended by is that there are always raids on the highway trust fund.\n  People have their own programs, they may be good programs, but they \ntry to go in and get money out of the highway trust fund to support \nthose programs. We have seen this happen over and over again in \nestablishing policies in the Senate, that they highway fund it. How \nshould we fund it? Let's fund it with transportation funds.\n  I believe that is a moral issue.\n  When the American people go to the pump, they do not mind paying a \ntax, but when they find out that tax is not going to highway \nconstruction and highway improvements and highway maintenance and \nintermodal transportation, they are understandably very nervous and \nvery offended.\n  We have the firewall protection of the highway trust fund to make \nsure that these trust funds are not going to be vulnerable to raids in \norder to pay for other programs. I know there are a lot of people who \nfeel they are not as excited about the way the formula was put \ntogether. I would like to say something about that. This is \nsignificant.\n  There are two ways to do a highway bill. I know one of the ways that \nwas a little more prevalent in the other body was to come up with \nprojects. You have 435 Members who have projects of significance. \nInstead, we believe that decisions on the priority of expenditure of \ntransportation dollars should be made at the local level. In other \nwords, it is easy to come up here and pass something and go home and \nsay: Look what I got for you; I am bringing this home.\n  What we prefer is to have an equitable distribution of moneys that \ncome into the highway trust fund to go back to the States and then let \nthe States make these decisions. If there are States that don't want to \ndo this, that is fine. But in the State of Oklahoma, I can assure you \nthe closer to the people at home, the better the decisions. The people \nin the eight transportation districts in my State of Oklahoma are far \nbetter informed on the needs and priorities of where money should be \nspent on transportation than they are here in Washington. There are a \nlot of people who think that no decision is a good decision that is \nmade in Washington. I don't agree with that.\n  We have a different way of doing it than the other body. We have a \nformula. Our formula takes everything into consideration. We are \ntalking about interstate lane miles; vehicle miles traveled on the \ninterstate; the contributions to the highway trust fund; the lane miles \nand principal arteries, excluding the interstate VMT on principal \narteries; surface transportation programs; total lane miles--all these \nthings are considered--the Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation \nProgram; we have rankings to see what is really nationwide that should \nbe attributed to this. Certainly, I am a little bit prejudiced, being \nfrom Oklahoma where our bridges are in the worst shape of any of the 50 \nStates. We are going to correct that, and we can correct that with this \nbill.\n  We have congestion mitigation, air quality improvement programs, and \nthese are very significant. These are the things that come in under the \nformula that goes out to the States. We have the Recreational Trails \nProgram. We know all about that. We take into consideration low-income \nStates. There are some States that are lower income States, and the \npeople are not really able to pay for quite as much as some other \nStates. We have low-population States, but they still have to have \nroads. Consequently, that has to be a part of the formula. We have low \npopulation density States. Some States have much higher fatalities than \nother States. That tells you they need to do something. The SAFETEA \ncore program is in this base bill and will be continued. If we get \naround to the managers' amendment, then we will have something in \nthere. Guaranteed minimum growth, you have to have some consideration \nin there because there are States that are growing very rapidly. Some \nStates are on the other side.\n  We have donor States, donee States. These are things that are \nconsidered. A lot of people realize we have many States, including my \nState of Oklahoma, that are donor States. In other words, we don't get \nback as much money as we send to Washington to go into the highway \ntrust fund. In TEA-21, we put in a minimum figure of 90.5 percent. In \nthe bill we had last year, it would bring all these donee States all \nthe way up to 95. That was good, but it took $318 billion over 6 years \nto do that. We were not able to get it out of conference.\n  By the way, as the Senator from Missouri said, that bill passed the \nSenate by 76 to 21. That gives you an idea. If we get the bill up here, \nall we have to do is get by all these procedures, and we will pass a \nbill. It will take into consideration all the things I mentioned. This \nis not just a political table. In fact, politics didn't enter into it. \nWe don't have projects in this Senate bill. The House bill does. When \nwe go to conference, we are going to iron those things out, and we are \ngoing to come out with a good bill. But you can't do that until you get \nall the amendments in and get a vote.\n\n[[Page S4628]]\n\n  I encourage Members to offer their amendments and to discuss the \nhighway bill. I know there are some Members who were requesting time \nfor that purpose.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see the floor manager of the highway \nbill.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is my understanding you want to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Can you hold it to, say, 25 minutes?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I further ask unanimous consent that the time you take be \nthe time, following you, given to Senator Specter, who is wanting to \nhave about that amount of time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is my understanding then that the Senator from \nMassachusetts will go for 25 minutes. Then the Senator from \nPennsylvania will go for 25 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That was the Chair's understanding.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the floor manager. This is very \nimportant legislation, enormously important to my State as other \nStates. We need the kinds of investments in our roads and bridges to \nensure their safety and security and that they will continue to be the \nvital avenues for an expanding and growing economy. I look forward to \nworking with the committee.\n\n\n                           Iraq Supplemental\n\n  I appreciate having the opportunity to address the Senate on what I \nanticipate will be the matter that will be before the Senate later this \nevening and through tomorrow, and that is the Iraq supplemental \nconference report. As I mentioned, I expect that it will be laid down \nin the next few hours, and I expect there will be a final resolution of \nthis sometime tomorrow.\n  I welcome the opportunity to address some of the important provisions \nthat are included in the conference report and bring them to the \nattention of our colleagues and to the American people.\n  I intend to support the Iraq spending bill. Although I disagree \nstrongly with some of the bill's provisions, these funds are clearly \nneeded for our troops. All of us support our troops. We obviously want \nto do all we can to see that they have proper equipment, vehicles, and \neverything else they need to protect their lives as they carry out \ntheir missions. It is scandalous that the administration has kept \nsending them into battle in Iraq without proper equipment. No soldier \nshould be sent into battle unprotected. No parent should have to go in \ndesperation to the local Wal-Mart to buy armor plates and mail them to \ntheir sons and daughters serving in Iraq.\n  Our military is performing brilliantly under enormously difficult \ncircumstances, and we need to give them our support--not just from our \nwords but from our pockets, too. One aspect of this bill that I am \nparticularly proud of is the increased funding for humvees for our \ntroops on patrol in Iraq. The Bayh-Kennedy amendment adds additional \nfunds to keep production at increased levels. Some opponents claim that \nthe Army already had enough armed humvees and objected to any further \nincrease. But a front-page article in the New York Times, on April 25, \ntold us the troop side of the real need for more armor and the \ndifference it can make.\n\n  Company E, a Marine Corps unit based at Camp Pendleton, returned from \n6 months in Ramadi last year, and its members were so frustrated with \nthis problem that they decided to tell their story. They did not have \nenough armored vehicles. Thirteen of the twenty-one marines from \nCompany E who were killed in Iraq had been riding in humvees that \nfailed to protect them from bullets or bombs. They saw problems up \nclose.\n  A year ago, eight of them were killed when their humvees were \nambushed on the way to aid another unit under fire. The cargo section \nof the humvee where the troops were riding did not even have hillbilly \narmor to protect them from the blast. They were totally unprotected. As \none marine described the attack: All I saw was sandbags, blood, and \ndead bodies. There was no protection in the back.\n  Captain Kelly Royer, Company E's unit commander, asked his superiors \nwhen he would be getting more armored humvees. He was told that \nadditional armor had not been requested and that there were production \nconstraints.\n  Another marine says they complained about the shortages every day to \nanybody we could. They told us they were listening, but we did not see \nit.\n  These marines on the front line knew the armor meant the difference \nbetween life and death, the difference between an essential mission and \na suicide mission. They were desperate to get more armor. Day after day \nthey saw the brutal consequences of the Pentagon's incompetence and \ndelay.\n  The lessons learned from the war in Iraq are said to help us in \nfuture conflicts, but for all forces facing death every day, the future \nwas yesterday. In fact, the Marines are requesting funds for the coming \nfiscal year to develop and produce new armored vehicles to avoid these \ndeadly threats.\n  The need is so clear that the request was submitted under the Marine \nCorps Urgent Universal Needs Statement which was created to streamline \nthe acquisition process and get equipment to the field faster. They \nhave a plan to meet the future need, but what about the urgent need \ntoday?\n  We do not have the luxury of time to wait for these new vehicles to \nroll off a future assembly line. The need for armored humvees is now. \nThe hillbilly armor they scavenge for and add to their unprotected \nhumvees does not provide adequate protection.\n  The Army says of the new requirement approved this month, none of it \nis designated for the Marine Corps. The Pentagon refuses to make this a \ntop priority. They continue to drag their feet.\n  In a report to Congress this month, the Government Accounting Office \ndescribes month after month of mismanagement by the Pentagon in \nsupplying the armored humvees our troops urgently need to carry out \ntheir missions and stay alive.\n  The GAO report found the Army still had no long-term plan to increase \nthe number of armored humvees. The war in Iraq has been going on for 2 \nfull years. Our troops are under fire every day, and the Pentagon still \ndoes not have a plan to protect them.\n  I have in my hand an April 2005 GAO report, ``Defense Logistics \nAgency, Actions Needed to Improve Availability of Critical Items during \nCurrent and Future Operations.'' On page 123, it states that there two \nprimary causes for the shortages of uparmored vehicles and add-on armor \nkits. First, a decision was made to pace production rather than use the \nmaximum available capacity.\n  This is the General Accounting Office in their report of April of \nthis year.\n  Second, the funding allocations did not keep up with rapidly \nincreasing requirements.\n  That is the General Accounting Office about whether we need to have \nmore uparmored humvees and whether we have to give it a higher priority \nand whether there is a need in Iraq today. Our troops are under fire \nevery day, and the Pentagon still does not have a plan to protect them.\n  In a briefing prepared by marines for Congress, they specifically \nstate, in their vehicle hardening strategy, that ``funding assistance \nis required to achieve optimum levels of armor protection.''\n  The GAO report clearly points out that the Pentagon's bureaucratic \nmentality infected its decisions. They tried to solve the problem in a \nslow and gradual manner instead of solving it quickly. As the GAO \nreport states, there were two primary causes for the shortages: \n``First, a decision was made to pace production.'' Translated into \nlayman's language, that means there\n\n[[Page S4629]]\n\nwas not a sense of urgency by the Pentagon. That is what ``pace \nproduction'' means. And then ``rather than use the maximum available \ncapacity'' means they didn't get off their tail and increase \nproduction. And ``Second, funding allocations did not keep up with \nrapidly increasing requirements.''\n\n  I am going to come to the statements by the responsible DOD officials \nbefore the Armed Services Committee on which I serve.\n  It is equally obvious that in addition to the bureaucratic mentality \nof the Pentagon, their cakewalk mentality is also a major part of the \nproblem. Week after week, month after month they refuse to believe that \nthe insurgency will continue. They want to believe it will soon be \nover. They do not feel they need to waste dollars on armored humvees \nthat soon will not be needed in Iraq. So month after month, our troops \nkeep paying with their lives. The light the Pentagon sees at the end of \nthe tunnel turns out to be the blinding flash of another roadside bomb \nexploding under another unprotected humvee in Iraq.\n  They cannot even get their story right. Armor Holdings, the company \nthat makes the armored humvee, told my office recently that its current \ncontract with the Army will actually mean sharp cutbacks in production. \nRight now, they produce 550 armored humvees a month. Their contract \nreduces that number to 239 in June, zero in July and then back to 40 in \nAugust and 71 in September. The company is now negotiating for slightly \nhigher levels of production in June, July, and August, but it still \nexpects to decrease production to 71 by September.\n  What possible justification can there be for the Pentagon to slow \ndown current production so drastically in the months ahead when armored \nhumvees are so urgently needed? The Pentagon keeps saying: We will work \nit out. On nine different occasions, we have asked the Pentagon for \ntheir requirements for humvees, and nine times they have been wrong. \nNine times they have made their presentation before the Armed Services \nCommittee, and nine times they have been wrong in underestimating the \nimportance of needs, and American service men and women have been \npaying with their lives.\n  This bill tells the Department of Defense that we will not let them \nget it wrong for a tenth time. For the sake of our troops, Congress \nacted and the Pentagon should not ignore it. The contract should be \namended immediately to obtain the maximum possible production of \narmored humvees for the months ahead. Our troops are waiting for an \nanswer, and their lives depend on it.\n  Another important part of this bill will be the periodic report it \nrequires on the progress our forces are making in Iraq. Our military is \nperforming brilliantly under enormously difficult circumstances, but \nthey do not want, and the American people do not want, an open-ended \ncommitment. After all the blunders that took us into war, we need to be \ncertain that the President has a strategy for success.\n  The $5.7 billion in this bill for training Iraqi security forces is a \nkey element of a successful strategy to stabilize Iraq and withdraw \nAmerican forces. The report will provide the straight answer that we \nhave not had before about how many Iraqi security forces are adequately \ntrained and equipped.\n  We are obviously making progress, but it is far from clear how much. \nThe American people deserve an honest assessment that provides the \nbasic facts, but that is not what we have been given so far.\n  According to a GAO report in March, U.S. Government agencies do not \nreport reliable data on the extent to which Iraqi security forces are \ntrained and equipped. There it is, March: The General Accounting Office \nsays U.S. Government agencies do not report reliable data on the extent \nto which the Iraqi security forces are trained and equipped.\n  The American people do not know the answer. When they do not know, it \nmeans pretty clearly that they are not getting the kind of training and \npriority they should, and the longer it takes to train them the longer \nAmerican servicemen are going to be over there risking their lives.\n  The report goes on to say that the Departments of State and Defense \nno longer report on the extent to which Iraqi security forces are \nequipped with their required weapons, vehicles, communications, \nequipment, and body armor. Imagine that. According to the General \nAccounting Office, the Departments of State and Defense no longer \nreport on the extent to which the Iraqi security forces are equipped \nwith their required weapons, vehicles, communications, equipment, and \nbody armor.\n  It is clear from the administration's own statements that they are \nusing the notorious fuzzy math tactic to avoid an honest appraisal.\n  On February 4, 2004, Secretary Rumsfeld said:\n\n       We have accelerated the training of Iraqi security forces, \n     now more than 200,000 strong.\n\n  A year later, on January 19, 2005, Secretary of State Condoleezza \nRice said:\n\n       We think the number right now is somewhere over 120,000.\n\n  On February 3, 2005, in response to questions from Senator Levin at a \nSenate Armed Services Committee hearing, GEN Richard Myers, Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, conceded that only 40,000 Iraqi security \nforces are actually capable. He said:\n\n       48 deployable (battalions) around the country, equals about \n     40,000, which is a number that can go anywhere and do \n     anything.\n\n  Obviously, we need a better accounting of how much progress is being \nmade to train and equip effective Iraqi security forces.\n  The President's commitment to keep American troops in Iraq as long as \nit takes and not a day longer is not enough for our soldiers and their \nloved ones. They deserve a clearer indication of what lies ahead, and \nso do the American people. I am encouraged that the administration is \nfinally being required by this bill to tell Congress how many U.S. \ntroops will be necessary in Iraq through the end of 2006. The American \npeople, and especially our men and women in uniform, and their \nfamilies, deserve to know how much real progress is being made in \ntraining Iraqi troops and how long our forces will be in Iraq. \nHopefully, the administration will submit these reports in good faith \nand not attempt to classify this vital information.\n  Those are two of the major provisions that I think require support \nfor this legislation. There was an additional provision that I support \nthat I will mention briefly, and then I will conclude in mentioning a \nprovision which I find very unacceptable, troublesome, and unworkable.\n  The provision that was added by Senator Mikulski, the H-2B visas for \nseasonal workers, which I had the opportunity to join with her, remains \nin this legislation, and it will make a great deal of difference. It \nwill be a lifeline for small family businesses in my State on Cape Cod \nand many other firms that rely overwhelmingly on seasonal workers to \nmeet their heavy summer needs. Many use the programs year after year \nbecause it is the only way to legally fill temporary and seasonal \npositions when no American workers are available. Without this \namendment, they would be out of luck this summer, and many will be out \nof business.\n  This is a short-term solution to the current visa crisis. The bill is \na 2-year fix, and without it many businesses will be forced to shut \ntheir doors. I appreciate the support of our colleagues on this issue. \nIt will help many hard-working small businesses and industries across \nthe country.\n  Unfortunately, not all the immigration provisions included in the \nbill have this kind of broad support. Included in the conference \nagreement are the so-called REAL ID immigration provisions that are \nhighly controversial, harmful, and unnecessary. The Intelligence Reform \nAct we approved overwhelmingly last year provides real border security \nsolutions. The so-called REAL ID bill added by the House to this \nspending bill contains controversial provisions we rejected last year \nand likely would have rejected again if we had had a chance to debate \nthem on the Senate floor. They are a false solution on border security, \nand they serve no purpose except to push an anti-immigrant agenda. More \nthan ever we need to take the time to get border security reform right \nas opposed to pushing through legislation to meet the demands of anti-\nimmigrant extremists. The stakes are simply too great.\n  In addition to the numerous substantive problems with the REAL ID, \nthe process through which they have\n\n[[Page S4630]]\n\nbeen forced into this conference report is flawed and unacceptable. The \nRepublican leadership in the House and Senate shut Democrats out of the \nconference negotiations. Why? Because the House bill has controversial \nprovisions that have questionable support in the Senate and with the \nAmerican people. Strongarm tactics are offensive and do a great deal of \ndisservice to the important issues of our time. The White House too, \nonce rejected these provisions, yet, they now support them. What \nimportant issues will the White House flip-flop on next?\n  Those who pushed through these REAL ID provisions continue to say \nthat loopholes exist in our immigration and asylum laws that are being \nexploited by terrorists. They claim these provisions will close them. \nIn fact, they do nothing to improve national security and leave other \nbig issues unresolved.\n  They want us to believe that its changes will keep terrorists from \nbeing granted asylum. But current immigration laws already bar persons \nengaged in terrorist activity from asylum. Before they receive asylum, \nall applicants must also undergo extensive security checks, covering \nall terrorist and criminal databases at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the FBI, and the CIA.\n  Asylum seekers will find no refuge. Battered women and victims of \nstalking will be forced to divulge their addresses in order to get \ndriver's licenses, potentially endangering their lives. Many Americans \nwill have other problems with their driver's license. All legal \nrequirements, including labor laws, can now be waived to build a wall. \nFor the first time since the Civil War, habeas corpus will be \nprohibited. The REAL ID provisions contain other broad and sweeping \nchanges to laws that go to the core of our national identity.\n  Each year, countless refugees are forced to leave their countries, \nfleeing persecution. America has always been a haven for those \ndesperate for such protection. At the very beginning of our history, \nthe refugee Pilgrims seeking religious freedom landed on Plymouth Rock. \nEver since, we have welcomed refugees, and it has made us a better \nNation. Refugees represent the best of American values. They have stood \nalone, at great personal cost, against hostile governments for \nfundamental principles like freedom of speech and religion. We have a \nresponsibility to examine our asylum policies carefully, to see that \nthey are fair and just.\n  But, the REAL ID bill tramples this noble tradition and will be \ndevastating for legitimate asylum-seekers fleeing persecution. It will \nmake it more difficult for victims fleeing serious human rights abuses \nto obtain asylum and safety, and could easily lead to their return to \ntheir persecutors.\n  Another section of conference report contains a provision that would \ncomplete the U.S.-Mexico border fence in San Diego. But it goes much \nfarther than that. It gives the Department of Homeland security \nunprecedented and unchecked authority to waive all legal requirements \nnecessary to build such fences, not only in San Diego, but anywhere \nelse along our 2,000 mile border with Mexico and our 4,000 mile border \nwith Canada. Building such fences will cost hundreds of millions of \ndollars, and they still will not stop illegal immigration. What we need \nare safe and legal avenues for immigrants to come here and work, not \nmore walls.\n  A major additional problem in the REAL ID provisions is that it could \nresult in the deportation even of long-time legal permanent residents, \nfor lawful speech or associations that occurred 20 years ago or more. \nIt raises the burden of proof to nearly impossible levels in numerous \ncases.\n  A person who made a donation to a humanitarian organization involved \nin tsunami relief could be deported if the organization or any of its \naffiliates was ever involved in violence. The burden would be on the \ndonor to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he knew nothing \nabout any of these activities. The spouse and children of a legal \npermanent resident could also be deported too based on such an \naccusation, because of their relationship to the donor.\n  The provision could be applied retroactively, so that a permanent \nresident who had once supported the lawful, nonviolent work of the \nAfrican National Congress in South Africa, Sinn Fein in Northern \nIreland, the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, or the Contras in \nNicaragua would be deportable. It would be no defense to show that the \nonly support was for lawful nonviolent activity. It would be no defense \nto show that the United States itself supported some of these groups.\n  The driver's license provisions do not make us safer either. Let me \nexplain what these provisions really do. They repeal a section of the \nIntelligence Reform Act which sets up a process for States and the \nFederal Government to work together to establish Federal standards for \ndriver's licenses and identification cards. Progress is already being \nmade to implement these important measures, but this bill replaces them \nwith highly problematic and burdensome requirements. The National \nConference of State Legislatures says that these provisions are \n``unworkable, unproven, costly mandates that compel States to enforce \nFederal immigration policy rather than advance the paramount objective \nof making State-issued identity documents more secure and verifiable.''\n  Indeed, it is a costly unfunded mandate on the States. The CBO \nestimate on the implementation of the driver's license provisions is \n$20 million over a 5-year period to reimburse States for complying with \nthe legislation. But, that is not all; the provisions require States to \nparticipate in an interstate database that would share information at a \ncost of $80 million over 3 years.\n  The driver's license provisions do nothing to address the threat of \nterrorists or to address legitimate security concerns. It would not \nhave prevented a single 9/11 hijacker from obtaining a driver's \nlicense, or a single terrorist from boarding a plane. All 13 hijackers \ncould have obtained licenses or IDs under this proposal, and foreign \nterrorists can always use their passports to travel.\n  The result of these restrictive driver's license provisions will be \nraised insurance rates, higher numbers of fatalities on America's \nroadways, and an increased black market for false and fraudulent \ndocuments. The REAL ID actually undercuts the original purpose of \ntraffic safety. It is better to have licensed, insured, and trained \ndrivers on our roads.\n  Preventing immigrants from obtaining driver's licenses undermines \nnational security by pushing people into the shadows and fueling the \nblack market for fraudulent identification documents.\n  The REAL ID provisions do nothing to combat the threat of terrorists \nor to deal with legitimate security concerns. They have taken away \nprecious time that could have been used to address genuine pressing \nissues.\n  Hundreds of organizations across the political spectrum continue to \noppose this legislation. A broad coalition of religious, immigrant, \nhuman rights, civil liberties and state groups have expressed their own \nstrong opposition.\n  In these difficult times for our country, we know that the threat of \nterrorism has not ended, and we must do all we can to enact genuine \nmeasures to stop terrorists before they act, and to see that law \nenforcement officials have the full support they need. The provisions \nof the REAL ID bill in the conference report today will not improve \nthese efforts. They will not make us safer or prevent terrorism. They \nare an invitation to gross abuses, and a false solution to national and \nborder security.\n  The REAL ID bill with its controversial provisions should have been \nconsidered by the Senate through debate and discussion, not attached to \na critical piece of legislation needed by our troops.\n  I urge the Senate to get serious about immigration reform that will \nmake genuine improvements where they are needed, and not in the \npiecemeal fashion that is contained in this report.\n  This bill also provides nearly $12 million to remedy a crisis in off-\nsite judicial security for our Federal judges. With this bill, we have \ntaken a small, but necessary step toward increasing security for the \ndistinguished men and women of our country who have been appointed to \nthe courts. In the wake of the recent murders of the husband and mother \nof Federal Judge Joan Lefkow at her home in Chicago, and the courtroom \nkillings in Atlanta, it is clear we\n\n[[Page S4631]]\n\nmust do more to enhance judicial security. This is a matter of the \nhighest urgency.\n  The tragic deaths of Judge Lefkow's family demonstrate that judges \nmay be safe inside the walls of our wellguarded courthouses, but they \nare vulnerable to disgruntled litigants in other places, even in their \nown homes. In, fact, security in the homes of judges has long been a \nconcern for the Judicial Conference, the principal decision-making \ngroup for the Federal courts. Sadly, three judges had previously been \nkilled in their homes: Judge John Wood of Texas, in 1979; Judge Richard \nDaronco of New York, in 1988; and Judge Robert Vance, of Alabama, in \n1989.\n  The vast majority of threats are received from people who are angry \nwith the outcome of a case in court. In the 10 years since the first \nworld trade center bombing, the Federal judiciary has handled an \nincreasing number of ``high threat'' matters.\n  Judge Lefkow was the victim of an act of domestic terrorism stemming \nfrom what should have been a routine civil matter. Matthew Hale, the \nleader of a White Supremacist group known as the World Church of the \nCreator, was convicted in April 2004 of soliciting an undercover FBI \ninformant to murder Judge Lefkow in retaliation for her ruling against \nhim in a trademark dispute. This example highlights the environment in \nwhich our Federal judges toil every day.\n  The Marshals Service, underfunded and understaffed as it is, \nstruggles to keep up with security needs in the new high-risk age, but \nthere is no reason why our judges should continue to remain so \nvulnerable 16 years after Judge Vance was killed in his home. We need \nto stand up for an independent judiciary. We can do so by providing the \nfunds to make their homes safe.\n  There were provisions in this legislation to do that. It says \nsomething about the nature of our dialog here when we have to provide \nthe kind of extraordinary additional security to judges because of the \nnature of the political dialog. Words have consequences. Words have \nresults. Words have meanings. The idea that individuals in responsible \npositions continue to threaten members of the judiciary too often can \nresult in serious consequences to those judicial members. We have \nattempted to provide some additional security to protect those \nindividuals. The best protection would be for more restraint on the \npart of those who talk about an independent judiciary.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article dated April \n25, 2005, from the New York Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, it was so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 25, 2005]\n\n         Bloodied Marines Sound Off About Want of Armor and Men\n\n                           (By Michael Moss)\n\n       On May 29, 2004, a station wagon that Iraqi insurgents had \n     packed with C-4 explosives blew up on a highway in Ramadi, \n     killing four American marines who died for lack of a few \n     inches of steel.\n       The four were returning to camp in an unarmored Humvee that \n     their unit had rigged with scrap metal, but the makeshift \n     shields rose only as high as their shoulders, photographs of \n     the Humvee show, and the shrapnel from the bomb shot over the \n     top. ``The steel was not high enough,'' said Staff Sgt. Jose \n     S. Valerio, their motor transport chief, who along with the \n     unit's commanding officers said the men would have lived had \n     their vehicle been properly armored. ``Most of the shrapnel \n     wounds were to their heads.''\n       Among those killed were Rafael Reynosa, a 28-year-old lance \n     corporal from Santa Ana, Calif., whose wife was expecting \n     twins, and Cody S. Calavan, a 19-year-old private first class \n     from Lake Stevens, Wash., who had the Marine Corps motto, \n     Semper Fidelis, tattooed across his back.\n       They were not the only losses for Company E during its six-\n     month stint last year in Ramadi. In all, more than one-third \n     of the unit's 185 troops were killed or wounded, the highest \n     casualty rate of any company in the war, Marine Corps \n     officials say.\n       In returning home, the leaders and Marine infantrymen have \n     chosen to break an institutional code of silence and tell \n     their story, one they say was punctuated not only by a lack \n     of armor, but also by a shortage of men and planning that \n     further hampered their efforts in battle, destroyed morale \n     and ruined the careers of some of their fiercest warriors.\n       The saga of Company E, part of a lionized battalion \n     nicknamed the Magnificent Bastards, is also one of fortitude \n     and ingenuity. The marines, based at Camp Pendleton in \n     southern California, had been asked to rid the provincial \n     capital of one of the most persistent insurgencies, and in \n     enduring 26 firefights, 90 mortar attacks and more than 90 \n     homemade bombs, they shipped their dead home and powered \n     on. Their tour has become legendary among other Marine \n     units now serving in Iraq and facing some of the same \n     problems.\n       ``As marines, we are always taught that we do more with \n     less,'' said Sgt. James S. King, a platoon sergeant who lost \n     his left leg when he was blown out of the Humvee that \n     Saturday afternoon last May. ``And get the job done no matter \n     what it takes.'' The experiences of Company E's marines, \n     pieced together through interviews at Camp Pendleton and by \n     phone, company records and dozens of photographs taken by the \n     marines, show they often did just that. The unit had less \n     than half the troops who are now doing its job in Ramadi, and \n     resorted to making dummy marines from cardboard cutouts and \n     camouflage shirts to place in observation posts on the \n     highway when it ran out of men. During one of its deadliest \n     firefights, it came up short on both vehicles and troops. \n     Marines who were stranded at their camp tried in vain to hot-\n     wire a dump truck to help rescue their falling brothers. That \n     day, 10 men in the unit died. Sergeant Valerio and others had \n     to scrounge for metal scraps to strengthen the Humvees they \n     inherited from the National Guard, which occupied Ramadi \n     before the marines arrived. Among other problems, the armor \n     the marines slapped together included heavier doors that \n     could not be latched, so they ``chicken winged it'' by \n     holding them shut with their arms as they traveled.\n       ``We were sitting out in the open, an easy target for \n     everybody,'' Cpl. Toby G. Winn of Centerville, Tex., said of \n     the shortages. ``We complained about it every day, to anybody \n     we could. They told us they were listening, but we didn't see \n     it.'' The company leaders say it is impossible to know how \n     many lives may have been saved through better protection, \n     since the insurgents became adept at overcoming improved \n     defenses with more powerful weapons. Likewise, Pentagon \n     officials say they do not know how many of the more than \n     1,500 American troops who have died in the war had \n     insufficient protective gear. But while most of Company E's \n     work in fighting insurgents was on foot, the biggest danger \n     the men faced came in traveling to and from camp: 13 of the \n     21 men who were killed had been riding in Humvees that failed \n     to deflect bullets or bombs. Toward the end of their tour \n     when half of their fleet had become factory-armored, the \n     armor's worth became starkly clear. A car bomb that the \n     unit's commander, Capt. Kelly D. Royer, said was at least as \n     powerful as the one on May 29 showered a fully armored Humvee \n     with shrapnel, photographs show. The marines inside were left \n     nearly unscathed.\n       Captain Royer, from Orangevale, Calif., would not accompany \n     his troops home. He was removed from his post six days before \n     they began leaving Ramadi, accused by his superiors of being \n     dictatorial, records show. His defenders counter that his \n     commanding style was a necessary response to the extreme \n     circumstances of his unit's deployment.\n       Company E's experiences still resonate today both in Iraq, \n     where two more marines were killed last week in Ramadi by the \n     continuing insurgency, and in Washington, where Congress is \n     still struggling to solve the Humvee problem. Just on \n     Thursday, the Senate voted to spend an extra $213 million to \n     buy more fully armored Humvees. The Army's procurement \n     system, which also supplies the Marines, has come under \n     fierce criticism for underperforming in the war, and to this \n     day it has only one small contractor in Ohio armoring new \n     Humvees.\n       Marine Corps officials disclosed last month in \n     Congressional hearings that they were now going their own way \n     and had undertaken a crash program to equip all of their more \n     than 2,800 Humvees in Iraq with stronger armor. The effort \n     went into production in November and is to be completed at \n     the end of this year.\n       Defense Department officials acknowledged that Company E \n     lacked enough equipment and men, but said that those were \n     problems experienced by many troops when the insurgency \n     intensified last year, and that vigorous efforts had been \n     made to improve their circumstances.\n       Lt. Gen. James N. Mattis of Richland, Wash., who commanded \n     the First Marine Division to which Company E belongs, said he \n     had taken every possible step to support Company E. He added \n     that they had received more factory-armored Humvees than any \n     other unit in Iraq.\n       ``We could not encase men in sufficiently strong armor to \n     deny any enemy success,'' General Mattis said. ``The tragic \n     loss of our men does not necessarily indicate failure--it is \n     war.''\n\n\n                         trouble from the start\n\n       Company E's troubles began at Camp Pendleton when, just \n     seven days before the unit left for Iraq, it lost its first \n     commander. The captain who led them through training was \n     relieved for reasons his supervisor declined to discuss. \n     ``That was like losing your quarterback on game day,'' said \n     First Sgt. Curtis E. Winfree.\n       In Kuwait, where the unit stopped over, an 18-year-old \n     private committed suicide in a chapel. Then en route to \n     Ramadi, they lost\n\n[[Page S4632]]\n\n     the few armored plates they had earmarked for their vehicles \n     when the steel was borrowed by another unit that failed to \n     return it. Company E tracked the steel down and took it back.\n       Even at that, the armor was mostly just scrap and thin, and \n     they needed more for the unarmored Humvees they inherited \n     from the Florida National Guard.\n       ``It was pitiful,'' said Capt. Chae J. Han, a member of a \n     Pentagon team that surveyed the Marine camps in Iraq last \n     year to document their condition. ``Everything was just \n     slapped on armor, just homemade, not armor that was given to \n     us through the normal logistical system.''\n       The report they produced was classified, but Captain Royer, \n     who took over command of the unit, and other Company E \n     marines say they had to build barriers at the camp--a former \n     junkyard--to block suicide drivers, improve the fencing and \n     move the toilets under a thick roof to avoid the insurgent \n     shelling. Even some maps they were given to plan raids were \n     several years old, showing farmland where in fact there were \n     homes, said a company intelligence expert, Cpl. Charles V. \n     Lauersdorf, who later went to work for the Defense \n     Intelligence Agency. There, he discovered up-to-date imagery \n     that had not found its way to the front lines.\n       Ramadi had been quiet under the National Guard, but the \n     Marines had orders to root out an insurgency that was using \n     the provincial capital as a way station to Falluja and \n     Baghdad, said Lt. Col. Paul J. Kennedy, who oversaw Company E \n     as the commander of its Second Battalion, Fourth Marine \n     Regiment. Before the company's first month was up, Lance Cpl. \n     William J. Wiscowiche of Victorville, Calif., lay dead on the \n     main highway as its first casualty. The Marine Corps issued a \n     statement saying only that he had died in action. But for \n     Company E, it was the first reality check on the constraints \n     that would mark their tour.\n\n\n                           Sweeping for Bombs\n\n       A British officer had taught them to sweep the roads for \n     bombs by boxing off sections and fanning out troops into \n     adjoining neighborhoods in hopes of scaring away insurgents \n     poised to set off the bombs. ``We didn't have the time to do \n     that,'' said Sgt. Charles R. Sheldon of Solana Beach, Calif. \n     ``We had to clear this long section of highway, and it \n     usually took us all day.'' Now and then a Humvee would speed \n     through equipped with an electronic device intended to block \n     detonation of makeshift bombs. The battalion, which had five \n     companies in its fold, had only a handful of the devices, \n     Colonel Kennedy said. Company E had none, even though \n     sweeping roads for bombs was one of its main duties. So many \n     of the marines, like Corporal Wiscowiche, had to rely on \n     their eyes. On duty on March 30, 2004, the 20-year-old lance \n     corporal did not spot the telltale three-inch wires sticking \n     out of the dust until he was a few feet away, the company's \n     leaders say. He died when the bomb was set off.\n       ``We had just left the base,'' Corporal Winn said. ``He was \n     walking in the middle of the road, and all I remember is \n     hearing a big explosion and seeing a big cloud of smoke.''\n       The endless task of walking the highways for newly hidden \n     I.E.D.'s, or improvised explosive devices, ``was nerve \n     wracking,'' Corporal Winn said, and the company began using \n     binoculars and the scopes on their rifles to spot the bombs \n     after Corporal Wiscowiche was killed.\n       ``Halfway through the deployment marines began getting good \n     at spotting little things,'' Sergeant Sheldon added. ``We had \n     marines riding down the road at 60 miles an hour, and they \n     would spot a copper filament sticking out of a block of \n     cement.'' General Mattis said troops in the area now have \n     hundreds of the electronic devices to foil the I.E.D.'s.\n       In parceling out Ramadi, the Marine Corps leadership gave \n     Company E more than 10 square miles to control, far more than \n     the battalion's other companies. Captain Royer said he had \n     informally asked for an extra platoon, or 44 marines, and had \n     been told the battalion was seeking an extra company. The \n     battalion's operations officer, Maj. John D. Harrill, said \n     the battalion had received sporadic assistance from the Army \n     and had given Company E extra help. General Mattis says he \n     could not pull marines from another part of Iraq because \n     ``there were tough fights going on everywhere.''\n       Colonel Kennedy said Company E's area was less dense, but \n     the pressure it put on the marines came to a boil on April 6, \n     2004, when the company had to empty its camp--leaving the \n     cooks to guard the gates--to deal with three firefights.\n       Ten of its troops were killed that day, including eight who \n     died when the Humvee they were riding in was ambushed en \n     route to assist other marines under fire. That Humvee lacked \n     even the improvised steel on the back where most of the \n     marines sat, Company E leaders say.\n       ``All I saw was sandbags, blood and dead bodies,'' Sergeant \n     Valerio said. ``There was no protection in the back.'' \n     Captain Royer said more armor would not have even helped. The \n     insurgents had a .50-caliber machine gun that punched huge \n     holes through its windshield. Only a heavier combat vehicle \n     could have withstood the barrage, he said, but the unit had \n     none. Defense Department officials have said they favored \n     Humvees over tanks in Iraq because they were less imposing to \n     civilians. The Humvee that trailed behind that day, which did \n     have improvised armor, was hit with less powerful munitions, \n     and the marines riding in it survived by hunkering down. \n     ``The rounds were pinging,'' Sergeant Sheldon said. ``Then in \n     a lull they returned fire and got out.''\n       Captain Royer said that he photographed the Humvees in \n     which his men died to show to any official who asked about \n     the condition of their armor, but that no one ever did. \n     Sergeant Valerio redoubled his effort to fortify the Humvees \n     by begging other branches of the military for scraps. ``How \n     am I going to leave those kids out there in those Humvees,'' \n     he recalled asking himself.\n       The company of 185 marines had only two Humvees and three \n     trucks when it arrived, so just getting them into his shop \n     was a logistical chore, Sergeant Valerio said. He also \n     worried that the steel could come loose in a blast and become \n     deadly shrapnel. For the gunners who rode atop, Sergeant \n     Valerio stitched together bulletproof shoulder pads into \n     chaps to protect their legs.\n       ``That guy was amazing,'' First Sgt. Bernard Coleman said. \n     ``He was under a vehicle when a mortar landed, and he caught \n     some in the leg. When the mortar fire stopped, he went right \n     back to work.''\n\n\n                            A Captain's Fate\n\n       Lt. Sean J. Schickel remembers Captain Royer asking a high-\n     ranking Marine Corps visitor whether the company would be \n     getting more factory-armored Humvees. The official said they \n     had not been requested and that there were production \n     constraints, Lieutenant Schickel said.\n       Recalls Captain Royer: ``I'm thinking we have our most \n     precious resource engaged in combat, and certainly the wealth \n     of our nation can provide young, selfless men with what they \n     need to accomplish their mission. That's an erudite way of \n     putting it. I have a much more guttural response that I won't \n     give you.'' Captain Royer was later relieved of command. \n     General Mattis and Colonel Kennedy declined to discuss the \n     matter. His first fitness report, issued on May 31, 2004, \n     after the company's deadliest firefights, concluded, ``He has \n     single-handedly reshaped a company in sore need of a leader; \n     succeeded in forming a cohesive fighting force that is \n     battle-tested and worthy.'' The second, on Sept. 1, 2004, \n     gave him opposite marks for leadership. ``He has been \n     described on numerous occasions as `dictatorial,' '' it said. \n     ``There is no morale or motivation in his marines.'' His \n     defenders say he drove his troops as hard as he drove \n     himself, but was wrongly blamed for problems like armor. \n     ``Captain Royer was a decent man that was used for a dirty \n     job and thrown away by his chain of command,'' Sergeant \n     Sheldon said.\n       Today, Captain Royer is at Camp Pendleton contesting his \n     fitness report, which could force him to retire. Company E is \n     awaiting deployment to Okinawa, Japan. Some members have \n     moved to other units, or are leaving the Marines altogether. \n     ``I'm checking out,'' Corporal Winn said. ``When I started, I \n     wanted to make it my career. I've had enough.''\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nproceed as in morning business for as much time as I may consume.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, a few minutes ago we had an agreement that \nwe would allow the Senator from Massachusetts to speak up to 25 minutes \nas in morning business and that the Senator would follow him with the \nsame amount of time. That is what we would intend to do. We thought \nthat would be satisfactory to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, may I proceed then?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I object, yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The Senator is \nrecognized under the previous order to speak for 25 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is correct.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. As in morning business.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to urge my \ncolleagues to explore ways to avoid a Senate vote on the nuclear, or \nconstitutional, option. It is anticipated that we may vote this week or \nthis month to reduce from 60 to 51 the number of\n\n[[Page S4633]]\n\nvotes to invoke cloture or cut off debate on judicial nominations. If \nthe Senate roll is called on that vote, it will be one of the most \nimportant in the history of this institution.\n  The fact is that all or almost all Senators want to avoid the crisis. \nI have repeatedly heard colleagues on both sides of the aisle say it is \na matter of saving face. But as yet we have not found the formula to do \nso.\n  I suggest the way to work through the current impasse is to proceed \nto bring to the floor circuit nominees, one by one, for up-or-down \nvotes. There are at least five and perhaps as many as seven pending \ncircuit nominees who could be confirmed or at least voted up or down. \nIf the straitjacket of party loyalty were removed by the Democrats, \neven more might be confirmed.\n  As a starting point, it is important to acknowledge that both sides, \nDemocrats and Republicans, have been at fault. Both sides claim they \nare victims and that their party's nominees have been treated worse \nthan the other's. Both sides cite endless statistics. I have heard so \nmany numbers spun in so many different ways that even my head is \nspinning. I think even Benjamin Disraeli, the man who coined the \nphrase, ``there are lies, damned lies, and statistics,'' would be \namazed at the creativity employed by both sides in contriving the \nnumbers in this debate.\n  The history of Senate practices has demonstrated that in the last 2 \nyears of President Reagan's administration and through 4 years of the \nadministration of President George Herbert Walker Bush, the Democrats \nslowed down the nomination process. When we Republicans won the 1994 \nelections and gained the Senate majority, we exacerbated the pattern of \ndelay and blocking nominees. Over the course of President Clinton's \npresidency, the average number of days for the Senate to confirm \njudicial nominees increased for district nominees as well as for \ncircuit nominees. That was followed by the filibuster of many qualified \njudicial nominees by the Democrats following the 2002 elections. In an \nunprecedented move, President Bush responded by making, for the first \ntime in the Nation's history, two recess appointments of nominees who \nhad been successfully filibustered by the Democrats. That impasse was \nthen broken when President Bush agreed to refrain from further recess \nappointments.\n  Against this background of bitter and angry recriminations, with each \nparty serially trumping the other to get even, or to dominate, the \nSenate now faces dual threats--one called the filibuster and the other \nthe constitutional or nuclear option, which rivals the United States-\nUnion of Soviet Socialist Republic confrontation of mutually assured \ndestruction. Both situations are accurately described by the acronym \nMAD.\n  We Republicans are threatening to employ the option to require only a \nmajority vote to end filibusters. The Democrats are threatening to \nretaliate by stopping the Senate agenda on all matters except national \nsecurity and homeland defense. Each ascribes to the other the \nresponsibility for blowing the place up. This gridlock occurs at a time \nwhen we expect a U.S. Supreme Court vacancy within the next few months. \nIf the filibuster would leave an eight-person Court, we could expect \nmany 4-to-4 votes, since the Court now often decides cases with a 5-to-\n4 vote. A Supreme Court tie vote would render the Court dysfunctional, \nleaving in effect circuit court decisions with many splits among the \ncircuits. So the rule of law would be suspended on many major issues.\n  In moving in the Judiciary Committee to select nominees for floor \naction, in my capacity as Chairman I have first selected William Myers \nbecause two Democrats had voted in the 108th Congress not to filibuster \nhim, and one candidate for the Senate in 2004, since elected, made a \ncampaign statement that he would vote to end the Myers filibuster and \nto confirm him. Adding those three votes to 55 Republicans, we were \nwithin striking distance to reach 60 or more.\n  I carefully examined Myers' record. Noting that he had opposition \nfrom some groups such as the Friends of the Earth and the Sierra Club, \nit was nonetheless my conclusion that his environmental record was \nsatisfactory, or at least not a disqualifier, as detailed in my \nstatement at the Judiciary Committee executive session on March 17 of \nthis year. To be sure, critics could pick at the Myers record as they \ncould at any Senator's record, but overall Myers was, in my opinion, \nworthy of confirmation.\n  I then set out to solicit others' views on Myers, including ranchers, \nloggers, miners, and farmers. In those quarters I found a significant \nenthusiasm for Myers' confirmation, so I urged those groups to have \ntheir members contact Senators who might be swing votes. I then \nfollowed up with personal talks to many of those Senators and found \nseveral prospects to vote for cloture. Then the screws of party loyalty \nwere applied and tightened and the prospects for obtaining the \nadditional few votes to secure cloture vanished.\n  I am confident if the party pressure had not been applied, the Myers \nfilibuster would have ended and he would have been confirmed. That \nresult could still be obtained if the straitjacket of party loyalty \nwere removed on the Myers nomination.\n\n  Informally, but authoritatively, I have been told the Democrats will \nnot filibuster Thomas Griffith or Judge Terrence Boyle. Griffith is on \nthe calendar now awaiting floor action, and Boyle is on the next agenda \nfor committee action. Both could be confirmed by the end of this month.\n  There are no objections to three nominees from the State of Michigan \nfor the Sixth Circuit--Richard Griffin, David McKeague, and Susan Bakke \nNeilson--but their confirmations are being held up because of \nobjections to a fourth nominee. I urge my Democratic colleagues to \nconfirm the three uncontested Michigan Sixth Circuit nominees and fight \nout the remaining fourth vacancy and Michigan District Court vacancies \non another day. The Michigan Senators do make a valid point on the need \nfor consultation on the other Michigan vacancies, and that can be \naccommodated.\n  In the exchange of offers and counteroffers between Senator Frist, \nthe majority leader, and Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, \nDemocrats have made an offer to avoid a vote on the nuclear or \nconstitutional option by confirming one of the four filibustered \njudges--Priscilla Owen, Janice Rogers Brown, William Pryor, or William \nMyers--with a choice to be selected by Republicans. An offer to confirm \nany one of those four nominees is in reality an explicit concession \nthat each is qualified for the court, and they are being held hostage \nas pawns in a convoluted chess game which has spiraled out of control.\n  If the Democrats believe each is qualified, a deal for confirmation \nfor any one of them is repugnant to the basic democratic principle of \nindividual fair and equitable treatment and further violates Senators' \noath on the constitutional confirmation process. Such dealmaking would \nfurther confirm public cynicism about what goes on in Washington behind \nclosed doors.\n  Instead, let the Senators consider each of the four without the \nconstraints of party line voting. Let us revert to the tried and tested \nmethod of evaluating each nominee individually.\n  By memorandum dated April 7, I circulated an analysis of Texas \nSupreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen's records demonstrating she was \nnot hostile to Roe v. Wade and that her decisions were based on solid \njudicial precedence. No one has challenged that legal analysis.\n  Similarly, I distributed a memorandum containing an analysis of Judge \nWilliam Pryor's record since he has been sitting on the Eleventh \nCircuit. It shows a pattern by Judge Pryor of concern to protect the \nrights of those often overlooked in the legal system. Similarly, no one \nhas refuted that analysis.\n  California Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers Brown has been \npilloried for her speeches. If political or judicial officials were \nrejected for provocative or extreme ideas and speeches, none of us \nwould hold public office. The fact is, the harm to the Republic, at \nworst, by confirmation of all pending circuit court nominees, is \ninfinitesimal compared to the harm to the Senate, whichever way the \nvote would turn out, on the nuclear or constitutional option.\n  None of these circuit judges could make new law because all are bound \nand each one has agreed on the record to follow U.S. Supreme Court \ndecisions. While it is frequently argued\n\n[[Page S4634]]\n\nthat Supreme Court decisions are in many cases final because the \nSupreme Court grants certiorari in so few cases, the circuit courts sit \nin panels of three so that no one of these nominees could unilaterally \nrender an unjust decision since at least one other circuit judge on the \npanel must concur.\n  While it would be naive to deny that ``quid pro quo'' and \n``logrolling'' are not frequent congressional practices, those \napproaches are not the best way to formulate public policy or make \ngovernmental decisions. The Senate has a roadmap to avoid ``nuclear \nwinter'' in a principled way. Five of the controversial judges can be \nbrought up for up-or-down votes on this state of the record. The others \nare entitled to individualized treatment on the filibuster issue. It \nmay be that the opponents of one or more of these judges may persuade a \nmajority of Senators that confirmation should be rejected. A group of \nRepublican moderates has, with some frequency, joined Democrats to \ndefeat a party-line vote. The President has been explicit in seeking \nup-or-down votes as opposed to commitments on confirmations.\n  The Senate has arrived at this confrontation by exacerbation as each \nside has ratcheted up the ante in delaying and denying confirmation to \nthe other party's Presidential nominees. A policy of consultation/\nconciliation could diffuse the situation.\n  This has already been offered by the Democrats informally, signaling \ntheir intentions not to filibuster Griffith or Boyle, and by offering \nno objections to the three Michigan nominees. Likewise, it has been \nreported that Senator Reid has privately told Republicans he does not \nintend to block votes on any Supreme Court nominee except in extreme \ncases. A public statement of confirmation with an amplification on what \nconstitutes ``extreme case'' could go a long way to diffusing the \nsituation.\n  Senator Schumer praised White House Counsel Gonzales during his \nconfirmation hearings for times in which now-Attorney General Gonzales \nconsulted with Senator Schumer on President Bush's judicial nominees \naffecting the State of New York. On April 11 of this year, a nominee \npushed by Senator Schumer, Paul Crotty, was confirmed for the federal \ncourt in New York. Both New Jersey Senators, Senators Torricelli and \nCorzine, approved all five district court nominations for their State \nin the 107th Congress. And in that Congress, Florida's Democratic \nSenators, Bob Graham and Bill Nelson, appointed representatives to a \ncommission which recommended federal judges to President Bush. \nPresident Bush recently nominated Minority Leader Harry Reid's pick for \nthe District Court for the District of Nevada.\n  So there have been some significant signs of consultation and \nconciliation by the Republicans on choices by Democratic Senators.\n\n  I have reason to believe the President is considering consultation \nwith the Michigan Senators on some federal judicial vacancies in their \nstate and perhaps beyond.\n  One good turn deserves another. If one side realistically and \nsincerely takes the high ground, there will be tremendous pressure on \nthe other side to follow suit. So far, the offers by both sides have \nbeen public relations maneuvers to appear reasonable to avoid blame and \nplace it elsewhere. Meanwhile, the far left and far right are urging \neach side to shun compromise. ``Pull the trigger,'' one side says. \n``Filibuster forever,'' the other side retorts. Their approaches would \nlead to extreme judges at each end of the political spectrum as control \nof the Senate inevitably shifts from one party to another.\n  The Senate today stands on the edge of an abyss. Institutions such as \nour Senate are immortal but not invulnerable. If we fail to step back \nfrom the abyss, we will descend into a dark protracted era of divided \npartisanship. But if we cease this aimless and endless game of \npolitical chicken, we could restore the Senate to its rightful place as \nthe world's greatest deliberative body. That will require courage, \ncourage from each Senator, courage to think and act with independence.\n  Our immortal Senate is depending on that courage. Now the question \nremains as to whether we have it.\n  Since the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics \navoided the nuclear confrontation in the Cold War by concessions and \nconfidence-building measures, why couldn't Senators do the same by \ncrossing the aisle in the spirit of compromise?\n  As a result of the time constraints, I have abbreviated the oral \npresentation of this statement. I ask unanimous consent the full text \nbe printed at the conclusion of this statement, including my statement \nwhich I now make that the text is necessarily repeated to a substantial \nextent of what I have delivered orally, but it is included so that a \nfull text may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to urge my \n     colleagues to explore ways to avoid a Senate vote on the \n     nuclear or constitutional option. It is anticipated that we \n     may vote this week or this month to reduce from 60 to 51 the \n     number of votes required to invoke cloture or cut off debate \n     on judicial nominations. If the Senate roll is called on that \n     vote, it will be one of the most important in the history of \n     this institution.\n       The fact is that all, or almost all, Senators want to avoid \n     the crisis. I have had many conversations with my Democratic \n     colleagues about the filibuster of judicial nominees. Many of \n     them have told me that they do not personally believe it is a \n     good idea to filibuster President Bush's judicial nominees. \n     They believe that this unprecedented use of the filibuster \n     does damage to this institution and to the prerogatives of \n     the President. Yet despite their concerns, they gave in to \n     party loyalty and voted repeatedly to filibuster Federal \n     judges in the last Congress.\n       Likewise, there are many Republicans in this body who \n     question the wisdom of the constitutional or nuclear option. \n     They recognize that such a step would be a serious blow to \n     the rights of the minority that have always distinguished \n     this body from the House of Representatives. Knowing that the \n     Senate is a body that depends upon collegiality and \n     compromise to pass even the smallest resolution, they worry \n     that the rule change will impair the ability of the \n     institution to function.\n       I have repeatedly heard colleagues on both sides of the \n     aisle say it is really a matter of saving ``face''; but, as \n     yet, we have not found the formula to do so. I suggest the \n     way to work through the current impasse is to proceed to \n     bring to the floor circuit nominees one by one for up or down \n     votes. There are at least five and perhaps as many as seven \n     pending circuit nominees who could be confirmed; or, at least \n     voted up or down. If the straightjacket of party loyalty were \n     removed, even more might be confirmed.\n       For the past 4 months since becoming Chairman of the \n     Judiciary Committee, my first priority has been to process \n     the nominees through committee to bring them to the floor. As \n     a starting point, it is important to acknowledge that both \n     sides, Democrats and Republicans, have been at fault. Both \n     sides claim that they are the victims and that their party's \n     nominees have been treated worse than the other's. Both sides \n     cite endless statistics. I have heard so many numbers spun so \n     many different ways that my head is spinning. I think even \n     Benjamin Disraeli, the man who coined the phrase, ``there are \n     lies, damned lies and statistics,'' would be amazed at the \n     creativity employed by both sides in contriving numbers in \n     this debate.\n       In 1987, upon gaining control of the Senate and the \n     Judiciary Committee, the Democrats denied hearings to seven \n     of President Reagan's circuit court nominees and denied floor \n     votes to two additional circuit court nominees. As a result, \n     the confirmation rate for Reagan's circuit nominees fell from \n     89 percent prior to the Democratic takeover to 65 percent \n     afterwards. While the confirmation rate decreased, the length \n     of time it took to confirm judges increased. From the Carter \n     administration through the first 6 years of the Reagan \n     administration, the length of the confirmation process for \n     both district and circuit court seats consistently hovered at \n     approximately 50 days. For Reagan's final Congress, however, \n     the number doubled to an average of 120 days for these \n     nominees to be confirmed.\n       The pattern of delay and denial continued through 4 years \n     of President George H.W. Bush's administration. President \n     Bush's lower court nominees waited, on average, 100 days to \n     be confirmed, which was about twice as long as had \n     historically been the case. The Democrats also denied \n     committee hearings for more nominees. President Carter had 10 \n     nominees who did not receive hearings. For President Reagan, \n     the number was 30. In the Bush Sr. administration the number \n     jumped to 58.\n       When we Republicans won the 1994 election and gained the \n     Senate majority, we exacerbated the pattern of delaying and \n     blocking nominees. Over the course of President Clinton's \n     presidency, the average number of days for the Senate to \n     confirm judicial nominees increased even further to 192 days \n     for district court nominees and 262 days for circuit court \n     nominees. Through blue slips and holds, 60 of President \n     Clinton's nominees were blocked. When it became clear that \n     the Republican-controlled Senate would not allow the \n     nominations to move forward, President Clinton\n\n[[Page S4635]]\n\n     withdrew 12 of those nominations and chose not to re-nominate \n     16.\n       After the 2002 elections, with control of the Senate \n     returning to Republicans, the Democrats resorted to the \n     filibuster on ten circuit court nominations, which was the \n     most extensive use of the tactic in the Nation's history. The \n     filibuster started with Miguel Estrada, one of the most \n     talented and competent appellate lawyers in the country. The \n     Democrats followed with filibusters against nine other \n     circuit court nominees. During the 108th Congress, there were \n     20 cloture motions on 10 nominations. All 20 failed.\n       To this unprecedented move, President Bush responded by \n     making, for the first time in the Nation's history, two \n     recess appointments of nominees who had been successfully \n     filibustered by the Democrats. That impasse was broken when \n     President Bush agreed to refrain from further recess \n     appointments.\n       Against this background of bitter and angry recriminations, \n     with each party serially trumping the other party to ``get \n     even'' or, really, to dominate, the Senate now faces dual \n     threats, one called the filibuster and the other the \n     constitutional or nuclear option, which rival the US/USSR \n     confrontation of mutually assured destruction. Both \n     situations are accurately described by the acronym ``MAD.''\n       We Republicans are threatening to employ the constitutional \n     or nuclear option to require only a majority vote to end \n     filibusters. The Democrats are threatening to retaliate by \n     obstructing the Senate on a host of matters. Each ascribes to \n     the other the responsibility for ``blowing the place up.''\n       The gridlock occurs at a time when we expect a United \n     States Supreme Court vacancy within the next few months. If a \n     filibuster would leave an 8 person court, we could expect \n     many 4 to 4 votes since the Court now often decides cases \n     with 5 to 4 votes. A Supreme Court tie vote would render the \n     Court dysfunctional, leaving in effect the circuit court \n     decision with many splits among the circuits, so the rule of \n     law would be suspended on many major issues.\n       In moving in the Judiciary Committee to select nominees for \n     floor action, I first selected William Myers because two \n     Democrats had voted in the 108th Congress not to filibuster \n     him, and one candidate for the Senate in 2004, since elected, \n     made a campaign statement that he would vote to end the Myers \n     filibuster and to confirm him. Adding those three votes to 55 \n     Republicans, we were within striking distance to reach 60 or \n     more. I carefully examined Myers' record. Noting that he had \n     opposition from some groups such as Friends of the Earth and \n     the Sierra Club, it was my conclusion that his environmental \n     record was satisfactory, or at least not a disqualifier, as \n     detailed in my statement at the Judiciary Committee Executive \n     Session on March 17, 2005. To be sure, critics could pick at \n     his record as they could at any Senator's record; but overall \n     Mr. Myers was worthy of confirmation.\n       I then set out to solicit others' views on Myers, including \n     the ranchers, loggers, miners, and farmers. In those \n     quarters, where I found significant enthusiasm for the Myers \n     confirmation, I urged them to have their members contact \n     Senators who might be swing votes. I then followed up with \n     personal talks to many of those Senators and found several \n     prospects to vote for cloture. Then the screws of party \n     loyalty were applied and tightened, and the prospects for \n     obtaining the additional few votes to secure cloture \n     vanished. I am confident that if party pressure had not been \n     applied, the Myers filibuster would have ended and he would \n     have been confirmed. That result could still be obtained if \n     the straitjacket of party loyalty were removed on the Myers \n     nomination.\n       Informally, but authoritatively, I have been told that the \n     Democrats will not filibuster Thomas Griffith or Judge \n     Terrence Boyle. Griffith is on the Senate calendar awaiting \n     floor action, and Boyle is on the next agenda for committee \n     action. Both could be confirmed by mid-May.\n       There are no objections to three nominees from the State of \n     Michigan for the Sixth Circuit: Richard Griffin, David \n     McKeague and Susan Bakke Neilson; but their confirmations are \n     held up because of objections to a fourth nominee. I urge \n     my Democratic colleagues to confirm the three uncontested \n     Michigan Sixth Circuit nominees and fight out the Fourth \n     Circuit vacancy and Michigan district court vacancies on \n     another day. The Michigan Senators make a valid point on \n     the need for consultation on the other Michigan vacancies \n     and that can be accommodated.\n       In the exchange of offers and counteroffers between Sen. \n     Frist, majority leader and Sen. Harry Reid, the Democrat \n     leader, Democrats have made an offer to avoid a vote on the \n     nuclear or constitutional option by confirming one of the \n     four filibustered judges: Priscilla Owen, Janice Rogers \n     Brown, William Pryor, or William Myers with the choice to be \n     selected by Republicans.\n       An offer to confirm any one of the those four nominees is \n     an explicit concession that each is qualified for the court \n     and that they are being held hostage as pawns in a convoluted \n     chess game which has spiraled out of control. If the \n     Democrats really believe each is unqualified, a ``deal'' for \n     confirmation for anyone of them is repugnant to the basic \n     democratic principle of individual, fair, and equitable \n     treatment and violates Senators' oaths on the constitutional \n     confirmation process. Such ``deal-making'' confirms public \n     cynicism about what goes on behind Washington's closed doors.\n       Instead, let the Senate consider each of the four without \n     the constraints of party line voting. Let us revert to the \n     tried and tested method of evaluating each nominee \n     individually. By memorandum dated April 7, 2005, I circulated \n     an analysis of Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen's \n     record demonstrating she was not hostile to Roe vs. Wade and \n     that her decisions were based on solid judicial precedent. No \n     one has challenged that legal analysis.\n       By memorandum dated January 12, 2005, I distributed an \n     analysis of decisions by Judge William Pryor that shows his \n     concern to protect the rights of those often overlooked in \n     the legal system. Similarly, no one has refuted that \n     analysis. California Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers \n     Brown has been pilloried for her speeches. If political or \n     judicial officials were rejected by provocative/extreme ideas \n     in speeches, none of us would hold public office.\n       The fact is that the harm to the Republic, at worst, by the \n     confirmation of all pending circuit court nominees is \n     infinitesimal compared to the harm to the Senate, whichever \n     way the vote would turn out, on the nuclear or constitutional \n     option. None of these circuit judges could make new law \n     because all are bound, and each one agreed on the record, to \n     follow U.S. Supreme Court decisions. While it is frequently \n     argued that circuit court opinions are in many cases final \n     because the Supreme Court grants certiorari in so few cases, \n     circuit courts sit in panels of three so that no one of these \n     nominees can unilaterally render an unjust decision since at \n     least one other circuit judge on the panel must concur.\n       While it would be naive to deny that the ``quid pro quo'' \n     and ``logrolling'' are not frequent congressional practices, \n     those approaches are not the best way to formulate public \n     policy or make governmental decisions. The Senate has a \n     roadmap to avoid ``nuclear winter'' in a principled way. Five \n     of the controversial judges can be brought up for up-or-down \n     votes on this state of the record. The others are entitled to \n     individualized treatment on the filibuster issue.\n       It may be that the opponents of one or more of these judges \n     may persuade a majority of Senators that confirmation should \n     be rejected. A group of Republican moderates has, with some \n     frequency, joined Democrats to defeat a party line vote. \n     The President has been explicit in seeking up-or-down \n     votes as opposed to commitments on confirmations.\n       The Senate has arrived at this ``confrontation by \n     exacerbation'' as each side ratcheted up the ante in delaying \n     and denying confirmation to the other party's Presidential \n     nominees. A policy of conciliation/consultation could diffuse \n     the situation. This has already been offered by the \n     Democrats, informally signaling their intentions not to \n     filibuster Griffith or Boyle. Likewise, it has been reported \n     that Senator Reid has privately told Republicans that he \n     doesn't intend to block votes on any Supreme Court nominees, \n     except in extreme cases. A public statement with an \n     amplification of what constitutes an ``extreme case'' could \n     go a long way.\n       Sen. Schumer praised White House Counsel Gonzales's \n     consultation with him on President Bush's judicial nominees. \n     On April 11, 2005, the President's nominee for the U.S. \n     District Court for the Southern District of New York, Paul \n     Crotty, supported by Senator Schumer, was confirmed. Both New \n     Jersey Senators, Bob Torricelli and Jon Corzine, approved all \n     five district court nominations for their state in the 107th \n     Congress. In the 107th Congress, Florida's Democratic \n     Senators, Bob Graham and Bill Nelson, appointed \n     representatives to a commission which recommended Federal \n     judges to President Bush.\n       President Bush recently nominated Minority Leader Harry \n     Reid's pick for the U.S. District Court for the District of \n     Nevada. I have reason to believe the President is considering \n     consultation with the Michigan Senators on some Federal \n     judicial vacancies in their State and perhaps beyond.\n       One good turn deserves another. If one side realistically \n     and sincerely takes the high ground, there will be tremendous \n     pressure on the other side to follow suit. So far, the offers \n     by both sides have been public relations maneuvers to appear \n     reasonable to avoid blame and place it elsewhere.\n       Meanwhile, the far left and the far right are urging each \n     side to shun compromise: pull the trigger; filibuster \n     forever. Their approaches would lead to extreme judges at \n     each end of the political spectrum as control of the Senate \n     inevitably shifts from one party to the other.\n       The Senate today stands on the edge of the abyss. \n     Institutions like the Senate are immortal but not \n     invulnerable. If we fail to step back from the abyss, we will \n     descend into a dark, protracted era of divisive partisanship. \n     But if we cease this aimless game of political chicken, we \n     can restore the Senate to its rightful place as the world's \n     greatest deliberative body. That will require courage. \n     Courage from each senator. Courage to think and act with \n     independence. Our immortal Senate is depending on our \n     courage. Do we have it?\n       Since the U.S. and USSR avoided a nuclear confrontation in \n     the Cold War by concessions and confidence-building measures, \n     why couldn't Senators do the same by crossing the aisle in \n     the spirit of compromise.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S4636]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 600 to Amendment No. 567\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Talent], for himself, and \n     Mr. Dodd, proposes an amendment numbered 600 to amendment No. \n     567.\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require notice regarding the criteria for small business \n         concerns to participate in Federally funded projects)\n\n       At the end of subtitle H of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 18__. NOTICE REGARDING PARTICIPATION OF SMALL BUSINESS \n                   CONCERNS.\n\n       The Secretary of Transportation shall notify each State or \n     political subdivision of a State to which the Secretary of \n     Transportation awards a grant or other Federal funds of the \n     criteria for participation by a small business concern in any \n     program or project that is funded, in whole or in part, by \n     the Federal Government under section 155 of the Small \n     Business Reauthorization and Manufacturing Assistance Act of \n     2004 (15 U.S.C. 567g).\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to discuss \nthis amendment which I am offering with Senator Dodd. It has been \naccepted by the managers on both sides, and I am grateful for that.\n  The amendment is the next step in lifting a very significant burden \noff minority contractors around the country who want to do business \nwith the Government. Very simply, it would direct the Secretary of \nTransportation to inform State and local governments that receive \nFederal dollars through the highway bill of a new law, a law that \nprovides that minority contractors who have already been certified as \n8(a) contractors under Federal law are automatically certified under \nState law as minority contractors on any contract that is funded in \nwhole or in part by Federal dollars. Let me explain the background.\n  As Senators know, the 8(a) Program is one of the programs that small \nbusinesses use to get certified as a minority contractor in doing \nbusiness with the Federal Government. State and local governments have \nsimilar certifications for doing business as a minority contractor with \ntheir governments. This has presented a serious obstacle for minority \nsmall businesses that want to do business or take advantage of goals or \nsetaside programs because they have in the past been required to get \nadditional certifications at both the State and local levels after \nalready having been certified under the Federal Government's 8(a) \nProgram. As a result, countless small minority-owned businesses have \nspent thousands and thousands of dollars and countless hours getting \ncertified at the State and local levels just to learn that the \ncontracting opportunity they originally sought was, by the time they \nwere certified, no longer open.\n  In short, getting multiple certifications at the State and local \nlevels after you have already done it at the Federal level is a time-\nconsuming, expensive, and unnecessary process that in the past has left \nmany highly qualified minority small business contractors shut out from \nthe competition of Government contracts. So last year, I added an \namendment on the JOBS bill that provides that section 8(a) contractors, \nthose who have already been certified on the Federal level, are \nautomatically certified as minority contractors in any State or local \nprogram funded in whole or in part by Federal dollars.\n  I have already heard from small businesses from Missouri and around \nthe country. I am pleased to report this provision is saving minority \nsmall business people thousands of dollars and many hours and a lot of \nheadaches. In many cases, it is making it possible for them to \nparticipate in programs and projects that they would not have been able \nto participate in in the past without maneuvering through the obstacles \nof getting additional State or local certifications. Now we need to get \nthe word out about the new law.\n  So today, the amendment of Senator Dodd and myself directs the \nSecretary of Transportation to inform State and local governments of \nthe new law that prohibits them from requiring federally certified 8(a) \nminority firms from obtaining State and local certifications on any \nState or local project that receives Federal funding.\n  This amendment is the natural followup to last year's law. It should \nnot cost money. It has the support of minority small business \nassociations around the country. I am pleased that it has majority and \nminority support on the Senate floor, and I am very pleased that the \nhandlers on both sides of the aisle have accepted the amendment.\n  I thank the National Black Chamber of Commerce, the United States \nHispanic Chamber of Commerce, as well as the Hispanic Chamber of \nGreater Kansas City, the Minority Business Council of St. Louis, and \nthe Hispanic Chamber of Metropolitan St. Louis for their continued \nsupport in providing 8(a) contractors equal access to all projects \nreceiving Federal funding.\n  I also want to thank the Senator from Connecticut for his work and \neffort on behalf of the amendment and his continued leadership on \nbehalf of small business issues. I urge the Senate to adopt the \namendment. I understand that the handlers are desirous of a rollcall \nvote so I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what was the request?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Ordering the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. TALENT. My understanding was that the handlers wanted the yeas \nand nays on the amendment. I will withdraw the request if that is not \nthe case.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 this evening the \nSenate proceed to a vote in relation to the Talent amendment, with the \ntime equally divided until the vote and no second-degree amendments in \norder to the amendment prior to the vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I have no problem voting on this Talent amendment. I am \ndisappointed that we have not been able to clear a resolution \nexpressing support for the withdrawal of troops from Georgia. The \nPresident is there today. I am so glad he is visiting Georgia. I was \nthere with a bipartisan congressional delegation a few weeks ago, and I \nrepeat I am disappointed we could not do this while he is in country.\n  The leaders of Georgia would be so ecstatic if we could do this. In \nGeorgia, there are leftovers from the Soviet Union military bases that \nare controlled by Russians, that are staffed by Russians. They will not \nleave that little country of Georgia. We have to do what we can in \nexerting influence to get Russia to pull their troops out of this \nlittle country. I hope the majority will look this resolution over and \nthat\n\n[[Page S4637]]\n\nit can be approved in the immediate future. It would have tremendous \nsignificance with our President being there at this present time.\n  So I have no objection to the request by my friend from Oklahoma.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader withdraws his \nreservation.\n  Without objection, the unanimous consent request is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the effort \nthat my colleague from Missouri is making. When the Senator from \nMissouri was in the House, he was chairman of the House Small Business \nCommittee when I was chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee. \nWe took great pride in the tremendous contribution that small business \nmade to our State, both in terms of the jobs they produced as well as \nthe tremendous boost that the small businesses were able to provide to \nour productive sector.\n  Again, I commend the Senator from Missouri for the action he took \nlast year to make sure that these minority small business contractors \ncould be qualified. This will go a long way toward easing the procedure \nto make sure that minority small business operations have a chance to \nget in on the work of the highway bill. It is very important that we \nmove forward with our highway construction, and having the minority \nsmall businesses providing jobs in their community and representing the \ncommunities that will be served is a very worthy goal.\n  This small measure would have a big impact. So I urge the adoption of \nthis amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  All time has expired. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander), the Senator from Mississippi \n(Mr. Cochran), the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi), the Senator from \nArizona (Mr. Kyl), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), and the \nSenator from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, yesterday was the 60th anniversary of the \nend of World War II in Europe. It was also, of course, Mother's Day. My \nspeechwriter Ann O'Donnell shared a letter with me her grandfather \nwrote that is a fitting remembrance of both occasions. It is a letter \nfrom a young Army private, 12th Armored Division, named Glenn H. \nWaltner. Stationed in Germany at the time, he wrote to his mother, Mrs. \nJ. J. Waltner in Freeman, SD.\n  The letter is postmarked 60 years ago today, May 9, 1945, though it \nwas written, actually, on May 3, 1945. It reads as follows:\n\n       Dearest Mother,\n       Mother's Day is only a short time away again. Since we \n     cannot be together, I'm taking this opportunity to thank you \n     for being my mother. You've always been all that any son \n     could ever ask a mother to be--kind, patient, loving, \n     considerate, and forgiving. Though Mother's Day comes but \n     once yearly, don't think you're not appreciated the other \n     [days of the year]. I thank God daily for the privilege of \n     having been your son.\n       [I] am well--have been moving so swiftly and far that mail \n     still hasn't reached us, nor can we mail letters often. \n     Shaved today for the first time in a long while and haven't \n     had my hair cut for months, I guess. Hear peace rumors daily, \n     but apparently, the Germans don't know a thing about it.\n       Happy Mother's Day--Love from your son, Glenn.\n\n  Mr. President, I imagine that many hundreds of letters just like this \nwent out 60 years ago to mothers all across our country. Letters went \nout as they waited patiently, praying for the safe return of their \ndear, beloved sons serving overseas during the war. Fortunately, just a \nfew short days after this particular letter was written, the rumors \nabout peace did become a reality as Hitler's Germany surrendered to \nAllied forces, bringing to an end almost 6 years of brutal, bloody \nbattle and an unparalleled threat to mankind in the Nazi's attempt to \ndestroy the Jewish race.\n  When I think about all those who served during World War II, I am \nreminded of a famous speech in William Shakespeare's play ``Henry V.'' \nThe title character attempts to rally his men with a St. Crispin Day \nspeech, a moving appeal to soldiers facing a vastly superior French \nforce. Shakespeare's Henry assures his men of their place in history, \ncreating the bond that links them all. An excerpt from that speech \nreads as follows:\n\n     And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,\n     From this day to the ending of the world,\n     But we in it shall be remember'd;\n     We few, we happy few, we band of brothers.\n\n  Stephen Ambrose, of course, in his book, ``Band of Brothers,'' also \nwrote about this fraternal bond that connects all warriors to one \nanother. Ambrose documented the journey of the men of Easy Company, E \nCompany, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, through their journey \nthrough World War II. While the men of the 506th seem at times lost in \nthe confusion and tragedy of war, Ambrose ends his book with a poignant \nreflection on what they encountered during the war. He wrote as \nfollows:\n\n       They found combat to be ugliness, destruction, and death, \n     and hated it. Anything was better than the blood and carnage, \n     the grime and filth, the impossible demands made on the \n     body--anything, that is, except letting down their buddies. \n     They also found in combat the closest brotherhood they ever \n     knew. They found selflessness. They found they could love the \n     other guy in their foxhole more than themselves. They found \n     that in war, men who love life would give their lives for \n     them.\n\n  Over the last couple of years, my staff and I have had the great \nprivilege of getting to know a group of World War II veterans who, like \nthe men of Easy Company, are, indeed, a band of brothers. They are a \nband of selfless, patriotic, quiet heroes who to this day, 60 years \nafter the end of the war, remain in close contact, staying in touch\n\n[[Page S4638]]\n\nwith one another and their families through e-mails, newsletters, and \nreunions. They also, to this day, continue to remember and honor those \nin their company who never made it home, those who were killed during \nthe fighting, those who will remain as they were at the time frozen in \ntheir youth.\n  I am speaking about the men of Company K, the most decorated company \nin the 409th Regiment of the 103rd Infantry Division, 6th Corps of the \n7th Army. The men of K Company, however, are not unique. The bonds they \nshare and the sacrifices they made are no different than the bonds and \nthe sacrifices of all those who served in World War II together.\n  Two years ago at this time, I spoke about the 58th anniversary of V-E \nDay and specifically about K Company. Since that time, my staff and I \nhave heard from many of the surviving members of K Company and their \nfamilies. We have learned a great deal about what so many men and women \nwent through both during and after the war.\n  I must say the connection my office and I have established with the \nmembers of K Company, soldiers who saw battle in Germany, France, and \nAustria, has been one of the most rewarding experiences I have had \nduring my entire time in Congress.\n  One of the members of K Company is my dad, Richard DeWine. In talking \nto both my mother and my father this past weekend about the end of the \nfighting in Europe 60 years ago, they remember vividly what happened, \nwhere they were 60 years ago yesterday. My mother remembers riding on a \nfiretruck during an impromptu celebration in my parents' hometown of \nYellow Springs, OH. She remembers that celebration after the \nannouncement was made of the German surrender.\n  My dad, half a world away at the time, remembers spending the night \nbefore in a foxhole near Innsbruck, Austria, the night before the \nsurrender. And he, like PVT Glenn Waltner who wrote in his letter to \nhis mother, my dad also heard rumors that the war was nearing an end. \nMy dad says the rumors were all over the place. But nevertheless, my \ndad stayed awake that night in that foxhole fearing that the enemy \nwould attack. He remembers thinking he saw German soldiers coming \ntowards them.\n\n  The next morning, and later when he talked to his comrades, his \nbuddies, when he compared notes with them, they thought the same thing, \nthat the Germans were coming after them, coming towards them. Yet they \nnever attacked that night, thank Heavens.\n  My dad says when the war did end the next day, he can still remember \ngroups of German troops surrendering, and then when he and his K \nCompany buddies went into Innsbruck, quite shortly thereafter he \nremembers the people of Innsbruck throwing flowers at them as they rode \ninto Innsbruck.\n  My parents' recollections and the letter I read on the Senate floor \nfrom Glenn Waltner are just a couple of examples of the many stories we \nall have heard about those who fought during World War II. It is \nthrough the stories of those who served over half a century ago that we \ncontinue to learn about history, about humanity, and about the \nsacrifices that were made by our parents, grandparents, those who made \nthe sacrifices. Sixty years later, we continue to learn from all those \nwho served in World War II. We continue to learn about honor, respect, \nloyalty, humility, and sacrifice.\n  I thank each of them for what they did, what they did for each one of \nus, and what they did for our country and what they did for the world, \nwhat they did over 60 years ago.\n  They fought so that we could know peace, so that we could remain \nfree. They will never be forgotten.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/09/senate-section/article/S4638-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4638-S4639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PROTECTING THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE COURTS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, inscribed on the Justice Department \nbuilding are the words: ``No free government can survive that is not \nbased on the supremacy of law.''\n  Aristotle said: ``Where the laws are not supreme, there demagogues \nspring up.''\n  And Balzac wrote: ``The soul of liberty is love of law.''\n  It is a free and independent judiciary that ensures the supremacy of \nlaw. It is a free and independent judiciary that guards against the \ndemagogue. It is a free and independent judiciary that protects the \nsoul of liberty.\n  As Montesquieu wrote in The Spirit of the Laws: ``There is no liberty \nif the judiciary power be not separated from the legislative and the \nexecutive.''\n  And as George Washington wrote to John Jay in 1789, when Washington \ninvited Jay to be Chief Justice: ``The Supreme Court must be recognized \nas the keystone of our political fabric.''\n  The effort by some to abridge the Senate's role in the confirmation \nof judges is nothing less than an effort to diminish the independence \nof the judiciary. That is the bottom line.\n  The Senate's rules and its paramount value of unlimited debate are \ncentral to preserving that independence of the judiciary. The Senate's \ninvolvement in the confirmation of judges helps to ensure that nominees \nhave the support of a broad political consensus. The Senate's \ninvolvement helps to ensure that the President cannot appoint extreme \nnominees. The Senate's involvement helps to ensure that judges are more \nindependent.\n  The Framers wanted the courts to be an independent branch of \ngovernment, helping to exercise the Constitution's intricate system of \nchecks and balances. The Senate's involvement in the confirmation of \njudges helps to ensure that the judiciary can be that more independent \nbranch. And that independence of the judiciary, in turn, helps to \nensure the protection of personal rights and liberties.\n  Just witness the Bill of Rights and the Constitution and the degree \nto which the court protects the Bill of Rights against improper \nencroachment by the legislative branch and in some cases by the \nexecutive branch.\n  The current fight over allowing the President to more easily gain \nconfirmation of Supreme Court Justices and Appellate Court judges \nrecalls another such effort by a President to affect the independence \nof the judiciary. It was in 1937, when President Franklin Roosevelt \ntried to pack the Supreme Court.\n  Roosevelt's effort to pack the Court failed in 1937 because enough \nSenators from his own party stood up to their President. They stood up \nfor the Constitution that they loved.\n  One of those Senators was Montana's Burton K. Wheeler.\n  Until then, Burt Wheeler, a Democrat, had been an ardent champion of \nNew Deal causes. But that changed with Roosevelt's effort to pack the \nCourt.\n  In his book about Lyndon Johnson, Master of the Senate, the historian \nRobert Caro recounts what happened:\n\n       Burton K. Wheeler of Montana, long a leader in Senate \n     fights for liberal causes, was coming to see that the Court \n     plan implied an alteration in the whole balance of \n     governmental power in favor of the White House. What, he \n     wondered, would come next? He refused to fight for this \n     cause. Wheeler was a senator other senators followed. \n     Roosevelt sent his aide Thomas G. Corcoran to him with an \n     offer. Its details would be a matter of dispute; at a very \n     minimum, Wheeler would be allowed to give `advice' on the \n     nominations of two of the six justices. Wheeler had accepted \n     other offers from Corcoran before, but he refused to do so on \n     the Court-packing plan. I'm going to fight it with everything \n     I've got,' he told Corcoran. The President hurriedly invited \n     his old friend Burt to dine at the White House that evening; \n     the Senator replied that the President had better `save the \n     plate for someone who persuaded more easily'.\n\n  And on the Senate floor, Senator Wheeler said:\n\n       I am saying to the Senator now that those connected with \n     the administration have said that they wanted six men upon \n     the Supreme Court whom they could trust, that they wanted men \n     on the Court who would decide cases as they wanted them to be \n     decided. That is the issue. It can be camouflaged as much as \n     one wants to attempt to camouflage it, but the truth is that \n     it is impossible to get away from the fact that this is a \n     proposal to make the Supreme Court of the United States \n     subservient to the executive branch of government.\n\n\n[[Page S4639]]\n\n\n  Similar words could be said about the current effort to abridge the \nSenate's involvement in securing the independence of the Court. There \nare those connected with the current effort who want people ``on the \nCourt who would decide cases as they want them to be decided.'' And it \nis impossible to deny that the effect of the current proposal would be \n``to make the Supreme Court of the United States [more] subservient to \nthe executive branch of government.''\n  There is no doubt about it. That is the intent. That is the result.\n  On the Senate floor, Senator Wheeler also said:\n       I say the step proposed is one of the most dangerous ever \n     suggested, and it will set the most dangerous precedent of \n     which I can conceive. You can bring political pressure to \n     bear on me, you can say, `You you have to go along because of \n     the fact that the administration wants it.' You can say that \n     the privilege of appointing postmasters will not be accorded \n     me; you can say that I will get no more projects for my \n     State, worthy or unworthy; you can say what you please; but I \n     say to Mr. Farley [the Postmaster General and Chairman of the \n     Democratic National Committee] and to everyone else that, so \n     far as I am concerned, I will vote against this proposal \n     because it is morally wrong, morally unsound. It is a \n     dangerous precedent, . . . it gets us nowhere, it is an \n     expedient, it is a stopgap and dictatorial, and so far as I \n     am concerned, if I am the only man in the Senate to do so, I \n     shall vote against it.\n\n  Once again, similar words could be said about the current effort to \nabridge the Senate's involvement in securing the independence of the \nCourt. ``[T]he step proposed is one of the most dangerous ever \nsuggested.'' ``[I]t will set the most dangerous precedent . . . .'' \n``[I]t is morally wrong, morally unsound.'' ``[I]t gets us nowhere . . \n. .'' ``[A]nd so far as I am concerned, if I am the only man in the \nSenate to do so, I shall vote against it.''\n  I only hope that enough Senators from the majority will have the \ncourage that Burt Wheeler had, to stand up to their President, and stop \nthis effort to undermine our Nation's cherished checks and balances.\n  In the latter half of the 19th Century, James Bryce was the \nAmbassador of the United Kingdom to the United States. In 1888, he \nwrote of America's independent judiciary:\n\n       The Supreme Court is the living voice of the Constitution . \n     . . . It is the guarantee of the minority who, when \n     threatened by the impatient vehemence of the majority, can \n     appeal to this permanent law, finding the interpreter and \n     enforcer thereof in a Court set high above the assaults of \n     faction.\n\n  For two centuries, the Senate's rules have protected the rights of \nthe minority party, Democrats and Republicans alike, and thereby \nprotected the independence of the judiciary. After two centuries, it \nwould be a mistake to change those rules.\n  As the Senior Senator from Tennessee, the Majority Leader, wrote in a \nforward to a book published last year entitled Senate Procedure and \nPractice, and I quote:\n\n       [A]bove all, together the Senate's rules and practices form \n     a whole. It is a whole that faithfully reflects the Framer's \n     design and ambition for the body. It is a whole that remains \n     true to the Senate's two paramount values: unlimited debate \n     and minority rights.\n  [U]nlimited debate and minority rights.\n\n  That is what the leader wrote just a year ago: unlimited debate is \none of the paramount values in the Senate's rules. Minority rights is \nthe other one.\n  ``[U]nlimited debate'' allows Senators to protect ``minority \nrights.'' The Senate's rules help to protect the independent judiciary. \nThe Senate's rules help to ensure that no one party has absolute power. \nThe Senate's rules help to give effect to the Framer's conception of \nchecks and balances to protect the rule of law.\n  John Locke wrote in The Second Treatise on Government:\n\n       Wherever law ends, tyranny begins.\n  John F. Kennedy said:\n\n       Law is the strongest link between man and freedom.\n  And the Greek philosopher Heraclitus of Ephesus wrote:\n\n       The people should fight for their law as for their city \n     wall.\n  I urge my Colleagues on the other side of the aisle to fight for this \ncity wall. I urge them to defend the independence of the judiciary. One \nhallmark that sets the United States apart from most countries in the \nworld is a strong, independent judiciary: not bullied by the \nlegislative branch, not bullied by the executive branch; an independent \njudiciary.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to defend that independence and I urge them to \nreject this effort to overturn the Senate's rules.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, finally, after much laboring, this massive \nnew substitute, or managers' amendment, is before us.\n  This reflects the tremendous amount of work our staffs have done over \nthe recess as well as the many long weeks and months our committees \nworked on it. It is not what anybody would say is a perfect bill. \nEverybody would like more money, and many would like more money in \ndifferent places. But given the constraints under which we operated, \nthis is the best we have been able to produce. Obviously, we hope that \nafter the Senate may complete action on the supplemental, which I \nunderstand may be coming up, we would like to move as quickly as we can \non this bill.\n  The leadership on both sides has told us they want to finish the bill \nby this week. That is an ambitious schedule but, frankly, the current \nextension of the highway transportation bill runs out at the end of \nthis month. The only hope we have of meeting that deadline and getting \na bill to the President is to get it to conference this week. The \nconference is going to be difficult because of the different approach \ntaken by the House than the approach we have taken.\n  The approach we have taken, and the EPW Committee, on highway funds \nis one of bipartisan cooperation, to use formulas to assure that the \nhighway money goes to States on the various indicators of need built \ninto the formulas. I happen to think the formulas undercut the \ncrossroads of the United States. I will be showing, when people talk \nabout needs in other areas, a map by the U.S. Department of \nTransportation showing the level of heavy traffic on the roads in \nAmerica. It is no surprise that that heavy traffic goes right through \nthe middle of America, through Oklahoma, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana. \nWe are the crossroads States. We are not doing as well in our States as \nmany of the other States that are asking for more money.\n  When people say they want more money, my response is: I do, too. But \nwe have attempted to follow the pattern established in previous \nformulas. And if people want to change it, I have some changes I would \nlike to make as well and include the crossroads where the traffic is \nthe heaviest and where, in my State and in Oklahoma, we now recognize \nthe fact that deaths caused by inadequate highways is a legitimate \nconcern for a bill called SAFETEA.\n\n[[Page S4640]]\n\n  I am delighted, through the leadership of Senator Inhofe and the \ncooperation and leadership of our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, Senator Jeffords, Senator Baucus, Senator Reid, who worked very \nclosely with me on the last highway bill, we brought our section to the \nfloor as well as the sections from the other committees. We look \nforward as soon as we can to going back to work on it. We would ask any \nof our colleagues who have amendments, particularly to our section, you \nhave had a chance to look at it, we have had a chance to work on it. I \nhope we can move quickly because the time will be short and the bill is \nimportant.\n  With that, I thank the chairman of our committee and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Missouri. \nHe has worked tirelessly, as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nTransportation of the Environment and Public Works Committee. You \nalways hear that working with Senators is like herding cats. I think we \nhave learned that on this bill. It is very difficult. Of course, by the \nvery nature of the Senate, one person can hold things up. But I don't \nthink there is anything this year we are going to be dealing with that \nis more important than our highway reauthorization bill.\n  Last year we passed a good bill out of committee. We were unable to \nget it out of conference last year. This year I am sure that situation \nwill change.\n  As we work on it this week, I agree it is an ambitious schedule to \nget it done, but I am anticipating we are going to have to at some \npoint file cloture. I would certainly tell any of the staff and Members \nwho might be listening that we are open for business. We now have the \nsubstitute amendment on the floor so we know what we are working with. \nWe would ask them to bring their amendments down. We can't do anything \nwith an amendment unless we see it, unless we have it before us.\n  I know what is going to happen if we don't do that. When we come up \nagainst some deadlines, trying to get this passed out of here at the \nend of the week, people are going to be saying they didn't have time. \nYou have time now. We are waiting for you. We want you to bring them \ndown.\n  The substitute amendment we adopted has some changes in it. We did \nincrease some highway funding by $8.9 billion. That would be the \nhighway funding portion. That was over the EPW bill that we passed out \nof the committee that we chair. And it includes a 5.1-percent increase \nin both the apportioned and allocated programs. It also includes the \nminimum rate of return for donor States to 91 percent and working up to \n92 percent. This is not as ambitious as it was last year, but last year \nwe were dealing with a bill that was $318 billion over a 6-year period. \nThis is going to be about 251 over the remaining 5 years of the 6-year \nreauthorization.\n  Last year's bill, the donee status was improved more dramatically so \nthat for States such as my State of Oklahoma and the State of the \nPresiding Officer, we would have that up to a minimum of 95 percent. \nThat means we would get back at least 95 percent of that which is \ncollected in our respective States. We can't quite do that with the \nsmaller amount, but certainly it is enhanced a little bit with the \namendment we just agreed to consider.\n  So we have a lot in here, and they are going to be a part of this \nbill. Again, the only thing that needs to be done right now is for \namendments to be brought to the floor. By the way, Senator Bond is \nright when he says there are a lot of Members who are not happy, and \nthey won't have enough money in their States. I am not happy about the \namount of money in Oklahoma. There was a lot of compromising over a 3-\nyear period to get us where we are today. However, if you are not \nhappy, offer an amendment. We will consider it and we will vote on it. \nThat is what the process is all about.\n  We have a lot to be done in the next 4 days. We expect that we are \ngoing to be doing it. We are encouraging people to come down with their \namendments.\n  I chair the EPW committee, but we also have some titles in here by \nthe Banking Committee, the Commerce Committee, and the Finance \nCommittee. We have been talking to those chairmen. I believe they are \nready. So we could entertain amendments on any of these sections or any \nof the titles of the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/09/senate-section/article/S4640-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to call the \nattention of my colleagues to the important issue of improving the \ncoordination of health care for the Nation's senior citizens. As we all \nknow, large numbers of senior citizens receive health care and \ntreatment from several different physicians. In fact, more than half \nthe patients with serious chronic conditions have three or more \ndifferent physicians.\n  Too often, a physician seen by a patient is not aware of the tests \nand prescriptions that other physicians have ordered for the same \npatient. The result is that the patient receives care that is often \nduplicative, and may actually be harmful.\n  We need new ideas on improving care coordination for patients--\nparticularly for senior citizens.\n  The Boston Globe recently published a thoughtful article by Lois \nQuam, CEO of the Ovations division of UnitedHealth Group, describing \nnew initiatives to improve the quality of health services provided to \nsenior citizens. It includes a number of worthwhile recommendations, \nand I urge my colleagues to take the time to read it carefully. We can \nclearly do better, much better, in this important area of health care.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article ``Rx For Medicare'' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Mar. 11, 2005]\n\n                            Rx for Medicare\n\n                             (By Lois Quam)\n\n       Social Security reform will dominate politics and be the \n     subject of much debate for months to come. However, failure \n     to address rising healthcare costs, by changing the way \n     Medicaid and Medicare-funded care is delivered, could \n     undermine efforts to ensure financial security for many \n     retirees.\n       Over the next 75 years, the government is expected to pay \n     more than $27 trillion in healthcare benefits promised to \n     seniors seven times its Social Security obligations for that \n     period. Further, a recent analysis by Urban Institute \n     researchers suggests that by 2040, typical seniors might have \n     to spend approximately one-fifth of their Social Security \n     benefits on Medicare premiums.\n\n[[Page S4641]]\n\n       Simply cutting funds for federal healthcare programs would \n     be shortsighted and potentially devastating to millions of \n     older Americans, including more than 960,000 in \n     Massachusetts. A better way to control costs while improving \n     the quality of healthcare is to rethink the traditional \n     models for delivering care.\n       Chronically ill patients with five or more medical \n     conditions made up only 20 percent of all Medicare \n     beneficiaries in 2004 but accounted for more than two-thirds \n     of the program's $302 billion in costs. In any single year, \n     such patients are likely to fill up to 20 separate \n     prescriptions, visit emergency rooms a dozen times or more, \n     and require hospitalization at least five times. Too often \n     these patients must make sense of an array of confusing, even \n     conflicting, information. This fragmentation of care can lead \n     to poor health outcomes that are unnecessarily costly and \n     draining for patients and physicians alike. We can reduce \n     this burden by organizing our resources more efficiently and \n     effectively.\n       The traditional Medicare and Medicaid fee-for-service \n     systems are structured primarily to provide acute care, not \n     to meet the needs of the chronically ill. These latter \n     patients require comprehensive management of their health, \n     emphasizing coordination of multiple treatments, health \n     maintenance, and prevention of disease. While there has not \n     been any effort to implement a care model of this kind on a \n     national scale, many smaller programs have already \n     demonstrated this approach's value in reducing costs and \n     improving care.\n       For example, On Lok SeniorHealth, a community-based \n     organization in San Francisco, provides seniors with a \n     complete program of health services preventive, acute, and \n     rehabilitative care along with home healthcare, social \n     services, and such personal assistance as meal delivery, \n     transportation, and help with prescriptions. On Lok's \n     patients report better overall health and fewer acute-care \n     needs and hospitalizations than comparable groups of Medicare \n     beneficiaries.\n       I have also seen the impact of this care model at my own \n     company. Our Evercare plans identify the most costly, at-risk \n     patients and deliver care within a system of careful \n     monitoring and management. At the heart of this system are \n     practitioners who coordinate multiple services, facilitate \n     communication between providers and patients, and ensure \n     integration of treatments.\n       Evercare is also working with Massachusetts to ensure this \n     kind of care is brought to seniors living in nursing homes, \n     as well as to home-based elderly and disabled. The \n     Massachusetts Senior Care Options program provides enrollees \n     with hands-on medical care coordination as well as home care \n     support services, such as outfitting the home for special \n     needs, housekeeping, transportation to physicians' offices, \n     and meals.\n       Again, there is evidence that the model can reduce costly, \n     redundant services while improving patient care. Federally \n     commissioned studies of Evercare programs in several states \n     showed that they slashed hospitalizations in half while \n     gaining a 97 percent satisfaction rating from participating \n     families. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \n     point to Evercare as the model for the Special Needs Plans \n     included in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. In Texas, \n     another program using this model saved more than $100 million \n     in two years and improved seniors' access to services.\n       The long-term survival of Medicaid and Medicare may depend \n     on the wide adoption of this approach, whether it is offered \n     by private companies such as Ovations or not-for-profit \n     programs like On Lok. We have an opportunity to do so for the \n     chronically ill within the framework of the Medicare \n     Modernization Act's Special Needs plans. However, both the \n     public and private sectors need to do a much better job of \n     analyzing the effectiveness of alternative-care models and \n     applying evidence-based lessons on a nationwide basis.\n       By working together, public and private leaders have the \n     opportunity to improve the quality of life for more than 41 \n     million older Americans and conserve Medicare resources. This \n     issue also affects younger generations, who must have the \n     security of knowing that their parents, and then they \n     themselves, will be well cared for as they age. But we need \n     to move quickly, beginning this year. If we wait until \n     Washington deals with Social Security and other issues on its \n     agenda, we may simply run out of time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/09/senate-section/article/S4641-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF JOHN BOLTON\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof John Bolton, the President's nominee for U.S. representative to the \nUnited Nations with the rank of Ambassador.\n  The President, together with his principal Cabinet officers, has put \ntogether an extraordinary national security team. John Bolton will be a \nvaluable addition to this team.\n  The President and his Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, have \nexpressed their confidence that John Bolton has the experience and \nskills to represent the United States at the United Nations and to \ncarry out the President's priorities to strengthen and reform the U.N. \nI concur in the confidence they placed in the nominee.\n  John Bolton has had a long and distinguished career in public service \nand in the private sector. Most recently, he has served for the past 4 \nyears as the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security Affairs. In that capacity, Secretary Bolton \nworked to build a coalition of over 60 countries to help combat the \nspread of weapons of mass destruction through the Proliferation \nSecurity Initiative, PSI. He was a leader in creating the G8 Global \nPartnership to, in effect, ``multilateralize'' the Nunn-Lugar nuclear \nthreat reduction concept by inviting other nations to join the United \nStates in helping to eliminate and safeguard dangerous weapons and \ntechnologies which remain in the countries of the former Soviet Union.\n  Previously, John Bolton has served as Assistant Secretary of State \nfor International Organization Affairs, as an Assistant Attorney \nGeneral in the Department of Justice, and many years ago he held \nseveral senior positions in the Agency for International Development. \nHe has also had a distinguished legal career in the private sector.\n  Mr. Bolton has at times advocated or represented controversial \npositions which have sparked controversy. But he has done so with a \nfrankness and assertiveness that demonstrate his strongly held beliefs. \nAs this committee, and later the full Senate, considers this \nnomination, we should keep in mind the words of Secretary Rice: ``The \nPresident and I have asked John Bolton to do this work because he knows \nhow to get things done. He is a tough-minded diplomat, he has a strong \nrecord of success and he has a proven track record of effective \nmultilteralism . . . John, you have my confidence and that of the \nPresident.''\n  Given the enormity of problems facing the U.N. today, we have an \nobligation to send a strong-minded individual to help constructively to \nsolve these problems and to regain the confidence of the American \npeople in the continuing need for the U.N.\n  I share the President's and the Secretary's expectation that John \nBolton will faithfully represent the United States' interests and \nenthusiastically advance the President's goal of making the United \nNations a stronger, more effective international organization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/09/senate-section/article/S4641-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4641-S4642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PRAYER AT SCHOOL BOARD MEETINGS\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, last Thursday was designated as a National \nDay of Prayer. I began the day at a prayer breakfast with the people of \nTangipahoa, LA, whose school board was recently the subject of a \nFederal court ruling against prayer at board meetings.\n  This February 24 ruling, by U.S. District Court Judge Ginger Berrigan \nof New Orleans, was filed by an unnamed individual with the backing of \nthe American Civil Liberties Union. The purpose of the lawsuit was to \nstop prayers at Tangipahoa Parish School Board meetings.\n  In her ruling against the school board, Judge Berrigan said:\n\n     [i]n officially promoting a religious practice at its \n     governmental meetings, the board is doing what its schools \n     and teachers cannot do, favor religion over non-religion and \n     endorse particular religious faiths.\n\n  If this ruling stands, school boards in other parts of Louisiana as \nwell as school boards across the country could be subjected to similar \nlawsuits.\n  Many have joined me in criticizing this February 24 ruling, including \nthe Democratic Governor of Louisiana, Kathleen Blanco, who called for \nthe school board to appeal the decision to the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. As stated by Governor Blanco:\n\n       I believe that such prayers are entirely appropriate, \n     constitutional, and in keeping with a practice in our nation \n     that dates back to the Continental Congress.\n\n  I could not agree more with that statement, and I am delighted that \nthe school board on May 1, 2005 voted unanimously to appeal the \ndistrict court's ruling.\n  To me, this February 24 ruling seems like another attempt by Federal \ncourts to legislate from the bench--especially when you consider that \nother lawmaking bodies are allowed to hold prayer. Here in the Senate, \nwe routinely open with a prayer, as does the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and as do State legislatures across the Nation.\n  In 1983, the U.S. Supreme Court held, in the case of Marsh v. \nChambers, that\n\n[[Page S4642]]\n\nthe practice of opening legislative sessions with prayer has become \npart of the fabric of our society. To invoke divine guidance on a \npublic body entrusted with making the laws is not a violation of the \nEstablishment Clause, but rather is simply an acknowledgement of \nbeliefs widely held among the American people, said the Court.\n  Voluntary prayer in elected bodies should not be limited to prayer in \nState legislatures and Congress. School boards are deliberative bodies \nof adults. They are similar to a legislature in that they are elected \nby the people, act in the public interest, and are open to the public \nfor voluntary attendance.\n  And let's not forget that this Nation was founded on the principle of \nfreedom of religion. Not freedom from religion but freedom of religion. \nThe Framers intended that the U.S. Constitution would bar the \nGovernment from enacting any law that favors one religious denomination \nover another, not prevent any mention of religion or reference to God \nin civic dialogue. The Framers recognized that freedom to practice \nreligion and to express religious thought is a fundamental and \nalienable right belonging to all Americans.\n  The ACLU, which backed this lawsuit against the school board, has \ncriticized those of us who have called for the school board to appeal \nthe district court ruling. I do not share the ACLU's opinion, and more \nimportantly, the people of Louisiana do not share the ACLU's opinion.\n  It is a fact that Americans often turn to their elected officials for \nrelief, especially after being rebuffed by courts. As stated by the \nnonpartisan Congressional Research Service:\n\n       With regard to religious liberty, the origin and growth of \n     an individual's right to believe or not believe, and the \n     safeguarding of that right, have occurred almost entirely \n     outside the courtroom. The regular political process has \n     protected the religious freedom of minorities as well as and \n     often better than the courts.\n\n  In short, it is not unusual for Congress to advance religious liberty \nbeyond what is available from the judiciary.\n  On April 29 I introduced a resolution, S. Res. 132, expressing the \nUnited States Senate's support for the practice of prayer at the \nbeginning of school board meetings. U.S. Congressman Bobby Jindal has \nintroduced a similar measure in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  I want to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Coburn, Mr. Grassley, \nand Mr. DeMint for their cosponsorship of S. Res. 132. I urge my other \ncolleagues to support this resolution, which recognizes that prayer \nbefore school board meetings is a protected act in accordance with \nfundamental principles upon which this Nation was founded.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/09/senate-section/article/S4642-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SUPPORTING RESPONSIBLE GUN STORAGE LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, two separate accidental shootings in \nDetroit on April 22 of this year left one 13-year-old boy dead and a 9-\nyear-old boy critically wounded. These tragedies should remind us again \nthat much more must be done to prevent access to guns by children.\n  According to published reports, both of these shootings involved \nchildren playing with guns inside their own homes. In both cases, the \nguns accidentally discharged and shot the victim in the head. In \nreference to the accidental shooting of the 9-year-old boy, Lieutenant \nJames Tolbert of the Detroit Police Department commented, ``This is an \nunfortunate and needless incident that would have been prevented if \npeople would make sure that a weapon in the home is secure and out of \nreach.'' In addition, Lieutenant Tolbert suggested that similar \nshootings could be prevented through the use of trigger locks or the \nstorage of ammunition separate from the gun.\n  Recent research supports Lieutenant Tolbert's suggestions. A study \npublished in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that \nthe application of responsible gun storage measures can significantly \nreduce the risk of unintentional shooting or suicide by minors using a \ngun. According to the study, when ammunition in the home is locked up, \nthe risk of such injuries is reduced by 61 percent. Simply storing \nammunition separately from the gun reduces such occurrences by more \nthan 50 percent.\n  According to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, teenagers \nand children are involved in more than 10,000 accidental shootings in \nwhich close to 800 people die each year. Reducing the number of \naccidental shootings involving children and teenagers requires that \ncommonsense gun storage measures be adopted.\n  During the 108th Congress, I joined with 69 of my colleagues in \nvoting for Senator Boxer's trigger lock amendment. Senator Boxer's \namendment would have required that all handguns sold by a dealer come \nwith a child safety device, such as a lock, a lock box, or technology \nbuilt into the gun itself that would increase the security of the \nweapon while in storage. Although the underlying gun industry immunity \nbill to which this amendment was attached was later defeated, the \nsupport for Senator Boxer's proposal is clear.\n  Requiring that guns be stored in a responsible manner could have \nprevented many of the accidental shootings we have seen in Detroit and \naround the country. I am hopeful that Congress will work to limit \nchildren's access to guns so that fewer families will have to endure \nthe loss of their child because of a preventable accident.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/09/senate-section/article/S4642-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nHONORING IOWA FINALISTS WE THE PEOPLE: THE CITIZEN AND THE CONSTITUTION \n                          NATIONAL COMPETITION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the students from \nCentral Academy in Des Moines, IA who recently participated in the We \nthe People: The Citizen and the Constitution national finals in \nWashington, DC The annual competition is the culmination of the \nstudents' extensive study of the American system of constitutional \ndemocracy. The team from Central Academy won the State competition, \nearning the honor of representing Iowa in the national finals from \nApril 30 through May 2, 2005. I am also proud to say that they won a \nunit award for their impressive performance on unit 3.\n  Unfortunately, I was in Iowa during the national finals this year so \nI was unable to meet with the students from Iowa as I customarily do. \nHowever, I am always impressed by how knowledgeable and politically \nastute the students are who have been through this program and I \nunderstand this year's group of students was no exception. I know \nIowans can be very proud to have had them representing Iowa.\n  The We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution program is run by \nthe Center for Civic Education with the help of federal funding. The \nprogram provides an excellent curriculum and valuable professional \ndevelopment opportunities for teachers, giving students a solid \ngrounding in the history, philosophy, and practice of our American \nsystem of constitutional democracy. The result is young people who are \nmore politically aware, more engaged, and more equipped to be good \ncitizens.\n  In closing, I would like to recognize the Central Academy students \nwho participated in this program, Emily Burney, Julia Busiek, Kate \nConlow, Tim Di Iulio, Jon Hill, Lisa Jefferson, Alix Liftka-Reselman, \nPhillip Miller, Ben Miller-Todd, David Nolan, Caroline Rendon, Andrew \nTatge, Erin Turner, Emily Varn, and their teacher, Michael Schaffer. \nThey can all be very proud of their knowledge and accomplishments.

Mr. President, I would like to briefly discuss my vote \nin favor of cloture on the nomination of Stephen Johnson to be the \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency EPA. I have always \nbelieved that the President should be granted significant deference in \nselecting his\n\n[[Page S4643]]\n\nCabinet and close advisers. Unlike judicial nominees, the EPA \nAdministrator will serve for 4 years at the President's discretion.\n  Furthermore, the President made a good choice. Stephen Johnson, who \nhas served the country for 24 years as a career EPA employee, is a \nwell-qualified nominee who enjoys broad public support. When his \nnomination was considered by the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee this spring, the committee approved his nomination by a vote \nof 17-1. He will serve the country well as Administrator of the EPA.\n  I share my colleagues' concerns about the administration's refusal to \nprovide the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee with EPA's \nanalysis of the clean air bills pending before the Senate. I am proud \nto cosponsor Senator Jeffords' Clean Power Act, and I believe that the \nadministration's Clear Skies proposal is woefully inadequate. I agree \nthat the information Senator Carper has requested from EPA is vitally \nimportant to evaluate the differing clean air regulation proposals. \nEPA's refusal to turn over its analysis indicates that its own data do \nnot lend support to the Clear Skies initiative. Disclosure of \nGovernment data to the public is a cornerstone of our democracy, and \nthis administration has continually attempted to avoid congressional \noversight.

To restore credibility to the agency that is supposed \nto safeguard human health and the environment, Administrator Johnson \nshould release this information immediately.\n  Nonetheless, I do not believe that the administration's refusal to \nprovide this information should stand in the way of this qualified \nnominee leading the Nation's Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/09/senate-section/article/S4643-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SOUTH MOUNTAIN PEACE ACTION\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to praise a group of my \nconstituents working toward the noble goal of peace. This group is \ncalled South Mountain Peace Action, and its members are active in \nMaplewood and South Orange, NJ. Peace Action members have circulated a \npetition in their community about the war in Iraq. The petition was \nsigned by more than 1,200 concerned New Jerseyans, so I think it is \nimportant for Congress to take note of their actions.\n  The Peace Action petition discusses the staggering costs of the Iraq \nWar, both in terms of American lives and taxpayer dollars. As of today, \nmore than 1,600 American troops have died and nearly 12,000 have been \nwounded in action. We have now lost over 50 people with ties to New \nJersey. I have attended several funerals for New Jersey's fallen \nsoldiers, and each funeral is a difficult, emotional experience. I have \nalso been to Walter Reed Army Hospital and I have seen firsthand the \ndebilitating injuries suffered by our troops.\n  The taxpayer costs of the war are also staggering. So far, the war \nand reconstruction of Iraq have cost more than $200 billion, and the \nspigot of taxpayer funds continues to run. Originally, Secretary of \nDefense Donald Rumsfeld told us that war in Iraq would cost ``under $50 \nbillion,'' but due to a lack of planning and terrible decisions by the \nBush administration, the costs are skyrocketing.\n  This war is tainted by the faulty information that the President \nprovided the Nation and the world about Saddam Hussein's supposed \nstockpile of weapons of mass destruction. But our troops are there and \nwe must support them. And, in my view, we must work to stabilize Iraq \nand bring our troops home as soon as possible.\n  Thanks to groups such as Peace Action, our communities are speaking \nup about the costs of this war. I hope that their activism will bring \npositive results for our Nation and for our troops in Iraq and their \nfamilies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/09/senate-section/article/S4643-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO KIP JANVRIN\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a native \nIowan and a remarkable athletic champion, Kip Janvrin. Late last month, \njust 3 months shy of his 40th birthday, he accomplished the amazing \nfeat of winning the decathlon at the Drake Relays for the 15th time. \nOverall, Kip has finished 85 of the 88 decathlons he has entered since \n1983. He has won 38 of them, which is a world record.\n  The Drake Relays are one of the Nation's most prestigious track and \nfield events, held each spring at Drake Stadium in Des Moines. This \nyear, the 96th annual Drake Relays, Kip took the field for the last \ntime in an event, the decathlon, that he has dominated at Drake for 22 \nyears.\n  Over the years, the words Drake Relays and Kip Janvrin have become \nvirtually synonymous. From Jesse Owens to Wilma Rudolph, Gwen Torrance, \nCarl Lewis and Michael Johnson, the Drake Relays have seen almost all \nof the great Olympians in track and field. But one Olympian, Kip \nJanvrin, has been a dominant presence for more than two decades, \ncompeting in what is arguably the most grueling and demanding event in \nall of sports.\n  If the cheers at Drake are especially loud for Kip, it is because he \nis a native son of Iowa, raised in Panora and a graduate of Simpson \nCollege in Indianola. It is fitting that the last year for the original \nDrake Stadium will also be the last year that this American original \ncompetes in the Relays.\n  Kip is one of the top-ranked decathletes in the world, and he is the \noldest active U.S. competitor in this extraordinarily demanding event. \nThe decathlon is a 10-event competition which takes place over 2 days. \nIt includes the 100-meter dash, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400 \nmeter dash, 110 meter hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin and 1,500 \nmeter run. Kip began competing in the decathlon in 1983, and quickly \nexcelled in all 10 events.\n\n  While attending Simpson College, Kip competed many times in the Drake \nRelays. His first victory came in 1987. His 15 championships at the \nDrake Relays are the most by any athlete in the history of that event. \nIn 1998, he was inducted into the Drake Relays Hall of Fame. During his \nyears at Simpson, he earned three NCAA titles in the decathlon, and two \nmore NCAA titles in individual events. He was inducted into the Simpson \nHall of Fame in 1998, and the NCAA Division III Track and Field Hall of \nFame in 2004.\n  Kip's accomplishments are nothing short of amazing. He holds the \nworld records in career victories, in scores over 7,000 points, and in \nconsecutive finishes. He also holds the world record for the double \ndecathlon, a demanding event involving every event in track and field, \nexcept for the marathon and walks.\n  Kip won the decathlon at the 1995 Pan American Games. As a member of \nthe U.S. Olympic team at the 2000 Games in Sydney, Australia, he was \nthe oldest decathlete ever to compete for the United States. In 2001, \nhe won the decathlon at the USA Outdoor Championships. Last year, Kip \ncame in second at the Drake Relays, the first time in 9 years that he \ndid not come in first. However, Kip took the loss in stride, because \nthe victor was his protege, Travis Goepfert, also a native of Panora, \nIA.\n  Kip is currently in his 15th year as co-head coach at Central \nMissouri State University in Warrensburg. He and his wife, Teresa, have \ntwo sons, Jaxon, age 9, and Mason, age 7.\n  So as Kip Janvrin savors a victory in his final Drake Relays, I \nextend my congratulations and best wishes. With his self discipline, \nhis commitment to excellence, and his enormous human decency, he \nrepresents Iowa at its very best. Win or lose, he has always been a \ntrue champion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/09/senate-section/article/S4643-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4643-S4644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n         CELEBRATION OF SEX DIFFERENCES IN HEALTH AWARENESS DAY\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, May 8 to 14 is National Women's \nHealth Week and a time that we should take a careful look at the state \nof women's health in this country and in particular look at the lack of \nequality that still exist\n\n[[Page S4644]]\n\nfor women in access to health care. I have long been concerned about \nthe status of women's health care policies in the United States. That \nis why I have supported several bills and policy changes to improve \nwomen's health status.\n  For too long, the Federal Government failed to recognize the health \ndifferences between men and women. For example, for many years clinical \ntrials run by the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, often excluded \nwomen. As a result, safety and efficacy standards failed to take into \naccount the physiological differences between men and women. That is \nwhy I have worked with the FDA to increase the number of women included \nin these important clinical trials.\n  One way to ensure that we continue to make steady improvements on \nwomen's health issues is to ensure that our public health agencies work \nin a coordinated manner to consider the public health impact on women \nof a range of health issues. We can accomplish this goal by passing the \nWomen's Health Offices Act, which statutorily establishes Offices of \nWomen's Health at all of our public health agencies.\n  While we have made progress we need to continue efforts to focus on \nthe fact that women's health research is key to the future of improving \nand saving more lives. As a result of such research, death rates have \ndecreased for women with tumors of the cervix, breast, uterus, and \novary. Quality of life has also improved for cancer patients through \nthe development of less invasive surgical techniques, organ-sparing \ntreatments, and better control of pain and nausea related to \nchemotherapy.\n  Women's health is an issue I take very seriously. My two sisters both \nhad breast cancer and died of the disease, in a time before regular \nmammograms and improved treatment methods were widely used or \navailable.\n  I believe that we must work together in a bipartisan manner to \nrefashion our health care system so that all Americans, especially \nwomen, have access to the high quality care they deserve at an \naffordable price.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/09/senate-section/article/S4644-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                           TRIBUTE TO INTERNS\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I extend my appreciation to \nmy spring 2005 class of interns: Sarah Krantz, Matt Hill, Lauryn \nDouglas, Matt Drake, Stephanie Strasko, John Anderson, Ben Taylor, \nStacey Shin and Kathryn Anderson. Each of them has been of tremendous \nassistance to me and to the people of Iowa over the past several \nmonths.\n  Since I was first elected to the Senate in 1984, my office has \noffered internships to young Iowans and other interested students. \nThrough their work in the Senate, our interns have not only seen the \nlegislative process, but also personally contributed to our Nation's \ndemocracy.\n  It is with much appreciation that I recognize Sarah, Matt, Lauryn, \nMatt, Stephanie, John, Ben, Stacey and Kathryn for their hard work this \nspring. It has been a delight to watch them take on their assignments \nwith enthusiasm and hard work. I am very proud to have worked with each \nof them. I hope they take from their spring a sense of pride in what \nthey have been able to accomplish, as well as an increased interest in \npublic service and our democratic system and process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/09/senate-section/article/S4644-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/09/senate-section/article/S4644-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/09/senate-section/article/S4644-4", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   ENROLLED JOINT RESOLUTIONS SIGNED\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 2005, the \nSecretary of the Senate, on May 4, 2005, during the adjournment of the \nSenate, received a message from the House of Representatives announcing \nthat the Speaker has signed the following enrolled joint resolutions: \n\n       H.J.

A bill to include claims for injuries and death due to \nexposure during certain time periods form fallout emitted during the \nGovernment's above-ground nuclear tests in Nevada that exposed \nindividuals who lived in the downwind affected area in the State of \nMontana; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, in Montana, when someone does something to \nhurt someone else, they make it right. Not just because it is the right \nthing to do, but because in this State we shoot straight and take \nresponsibility for our actions that's why I'm working to bring some of \nthat Montana ethic to Washington to get the Federal Government to make \namends for actions that have caused too many Montanans great pain and \nsuffering.\n  Nuclear testing in Nevada during the 1950's threw blooms of \nradioactive Iodine-131, I-131, high into the atmosphere. Those who were \naffected are sometimes referred to as ``Down Winders'' because the wind \ncarried the poisonous iodine north to Montana where gravity finally \nkicked in and the radioactive material settled to the ground. It \neventually got into the milk supply--one of the primary sources of \nIodine 131--and disproportionately affected milk drinkers. And who \ndrinks milk? Children and babies, who are the most vulnerable in \nsociety.\n  Iodine-131 is absorbed by the thyroid--the organ of the body that \nuses iodine to produce important hormones. It can take between 20 and \n40 years, but eventually the damage caused by Iodine-131 manifests \nitself as thyroid cancer. I've had cancer, and I understand the \nphysical, mental and emotional pain that follows this terrible disease. \nI know the pain, and it is time that the government made right the harm \nit has caused to people in my State of Montana.\n  In 1990, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act or RECA was signed \ninto law. This measure provided financial compensation for victims \nliving downwind of the Nevada Test Site to the tune of $50,000 per \nperson. The law covered select counties in Nevada, Utah and Arizona. \nLater, this Act was amended to include compensation for uranium miners \nin Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, \nUtah, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.\n  However, Montana, with 15 of the 25 counties with the highest dosage, \nMeagher, Broadwater, Beaverhead, Jefferson, Powell, Judith Basin, \nMadison, Fergus, Gallatin, Petroleum, Lewis and Clark, Blaine, Silver \nBow, Chouteau and Deer Lodge, single most affected county in the United \nStates, Meagher, is the only State in the affected region to receive no \nRECA compensation at all. If that doesn't sound right, it's because \nit's not.\n  Montanans have experienced unbelievably high rates of thyroid cancer. \nBetween 1989 and 2003, the national rate of thyroid cancer increased by \n38 percent. In that same timeframe, Montana's rate increased by a \nwhopping 127 percent. And yet, Montana is the only State in the region \nthat is excluded from RECA. In 2000, the rate of reported thyroid \ncancer in Montana was 17.5 times greater than the national rate. And \nyet, Montana is the only State in the region that is excluded from \nRECA.\n  On April 28, 2005, at the request of Congress, a report was released \nby the National Academy of Sciences. The 500-page report confirms the \ninadequacy of current RECA compensation. Most importantly, it supports \nthe fact that Montana was one of the worst affected States. The fact is \nthat folks in Montana were involuntarily subjected to increased risk of \ninjury and disease in order to serve the national security interests of \nthe United States. Moreover, they deserve our compassion and support. I \nstrongly encourage my colleagues to support the expansion of RECA to my \nState of Montana.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 979. A bill to strengthen United States capabilities to secure \nsealed sources of nuclear materials from terrorists; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Safe Storage \nof Radiological Materials Act of 2005 to prevent sealed radioactive \nsources, which can be used to create ``dirty bombs,'' from getting into \nthe hands of terrorists. This bill is similar to S. 1045, the Low-Level \nRadioactive Waste Act, which I introduced in 2003.\n  Since September 11, 2001, the Congress has faced the challenge of \nanticipating where the next attack on the United States will come from \nand in what form it will come. It is important to weigh where to invest \nprecious security resources, knowing everything can't be protected. \nMany vulnerabilities deserve serious attention. Some can be addressed \nwith relative ease.\n  Thousands of unwanted sealed radioactive sources are currently held \nby the private sector, research institutions, and medical laboratories \nwhere these sources are generally unprotected and accessible. An April \n2003 report I requested from the Government Accountability Office, GAO, \nentitled ``Nuclear Proliferation: DOE Action Needed to Ensure Continued \nRecovery of Unwanted Sealed Radioactive Sources,'' stated that ``if \nthese sealed sources fell into the hands of terrorists, they could be \nused as simple and crude but potentially dangerous radiological \nweapons, commonly called dirty bombs.'' Most experts agree that it \nwould not require much scientific expertise or funding to cobble \ntogether a dirty bomb from radioactive material. In other words, the \nrequired materials are accessible and the assembly is relatively \nrudimentary.\n  The GAO report focused on greater-than-class-C, GTCC, sealed sources. \nGTCC radiological sources are the ``high end'' of the continuum of low-\nlevel radioactive waste. Class A, B, and C wastes can generally be \ndisposed of at existing commercial disposal facilities. But wastes that \nexceed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's criteria for Class C, known \nas greater-than-class-C wastes, are potent enough that they cannot be \ndisposed of at existing facilities. While GTCC wastes are not as \ndangerous as high-level radioactive waste and therefore are not \nconsidered the highest security priority, they are the most potent of \nlow level waste and necessitate progressively more stringent disposal \nrequirements.\n  The Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments of 1985, P.L. 99-\n240, required the Department of Energy, DOE, to provide a facility for \ndisposing of all GTCC radioactive waste, including GTCC sealed sources \nthat are no longer utilized by their owners. GAO found that little to \nno work had been done to designate a permanent disposal site. Although \nDOE has said that the facility will be up and running by 2007, it seems \nunlikely as they have only just begun the necessary environmental \nimpact statement process.\n  In 1999, DOE created the Off-Site Source Recovery Project, OSRP, to \nrecover unwanted GTCC sealed sources and temporarily house them at the \nDepartment of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory. According to GAO \ntestimony before the Senate Energy Committee in September 2004, \napproximately 10,000 GTCC sealed sources from about 160 sites across \nthe U.S. had been recovered to date. However, approximately 8,000 \nsources still remained in\n\n[[Page S4649]]\n\ninsecure facilities at the time of the hearing.\n  The job is not done, but the National Nuclear Security Administration \n(NNSA), the division within DOE responsible for the U.S. Radiological \nThreat Reduction, USRTR, previously the OSRP, has made great strides. \nSince I first introduced S. 1045, the Low Level Radioactive Waste Act, \nin May 2003, the prioritization of off-site recovery of GTCC sources \nhas heightened. DOE received a $10 million supplemental for the program \nin 2003 and the President's fiscal year 06 budget proposes funding the \nUSRTR at $12.75 million, up 69 percent from the fiscal year 05 enacted \nlevel of $7.54 million.\n  Earlier this month, NNSA called to let me know it intended to remove \n100 sources of cobalt-60, which is GTCC, from the University of Hawaii.\n  The University had been trying to get DOE, the owners of the \nmaterial, to dispose of the sources for years. The radioactive material \nwas used in an irradiator and loaned to the University back in the \n1960s for agricultural research. I am grateful that NNSA stepped up its \nrecovery of unneeded radiological sources and helped to relieve the \nburden of guarding potentially dangerous material from the University \nadministration.\n  The progress made by NNSA, while appreciated and laudable, is \nnonetheless a first step. Without the designation of a permanent \ndisposal facility for GTCC waste, DOE will run out of temporary storage \nspace. The Department already encountered problems finding a place to \nstore strontium-90, cesium-137, and plutonium-239, all GTCC sources \nthat have unique storage requirements. A permanent disposal facility \nthat can accommodate all GTCC waste must be identified.\n  The Safe Storage of Radiological Materials Act of 2005 would require \nDOE to report to Congress on the current situation and future plans for \ndisposal alternatives for GTCC radioactive waste and the cost and \nschedule to complete an environmental impact statement and record of \ndecision on a permanent disposal facility for GTCC radioactive wastes. \nMy bill would also require DOE to provide Congress with a plan for the \nshort-term recovery of GTCC radioactive waste until a permanent \nfacility is available. This legislation parallels the recommendations \nof the April 2003 GAO report, and I believe enactment of this bill is \ncritical to securing sealed sources of nuclear material.\n  Twenty years is too long to wait for an agency to do its job. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 979\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Safe Storage of Radiological \n     Materials Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DISPOSAL OF CERTAIN LOW-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) according to the report of the National Commission on \n     Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, more than 2 dozen \n     terrorist groups, including al Qaeda, are pursuing chemical, \n     biological, radiological, and nuclear materials;\n       (2) according to the report of the National Commission on \n     Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, the United States \n     is a prime target for weapons made with chemical, biological, \n     radiological, and nuclear materials;\n       (3) the Department of Energy estimates that about 10,000 \n     sealed sources of greater-than-Class C low-level radioactive \n     waste (as defined in section 61.55 of title 10, Code of \n     Federal Regulations) will become unwanted and will have to be \n     disposed of through the Department of Energy by 2010;\n       (4) the Department of Energy--\n       (A) does not have adequate resources or storage facilities \n     to recover and store all unwanted sources of greater-than-\n     Class C low-level radioactive waste; and\n       (B) has not identified a permanent disposal facility;\n       (5) a report by the Government Accountability Office \n     entitled ``Nuclear Proliferation: DOE Action Needed to Ensure \n     Continued Recovery of Unwanted Sealed Radioactive Sources'' \n     states that ``[t]he small size and portability of the sealed \n     sources make them susceptible to misuse, improper disposal, \n     and theft. If these sealed sources fell into the hands of \n     terrorists, they could be used as simple and crude but \n     potentially dangerous radiological weapons, commonly called \n     dirty bombs.''; and\n       (6) the Government Accountability Office report further \n     states that ``[c]ertain sealed sources are considered \n     particularly attractive for potential use in producing dirty \n     bombs because, among other things, they contain more \n     concentrated amounts of nuclear material known as `greater-\n     than-Class-C material.' ''\n       (b) Responsibility for Activities To Provide Storage \n     Facility.--The Secretary of Energy shall provide to Congress \n     official notification of the final designation of an entity \n     within the Department of Energy to have the responsibility of \n     completing activities needed to provide a facility for safely \n     disposing of all greater-than-Class C low-level radioactive \n     waste.\n       (c) Reports and Plans.--\n       (1) Report on permanent disposal facility.--\n       (A) Plan regarding cost and schedule for completion of eis \n     and rod.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with \n     Congress, shall submit to Congress a report containing an \n     estimate of the cost and a proposed schedule to complete an \n     environmental impact statement and record of decision for a \n     permanent disposal for greater-than-Class C radioactive \n     waste.\n       (B) Analysis of alternatives.--Before the Secretary of \n     Energy makes a final decision on the disposal alternative or \n     alternatives to be implemented, the Secretary of Energy \n     shall--\n       (i) submit to Congress a report that describes all \n     alternatives under consideration, including all information \n     required in the comprehensive report making recommendations \n     for ensuring the safe disposal of all greater-than-Class C \n     low-level radioactive waste that was submitted by the \n     Secretary to Congress in February 1987; and\n       (ii) await action by Congress.\n       (2) Short-term plan for recovery and storage.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy shall submit \n     to Congress a plan to ensure the continued recovery and \n     storage of greater-than-Class C low-level radioactive sealed \n     sources that pose a security threat until a permanent \n     disposal facility is available.\n       (B) Contents.--The plan shall address estimated cost, \n     resource, and facility needs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n  S. 980. A bill to provide state and local governments with financial \nassistance that will increase their ability and effectiveness in \nmonitoring convicted sex offenders by developing and implementing a \nprogram using global positioning systems to monitor convicted sexual \noffenders or sexual predators released from confinement; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I commend the leadership.\n  I rise to address the Senate on the subject of sexual predators. We \nhave certainly had our fill of these people who prey on children in the \nState of Florida. The Nation has recently joined Florida in mourning \nthe deaths of two young girls murdered by registered sex offenders. In \nMarch, an attacker walked in to--\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Certainly.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Could I inquire as to how long you would like to address \nthe Senate in morning business.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. About 5 minutes.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma. I know this is a \nsubject that he is quite concerned with. The Nation was gripped with \nthe news of this sexual predator who walked into the unlocked home of a \n9-year-old, Jessica Lunsford, in Homossassa, FL, took her from her \nbed--I want the Senator from Oklahoma to listen to the emotion in my \nvoice. He walked into her unlocked home, took her from her bed, raped \nher, and then buried her alive. The man who is charged is a registered \nsex offender, previously convicted of molesting a minor, but law \nenforcement had lost track of him. In fact, he was living within 150 \nfeet of Jessica Lunsford.\n  To add insult to injury, he was working at an elementary school.\n  Unfortunately, it did not stop there. About a month later, 13-year-\nold Sarah Lunde was abducted from her home in Rushkin, FL, and she was \nmurdered. Her confessed killer is her mother's ex-boyfriend, who is \nalso a convicted sex offender.\n  In our State alone, we have over 30,000 registered sex offenders, and \nthere are more than 300,000 nationwide. The Bureau of Justice \nStatistics has provided data showing that 70 percent of all the men in \nprison for a sex crime were men whose victim was a child.\n\n[[Page S4650]]\n\n  In 2003, the Justice Department published a report on recidivism \nrates of sex offenders, and it has produced some disturbing statistics. \nThe Department of Justice tracked 9,691 male sex offenders released \nfrom 15 State prisons, including Florida. They tracked them for a 3-\nyear period and found that 40 percent of the sex offenders who re-\noffended did so within the first year, and within 3 years of their \nrelease from prison, 5.3 percent of those sex offenders were rearrested \nfor another sex crime. Is this beginning to tell us a story? Half of \nthe sex offenders tracked in this study included men who molested \nchildren, and within the first 3 years of their release from prison, \n3.3 percent of these convicts were rearrested for another sex crime \nagainst a child.\n  In the wake of the two recent tragedies in Florida, of Jessica \nLunsford and Sarah Lunde, the State legislature passed a law that will \nprovide tougher sentences for child sex offenders, and aid law \nenforcement in effectively monitoring those sex offenders. This law \nwill require sex offenders, released back into our communities, to wear \na bracelet that will have a global positioning system track them.\n  I applaud the initiative by our State, and I believe now there ought \nto be an appropriate Federal response to be supportive of the States \nand local governments that want to address this problem. The technology \nis there, but it is expensive. To be effective, tough laws on these \nsexual predators of children must be properly funded, and I believe it \nis worth properly funding them to protect our children.\n  Today I am introducing this bill, the Sexual Predator Effective \nMonitoring Act, which will provide $30 million in grants to States that \nestablish programs under their State law to get tougher on child sex \noffenders released back into a community and to get tougher on them \nwith more effective monitoring and tracking. This bill directs the \nAttorney General to award grants to those States to assist them in \ncarrying out programs to outfit sexual offenders with an ankle bracelet \nthat will track them using global positioning systems.\n  In the first year, I am suggesting that this bill offer $10 million \nin grants. In the second year, $20 million, and then we would have to \ncome back and readdress the issue. The Attorney General then would be \ndirected to issue a report so we could go on with future extension of \nthe bill. There are no silver bullets to stop these sexual predators \nfrom preying on our children, but I believe tough laws, such as the new \nFlorida statute, are going to go a long way in preventing these sexual \noffenders from reoffending.\n  Nine-year-old Jessica Lunsford's confessed rapist and murderer was \nliving only within 150 feet of her home, but law enforcement officers \ndid not know where he was because he failed to notify them of his \nchanged address. Law enforcement also did not know he was working in a \nnearby elementary school, nor did the school know they had a registered \nsex offender on school property.\n  GPS monitoring systems, when properly used, will assist law \nenforcement in knowing where these child sex offenders are and \npreventing them from going into restricted areas like elementary \nschools. We owe it to our children to do all we can to make sure that \nwe keep them safe. That is why I am introducing this bill today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 980\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sexual Predator Effective \n     Monitoring Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) in recent years we have seen multiple cases of \n     convicted sexual offenders serving probation abducting and \n     murdering young children;\n       (2) several states have begun the development and \n     implementation of outfitting convicted sexual offenders with \n     Global Positioning Systems to track their movements while on \n     probation;\n       (3) the employment of these devices will assist law \n     enforcement in tracking the movements and location of \n     probationers in real time to within 10 ft. of their location;\n       (4) Global Positioning System tracking will permit law \n     enforcement to ensure that convicted sex offenders do not go \n     to areas restricted according to the terms of their \n     probation;\n       (5) Global Positioning Systems will serve to deter sexual \n     predators from re-offending as they will know that their \n     movements are monitored and tracked by law enforcement; and\n       (6) in the event that a convicted sexual offender commits \n     an additional sex offense while on probation and monitored \n     with a Global Positioning System, the Global Positioning \n     System technology will aid law enforcement in the \n     investigation of these crimes by quickly determining the \n     location of sexual offenders within the area of the suspected \n     crime.\n\n     SEC. 3. SEXUAL PREDATOR MONITORING PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Grants Authorized.--\n       (1) In general.--The Attorney General is authorized to \n     award grants and contracts to State and local governments to \n     assist such States and local governments in--\n       (A) carrying out programs to outfit sexual offenders with \n     electronic monitoring units; and\n       (B) the employment of law enforcement officials necessary \n     to carry out such programs.\n       (2) Duration.--The Secretary shall award grants under this \n     Act for a period not to exceed 3 years.\n       (b) Application.--\n       (1) In general.--Each State or local government desiring a \n     grant under this Act shall submit an application to the \n     Attorney General at such time, in such manner, and \n     accompanied by such information as the Attorney General may \n     reasonably require.\n       (2) Contents.--Each application submitted pursuant to \n     paragraph (1) shall--\n       (A) describe the activities for which assistance under this \n     Act is sought; and\n       (B) provide such additional assurances as the Attorney \n     General determines to be essential to ensure compliance with \n     the requirements of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 4. PROPORTIONAL SHARE.\n\n       The Attorney General shall ensure that each State with \n     eligible programs receives a proportional share of funding \n     under this Act based on the total number of eligible States \n     and the population of sex offenders to be monitored with \n     global positioning systems in those States.\n\n     SEC. 5. DEFINITION.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``sexual offender'' means an offender \n     18 years of age or older who commits a sexual offense against \n     a minor.\n\n     SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2006 and $20,000,000 for fiscal \n     year 2007 to carry out this Act.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than April 1, 2007, the Attorney \n     General shall report to Congress--\n       (1) assessing the effectiveness and value of this Act; and\n       (2) making recommendations for continuing funding and the \n     appropriate levels for such funding.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Truth in \nEmployment Act, a bill I previously introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives to stem the harm done to companies by salting, a union \ntactic that is causing material economic damage to small businesses \neveryday in this country.\n  There is a basic disagreement over the definition of salting. While \nunion supporters and the NLRB have defined the term as the ``placing of \nunion members on non-union job sites for the purpose of organizing,'' \nit has been widely documented that the true motivation of many salts is \nsimply to increase the cost of doing business for non-union \ncontractors, regardless of the wishes of the employer's bona fide \nemployees.\n  Salting is much more than someone seeking employment for the purpose \nof union organizing. It is an attempt to interfere with business \noperations, harass employees, and cause economic harm through illegal \nactivities and frivolous legal complaints against employers. Union \norganizers who fail to convince employees to organize will use salting \nto shut down non-union companies, often going to extreme lengths, \nincluding preventing deliveries to job sites and destroying building \nsupplies.\n  In my own State of South Carolina, salting has resulted in the loss \nof hundreds of jobs. In Sumter, South Carolina, the Yuasa Exide battery \nplant was targeted by a union.\n  Union salts infiltrated the plant, and when employees there did not \nunionize, the union retaliated by sabotaging product, causing work slow \ndowns, making verbal threats and threatening phone calls, and putting \nnails in people's tires. Union leaders threatened to shut down the \nplant and they did just that. Six hundred and fifty people were laid \noff because the Yuasa Exide plant could not afford the increased cost \nto\n\n[[Page S4651]]\n\nthe business of defending itself and its employees from the union \nsalting campaign. Yuasa Exide, which was the first tenant in Sumter's \nindustrial park, had been there since 1965 and provided high-tech, \ngood-paying jobs in a rural area, was forced to close its doors because \nof salting.\n  The impacts of salting are felt by many. Companies see increased \ncosts from having to defend themselves against labor relations \ncomplaints as well as lost hours of productivity from having to fight \nthese charges. Consumers are impacted by salting when they experience \nincreased costs and higher prices. Moreover, Federal agencies spend \nuntold sums to investigate claims that are later found to be without \nmerit, forcing taxpayers to effectively subsidize union activity.\n  To put it bluntly, salting is a job killer. At a time when we are \nworking in Congress to enact policies which will spur job growth and \nensure future economic prosperity, salting abuses stand directly in the \nway of these goals. We can no longer allow American jobs to suffer at \nthe hands of Washington labor bosses.\n  To prevent salting abuses from causing more harm to employers, I am \nintroducing the Truth in Employment Act which amends section 8(a) of \nthe National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to make clear that an employer \nis not required to hire any person who seeks a job in order to promote \ninterests unrelated to those of the employer. This bill in no way \ninfringes upon any rights or protections otherwise accorded employees \nunder the NLRA. Employees will continue to enjoy their right to \norganize. The bill merely seeks to alleviate the legal pressures \nimposed upon employers to hire individuals whose overriding purpose for \nseeking the job is to disrupt the employer's workplace or otherwise \ninflict economic harm designed to put the employer out of business. \nThis bill in no way infringes upon any rights or protections otherwise \naccorded employees under the NLRA, or any other employment statute.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 983\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Truth in Employment Act of \n     2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that:\n       (1) An atmosphere of trust and civility in labor-management \n     relationships is essential to a productive workplace and a \n     healthy economy.\n       (2) The tactic of using professional union organizers and \n     agents to infiltrate a targeted employer's workplace, a \n     practice commonly referred to as ``salting'' has evolved into \n     an aggressive form of harassment not contemplated when the \n     National Labor Relations Act was enacted and threatens the \n     balance of rights which is fundamental to our system of \n     collective bargaining.\n       (3) Increasingly, union organizers are seeking employment \n     with nonunion employers not because of a desire to work for \n     such employers but primarily to organize the employees of \n     such employers or to inflict economic harm specifically \n     designed to put nonunion competitors out of business, or to \n     do both.\n       (4) While no employer may discriminate against employees \n     based upon the views of employees concerning collective \n     bargaining, an employer should have the right to expect job \n     applicants to be primarily interested in utilizing the skills \n     of the applicants to further the goals of the business of the \n     employer.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to preserve the balance of rights between employers, \n     employees, and labor organizations which is fundamental to \n     our system of collective bargaining;\n       (2) to preserve the rights of workers to organize, or \n     otherwise engage in concerted activities protected under the \n     National Labor Relations Act; and\n       (3) to alleviate pressure on employers to hire individuals \n     who seek or gain employment in order to disrupt the workplace \n     of the employer or otherwise inflict economic harm designed \n     to put the employer out of business.\n\n     SEC. 4. PROTECTION OF EMPLOYER RIGHTS.\n\n       Section 8(a) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \n     158(a)) is amended by adding after and below paragraph (5) \n     the following:\n     ``Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring \n     an employer to employ any person who seeks or has sought \n     employment with the employer in furtherance of other \n     employment or agency status.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/09/senate-section/article/S4651-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 133--RECOGNIZING THE 13TH ANNUAL NATIONAL ASSOCIATION \n                     OF LETTER CARRIERS FOOD DRIVE\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \nWarner, Mr. Durbin, and Ms. Snowe) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                              S.

Res. 134\n\n       Whereas, in July 1995, thousands of men and boys who had \n     sought safety in the United Nations-designated ``safe area'' \n     of Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina under the protection \n     of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) were \n     massacred by Serb forces operating in that country;\n       Whereas, beginning in April 1992, aggression and ethnic \n     cleansing perpetrated by Bosnian Serb forces, while taking \n     control of the surrounding territory, resulted in a massive \n     influx of Bosniaks seeking protection in Srebrenica and its \n     environs, which the United Nations Security Council \n     designated a ``safe area'' in Security Council Resolution 819 \n     on April 16, 1993;\n       Whereas the UNPROFOR presence in Srebrenica consisted of a \n     Dutch peacekeeping battalion, with representatives of the \n     United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the \n     International Committee of the Red Cross, and the \n     humanitarian medical aid agency Medecins Sans Frontiers \n     (Doctors Without Borders) helping to provide humanitarian \n     relief to the displaced population living in conditions of \n     massive overcrowding, destitution, and disease;\n       Whereas Bosnian Serb forces blockaded the enclave early in \n     1995, depriving the entire population of humanitarian aid and \n     outside communication and contact, and effectively reducing \n     the ability of the Dutch peacekeeping battalion to deter \n     aggression or otherwise respond effectively to a \n     deteriorating situation;\n       Whereas, beginning on July 6, 1995, Bosnian Serb forces \n     attacked UNPROFOR outposts, seized control of the isolated \n     enclave, held captured Dutch soldiers hostage and, after \n     skirmishes with local defenders, ultimately took control of \n     the town of Srebrenica on July 11, 1995;\n       Whereas an estimated one-third of the population of \n     Srebrenica, including a relatively small number of soldiers, \n     made a desperate attempt to pass through the lines of Bosnian \n     Serb forces to the relative safety of Bosnian-\n\n[[Page S4652]]\n\n     held territory, but many were killed by patrols and ambushes;\n       Whereas the remaining population sought protection with the \n     Dutch peacekeeping battalion at its headquarters in the \n     village of Potocari north of Srebrenica but many of these \n     individuals were randomly seized by Bosnian Serb forces to be \n     beaten, raped, or murdered;\n       Whereas Bosnian Serb forces deported women, children, and \n     the elderly in buses, held Bosniak males over 16 years of age \n     at collection points and sites in northeastern Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina under their control, and then summarily murdered \n     and buried the captives in mass graves;\n       Whereas approximately 20 percent of Srebrenica's total \n     population at the time--at least 7,000 and perhaps thousands \n     more--was murdered;\n       Whereas the United Nations and its member states have \n     largely acknowledged their failure to take actions and \n     decisions that could have deterred the assault on Srebrenica \n     and prevented the subsequent massacre, including the lengthy \n     report issued by the Government of the Netherlands on April \n     10, 2002, entitled ``Srebrenica, a `safe' area--\n     Reconstruction, background, consequences and analyses of the \n     fall of a safe area'';\n       Whereas Bosnian Serb forces, hoping to conceal evidence of \n     the massacre at Srebrenica, subsequently moved corpses from \n     initial mass grave sites to many secondary sites scattered \n     throughout parts of northeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina under \n     their control;\n       Whereas the massacre at Srebrenica was among the worst of \n     many horrible atrocities to occur in the conflict in Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina from April 1992 to November 1995, during \n     which the policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing pursued \n     by Bosnian Serb forces with the direct support of authorities \n     in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) \n     ultimately led to the displacement of more than 2,000,000 \n     people, an estimated 200,000 killed, tens of thousands raped \n     or otherwise tortured and abused, and the innocent civilians \n     of Sarajevo and other urban centers repeatedly subjected to \n     shelling and sniper attacks;\n       Whereas Article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, done at Paris December \n     9, 1948, and entered into force January 12, 1951, defines \n     genocide as ``any of the following acts committed with intent \n     to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial \n     or religious group, as such: (a) killing members of the \n     group; (b) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members \n     of the group; (c) deliberately inflicting on the group \n     conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical \n     destruction in whole or in part; (d) imposing measures \n     intended to prevent births within the group; (e) forcibly \n     transferring children of the group to another group'';\n       Whereas, on May 25, 1993, the United Nations Security \n     Council adopted Security Council Resolution 827, establishing \n     the world's first international war crimes tribunal, the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia \n     (ICTY), based in The Hague, the Netherlands, and charging the \n     ICTY with responsibility for investigating and prosecuting \n     individuals suspected of committing war crimes, genocide, \n     crimes against humanity, and grave breaches of the 1949 \n     Geneva Conventions on the territory of the former Yugoslavia \n     since 1991;\n       Whereas numerous members of the Bosnian Serb forces and \n     political leaders at various levels of responsibility have \n     been indicted for grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva \n     Conventions, violations of the laws or customs of war, crimes \n     against humanity, genocide, and complicity in genocide \n     associated with the massacre at Srebrenica, some of whom have \n     been tried and sentenced while others, including Radovan \n     Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, remain at large; and\n       Whereas the international community, including the United \n     States, has continued to provide personnel and resources, \n     including through direct military intervention, to prevent \n     further aggression and ethnic cleansing, to negotiate and \n     help ensure the full implementation of the General Framework \n     Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, initialled at \n     Dayton, Ohio, November 21, 1995, and done at Paris December \n     14, 1995, including cooperation with the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the thousands of innocent people murdered at Srebrenica \n     in Bosnia and Herzegovina in July 1995, along with all \n     individuals who were victimized during the conflict and \n     genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995, should \n     be solemnly remembered and honored;\n       (2) the policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing as \n     implemented by Serb forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina from \n     1992 to 1995 meet the terms defining the crime of genocide in \n     Article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment \n     of the Crime of Genocide, done at Paris December 9, 1948, and \n     entered into force January 12, 1951;\n       (3) foreign nationals, including United States citizens, \n     who have risked, and in some cases lost, their lives in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina while working toward peace should be \n     solemnly remembered and honored;\n       (4) the United Nations and its member states should accept \n     their share of responsibility for allowing the Srebrenica \n     massacre and genocide to occur in Bosnia and Herzegovina from \n     1992 to 1995 by failing to take sufficient, decisive, and \n     timely action, and the United Nations and its member states \n     should constantly seek to ensure that this failure is not \n     repeated in future crises and conflicts;\n       (5) it is in the national interest of the United States \n     that those individuals who are responsible for war crimes, \n     genocide, crimes against humanity, and grave breaches of the \n     1949 Geneva Conventions committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina \n     should be held accountable for their actions;\n       (6) all persons indicted by the International Criminal \n     Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) should be \n     apprehended and transferred to The Hague without further \n     delay, and all countries should meet their obligations to \n     cooperate fully with the ICTY at all times; and\n       (7) the United States should continue to support--\n       (A) the independence and territorial integrity of Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina;\n       (B) peace and stability in southeastern Europe as a whole; \n     and\n       (C) the right of all people living in southeastern Europe, \n     regardless of national, racial, ethnic or religious \n     background--\n       (i) to return to their homes and enjoy the benefits of \n     democratic institutions, the rule of law, and economic \n     opportunity; and\n       (ii) to know the fate of missing relatives and friends.\n  Mr. SMITH: Mr. President, I rise today to mark a solemn anniversary. \nTen years ago this July, thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought safety \nfrom the brutal ethnic cleansing campaign conducted by Bosnian Serb \nforces in the small town of Srebrenica. This was supposed to be a \n``Safe Area,'' a space designated and protected by the United Nations \nas a place of refuge. Instead, it became the site of the worst case of \ngenocide in Europe since World War II.\n  I am pleased to submit a resolution today, along with my colleague \nSenator Biden, which recognizes this somber anniversary. The resolution \nalso reiterates our support for the need to bring to justice those who \nperpetrated this crime against humanity.\n  In June 1995, after three years of war, the Bosnian Serbs launched a \nbrutal attack against the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica. In what was an \nincomprehensible and fatal error, United Nations Protection Force \n(UNPROFOR) had collected weapons from the Bosnian Muslims in return for \nits designation of Srebrenica as a safe area. This rendered the \npopulation even more vulnerable to the Bosnian Serb assault.\n  The presence of the U.N. soldiers and the confiscation of the \nMuslims' arms was supposed to deter a Bosnian Serb attack by removing \nany semblance of provocation. But the Bosnian Serbs struck anyway and \nthe UNPROFOR troops were unable to assist the Muslim population they \nhad placed at such disadvantage.\n  The Bosnian Serbs easily overtook the city, deporting women, \nchildren, and the elderly in buses. Bosniak men older than 16 were \nrounded up and held at collection points in northeastern Bosnia. Here \nthey were summarily murdered and buried in mass graves.\n  At least 7,000 Bosnian Muslims, 20 percent of Srebrenica's total \npopulation at the time, were murdered. A similar enclave at Zepa, \nallegedly protected by the United Nations force, fell to the Serb \nonslaught two weeks later.\n  After learning of the genocide committed by the Nazis during the \nsecond World War, the world made a promise: We said ``never again.'' \nYet 50 years later on the European continent, men and boys were \nmurdered solely because they were Muslim.\n  So as we look back and remember a decade later, we must learn from \nthe mistakes that were made at Srebrenica. We should ensure that those \nresponsible are held accountable for their actions. We should continue \nto support the independence and territorial integrity of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina and peace and stability in southeastern Europe as a whole. \nWe should support the right of all people living in the region, \nregardless of national, racial, ethnic or religious background, to \nreturn to their homes and enjoy the benefits of democratic \ninstitutions, the rule of law, and economic opportunity. We should \nencourage all efforts to determine the fate of all those still missing.\n  And finally, we should solemnly remember and honor all those that \nwere victims of the massacre at Srebrenica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/09/senate-section/article/S4652-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4652-S4653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 597.

records check similar to the \n     background records check required for commercial motor \n     vehicle operators licensed in the United States to transport \n     hazardous materials in commerce.\n       (2) Definitions.--In this subsection:\n       (A) Hazardous materials.--The term ``hazardous material'' \n     has the meaning given that term in section 5102(2) of title \n     49, United

shall develop and \n     implement a process for the notification of a hazmat employer \n     (as defined in section 5102(4) of title 49, United States \n     Code), if appropriate considering the potential security \n     implications, designated by an applicant seeking a threat \n     assessment under part 1572 of title 49, Code of Federal \n     Regulations, if the Transportation Security Administration, \n     in an initial notification of threat assessment or a final \n     notification of threat assessment, served on the applicant \n     determines that the applicant does not meet the standards set \n     forth in section 1572.5(d) of title 49, Code of Federal \n     Regulations.\n       (2) Relationship to other background records checks.--\n       (A) Elimination of redundant

Federal Regulations, and\n       (ii) has issued a notification of no security threat under \n     section 1572.5(g) of that title,\n\n     is deemed to have met the requirements of any other \n     background check that is equivalent to, or less stringent \n     than, the background check performed under section 5103a of \n     title 49, United States Code, that is required for purposes \n     of any Federal law applicable to transportation workers.\n       (B) Determination by assistant secretary.--Within 30 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Assistant \n     Secretary of Homeland Security (Transportation Security \n     Administration) shall initiate a rulemaking proceeding, \n     including notice and opportunity for comment, that sets forth \n     the

Future rulemakings.--The Assistant Secretary shall make \n     a determination under the criteria established under \n     subparagraph (B) with respect to any rulemaking proceeding to \n     establish or modify required background checks for \n     transportation workers initiated after the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n       (c) Appeals Process for More Stringent State Procedures.--\n     If a State establishes standards for applicants for a \n     hazardous materials endorsement to a commercial driver's \n     license that, as determined by the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security, are more stringent than the standards set forth in \n     section 1572.5(d) of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, \n     then the State shall also provide an appeals process similar \n     to the process provided under section 1572.141 of title 49, \n     Code of Federal Regulations, by which an applicant denied a \n     hazardous materials endorsement to a commercial driver's \n     license by that State may appeal that denial in a manner \n     substantially similar to, and to the same extent as, an \n     individual who received an initial notification of threat \n     assessment under part 1572 of that title.\n       (d) Clarification of Term Defined in Regulations.--The term \n     ``severe transportation security incident'', as defined in \n     section 1572.3 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, does \n     not include a work stoppage or other nonviolent employee-\n     related action resulting from an employer-employee dispute. \n     Within 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security shall modify the definition of \n     that term to reflect the preceding sentence.\n       (e) Background Check Capacity.--The Assistant Secretary of \n     Homeland Security (Transportation Security Administration) \n     shall transmit a report by October 1, 2005, to the Senate \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the \n     House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security on \n     the implementation of fingerprint-based

Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the \ndesk, and I ask for its first reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the title of the bill for \nthe first time.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 981) to ensure that a Federal employee who takes \n     leave without pay in order to perform service as a member of \n     the uniformed services or member of the National Guard shall \n     continue to receive pay in an amount which, when taken \n     together with the pay and allowances such individual is \n     receiving for such service, will be no less than the basic \n     pay such individual would then be receiving if no \n     interruption in employment had occurred.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is with some measure of frustration \nthat I rise to again introduce the Reservist Pay Security Act. This \nbill allows members of the National Guard and Reserve who are Federal \nemployees to\n\n[[Page S4788]]\n\nmaintain their normal salary when called to active duty by having \nFederal agencies make up the difference between their military pay and \nwhat they would have earned at their Federal civilian job.\n  This is not a radical concept. Many of the major employers in America \noffer a similar benefit for their employees in the Guard and Reserve \nwho are mobilized and, due to lower military pay, suffer a loss of \nincome. Companies such as Ford, General Motors, IBM, 3M and, in my own \nState of Illinois, Sears, as well as the Illinois State government and \nthat of 23 other States provide this same exact security for their \nworkers.\n  Why do they do this? For two reasons: First, These employers are \npatriotic members of American society who want to step up and do their \npart for the country while it is engaged in a war. Second, they want to \nsend a clear message to their employees that they are valued where they \nwork and that the organization is looking forward to their return. The \nDepartment of Defense operates a highly respected program known as \nEmployer Support for the Guard and Reserve, or ESGR, which pays tribute \nto more than 900 such patriotic employers.\n  It is nothing less than shameful that the largest employer in \nAmerica, the United States Federal Government, is not on that list \nbecause we do not provide a similar benefit for our employees in the \nGuard and Reserve.\n  I must note, however, that my colleagues in the Senate have generally \nrecognized this and have joined me to correct this situation by passing \nthe Reservist Pay Security Act. In October 2003, the Senate approved, \nby a vote of 96 to 3, my amendment to S. 1689, the supplemental \nappropriations for 2004. In June of 2004, it was agreed to by a voice \nvote as an amendment to S. 2400, the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor 2005. Most recently, on April 13, the Senate passed this needed \nmeasure as an amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill for \n2005. That was the third time this measure has passed the Senate. In \neach of those instances, this measure has been dropped in conference \nwith our colleagues in the House of Representatives. It is unfortunate \nthat some of our colleagues fail to appreciate the need to pass this \nbill.\n  The Senate knows this is important. The Reserve Officers Association \nknows that it is important. The National Guard Association of the \nUnited States knows that it is important. The Enlisted Association of \nthe National Guard of the United States knows that it is important. And \nI can assure you that we in the Senate will not give up on this matter.\n  Today I introduce this measure with my colleagues, Senators Mikulski, \nAllen, Landrieu, Leahy, Lautenberg, Kerry, Sarbanes, and Bingaman. This \nbill is identical to the Reservist pay amendment to the supplemental \nwith the exception that this measure provides a mechanism for possible \nretroactive payments for those who have served since October 11, 2002.\n  Of the nearly 1.2 million members of the National Guard and Reserves, \nsome 120,000--approximately 10 percent--are also Federal employees. As \nof January 2005, more than 43,000 Federal employees had been activated \nsince September 11, 2001. More than 17,000 are currently on active \nduty.\n  Income loss hurts Reserve component retention. Of the top 10 reasons \ncited for leaving the National Guard/Reserve, income loss was No. 4, \ntrailing only family burden, deployment frequency and deployment \nlength.\n  This measure has not been scored by CBO. Funds would likely come from \nexisting appropriations. In addition to my own State of Illinois, 23 \nother State governments have similar salary continuation laws for State \nemployees: Alabama, Alaska, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, \nKansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New \nYork, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, \nVermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming. Most of these States report \nthat this has required no additional appropriations. The differential \nwas paid from funds already appropriated for government employee pay. \nWith the exception of any retroactive payments, that would be true of \nour measure as well.\n  Reservists bring to military service their civilian professional \nskills and provide their civilian employers with the expertise and \nexperience they have gained in the Armed Forces. This adds value to \nAmerica.\n  Last year, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee saw the value of \nsupporting our citizen soldiers and reported this measure to the floor, \nbut it did not see action as a free-standing bill before the Congress \nadjourned. I hope we can make it as a freestanding bill or as an \namendment on some other legislation this year.\n  Our bottom line is simply this: Federal employees should not lose \nincome when mobilized for extended duty in the National Guard and \nReserve. Major American employers already protect their workers from \nsuch loss. It is time for the Federal Government to support our troops \nby doing the same.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I now ask for its second reading, and \nin order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule \nXIV, I object to my own request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard, and the bill will be read \nfor the second time on the next legislative day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/09/senate-section/article/S4788-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4788-S4789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL CYSTIC FIBROSIS AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
