KAVANAUGH TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR \n                    THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session and resume the consideration of Calendar \nNo. 632, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Brett M. Kavanaugh, of \nMaryland, to be United States Circuit Judge for the District of \nColumbia Circuit.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished minority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the distinguished ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee wishes to speak on the nomination of Brett \nKavanaugh. I also wish to do that.\n  I ask that the Senator from Vermont be recognized.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are concluding the debate on the \ncontroversial nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to a seat on the Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n  I spoke last evening, and I shall not speak longer today except to \nagain express my concern that we are putting a person with no judicial \nexperience on the second most powerful court in the land.\n  This vote will go forward, unlike the votes for two far more \nqualified people nominated by President Clinton who were pocket-\nfilibustered by the Republican leadership of the Senate, along with 59 \nother judges nominated by President Clinton who were pocket-\nfilibustered by the Republican leadership.\n  What I worry about with this nomination of Mr. Kavanaugh, whose ABA \nrating has been downgraded--it is almost unprecedented to see that \nhappen--is that he is a man who in all his statements spoke of making \nrulings that would make President Bush proud. This is an independent \nbranch of Government. He is not supposed to make any President--\nRepublican or Democratic--proud. He is not supposed to be a rubberstamp \nfor anybody.\n  I think when you have a Republican-controlled Congress which has \nrefused to be a check on the Bush-Cheney administration, whether it is \nthe war in Iraq, the lack of weapons of mass destruction, the failures \nof Homeland Security with Katrina, or this latest fiasco in the \nVeterans' Administration, there is no accountability. We at least \nshould be able to speak to our courts and to expect our courts to be \naccountable.\n  This is an administration that has been secretly wiretapping \nAmericans for years without warrants, despite the requirements of the \nlaw. This is an administration that refused to allow the Justice \nDepartment's own Office of Professional Responsibility to proceed\n\n[[Page S5304]]\n\nwith an investigation into whether Justice Department lawyers violated \ntheir responsibilities or the law in establishing and justifying \nprograms to spy on Americans. This is an internal government \ninvestigation that is being stymied by the administration.\n  This is an administration that has operated behind a wall of secrecy \nand that has issued secret legal opinions justifying the use of torture \nand rendition of prisoners to other countries, ignoring the dangers \nsuch tactics pose to our own soldiers and Americans around the world. \nThis is an administration that is talking about prosecuting reporters \nand newspapers for trying to inform the American people about their \ngovernment. This is an administration that says the law is what the \nPresident decides the law should be not what Congress passes.\n  What is desperately lacking throughout this administration and this \nRepublican-controlled Congress is accountability. I will give you one \nexample.\n  Yesterday, those responsible for Enron's collapse, which caused so \nmany employees and investors to lose their savings, were held \naccountable in a court of law. Precious little was done by the \nRepublican-controlled Congress to look into that. It required an \nindependent court of law. Of course, Enron had been very generous to \nthe President and to others and to many among the Republican leadership \nin the House and Senate in their contributions.\n  I compliment the President, who yesterday expressed some regrets over \nthe disastrous course he charted in Iraq; he began to acknowledge the \nharm done to this country in Abu Ghraib--far different than during his \ncampaign when he said he could not think of a mistake he had ever made \nexcept for some of his nominations.\n  Well, the President's picks for important judicial nominations \ncontinue to fare no better than his picks to head the CIA or FEMA or \nthe VA. But bad judicial nominations will continue for lifetimes, not \njust the 2 years left to the Bush-Cheney administration. In just the \npast few months, we have learned that Judge Terrence Boyle, President \nBush's pick for the Fourth Circuit and a sitting U.S. district judge, \nhas ruled on multiple cases involving corporations in which he held an \ninterest. The President's nominee to the Tenth Circuit, Judge James \nPayne, was withdrawn after it was revealed that he, too, sat on many \ncases where he held stock in one of the parties. Another of President \nBush's nominees to the Fourth Circuit, Claude Allen, who would be a \nsitting Circuit Judge now if Democrats had not opposed his nomination, \nis now the subject of a criminal prosecution for charges akin to \nstealing from retail stores. And Michael Wallace, President Bush's pick \nfor the Fifth Circuit, recently received the first unanimous not \nqualified rating from the ABA for a Circuit Court nominee in nearly 25 \nyears.\n  Now we are considering a nominee today, Brett Kavanaugh, who is a \nyoung and relatively inexperienced, but ambitious member of the White \nHouse's inner circle. He is the President's pick to put another ally \nand trusted vote on the DC Circuit. He has spent most of his legal \ncareer in partisan political positions. As Staff Secretary to the \nPresident, Mr. Kavanaugh has been involved in President Bush's use of \n750 Presidential signing statements designed to reserve for the \nPresident alone the power to choose whether to enforce laws passed by \nCongress. As an Associate White House Counsel, Mr. Kavanaugh worked \nwith Karl Rove on the President's plan to pack the Federal bench with \nideologues such as William Pryor, Janice Rogers Brown and others. He \nhelped justify the wall of secrecy that has shrouded so many of the \nWhite House's activities.\n\n  At his hearing Mr. Kavanaugh emphasized, as if a qualification, that \nhe had ``earned the trust of the President'' and his ``senior staff.'' \nAll that may be useful for advancement within this President's \nadministration or Republican circles, but those are hardly qualities or \nqualifications for an independent judge of this President and this \nadministration's actions. Indeed, when pressed at his confirmation \nhearing to provide answers about his qualifications for this lifetime \nappointment and how he would fulfill his responsibilities as a judge, \nMr. Kavanaugh sounded like a spokesman and representative for the \nadministration. Over and over he answered our questions by alluding to \nwhat the President would want and what the President would want him to \ndo. We heard from a nominee who parroted the administration's talking \npoints on subject after subject. Rather than answer our questions, he \nreferred us to the bland explanation offered by a former Presidential \nspokesman. I do not think the Senate should confirm a Presidential \nspokesman to be a judge on the second highest court in the land. I do \nnot believe that Mr. Kavanaugh demonstrated that he has left his role \nas a member of the President's administration or that he will.\n  The reasons for the downgrading of Mr. Kavanaugh's ABA rating also \nraise concerns about his independence. Not only did those who have seen \nMr. Kavanaugh in his limited legal practice describe him as ``less than \nadequate,'' but those who were interviewed recently raised concerns \nabout Mr. Kavanaugh's ability to be balanced given his many years in \npartisan positions working to advance a political agenda. They \ndescribed him as ``insulated,'' ``sanctimonious,'' and ``immovable and \nvery stubborn and frustrating to deal with on some issues.'' These may \nbe good qualities for a partisan political operative, but they are not \nqualities that make for a good judge.\n  My concerns about Mr. Kavanaugh's judicial independence are \nheightened by the fact that he has been nominated to the DC Circuit, a \ncourt which the Republicans have spent more than a decade trying to \npack. They spent President Clinton's second term blocking his highly-\nqualified nominees, Elena Kagan, now Dean of Harvard Law School, and \nAllen Snyder, a former clerk to Chief Justice Rehnquist and highly \nrespected litigator. Nonetheless, I voted to confirm Judge John Roberts \nto be a member of the DC Circuit and later supported his nomination to \nbe Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  After the Senate last year confirmed two of President Bush's nominees \nthat I strongly opposed--Janice Rogers Brown and Thomas Griffith--\nRepublican appointees now comprise a two-to-one majority on this \nimportant court. This is not a court that needs another rubberstamp for \nthe President's political ally.\n  The Senate Republican leadership is catering to the extreme rightwing \nand special interest groups agitating for a fight over judicial \nnominations. With a number of judicial nominees ready for bipartisan \nconfirmation, the Senate Republican leadership would rather concentrate \non this controversial and divisive nominee. That this nomination has \nnot moved forward for 3 years is indicative of the fact that even \nRepublican Senators know what a poor nomination this is. They have made \nno secret of the reason for rushing this nomination through the Senate \nnow, after it has languished for 3 years under Republican control, and \nafter the nominee admitted to slow-walking his responses to this \ncommittee. They want to stir up a fight. They want to score cheap \npolitical points at the expense of another lifetime appointment to the \ncourts.\n  The Senate Republican leadership is apparently heeding the advice of \nthe Wall Street Journal editorial page, which wrote, ``[a] filibuster \nfight would be exactly the sort of political battle Republicans need to \nenergize conservative voters after their recent months of despond.'' \nRich Lowery, editor of the conservative National Review, listed a fight \nover judges as one of the ways President Bush could revive his \npolitical fortunes, writing that he should, ``[p]ush for the \nconfirmation of his circuit judges that are pending. Talk about them by \nname. The G.O.P. wins judiciary fights.'' Republican Senators are \nrelishing this chance for a political fight. Senator Thune has said, \n``A good fight on judges does nothing but energize our base. . . . \nRight now our folks are feeling a little flat.'' Senator Cornyn has \nsaid, ``I think this is excellent timing. From a political standpoint, \nwhen we talk about judges, we win.'' On May 8, 2006, the New York Times \nreported: ``Republicans are itching for a good election-year fight. Now \nthey are about to get one: a reprise of last year's Senate showdown\n\n[[Page S5305]]\n\nover judges.'' The Washington Post reported on May 10: ``Republicans \nhad revived debate on Kavanaugh and another Bush appellate nominee, \nTerrence Boyle, in hopes of changing the pre-election subject from \nIraq, high gasoline prices and bribery scandals.''\n  We should not stand idly by as Republicans choose to use lifetime \nFederal judgeships for partisan political advantage. In a May 11, 2006, \neditorial The Tennessean wrote:\n\n       [T]he nation should look with complete dismay at the \n     blatantly political angle on nominations being advocated by \n     Senate Republicans now. . . . Republicans are girding for a \n     fight on judicial nominees for no reason other than to be \n     girding for a fight. They have admitted as much in public \n     comments. . . . In other words, picking a public fight over \n     judicial nominees is, in their minds, the right thing to do \n     because it's the politically right thing to do. . . . Now, \n     Republicans are advocating a brawl for openly political \n     purposes. The appointment of judges deserves far more respect \n     than to be an admitted election-year ploy. . . . It should be \n     beneath the Senate to have such a serious matter subjected to \n     nothing but a tool for political gain.\n\n  On May 3, 2006, the New York Times wrote in an editorial:\n\n       The Republicans have long used judicial nominations as a \n     way of placating the far right of their party, and it appears \n     that with President Bush sinking in the polls, they now want \n     to offer up some new appeals court judges to their \n     conservative base. But a lifetime appointment to the DC \n     Circuit is too important to be treated as a political reward.\n\n  Our job in the Senate should not be to score political points or \nadvance partisan agendas. Our job is to fulfill our duty under the \nConstitution for the American people. We must be able to assure the \nAmerican people that the judges confirmed to lifetime appointments to \nthe highest courts in this country are fair to those who enter their \ncourtrooms and to the law.\n  We have heard from many who are concerned about the nomination of Mr. \nKavanaugh: The AFL-CIO, United Auto Workers, and Service Employees \nInternational Union have all written to us opposing this nomination. \nThe Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, NARAL PRO-Choice American, \nand the National Council of Jewish Women have all written to us \nopposing this nomination. The Society of American Law Teachers, \nNational Employment Lawyers Association, and the Alliance for Justice \nhave all written to us opposing this nomination. Earthjustice and \nCommunity Rights Counsel have written to us concerned about this \nnomination.\n  The Senate's job is to fulfill our duty under the Constitution, \nrather than act as a rubberstamp for the President's attempt to pack \nthe courts with political allies. We must be able to assure the \nAmerican people that the judges confirmed to lifetime appointments to \nthe highest courts in this country are being appointed to be fair and \nprotect their interests, rather than those of a Presidential patron. \nMr. Kavanaugh has given the Senate no reason to believe he has the \ncapacity for independence.\n  I am prepared to vote on Mr. Kavanaugh right now unless others on the \nother side would wish to talk, which, of course, would lead others to \ntalk. As I said to the two leaders last night, I would be willing to go \nto a vote soon.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish to first note my concern about \nthe procedure followed in the Judiciary Committee to report out this \nnomination precipitously to the floor. Our practice on nominations in \nthe committee has been first to hold a hearing. Next, Senators are \ngiven the opportunity to review the transcript of the hearing and \nsubmit written questions. Normally, we are given a week to do that, \nwhich is a reasonable length of time. Then, once a nominee answers any \nwritten questions, the nomination can be noticed, and we have the right \nto hold that nomination over for 1 week. That is not an extraordinary \namount of time, but it is at least sufficient for the Senators on the \ncommittee to do their jobs and have confidence that the nomination has \nbeen considered with due diligence.\n  There is no good reason that we couldn't follow that schedule in this \ncase. Mr. Kavanaugh's situation is unusual because he was first \nnominated several years ago, but his first nomination was essentially \nabandoned when he decided not to respond to written questions for a \nfull 7 months after his hearing in April 2004. Senators on the \nDemocratic side requested a new hearing for him over a year ago, after \nhe was renominated. His nomination lay dormant until just a few weeks \nago.\n  Then, all of a sudden, there was a full court press to get this \nnomination done. Why is that? The rush to judgment in the committee, as \nfar as I can tell, was based on nothing more than the majority leader's \ndesire to have a floor vote on the nomination before our next recess. \nThere was no reason for the rush except for the majority leader's \npolitical timetable. There is no crisis in the District of Columbia \nCircuit, which has the lowest caseload of any circuit in the country. \nAll we were asking on the Democratic side in the committee was that we \nfollow the regular order--a timely hearing and the opportunity to ask \nwritten questions.\n  I do want to note that I finally received answers the day before the \ncommittee vote to some of the questions that I first asked back in \nApril 2004. I was not entirely satisfied with those answers, but they \nwere certainly more complete than those the nominee provided when he \nfirst answered my questions in November 2004. The fact that these \nquestions were finally answered just completes the record from 2004. I \nbelieve Senators deserved a chance to review the transcript of the \nhearing held on May 9, 2006, and ask further questions if they wanted \nto. A lot has happened in this country and in this administration where \nMr. Kavanaugh works during the interval between his hearing in May 2004 \nand the hearing earlier this month. That is one of the reasons a second \nhearing was necessary. So it was a mistake for the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee to short-circuit the process by simply decreeing \nthat written questions would not be permitted.\n  Since the leader has decided to press forward on this nomination, I \nwill vote no. I do not think Mr. Kavanaugh is the right choice for this \nvacancy. He is a very bright young lawyer and he has some impressive \ncredentials. He may well be ready for appointment to a district court \njudgeship. But his record does not give me confidence that he is ready \nto serve on the District of Columbia Circuit, widely seen as the second \nhighest court in the land.\n  Mr. Kavanaugh has written almost nothing that we can look to for a \nsense of his judicial philosophy, of his judgment, of his temperament. \nIn addition, so much of his career after clerking has been spent in \npartisan political positions that it is certainly legitimate to wonder \nwhether he can be fair and impartial in a judicial role. Partisan \npolitical work does not necessarily disqualify someone from taking the \nbench. As has been pointed out, many very good appellate or Supreme \nCourt judges held political posts. But most held other positions as \nwell that demonstrated the capacity for independence. The Senate is \nentitled to ask for evidence that the nominee can be nonpartisan and \nimpartial, not just assurances. In Mr. Kavanaugh's case, there is \nsimply no record to examine to give comfort on that score. Furthermore, \nwe know from the latest ABA evaluation that at least some people who \nhave come in contact with him in his work do not think that he is \nprepared to be an appellate judge.\n  Of the currently serving judges on that court, only one--Judge \nDouglas Ginsburg--had less legal experience when he or she was \nconfirmed than Brett Kavanaugh now has. Ginsburg had 13 years of legal \nexperience, including a year as a Senate-confirmed Assistant Attorney \nGeneral and 8 years as a professor at Harvard Law School. He had a \nrecord that the Senate could much more easily evaluate. Other judges on \nthat circuit had much longer careers when they were appointed. Judge \nSentelle had 19 years of experience, including 10 years of private \npractice and 5 years as a judge; Judge Henderson had 18 years, \nincluding 4 as a U.S. district judge; Judge Randolph had 21 years of \nlegal experience; Judge Garland, 20 years; Judge Edwards, 15 years, \nincluding 10 years as a law professor at Michigan and Harvard; Judge \nTatel, 28 years; Judge Judith Rogers, 30 years, including 11 years as a \njudge; Judge Janice Rogers Brown, 28 years, including 11 years as a \njudge; Judge Griffith, 20 years.\n  The District of Columbia Circuit is not a place to learn the judicial \nropes,\n\n[[Page S5306]]\n\nnor is it a place to reward a loyal employee. It is a court that makes \ndecisions every day that have a huge effect on the lives and \nlivelihoods of American citizens and American businesses. It has a \ncaseload that demands not only a good legal mind but judgment, wisdom, \nand experience. Brett Kavanaugh has impressive credentials, but his \nlimited record makes it impossible for me to be confident that he will \nbe the fair and impartial judge that this country needs on such an \nimportant court. So I will vote no.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I oppose the nomination of Brett \nKavanaugh to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia.\n  Mr. Kavanaugh's lack of experience, partisan ideological leanings, \nlack of judicial temperament, and refusal to adequately answer \nquestions posed by the Judiciary Committee make him unqualified to sit \non the second highest court in the country.\n  Mr. Kavanaugh is a young lawyer who has spent most of his career in \npartisan positions. He lacks substantive courtroom experience and has \nnever tried a case to a verdict. In fact, a judge before whom he \nappeared characterized Mr. Kavanaugh work as ``less than adequate'' and \nat the experience level of an associate.\n  Nor is Mr. Kavanaugh a noted legal scholar. The highlight of his \ncareer has been working with Kenneth Starr in the Office of the \nSolicitor General and at the Office of the Independent Counsel, where \nhe spent 4 years and coauthored the infamous Starr Report.\n  Upon further review the nonpartisan American Bar Association panel \ndowngraded Mr. Kavanaugh's rating from ``well-qualified'' to \n``qualified.'' He was described by interviewees as ``sanctimonious,'' \nand ``immovable and very stubborn and frustrating to deal with on some \nissues.'' These are not qualities that make for a good judge. His low \nrating and nonjudicious demeanor put him in stark contrast to the \nmajority of appointments to the DC Circuit who received ``well-\nqualified'' ratings and respectful reviews from the American Bar \nAssociation review panel.\n  The President can and should do better than this. The country \ndeserves better than this.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, although I may not agree with a judicial \nnominee on policy matters, I will support that nominee as long as his \nor her values are consistent with the fundamental principles of \nAmerican law and there is no indication that the nominee is so \ncontrolled by ideology that ideology distorts his or her judgment. \nRegardless of their political views, I will support a nominee who \ndemonstrates fairness and openmindedness and whose reasoning is \nstraightforward, clearly expressed, and worthy of respect.\n  Brett Kavanaugh is, unfortunately, not such a nominee. Because Mr. \nKavanaugh does not have a judicial record to review, evaluating his \nfitness for the bench is not easy. We do not have written opinions from \nhim that would reveal whether he looks objectively at both sides of an \nissue before making a decision. Therefore, we must judge his \ntemperament on how he has conducted himself in interviews before the \nAmerican Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary \nand how he answered questions posed by the Senate Judiciary Committee. \nNeither assessment gives me the confidence necessary to vote to confirm \nMr. Kavanaugh to the DC Circuit.\n  In its 2003 assessment of Mr. Kavanaugh, the ABA record noted \nconcerns with the breadth of Mr. Kavanaugh's professional experience. \nIt was noted that he had never tried a case to verdict or judgment; \nthat his litigation experience over the years was always in the company \nof senior counsel; and that he had very little experience with criminal \ncases. Specifically, the committee said: ``Indeed, it is the \ncircumstance of courtroom experience that fills the transcripts that \nmake the record before the Court of Appeals, and concerns were \nexpressed about the nominee's insight into that very process.''\n  In its report on its recent reassessment of Mr. Kavanaugh, the ABA's \nStanding Committee on the Judiciary down-graded its rating of his \nqualifications. The report states that one judge who saw Kavanaugh's \noral presentation in court said that Kavanaugh was ``less than \nadequate,'' and that he had been ``sanctimonious,'' and had \ndemonstrated ``experience on the level of an associate.'' A lawyer in a \ndifferent proceeding said: ``Mr. Kavanaugh did not handle the case well \nas an advocate and dissembled.''\n  According to the report, the 2006 interviews of Mr. Kavanaugh raised \na new concern involving his potential for judicial temperament. \nInterviewees characterized Mr. Kavanaugh as, ``insulated,'' which one \nperson commented was due to his current position as Staff Secretary to \nthe President. Another interviewee questioned Mr. Kavanaugh's ability \n``to be balanced and fair should he assume a federal judgeship.'' And \nanother said that Kavanaugh is ``immovable and very stubborn and \nfrustrating to deal with on some issues.''\n  A judge needs to be able to balance competing viewpoints and \nobjectively determine a fair and equitable outcome. Mr. Kavanaugh's \nlack of judicial or courtroom or scholarly experience added to my \ndoubts about his impartiality and lead me to vote no.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to briefly state my reasons for \nopposing the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to serve as a judge on the \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Court.\n  I must say at the outset that I regret having to cast this vote. \nThroughout my tenure here in the Senate, I have supported the vast \nmajority of presidential nominees--regardless of the party to which a \npresident has belonged. With regard to the current administration, I \nhave joined with my colleagues in voting to confirm the overwhelming \nmajority of its judicial nominees--including those with whom I differed \non matters of legal and public policy. I had assumed that, when \nnominated, Mr. Kavanaugh would likely be among this large group of \njudicial nominees to receive broad bipartisan support. After all, he \nhas a commendable academic background, and served as a law clerk to two \nCircuit Court judges and one Supreme Court Justice.\n  However, it appears--that after emerging from a confirmation process \nwhere his conduct can be described as disappointing at best, and \ndismissive at worst--Mr. Kavanaugh has practically invited opposition \nto his nomination. In my view, there are few duties more important to \nthe Senate than the consideration of the nomination of article III \njurists. Other than considering a declaration of war or an amendment to \nthe Constitution, nothing is more important than deciding on a judicial \nnominee. The reasons for that view are practically self-evident: \narticle III judges are appointed for life, and they are appointed to \nlead and populate an entirely separate branch of government. Our entire \nconstitutional framework rests on an act of faith, first taken by our \nFounders, that is in some respects as audacious as it is vital: that \nthe President will nominate, and the Senate will confirm, only those \njudicial nominees who demonstrate the temperament, intellect, \nexperience, and character to stand independent of the executive and \nlegislative branches of government and hold those branches accountable \nto the law. If a nominee does not demonstrate those qualities during \nthe nomination process, if he or she does not show a capacity to render \nindependent judgments and uphold the principle of equal justice under \nlaw, then the outcome of a vote on that nomination is, in this \nSenator's view, a foregone conclusion: the nomination must be opposed.\n  During Mr. Kavanaugh's two confirmation hearings, he failed to \ndemonstrate the requisite qualifications for the high position to which \nhe has been nominated. He failed to provide meaningful responses to \nmany of the questions put to him. After his first hearing, he delayed \nproviding any answers at all to written questions for seven months. It \nwas not until after the 2004 elections that he finally decided to \nprovide those answers. When asked the reason for this delay, he offered \nonly a feeble rationale, saying he took responsibility for what he \ntermed a ``misunderstanding''. I found this explanation to be \nimplausible, to say the least. As Associate White House Counsel, one of \nMr. Kavanaugh's responsibilities was to prepare judicial nominees to \nsuccessfully navigate the confirmation process. So for him to say he\n\n[[Page S5307]]\n\nhad a ``misunderstanding'' about the need to promptly answer questions \nput to him by Senators strains credulity.\n  Mr. Kavanaugh also failed to provide full and candid answers to \nimportant questions about his role and views in helping to shape some \nof the administration's most controversial policies--from the \ndevelopment of legal rationales for torture to the drafting of \nExecutive orders to reduce the public's access to presidential records. \nHe also refused to tell the committee on what types of matters, if any, \nhe would recuse himself if such matters came before him as a judge.\n  This refusal to be forthcoming with the Judiciary Committee--and by \nimplication, with the Senate as a whole--bespeaks a dismissive attitude \ntoward the confirmation process that I find highly troubling. We have \nseen in recent years a growing tendency of candidates to treat the \nconfirmation process more as a game of hide-and-seek than a profoundly \nserious process designed by the Senate to provide Senators with the \ninformation that they need to make careful, reasoned decisions about \nnominees. If candidates do not provide vital information about their \nbackground and their views, they make it impossible for Senators to \nadequately discharge their constitutional duty to advise and consent \nwith respect to article III nominees.\n  I would be remiss if I did not also mention two other facts about \nthis nomination that make it highly unusual. One is that the American \nBar Association, ABA, downgraded its rating of the nominee, from \n``highly qualified'' to ``qualified''. Six of the eight members of the \nABA committee who voted previously on this nomination voted to \ndowngrade his nomination based on new information about his ability to \nact independently and his sparse record as a judge and legal \npractitioner. It also bears mentioning that this nominee, if confirmed, \nwould be one of the least experienced judges to have served on this \nparticular court. Only former Judge Kenneth Starr had less experience.\n  For these reasons, I must oppose this nomination. I hope that, if \nconfirmed, this nominee will prove me wrong by growing into a wise, \nindependent, and fair-minded jurist. But regrettably, at this time, he \nhas given the Senate paltry and insufficient facts on which to believe \nhe is prepared for the high office to which he has been nominated.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit \nis the second-highest court in the Nation. As such, its judges bear a \nunique responsibility.\n  By law, the DC Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over many issues \nthat other appellate courts cannot deal with. Only the judges of the DC \nCircuit can hear appeals under many critical laws that affect our \neconomy, our environment, and our election system. Because the Supreme \nCourt only hears a limited number of cases, the judges of the DC \nCircuit often have the final word on laws that affect the lives of \nmillions of Americans, at home and in the workplace.\n  Unlike most of the members of the DC Circuit. Brett Kavanaugh is not \na judge, an experienced litigator, or a legal scholar. Far from it. Mr. \nKavanaugh is a political operative, a man whose ambition has placed him \nat the center of some of the most politically divisive events in recent \nmemory. He is not qualified for this position. If his nomination is \napproved, I can say with confidence that Mr. Kavanaugh would be the \nyoungest, least experienced and most partisan appointee to the court in \ndecades.\n  Mr. Kavanaugh blatantly lacks the broad legal experience that is the \nhallmark of Federal judges--particularly those at the highest levels. \nHe has never tried a case to verdict or to judgment. In fact, Mr. \nKavanaugh has only practiced law for 10 years. Even counting his time \nas a law clerk, he still has only half of the average legal experience \nof nominees to the DC Circuit. To put this in context, Mr. Kavanaugh \nwould be the least experienced member of the DC Circuit in almost a \nquarter century.\n  His lack of experience is underscored by his responses to questions \nfrom Judiciary Committee members. When he was asked to name his 10 most \nsignificant cases, Mr. Kavanaugh could only cite five cases for which \nhe actually appeared in court, and only two cases in which he was lead \ncounsel. He even cited two cases for which he merely wrote a friend-of-\nthe-court brief for someone who was not a party to the lawsuit.\n  I am not alone in my judgment that Mr. Kavanaugh is not qualified for \nthis position. Aside from my seven colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee who voted against his appointment, organizations from around \nthe country are united in their opposition to his nomination. The AFL-\nCIO, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the NAACP, the National \nUrban League, the United Auto Workers. The list reads like a who's who \nof citizen representatives.\n  Most troubling, however, is the lukewarm evaluation of the American \nBar Association, which has now conducted three separate evaluations of \nMr. Kavanaugh. On the latest and perhaps closest evaluation, the ABA \ntook the unusual step of downgrading its rating of Mr. Kavanaugh. \nToday, a majority of that committee does not believe Brett Kavanaugh \ncan meet their highest standard for Federal nominees.\n  Why did the ABA downgrade its rating? It did so after confidential \ninterviews with judges and lawyers familiar with his work, when \nnumerous questions were raised about Mr. Kavanaugh's ability as an \nattorney and potential appellate judge.\n  A judge who heard Mr. Kavanaugh's oral arguments found that his \npresentation was ``less than adequate,'' and that he demonstrated \nskills ``on the level of an associate''--a young lawyer at a law firm. \nLawyers familiar with his work raised additional questions about his \nimpartiality and partisanship. One attorney specifically questioned \nwhether Mr. Kavanaugh was capable of being ``balanced and fair should \nhe assume a Federal judgeship.''\n  But Mr. Kavanaugh's lack of qualifications goes beyond years of \nexperience or individual interviews. More important, Mr. Kavanaugh is \nalmost completely unfamiliar with the substantive issues of law that \nconsistently arise in the DC Circuit.\n  These aren't arcane concerns. The DC Circuit has a key role in \nupholding the rights of American workers. That court decides far more \nappeals than any other circuit of decisions by the National Labor \nRelations Board on unfair labor practices. Usually, these cases are \nfiled by employers across the country attempting to overturn unfair \nlabor practice findings against them by the Board. Recently, almost one \nin three such appeals have been heard by the DC Circuit.\n  During our hearings, I asked Mr. Kavanaugh whether he had any \nexperience handling labor law matters. He couldn't provide a single \nexample of work in this area--not one. Instead, he made vague reference \nto his work as a law clerk and his brief time in the Justice \nDepartment.\n  The DC Circuit is also important to anyone who breathes our air or \ndrinks our water. It is the only Federal appellate court that can hear \nappeals on rules to protect the environment under the Clean Air Act and \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act. It is the only Federal court that can \ngrant a remedy when the executive branch fails to follow congressional \nmandates to protect the environment under these laws.\n  Nothing in Mr. Kavanaugh's record suggests that he would be willing \nto keep the executive branch in compliance with the law on these \nmatters. More generally, nothing in his record suggests that he would \nbe able to avoid the partisanship and politics that have marked his \nbrief career.\n  In fact, partisan politics is the only area in which Mr. Kavanaugh's \nqualifications cannot be questioned. He has been deeply involved in \nsome of the most bitterly divisive political events in the last \ndecade--and always on the same side.\n  At the Office of the Independent Counsel, Mr. Kavanaugh authored the \ninfamous Starr Report, wrote the articles of impeachment against \nPresident Clinton, and investigated the tragic suicide of Vince Foster.\n  As an Associate White House Counsel, Mr. Kavanaugh worked to support \nthe nomination and confirmation of Jay Bybee, the author of the \nnotorious--but then still secret--torture memo. He also was personally \nresponsible for drafting the executive order that made presidential \nrecords less accessible to the public and the press.\n\n[[Page S5308]]\n\nThis was order was so restrictive that one observer said it would \n``make Nixon jealous in his grave.''\n  We gave Mr. Kavanaugh an opportunity to prove that he was independent \nand impartial in spite of his partisan past. I personally noted that \nthis was my chief concern with his nomination, and I know that my \ncolleagues did the same. Mr. Kavanaugh refused to specify the issues \nand policies on which he would recuse himself--in spite of the fact \nthat he was at the center of a number of executive policy directives in \nrecent years.\n  His answers to our questions resembled political talking points more \nthan they did the answers we would expect from a nominee to such a \nprominent lifetime position in the Nation's Judiciary. He has shown \nnothing to suggest that he will stand up to the President when his \nduties require it.\n  Mr. Kavanaugh is not qualified for this job. Even worse, his \nnomination is a harsh reminder of the partisan and ideological \npressures that have marked many recent judicial nominations. His \nnomination seems little more than a crass administration attempt to \npoliticize the courts and provide a solid vote in favor of even the \nmost extreme political tactics of the administration. The Federal \ncourts need experienced, independent judges who can rise above their \npartisan beliefs and enforce the rights and guarantees of our \nConstitution and the rule of law. Mr. Kavnaugh is not such a nominee, \nand I urge my colleagues to oppose his nomination.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nconfirm President Bush's nomination of Brett M. Kavanaugh to be a U.S. \ncircuit judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \nCircuit.\n  President Bush first nominated Brett Kavanaugh to the DC Circuit on \nJuly 25, 2003. He received a hearing before the Judiciary Committee on \nApril 27, 2004, but the committee did not vote on Mr. Kavanaugh's \nnomination. President Bush renominated Mr. Kavanaugh on February 14, \n2005, and again on January 25, 2006. It is past time for Mr. Kavanaugh \nto receive an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.\n  Brett Kavanaugh is a well-respected attorney with impeccable academic \ncredentials and the background and experience necessary to serve as an \nexcellent judge on the DC Circuit. He currently serves as Assistant to \nthe President and staff secretary. He previously served in the White \nHouse Counsel's Office as Senior Associate Counsel and Associate \nCounsel to the President.\n  Mr. Kavanaugh graduated from Yale College, cum laude, and Yale Law \nSchool where he served as the notes editor on the Yale Law Journal. He \nserved as a judicial law clerk for Justice Anthony Kennedy on the \nSupreme Court of the United States, as well as Judge Walter Stapleton \nof the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and Judge Alex \nKozinski of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n  Prior to his Supreme Court clerkship, Mr. Kavanaugh earned a \nfellowship in the Office of the Solicitor General of the United States. \nAfter his clerkship, Mr. Kavanaugh served as an Associate Counsel in \nthe Office of Independent Counsel, where he handled a number of the \nnovel constitutional and legal issues. He was a partner at the \nprestigious Washington law firm of Kirkland & Ellis and has argued both \ncivil and criminal matters before the Supreme Court and appellate \ncourts throughout the country.\n  Besides his obvious academic and professional credentials, I would \nnote that Mr. Kavanaugh believes in giving back to his community. While \nin private practice, Mr. Kavanaugh took on challenging pro bono \nmatters, including representation of the Adat Shalom congregation in \nMontgomery County, MD, against an attempt to stop the construction of a \nsynagogue in the county.\n  Those who know Mr. Kavanaugh best strongly praise his intelligence, \nintegrity, and approach to the law. Mark Touhey III, Mr. Kavanaugh's \nsupervisor at the Independent Counsel's Office, wrote in his support: \n``Mr. Kavanaugh exhibit[s] the highest qualities of integrity and \nprofessionalism in his work. These traits consistently exemplify Mr. \nKavanaugh's approach to the practice of law and will exemplify his \ntenure as Federal appellate judge.''\n\n  Judge Walter Stapleton said of Mr. Kavanaugh: ``He really is a \nsuperstar. He is a rare match of talent and personality.'' After \narguing against Mr. Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court, Washington attorney \nJim Hamilton stated, ``Brett is a lawyer of great competency, and he \nwill be a force in this town for some time to come.''\n  Some of Mr. Kavanaugh's critics have tried to argue that he is too \nyoung to be a Federal appellate judge. In truth, Mr. Kavanaugh is 41 \nyears old and has had a broad range of experience that makes him an \nideal candidate for the DC Circuit.\n  Mr. Kavanaugh's legal work ranges from service as Associate Counsel \nto the President, to appellate lawyer in private practice, to \nexperience as a prosecutor. He clerked at two of the U.S. Courts of \nAppeal, the Third and Ninth Circuits, and at the Supreme Court. In \nprivate practice and during his service as a prosecutor, Mr. Kavanaugh \nparticipated in appellate matters in a number of the Federal courts of \nappeal and in the Supreme Court.\n  Besides, at age 41, Mr. Kavanaugh is considerably older than many of \nour Nation's most distinguished judges were at the time of their \nnomination. In fact, all three of the judges for whom Mr. Kavanaugh \nclerked were appointed to the bench before they were 41. All have been \nrecognized as distinguished jurists. Justice Kennedy was appointed to \nthe Ninth Circuit when he was 38 years old. Judge Kozinski was \nappointed to the Ninth Circuit when he was 35 years old. Judge \nStapleton was appointed to the district court at 35 and later elevated \nto the Third Circuit. There are many other examples of judges who were \nappointed to the bench at a young age and have had illustrious careers:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                 Name                            Circuit            Age\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJudge Harry Edwards...................

Eleventh Circuit.........     39\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Age should not be the sole measure of a person's experience. Many \nSenators began their service at a young age. Senators Biden and Kennedy \nwere elected to the Senate at the age of 30, and Senator Leahy was \nelected at age 34.\n  Some of Mr. Kavanaugh's critics have suggested that we should hold \nhis service in the White House for President Bush against him. They \nseem to suggest that Mr. Kavanaugh's public service to his Nation is \nsomehow a disqualifier for later serving on the bench. I disagree.\n  Public service in the executive or legislative branches of Government \nshould not be a disqualifier for judicial office. This has never been \nthe case, nor should it be. Justice Stephen Breyer was once the chief \ncounsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee before being nominated and \nconfirmed to the First Circuit by a substantial majority. I hope that \nnone of us believe that his service on Senator Kennedy's staff should \nhave disqualified him.\n  Judge Abner Mikvah spent most of his career prior to the bench as a \nDemocrat in elective office. He was a State legislator in Illinois and \nlater a U.S. Congressman. In fact, he was a sitting Congressman when he \nwas nominated to the DC Circuit. He, too, was confirmed by a \nsubstantial majority.\n  The Senate has not considered service as a Democratic staff member or \nas a Democratic Congressman a bar to service as a U.S. Circuit Judge, \nnor should it consider Mr. Kavanaugh's service in President Bush's \nWhite House as a strike against him. Suggesting that service in an \nelective branch of Government somehow tarnishes a lawyer's reputation \nwould be a terrible message for this body to send to the legal \ncommunity and to all citizens. Mr. Kavanaugh is superbly qualified to \nserve as a U.S. circuit judge, and he has made clear that he \nunderstands the role of a judge is different from the role of a member \nof the White House staff.\n  Some of Mr. Kavanaugh's critics have raised concerns about Mr. \nKavanaugh's ABA rating. The ABA's Committee on the Federal Judiciary \nhas consistently and unanimously\n\n[[Page S5309]]\n\nfound that Mr. Kavanaugh has the integrity, professional competence, \nand judicial temperament to serve on the DC Circuit. Each year Mr. \nKavanaugh's name has been in nomination the committee has rated Mr. \nKavanaugh, and each year every member of the committee has found him \n``qualified'' or ``well qualified.''\n  According to the ABA:\n\n       To merit a rating of ``well qualified,'' the nominee must \n     be at the top of the legal profession in his or her legal \n     community; have outstanding legal ability, breadth of \n     experience and the highest reputation for integrity; and \n     either demonstrate or exhibit the capacity for judicial \n     temperament. The rating of ``qualified'' means that the \n     nominee meets the Committee's very high standards with \n     respect to integrity, professional competence and judicial \n     temperament and that the Committee believes that the \n     nominee will be able to perform satisfactorily all of the \n     duties and responsibilities required by the high office of \n     a federal judge.\n\n  In 2004 and 2005 a majority of the committee thought Mr. Kavanaugh \nhad earned its highest rating, ``well qualified''; the rest thought he \nhad earned a ``qualified'' rating. This year the balance changed, with \nmore members of the committee believing he deserved a ``qualified'' \nrating and the rest thinking he deserved a ``well qualified'' rating.\n  Despite the fact that the ABA committee has included many committed \nDemocrats, the committee remains unanimous that Mr. Kavanaugh is \nindisputably competent, intelligent, and qualified to serve on the DC \nCircuit. In response to what some of my Democratic colleagues have said \nabout Kavanaugh's ABA rating, listen to what ABA committee chairman, \nStephen Tober had to say:\n\n       Let me underscore . . . that we didn't find him not \n     qualified. There's not a breath of that in this report or any \n     earlier report. We found him qualified/minority well \n     qualified. What I said at the end is what, in fact, many \n     people said, that he has a solid reputation for integrity, \n     intellectual capacity--a lot of people refer to him as \n     brilliant--and an excellent writing and analytical ability. \n     Those are great skills to bring to the court of appeals. \n     There is just no question about that.\n\n  According to Mr. Tober, in all of the ABA's ratings, Mr. Kavanaugh's \n``positive factors haven't changed a whole lot. He is found to have \nhigh integrity. He is found to be brilliant. He is a very skilled \nwriter and legal analyst. He has those components, and I have said this \nbefore . . . he has those skills that will serve him well, certainly, \non a Federal court.\n  Finally, Mr. Tober acknowledged that ``there is not a single not \nqualified vote in the picture.''\n  Brett Kavanaugh is a highly qualified attorney who has experience as \nan appellate litigator presenting arguments in court, and experience as \na judicial law clerk on the other side of the bench evaluating \nappellate arguments. He has spent most of his career as a public \nservant. I am confident that he will perform his duties as a judge in a \nfair and even-handed manner.\n  Today's vote on this nominee is long past due. I urge my colleagues \nto confirm Brett Kavanaugh to be a U.S. circuit judge.\n  Mr. REID. I intend to vote against the confirmation of Brett \nKavanaugh to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. This youthful, relatively \ninexperienced nominee lacks the credentials to be approved for a \nlifetime appointment to the second most important Federal court in the \ncountry.\n  At the outset, let me contrast this nomination with a circuit court \nnomination we recently approved: the nomination of Milan Smith to the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Smith is a pillar of the California \nlegal community, a distinguished practicing lawyer with 27 years of \nexperience in complex legal transactions. His nomination was the \nproduct of extensive consultation with Democratic Senators. The \nJudiciary Committee approved his nomination 18 to 0, and the full \nSenate gave its consent unanimously.\n  The Smith nomination is an example of the way the process is supposed \nto work. The Constitution gives the President and the Senate a shared \nrole in filling vacancies on Federal courts. Working together, we can \nmove highly qualified nonpartisan nominees through the process without \nrancor or delay.\n  But when the President uses judicial appointments as a reward to the \nextreme rightwing of the Republican Party, he invites controversy and \nconflict. Regrettably, that may be just the result that the White House \nwants.\n  Cesar Conda, a former domestic policy adviser to Vice President \nCheney, recently wrote in the Roll Call newspaper: ``For Bush, a \nrenewed fight over conservative judges . . . just might be the cure to \nthe Republican Party's current political doldrums.''\n  One of my Republican colleagues is quoted in the National Review \nearlier this month as saying: ``A good fight on judges does nothing but \nenergize our base. Right now our folks are feeling a little flat. They \nneed a reason to get engaged, and fights over judges will do that.''\n  At the same time, a lengthy debate over judges serves to distract \nattention from the pressing problems facing the Nation: an intractable \nwar in Iraq, soaring gas prices, millions of Americans who lack health \ninsurance. Instead of addressing these vital issues, this Senate has \nbeen forced to spend days and weeks and months talking about divisive \njudicial nominees.\n  The nomination of Brett Kavanaugh is nothing if not divisive. All \neight Democrats on the Judiciary Committee oppose his confirmation. \nEvery leading civil rights, environmental, and labor organization in \nthe country has urged that he be rejected.\n  This nomination is not the product of consensus and consultation--it \nis a poke in the eye to the Senate. It is a wedge that disrupts the \nwonderful bipartisanship which has characterized the immigration debate \nover the past 2 weeks.\n  I recently met with Brett Kavanaugh. He seems like a bright young \nman. But he is a 41-year-old lawyer who has spent his short legal \ncareer in service to partisan Republican causes.\n  His two principal accomplishments as a lawyer are his work as an aide \nto Special Counsel Kenneth Starr during the misguided crusade to \nimpeach President Clinton, and his current duty as a political lawyer \nin the Bush White House. Those positions do not disqualify Mr. \nKavanaugh from future service, but they do not constitute the kind of \nbroad experience in the law that we should expect from a nominee to the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit.\n  The DC Circuit is a uniquely powerful court. It has jurisdiction over \nchallenges to Federal activities affecting the environment, consumer \nprotections, workers and civil rights. This court hears appeals from \nthe Environmental Protection Agency, the National Labor Relations \nBoard, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Occupational \nSafety and Health Administration and other agencies.\n  As a result, DC Circuit judges sit in a unique position to judge \nGovernment actions that affect our lives in fundamental ways. Mr. \nKavanaugh's slim, partisan record gives me no confidence he is the \nright person to assume this awesome responsibility.\n  In the 113 years since the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit was \nestablished in 1893, 54 judges have sat on the court. Only three of \nthose judges came to the court with less experience than Kavanaugh. DC \nCircuit judges have averaged over 26 years of legal experience at the \ntime of their appointment to the DC Circuit. Mr. Kavanaugh, in \ncontrast, graduated from law school a mere 16 years ago.\n  It is not just Mr. Kavanaugh's youth but his lack of practical \nexperience that renders him unfit for this post. In his 16 years as a \nlawyer he has never tried a case to verdict or judgment. When \nquestioned about this deficiency at his committee hearing, the nominee \npresumed to compare himself to Chief Justice John Roberts. But at the \ntime of his appointment to the DC Circuit, Roberts had argued dozens of \ncases before the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh has argued just one such \ncase, on behalf of the Starr investigation.\n  There are other kinds of experience one might bring to an appellate \ncourt. Some nominees are respected scholars. Some are sitting judges. \nKavanaugh is neither. His high-ranking position in the Bush White House \nmight constitute relevant experience, but we have little idea what he \nhas accomplished in that role. He largely refused to answer questions \nfrom the committee about the issues he has handled or the positions he \nhas advocated.\n  We know he helped to select many of the controversial judicial \nnominees\n\n[[Page S5310]]\n\nwho have tied the Senate in knots in recent years. We know he was the \nauthor of a far-reaching government secrecy policy, despite his own \nrole in stripping President Clinton of every vestige of privacy and \nprivilege during the Starr investigation. Other than that, all we know \nis that Mr. Kavanaugh has had a fancy west wing title.\n  Most nominees gain more stature over the course of their legal \ncareers, but Mr. Kavanaugh is headed in the opposite direction. The \nAmerican Bar Association recently took the rare step of lowering its \nrating of this nominee.\n  Lawyers and judges interviewed by the nonpartisan ABA Committee \ndescribed Mr. Kavanaugh as ``sanctimonious,'' ``immovable'' and ``very \nstubborn and frustrating to deal with on some issues.'' A judge before \nwhom Mr. Kavanaugh appeared considered him ``less than adequate'' and \nsaid he demonstrated ``experience on the level of an associate.'' A \nlawyer who observed him during a different court proceeding stated: \n``Mr. Kavanaugh did not handle the case well as an advocate and \ndissembled.''\n  Needless to say, these are not qualities that make for a good judge.\n  Still others described Mr. Kavanaugh as ``insulated.'' That is the \nlast quality we want in a 41-year-old man who will soon begin the \ncloistered life of an appellate judge. Mr. Kavanaugh lacks the wide-\nranging experience that breeds wisdom and judgment, and he is unlikely \nto acquire those qualities on the bench.\n  Mr. Kavanaugh's thin legal resume contrasts with the resumes of the \ntwo Clinton nominees who were blocked by the Republican-controlled \nSenate when they were nominated to the same court. Elena Kagan, now the \nDean of Harvard Law School, had been both a practicing lawyer and a \nleading administrative law scholar at the time of her nomination. Allen \nSnyder, a former clerk to Justices Harlan and Rehnquist had been a \nlitigation partner at the law firm of Hogan and Hartson for 26 years.\n  Under what definition of fairness do my Republican colleagues insist \nthat Brett Kavanaugh is entitled to a Senate vote while Elena Kagan and \nAllen Snyder were denied a vote? By what standard do they consider \nKavanaugh qualified to sit on the DC Circuit when these two other \ndistinguished lawyers were denied that honor?\n  Unlike Kagan and Snyder, Mr. Kavanaugh will be considered by the \nSenate. But I will cast my vote against confirmation. This nominee's \nrecord is too sparse and the court to which he is nominated is too \nimportant to the rights that Americans hold dear.\n  I urge the Senate to reject this unacceptable nomination.\n  Mr. President, even in this Bush Presidency, I continue to believe \nthat a judge should have experience in a courtroom. I know that is \nsomewhat heretical in the environment we have, but I really believe \nthat if you are going to be a judge, you should have some practical \nexperience, at least picking a jury, arguing to a jury, appearing \nbefore a court, making your views known to the judge. That is largely \nlacking with this young man.\n  We have testimony before the Judiciary Committee from two judges for \nwhom he worked. It is unusual that people clerk for two separate \njudges. These clerkships are usually a year long, and you sit back \nthere and you shuffle papers for the judge and you draft opinions for \nthe judge on the cases that come before the judge--but that is very \ndifferent than courtroom experience as a practicing lawyer. You may go \nwatch a few arguments, but clerking for two judges doesn't do the \ntrick. That doesn't give you the experience to be a judge, especially a \njudge on the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals, the second \nhighest court in the land.\n  I understand that Mr. Kavanaugh has argued several appeals. But not \nvery many, and in any event that's not the same as trying cases in my \nview.\n  I am going to vote against confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh. I want to \nmake four brief points about this nomination.\n  First, Brett Kavanaugh is a youthful partisan who lacks the \ncredentials to be approved for a lifetime appointment to the second \nmost important Federal court in our country. He is 41 years old. He has \nspent his short legal career in service to Republican causes.\n  He worked as an aide to Special Counsel Kenneth Starr. I think the \nwork of Kenneth Starr will go down in history as a blight on this \ncountry. This partisan investigation disrupted this country and it was \naided by the nominee who is before the Senate at this time.\n  He has been a lawyer in the White House for President Bush. The fact \nthat he worked for Starr and now works in the White House doesn't \ndisqualify him, but these do not add up to the kind of experience we \nshould have from a nominee to the District Circuit Court. It doesn't \nadd up.\n  Second, Mr. Kavanaugh's lack of practical experience renders him \nunfit for the post. In his years as a lawyer, he has never tried a case \nto a verdict or to judgment.\n  There are other kinds of experience one might bring to an appellate \ncourt. Some nominees are respected scholars and some are sitting \njudges. Mr. Kavanaugh is neither.\n  His high-ranking position in the White House might constitute \nrelevant experience, but we have little idea about what he accomplished \nin that role. He has largely refused to answer questions from the \ncommittee about the issues he has handled or the positions he has \nadvocated.\n  The big push for this man comes from partisans who want to push the \nmajority in the Senate toward the nuclear option. They think it would \nbe a great thing to disrupt the Senate in this way.\n  Third, the American Bar Association recently lowered its rating of \nthis nominee. Most nominees gain more stature over the course of their \nlegal careers, but Mr. Kavanaugh is headed in the opposite direction, \nand rightfully so. Lawyers and judges of the nonpartisan ABA committee \ndescribed Mr. Kavanaugh as being ``sanctimonious'' and ``frustrating to \ndeal with.'' That says it all.\n  A judge before whom Mr. Kavanaugh appeared described him as ``less \nthan adequate'' and said he demonstrated experience ``at the level of \nan associate.''\n  A lawyer who observed him during a different court proceeding stated \nthat:\n\n       Mr. Kavanaugh did not handle the case well as an advocate \n     and dissembled.\n\n  Needless to say, these are not qualities which make a good judge. But \nthe right wing wants him, and he is going to become a judge.\n  Finally, let me say this: The nomination of Mr. Kavanaugh is \ndivisive. All eight Democrats on the Judiciary Committee oppose his \nconfirmation. Every leading civil rights, environmental, and labor \norganization in the country urged that he be rejected.\n  The Constitution gives the President and the Senate a shared role in \nfilling vacancies on the Federal court. Working together, we can move \nhighly qualified, nonpartisan nominees through the process without \nrancor or delay. But when the President uses judicial appointments as a \nreward to the extreme rightwing of the Republican Party, it invites \ncontroversy and conflict. And that is what we have. In sum, this \nnominee's record is too sparse. The court to which he is nominated is \ntoo important. I hope we get a lot of votes against this nomination. I \nunderstand that everyone on the other side of the aisle will walk over \nhere and vote for this unqualified candidate, but that is not how it \nshould be.\n  If there is no one else wishing to speak, I ask that we proceed to \nthe vote on Mr. Kavanaugh.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Brett Kavanaugh, the President's nominee for the DC Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, pledged that if he is confirmed:\n\n       I will interpret the law as written and not impose personal \n     policy preferences;\n       I will follow precedent in all cases fully and fairly, and, \n     above all, [I] will at all times maintain the absolute \n     independence of the judiciary, which, in my judgment, is the \n     crown jewel of our constitutional democracy.\n\n  Listen to the words that Brett Kavanaugh used: Fair, independent, \ncommitted to the rule of law. These are the qualities America wants in \nour federal judges.\n  We need more qualified nominees on the bench who practice judicial \nrestraint and respect the rule of law, and Brett Kavanaugh fits that \ndescription.\n  President Bush nominated Mr. Kavanaugh on July 25 of 2003. And since \nthis time, he's endured not one--\n\n[[Page S5311]]\n\nbut two--hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  He has been candid and forthcoming in answering countless oral and \nwritten questions from the Judiciary Committee. And he has met one-on-\none with numerous Members--both Republican and Democrat.\n  And now it's time that Brett Kavanaugh gets the fair up-or-down vote \nthat he's been waiting on for 3 years.\n  Later this morning, the Senate will give him that vote. We will \nfulfill our constitutional duty of advice and consent.\n  Over the last few weeks, we've heard a lot about his sterling \ncredentials and professional experience.\n  He is a graduate of Yale College and Yale Law School and was awarded \na prestigious Supreme Court law clerkship.\n  He has an extraordinary range of experience in both the public and \nprivate sectors.\n  He has dedicated more than 16 years to public service--as an \nappellate lawyer, a prosecutor, and an Assistant to the President.\n  He has argued both civil and criminal matters before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt and appellate courts throughout the country.\n  And he has received the American Bar Association's stamp of approval \nto serve on the Federal bench on three separate occasions.\n  Brett Kavanaugh is respected in the legal community for his keen \nintellect and legal prowess. And he has earned the reputation as a man \nof integrity, fairness, and honesty.\n  In a larger sense, today's vote is about more than just Brett \nKavanaugh as an individual nominee. Today's vote is another sign of \nprogress for the judicial nominations process.\n  The Senate is continuing on a path we began a little more than a year \nago. At that time, the Senate turned away from judicial obstruction and \nadvanced the core constitutional principle that every judicial nominee \nwith majority support deserves a fair up-or-down vote.\n  I am proud of the Senate for continuing on this path--for fairness, \nfor principle, for the Constitution.\n  And I urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Brett \nKavanaugh.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

HAYDEN TO BE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE \n                                 AGENCY\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to a vote on Executive Calendar No. 672, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of General Michael V. \nHayden, United States Air Force, to be Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, there are five criteria I use to \nevaluate all executive branch nominees: competence, integrity, \ncommitment to the core mission of the department, commitment to the \nConstitution, and independence. Based on what I know about General \nHayden after working closely with him for more than 5 years, and based \non his testimony last week, I will support his nomination to be \nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency, CIA. I have no question \nabout his competence or personal integrity and expect him to remain an \nindependent voice, committed to the Constitution not just with words \nbut with deeds.\n  My confidence in General Hayden should not be interpreted as \nconfidence in this administration. I have flashing yellow lights about \nthe Bush administration's willingness to politicize this important \nintelligence agency. I am also concerned that this administration \nsometimes pays lip service to the law of the land, as we have seen with \nrecent revelations about the warrantless surveillance program.\n  In more than 35 years as military intelligence officer, General \nHayden has clearly demonstrated his competence, both in his work as \nDirector of the National Security Agency, NSA, and as Deputy Director \nof National Intelligence. He led NSA at a critical time in the Agency's \nhistory, as the United States took the offensive against those who had \nattacked us. He inherited an agency that needed to be transformed: from \nits Cold War orientation, from analogue to digital, from concentrating \non the Soviet threat to looking at multiple threats and nonstate \nactors. He accomplished this transformation at breathtaking speed. As \nDeputy Director of National Intelligence, General Hayden helped stand-\nup a brand new intelligence organization, recruiting a top-notch team, \nbreaking down ``stove pipes'' between agencies, and helping to unify \nthe entire intelligence community.\n  I have known and worked closely with General Hayden since 1999, when \nhe came to NSA. I have no question about his personal integrity. He has \nalways been a candid reformer. But recent revelations about the \nwarrantless surveillance program have raised serious questions: \nquestions about the integrity of surveillance programs that may have \nside-stepped the law; questions about a decision at the highest level \nto keep most members of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee in the \ndark about these programs; and questions about whether a candid \nreformer has become a cheerleader for this administration. I discussed \nmy concerns with Hayden during the confirmation hearing, and he \npromised to ``speak truth to power.'' I take him at his word, but the \nproof will be in his deeds.\n  I have no question about General Hayden's commitment to the mission \nof the intelligence community. He has worked in almost every aspect of \ncollecting and analyzing intelligence. But his expertise is technical \nintelligence, known as signals intelligence, SIGINT, and the CIA is our \nNation's lead agency for human intelligence, HUMINT.\n\n[[Page S5312]]\n\nThese two disciplines have very different challenges, different \ntechnology, and different cultures. Many have asked if a SIGINT expert \nis the right choice to lead a HUMINT agency. General Hayden addressed \nthis question in our hearing. He believes his long career in \nintelligence has prepared him for this challenge. He has a plan to \nimprove HUMINT tradecraft and develop common standards among all HUMINT \nagencies, including the Defense Intelligence Agency. He will also \ninvest in research and development of the cutting-edge technology our \nmen and women at the CIA need to accomplish their mission. General \nHayden has promised to focus our human intelligence activities on \nunderstanding tomorrow's threats, not just responding to today's \nheadlines. I believe he will bring to the CIA the same leadership, \npassion for reform, and respect for our intelligence workers that he \nbrought to the NSA. He will be a strong advocate for the CIA as it \nstruggles to redefine itself.\n  I have two flashing yellow lights about this nomination. First, I \nhave serious questions about the Bush administration's commitment to \nprotecting the Constitution. Second, I believe that we need a CIA \nDirector who will be independent.\n  I believe General Hayden is committed to protecting the Constitution \nwhile he works to protect our country from terrorists. But I am \nconcerned that others in this administration pay lip service to the law \nof the land. We all take an oath when we take office. We swear to \nsupport and defend the Constitution of the United States. We don't \nswear to a President or to a party. We know there are real threats, \npredators, actors who want to kill Americans. And we know that some of \nthe tools that keep us safe must remain secret. Which is why our \ncommitment to the Constitution is more important than ever. We can not \nprotect the American people and ignore their Constitution when nobody's \nlooking. Support for the Constitution must be more than lip service. We \nneed a real commitment to put the Constitution first. The Framers gave \nCongress the responsibility for oversight over the President's \npolicies. We must be informed about significant intelligence \nactivities, as the law requires, so we can exercise our responsibility \nto protect the Constitution as we protect our Nation from the threats \nwe face.\n  I am very concerned about the independence of the CIA. We need an \nindependent voice at the CIA, someone who is willing to speak truth to \npower to whomever is President and also to the congressional oversight \ncommittees. The last few years have been difficult ones for the CIA, in \npart because American people have lost confidence in its leaders. The \nAgency has had too many ``yes'' men, too few independent voices. I \nasked General Hayden how he would avoid another Powell, when our \ndistinguished Secretary of State was sent to the United Nations with \nwrong information, because CIA analysis had become too politicized. \nGeneral Hayden said that his job at the CIA will be to let intelligence \nanalysts do what comes naturally: provide unvarnished intelligence \nanalysts, independent of political concerns. He said, ``My job is to \nkeep anything from getting in the way'' of their work. He promised to \nconsider implementing a dissent channel to allow intelligence workers \nan avenue for expressing their concerns without leaking classified \ninformation to the press.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I believe General Hayden is qualified \nto lead the CIA, and I will vote for his confirmation. But I have \nserious concerns about how the Bush administration has politicized this \nimportant intelligence agency. The Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence must keep a close eye on the CIA as it struggles to \nredefine itself and its role in our reformed intelligence community.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I opposed the nomination of GEN Michael \nHayden to serve as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n  General Hayden has many qualifications as an intelligence \nprofessional, but I am sad to say that he is the wrong person for the \njob.\n  Over the last years, the abuse of the CIA by the Rumsfeld Pentagon \nand the Cheney White House has hurt our national security and our \ncredibility around the world, as the CIA was bullied into becoming a \nclient of administration ideologues, yielding unfounded claims of \n``slam dunk'' evidence for mythical weapons of mass destruction in \nIraq.\n  I am not confident that General Hayden is the person best equipped to \nrestore the CIA's independence and credibility, not just because he \ncomes from Secretary Rumsfeld's Pentagon but because he was the \nAdministration's principal spokesperson and defender of an illegal \ndomestic spying program.\n  We are reminded again and again of the administration's determination \nto keep the extent of their illegal domestic spying program secret. All \nwe have to do is look at the news that the Department of Justice \nabruptly ended an investigation into the conduct of Department lawyers \nwho approved the program--not because the approving lawyers were \ncleared of wrongdoing but because investigators were denied the \ninformation to conduct the investigation.\n  The question before us is not whether we are committed to destroying \nterrorists and preventing terrorist attacks before they happen. We all \nare. In fact, we can wage and win a far more effective war on terror. \nNo, the question is whether we can restore checks and balances between \nthe executive and legislative branch and what can be done to restore \naccountability for an administration that too often appears run by \npeople who hold themselves above the law. How many times will \nGovernment secrecy shield decisionmakers from any kind of \naccountability?\n  The fact that General Hayden was the key architect and, more \nrecently, the principal defender of a program that listened to phone \ncalls of Americans without a warrant, a program the administration \nrefuses to come clean about, resides at ground zero of this debate.\n  The goal of General Hayden's program was appropriate: to find al-\nQaida operatives who would do us harm. But the administration, instead \nof relying on the consent of the people through the American Congress \nand the court created under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, \nchose, unnecessarily, to assert the President's unfettered authority as \na war-time commander to execute this program.\n  We must use every tool at our disposal to protect America. But the \nadministration has no reason to assert unchecked Executive power when \nCongress is more than willing to work to create the mechanisms to keep \nAmerica safe while we still preserve our essential liberties.\n\n  America has been the strongest, safest, most secure Nation on the \nplanet for more than 200 years without ever having to choose between \nsecurity and freedom. We can have both. But it requires an executive \nbranch that respects the co-equal branches of Government. After the \nterrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Nation was united behind \nthe President. Congress was--and is--prepared to do anything necessary \nto win the war on terror and ready to work with the President. If \nPresident Bush believed the domestic eavesdropping laws were \ninsufficient, then all he had to do was ask Congress to improve them \nimmediately. But the President didn't do that. Instead, he decided he \nwas above the law.\n  General Hayden was the architect of that plan, and to this day he \nclings to an unnecessarily expansive interpretation of Executive power. \nThat is not what America needs in the next Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency.\n  We take our civil rights very seriously--and we should. It is our \nheritage and our birthright--one generation's gift to the next, earned \nin the blood of Americans since our revolution.\n  The mistrust, the anger, the lack of confidence so many Americans \nfeel about this program is a reflection of our love of liberty. \nRegrettably, it is also the result of the way this administration has \nconducted itself: asserting its right to act by executive branch \ndictate because we are a nation at war. In one moment, the President of \nthe United States says we are not listening to domestic calls without a \nwarrant; in another, the Attorney General says he can't rule it out.\n  We are a nation at war with global jihaadists, a war that, as the \nDepartment of Defense calls it, will be a ``long war.'' Ad hoc and \nsecret solutions to issues that demand a reasoned balance between \nsecurity and the freedom of\n\n[[Page S5313]]\n\nlaw abiding Americans cannot simply be handed over to the executive \nbranch--of any party.\n  This Congress has much work to do before we can say we have \neffectively insisted on that balance and done our duty. Before we do, \nit would be a mistake to support General Hayden's nomination.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I intend to vote against General Hayden.\n  I respect General Hayden's lifetime of public service, and his \ntestimony included some encouraging signs that he learned important \nlessons from the way intelligence was used to defend the Iraq war.\n  However, I cannot support General Hayden's nomination in light of the \nvery serious questions about the scope and legality of the NSA domestic \nsurveillance programs that he helped design, implement, and defend.\n  Until there is a full accounting of the surveillance program, I \ncannot in good conscience support a promotion for its chief architect.\n  We all want the administration to have strong leaders and the \nnecessary means to gather the best possible intelligence for our \nforeign policy and national security, especially the war on terrorism.\n  Those critical goals require a Director of Central Intelligence who \nwill work with Congress--not against us--in our efforts to prevent \nterrorism and improve our national security laws. We must protect the \ncountry while preserving our constitutional freedoms.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on confirmation \nof three of President Bush's nominations. Once again, the President has \nnominated experienced, well-qualified individuals who deserve \nconfirmation by the Senate.\n  The President has nominated Brett Kavanaugh to serve as a judge on \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. Mr. Kavanaugh has \nextensive experience in the law, having formerly served as a law clerk \nto Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. He later served as Associate \nWhite House Counsel, where he worked on a wide variety of legal and \nconstitutional issues. Mr. Kavanaugh also practiced law as a partner in \nthe Washington, DC, law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, and most recently \nserves as Assistant to the President and staff secretary at the White \nHouse.\n  Yesterday I voted in favor of the motion to invoke cloture on Mr. \nKavanaugh's nomination, which now allows the Senate to give him an up-\nor-down vote. I am pleased that the Senate will now be allowed to vote \non Mr. Kavanaugh's nomination, and I hope the Senate will continue to \ngive fair up-or-down votes to the other well-qualified judicial \nnominees the President forwards to the Senate.\n  The President has also nominated GEN Michael Hayden as Director of \nthe Central Intelligence Agency. General Hayden is a career Air Force \nofficer with a distinguished history of service to our country. His \nprevious service as Director of the National Security Agency will serve \nhim well in his new role at the CIA, where I believe he will continue \nto be a strong leader in service to our Nation.\n  Finally, the President has nominated Gov. Dirk Kempthorne to serve as \nSecretary of the Department of the Interior. Governor Kempthorne has an \nimpressive career in public service, having served as a United States \nSenator representing the State of Idaho in this body for 6 years. I am \nconfident that his career of public service and his Western State \nperspective will help him be an effective and responsible steward of \nour country's public lands, waters, and other natural resources.\n  Unfortunately, a family obligation prevents me from being present \nduring these votes. However, I support each of these nominees and, if \npresent, would vote to confirm them. I therefore ask that the record \nreflect my support for each of these nominations.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, had I been present to vote on the \nnomination of Gen. Michael Hayden to be Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, I would have cast a vote of ``no''.\n  I oppose General Hayden's nomination because of his role in the \nadministration's program to conduct warrantless electronic surveillance \non U.S. persons--a practice I believe is unlawful under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act.\n  During his nomination hearing before the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, General Hayden admitted to participating in the design of \nthe electronic surveillance program during his tenure as director of \nthe National Security Agency. And as the Principal Deputy Director of \nNational Intelligence, General Hayden became the chief advocate for the \nelectronic surveillance program, even taking the unusual step of \nappearing before the National Press Club to defend the Administration's \nprogram.\n  We are all united in fighting terrorism, but we can do it in a legal \nand constitutional way that gets the bad guys and protects our values \nand freedoms.\n  While I oppose the nomination of General Hayden because of the \ncontroversy surrounding the electronic surveillance program, I wish him \nthe very best and hope that he will turn out to be a strong and \nindependent leader at the CIA.\n  But I also hope that the Intelligence Committees in the House and \nSenate will conduct careful and thorough oversight over General Hayden \nand the CIA to ensure that the civil liberties of U.S. citizens are \nprotected.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, today I voted to confirm the \nnomination of General Michael Hayden to be Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency replacing my friend and Florida colleague Porter \nGoss. I voted to confirm General Hayden based on his impressive record \nas a career intelligence officer in a broad spectrum of strategic \nintelligence activities and programs. He is widely regarded as one of \nthe most qualified intelligence planners and managers among military or \ncivilian intelligence professionals.\n  Despite my vote in favor of his confirmation I remain deeply \nconcerned that recent revelations regarding domestic intelligence \ncollection by the National Security Agency may have violated our laws. \nIn hearings before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence General \nHayden often deferred questions about the program, the President's and \nJustice Department's statements about the program, and his own \ninvolvement in the NSA's activity to closed sessions. My Intelligence \nCommittee colleagues pursued these questions and ultimately recommended \napproval of the nomination on a bipartisan 12-3 vote. I still have many \nquestions about this program and how it was conceived and operated, and \nI will continue to seek answers to them. However, General Hayden has \nsufficiently demonstrated his objectivity, independence and openness \nthat I am comfortable with confirming his nomination.\n  Given the threats our Nation faces today and challenges that our \nintelligence system has had coping with those threats, General Hayden \nshould bring to this position much needed efficient, effective and, \nmost importantly, independent leadership and management. That should be \ngood for our intelligence agencies and good for the Nation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am casting my vote today in favor of \nGEN Michael V. Hayden to be Director of Central Intelligence. General \nHayden has a strong background in intelligence. He has spent his career \nin national security and particularly intelligence, serving as \nCommander of the Air Intelligence Agency and as Director of the \nNational Security Agency. General Hayden has served overseas in \nleadership positions with the U.S. Government in South Korea and \nBulgaria, and is currently Principal Deputy Director of National \nIntelligence, serving directly under Director of National Intelligence, \nJohn Negroponte. General Hayden was straightforward in his answers to \ntough questions during his confirmation process, showing a clear \ncommand of the issues of national security and the challenges facing \nthe intelligence community.\n  The confirmation process has also brought to light General Hayden's \nleadership qualities. At this time of change and realignment at the \nCIA, strong leaders are clearly needed. The agency has had a difficult \ntime adapting to the changes in the intelligence community structure \nand has suffered a decline in morale and sense of mission. By all \naccounts, General Hayden\n\n[[Page S5314]]\n\nwill bring a welcome change at the top, hopefully infusing the agency \nwith a new sense of direction and relevance that is badly needed.\n  I remain very concerned, however, that the wiretapping activities of \nthe NSA have been insufficiently investigated. General Hayden insisted \nin his confirmation hearings that he was given unequivocal legal advice \neach step of the way. I do not doubt that this is true, but I believe \nthat significant and compelling questions still remain about the \nvalidity of the legal foundation for the wiretapping programs. I have \nyet to be convinced that these activities are legal. Even if they are \nfound to be legal, I question whether we really want our Government to \nbe engaged in these activities.\n  But the debate on the NSA activities is far larger than just General \nHayden. This debate must go on in depth and focus on the legal and \npolicy issues at stake, not on the personalities of those involved.\n  We need to get the CIA back onto its feet and functioning properly. I \nbelieve that General Hayden is capable of doing that. I trust he will \nput his considerable skills to work in earnest on this task, as its \nsuccess is critical to our national security.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, the men and women at the CIA today \nrepresent the best intelligence professionals in the world, and they \ndeserve the best leadership and support. I have known General Hayden \nfor some time, and I am convinced that he is the right person for this \njob.\n  My initial concern regarding a military officer directing the world's \nmost sophisticated civilian intelligence agency have been addressed by \nGeneral Hayden in private conversation as well as at the public \nhearing. The role and mission of the intelligence community at the \nDepartment of Defense where General Hayden has been for over 30 years \nis different from the role and mission of the CIA. General Hayden has \nconvinced me that he can make the transition from the military side to \nthe civilian side of the intelligence community while continuing to \nmove the CIA in a positive direction of change and transition.\n  General Hayden has been instrumental in building our intelligence \ncapabilities to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Even before \nbecoming the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence, \nGeneral Hayden has demonstrated his willingness to express his opinion \nand speak his mind. His credibility and integrity are second to none. \nHe brings all these traits to his position as the Director of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency.\n  He also brings with him the experience of leading an organization in \ntransformation when he was at the National Security Agency. Today the \nCIA is in transformation to position itself from the preeminent \nintelligence organization during the Cold War to becoming an \nintelligence organization focused on new threats and national security \nissues such as countering terrorism, preventing countries such as Iran \nand North Korea from obtaining nuclear weapons, and protecting \nAmerica's interests in Asia, Latin America, and elsewhere.\n  General Hayden will face challenges as he continues this \ntransformation to ensure that the CIA continues to be the world class \norganization it must be to address these threats. This means continuing \nefforts to replace the old, risk adverse system that was not positioned \nto address the threats we are facing now and may face in the future. It \nalso means ensuring the Agency does not reverse course by infusing \nideas that previously opposed change, information sharing, or \noversight.\n  Throughout his career, General Hayden has proven his management and \nleadership abilities. He will provide the enthusiastic and dedicated \nofficers at CIA the ``top cover'' necessary for them to undertake the \ninnovative approaches to intelligence gathering that is required to \npenetrate the hard targets of today, and I am confident he will be able \nto keep the CIA moving on the right course.\n  Finally, General Hayden will head an organization that is responsible \nfor managing our national human intelligence effort. His military \nexperience combined with his experience as the Principal Deputy \nDirector of National Intelligence will serve him well as he integrates \nthe human intelligence efforts of the Department of Defense, the FBI, \nand others into the National Clandestine Service, recognizing the \nrequirements and capabilities of those organizations as he establishes \ncommon standards designed to further strengthen our country's \nintelligence capabilities.\n  I believe General Hayden is a qualified and dedicated person to lead \nthe CIA at this critical juncture, and I look forward to working \nclosely with him as the Director of the CIA.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote against the nomination of \nMichael Hayden to be Director of the CIA because I am not convinced \nthat the nominee respects the rule of law and Congress's oversight \nresponsibilities. General Hayden is highly experienced and talented. \nAnd some of his testimony before the Intelligence Committee, including \nhis acknowledgment that the intelligence process was manipulated in the \nlead-up to the war in Iraq, was encouraging.\n  It was therefore particularly disappointing that General Hayden \nfailed to dispel serious concerns about his direction and defense of a \nprogram to illegally wiretap Americans on American soil without the \nrequired warrants. Having finally been briefed about this program last \nweek, I am more convinced than ever that this program is illegal. I am \nequally convinced that there is no reason that this program could not \nhave been briefed to the congressional intelligence committees 4\\1/2\\ \nyears ago, as is required by law. Yet General Hayden expressed no \ndoubts or concerns about the legality of the program or the \nadministration's failure to inform Congress.\n  It is not sufficient for General Hayden to say that the lawyers told \nhim it was okay. He has an independent obligation to abide by the law. \nNo one can force him to break the law--not the lawyers and not the \nPresident. Nor were the legal issues especially complex or beyond the \nunderstanding of a very intelligent and experienced intelligence \nprofessional. For years, General Hayden had been conducting \nsurveillance in compliance with the FISA law. For years, the NSA had \nbeen notifying the congressional intelligence committees about its \nprograms. Then, one day, everything changes. FISA no longer applies--\nand, by the way, don't tell Congress. We know from General Hayden's \ntestimony in 2002 that he understands the importance of the legal \nprotections that FISA provides regarding surveillance of U.S. persons. \nHis decision that it was OK to secretly bypass those protections is \ninexcusable.\n  The Congress must stand up for the law and for our constitutional \nsystem of checks and balances. I believe that the President must be \nheld accountable for breaking the law and for insisting that he can \ncontinue to do so. I am deeply concerned that, unless this body speaks, \nit will be seen by history as having consented to this illegal action.\n  But those who carried out and defended this program also have some \nresponsibility. We know, from Attorney General Gonzales' testimony to \nthe Judiciary Committee, that this administration acknowledges \nvirtually no limits to its authority. Under the theories put forward by \nthe administration's lawyers, whenever national security is supposedly \nat stake, no laws are binding and Congress is merely an inconvenience. \nThese assertions are contrary to our constitutional system and they are \ndangerous. And they cannot serve as an excuse for experienced leaders \nlike General Hayden who know better.\n  My decision to vote against General Hayden is not simply about \nresponsibility for past conduct, although that is important. I will \nvote against this nominee because, given his recent actions and his \nless than reassuring testimony, I am not convinced that he will abide \nby the laws relevant to the position of the Director of the CIA. When I \nasked General Hayden about legally binding restrictions on the \nauthorities of the CIA, such as those prohibiting the CIA from engaging \nin domestic security, he spoke about Presidential authority and \nconsultations with Government lawyers. That was also his response to \nquestions about illegal warrantless wiretapping as well. We know what \nthis administration's lawyers have to say about following the law, and \nGeneral Hayden provided no reassurance that he will see things any \ndifferently.\n  General Hayden's conduct and testimony also raise serious questions\n\n[[Page S5315]]\n\nabout his willingness to respect congressional oversight. He was \ncomplicit in the administration's failure to inform the full \ncongressional intelligence committees about the warrantless \nsurveillance program, even though this notification is required by law. \nIn his testimony, he repeatedly failed to explain or criticize the \nadministration's failure to inform the full committees about the \nprogram. As Director of the CIA, General Hayden would have a legally \nbinding duty to keep the congressional intelligence committees informed \nof CIA activities. If General Hayden does not acknowledge this duty, we \ncannot be assured that the Congress will be kept fully and currently \ninformed, as is required by law.\n  Finally, I remain concerned about previous misleading testimony by \nGeneral Hayden regarding warrantless surveillance and his explanation \nfor that testimony. In 2002, he told a joint congressional committee \nthat, under FISA, persons inside the United States ``would have \nprotections as what the law defines as a U.S. person and I would have \nno authorities to pursue it.'' In fact, the President had already \nauthorized the NSA to bypass those legal protections. General Hayden's \nexplanation for this statement, that he was speaking in open session at \nthe time and had earlier given a fuller briefing to the committee in \nclosed session, does not justify a public misleading statement.\n  Our country needs a CIA Director who is committed to fighting \nterrorism aggressively without breaking the law or infringing on the \nrights of Americans. General Hayden's role in implementing and publicly \ndefending the warrantless surveillance program does not give me \nconfidence that he is capable of fulfilling this important \nresponsibility.\n  The stakes are high. Al-Qaida and its affiliates seek to destroy us. \nWe must fight back and we must join this fight together, as a nation. \nBut when administration officials ignore the law and ignore the other \nbranches of Government, it distracts us from fighting our enemies.\n  I am disappointed that the President decided to make such a \ncontroversial nomination at this time. In keeping with Senate \nhistorical practices, I defer to Presidents in considering nominations \nto positions in the executive branch. I do not believe it is the role \nof the Senate to reject nominees simply because they share the ideology \nof the person who nominated them. But we should not confirm a nominee \nfor this position of great responsibility when his conduct and \ntestimony raise such troubling questions about his adherence to the \nrule of law.\n  (At the request of Mr. Levin, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the Senate today considers the \nnomination of GEN Michael Hayden to be Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency. I support General Hayden's confirmation. He is the \nright person to lead the CIA out of a period of turmoil and \ncontroversy.\n  Without question General Hayden has the necessary credentials. He is \na career Air Force intelligence officer who led the National Security \nAgency for longer than anyone in the history of that agency. When he \ntook over the NSA it was no longer at the cutting edge of information \ntechnology as it had been during the Cold War. Not everything he tried \nworked but he led the agency's turnaround. We no longer worry, as we \ndid in 1999, that the NSA is on the verge of going deaf.\n  General Hayden left the NSA a year ago to become the Principal Deputy \nDirector of National Intelligence--the number two job in the new \norganization created by Congress to modernize the intelligence \ncommunity. He has helped Director John Negroponte start the process of \nbuilding a cohesive community from the 16 disparate intelligence \nagencies. Now he will have a chance to continue working on that \nintegration as the Director of the agency that is the lynchpin for U.S. \nintelligence, the CIA.\n  While his qualifications are obvious, General Hayden's selection is \nnot without controversy. As Director of the NSA he designed and \nimplemented a warrantless surveillance program, authorized by the \nPresident, to intercept communications inside the United States. The \ngoal of this program is to find terrorists, something every Member of \nthis body supports. But the program's questionable legal underpinnings \nand the decision to keep it hidden from most Members of Congress have \nraised questions about General Hayden's judgment and independence.\n  I wrote Director Negroponte in February expressing my view that \nGeneral Hayden's role in the public defense of the NSA program was \ninappropriate for an intelligence official. I reiterated that concern \ndirectly to General Hayden in a letter to him prior to his confirmation \nhearing last week. Officials of the intelligence community must avoid \neven the appearance of politicization.\n  General Hayden addressed this issue in his hearing and responded \nprivately to my letter. After carefully considering his answers and his \nresponse, I am convinced that he believes the NSA program is legal. I \nalso believe his public appearances were in large part his effort to \ndefend the men and women of the NSA. I still believe his participation \nin the White House public relations campaign was inappropriate, but I \nbelieve his explanation is sincere.\n  I raise this issue because it gets to the heart of what I think will \nbe General Hayden's challenge at the CIA--rebuilding the agency's \ncredibility and reestablishing its independence. The CIA was \nestablished in 1947 to be an independent source of intelligence for the \nPresident and other senior policymakers. We have no less a need for \nthat independence now than we did then. The Government, both the \nexecutive branch and the Congress, must have intelligence that is \ntimely, objective, and independent of political considerations. This is \nnot just a goal; it is the standard set in law.\n  Unfortunately, over the past few years we have witnessed a pattern of \ncynical manipulation of intelligence for political purposes. This \npoliticization has damaged the credibility of the intelligence \ncommunity and undermined America's efforts to deal with critical \nnational security challenges. General Hayden must take steps to assert \nhis and the CIA's independence.\n  The situation in the period prior to the Iraq war must never be \nrepeated. Administration officials accepted without question any nugget \nof intelligence, no matter how poorly sourced, if it supported the \ndecision to go to war with Iraq. In areas where the intelligence did \nnot support the administration's preconceived view, such as alleged \nIraqi ties to al-Qaida and the 9/11 attacks, the administration \nbadgered the intelligence community to find a link, ignored the \nintelligence that showed there was none, and set up a rogue \nintelligence operation at the Defense Department to aggressively push \nthe alleged connection.\n  But perhaps the most blatant abuse of the intelligence process was \nand continues to be the leaking and selective declassification of \nintelligence information to support particular policy goals. Many of my \ncolleagues have decried the unauthorized disclosures that regularly \nappear in the press. I join them in condemning these damaging leaks. \nBut it is important to understand that most disclosures of intelligence \ninformation are generated by executive branch officials pushing a \nparticular policy, and not by the rank-and-file employees of the \nintelligence agencies. This has been the pattern of the current \nadministration, particularly related to Iraq.\n\n  Based on his past performance I am sure that General Hayden will \nstand up to blatant attempts to influence intelligence judgments. I \nalso believe he has the character to speak out when he believes the \nintelligence process is being misused by senior policymakers.\n  General Hayden also will need to regain the trust of the Congress. \nThe administration's repeated refusal to allow effective oversight of \nsome of the most important intelligence programs has endangered \ncritical intelligence capabilities and alienated the Intelligence \nCommittees when their support is most needed. Signals intelligence and \nintelligence obtained from detainees are critical elements of our \nefforts to detect and stop terrorists. But the administration's ill-\nadvised attempts to shield these programs from oversight have created \nsuspicion and undermined public support for our counterterrorism \nefforts. Sustaining\n\n[[Page S5316]]\n\nthese kinds of intelligence programs over the long term requires the \nCongress to be a full partner from the beginning. Our mutual goal \nshould be to ensure that critical intelligence programs receive the \nattention and support they need to be effective.\n  Some have questioned the wisdom of a military officer serving in this \nposition. While I want to make sure that General Hayden is outside of \nthe military chain of command, I am convinced that General Hayden's \nmilitary experience will enable him to successfully manage the \nimportant and sometimes difficult relationship between the CIA and the \nDepartment of Defense. As CIA Director he also will be the national \nmanager of human intelligence collection activities across all \nagencies, including the Defense Department. This function is essential \nto ensuring effective coordination of our sensitive intelligence \noperations overseas. We cannot afford the creation of redundant \ncapabilities or any confusion as to who is in charge of these delicate \noperations.\n  General Hayden will take over the helm of the CIA at a time of rapid \nexpansion of the workforce and following a period of dramatic decline \nin employee morale. Under his predecessor's tenure the CIA lost many of \nits most experienced and talented officers. He will need to move \nquickly to convince the current workforce that the days of political \nlitmus tests are over and experienced professionals will be in charge \nrather than political cronies.\n  I cannot overstate the importance of the job General Hayden is \nundertaking. The CIA and our other intelligence agencies are the front \nline of our defense. The CIA must find better ways to penetrate targets \nsuch as Iran and North Korea while continuing to adapt to the ever \nchanging tactics of the international terrorist movement.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee's 2004 review of Iraq intelligence \nexposed some glaring problems in the collection and analysis of \nintelligence. The CIA has been undergoing its own internal review and \nhas begun integrating the lessons it has learned. It will be General \nHayden's job to see that the CIA embraces the reforms needed to deal \nwith the challenges of the 21st century. I am confident he is the right \nperson for the task.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the CIA must at all costs avoid a repeat of \nthe pre-Iraq war intelligence fiasco, when CIA Director Tenet said the \ncase for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was a ``slam dunk,'' and \nthen proceeded to distort and exaggerate underlying intelligence in \norder to support the administration's Iraq policy. The CIA needs an \nindependent Director who will speak truth to power and provide \nobjective assessments of a professional intelligence community, and not \ntry to please policymakers by telling them what they want to hear.\n  General Hayden not only promises to be independent and objective, \nGeneral Hayden has proven he has the backbone to do so.\n  For instance, General Hayden is perhaps the only high-level official \nwho has criticized the Department of Defense policy office of Douglas \nFeith. That office, before the war began, undertook to use a direct \npipeline to the White House for distorted intelligence assessments, \nbypassing mechanisms in place which are intended to produce balanced, \nobjective assessments.\n  General Hayden has done more than speak openly of his concerns about \nthe Feith operation. He acted upon them by placing a cautionary \ndisclaimer on the reporting of his agency relative to the links that \nFeith and others were trying to create between Saddam Hussein and al-\nQaida, so that his agency's reports could be misused for that purpose.\n  Again, speaking truth to power, General Hayden showed independence \nwhen he stood up against the positions being urged by Secretary of \nDefense Donald Rumsfeld during the recent reforms of the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  As to the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency, \nwhich General Hayden formerly led, many of us have concerns. But those \nconcerns as to the legality and as to the decision to implement the \nalleged collection of phone numbers called by millions of Americans \nshould be placed at the doorstep of the Attorney General and the White \nHouse.\n  I am one of those being briefed on the program, and I have a number \nof concerns. But my concerns are with the legality and privacy \nintrusions and effectiveness of the program authorized by the \nPresident, and given the legal imprimatur of the Attorney General. I \nknow of no evidence that General Hayden acted beyond the program's \nguidelines as set up by the President and the Attorney General.\n  I will vote for General Hayden's confirmation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nGEN Michael Hayden to be the next Director of the CIA.\n  I support his confirmation first because I think General Hayden's \nvision for the future of the CIA is right on point.\n  He has pledged to make the collection of human intelligence a top \npriority--a necessary move in understanding our Nation's enemies and \nthe threats we face.\n  At the same time, General Hayden understands the failures of analysis \nprior to the Iraq war and is committed to making major changes.\n  Only time will tell, but I am hopeful that General Hayden has what it \ntakes to put the agency on the right path after recent collection and \nanalytic failures.\n  Secondly, I think General Hayden brings with him the overarching view \nof the entire intelligence community needed to carry out the vision and \ntransition the CIA to deal with the new asymmetric threat posed by the \nterrorist world. I think this is critically important at this time.\n  General Hayden served 6 years as the Director of the National \nSecurity Agency, the largest intelligence agency in the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  He ably led a transformation from a Cold War institution to a key \ncomponent of our Nation's counterterrorism efforts.\n  Additionally, he served as Principal Deputy Director of National \nIntelligence under Ambassador Negroponte for the past year.\n  In this role, he oversaw the day-to-day operations of the Office of \nthe DNI, and many of the DNI's accomplishments to date can be directly \nattributed to General Hayden's service.\n  Third, I am pleased that General Hayden made a commitment to me to \nappoint experienced intelligence professionals to serve on his direct \nstaff and in senior positions across the agency.\n  I also support the administration's intention to name Stephen Kappes \nas the Deputy Director of the CIA.\n  Mr. Kappes brings a wealth of experience in the clandestine service \nto the agency's senior leadership.\n  Perhaps more importantly, his return to the agency has already gone a \nlong way to assure operators that they are well represented in \nmanagement and that their concerns will be met.\n  General Hayden will come to the agency at a time of major personnel \nproblems.\n  But he has already taken steps to move the agency beyond the problems \nof the past and that is good news.\n  There is no question that the concerns that have been raised about \nGeneral Hayden are legitimate and important.\n  Before my meeting with General Hayden and his appearance at the \nconfirmation hearings, I was concerned that he will not be sufficiently \nindependent of the Department of Defense. On this point, I have been \nreassured.\n  General Hayden has shown his independence in the past, and has \ncommitted that if he finds his uniform to be a hindrance in any way, he \nwill ``take it off.''\n  Similarly, the Intelligence Committee will need to pay close \nattention to intelligence activities of the Department of Defense, \nespecially in the area of human intelligence.\n  I have concerns that the Pentagon is going too far in this area, and \nI want to make sure that the CIA remains the leader and primary \nprovider of this type of intelligence collection.\n  My greatest concern about General Hayden is that he was not more \nforthcoming in his answers during the open confirmation hearing.\n  Many members asked important questions on the NSA domestic \nsurveillance program and on detention, interrogation and rendition \npolicies.\n  In my view, the public deserved more forthcoming answers than those \nprovided by General Hayden.\n  For example, I felt that General Hayden should have stated clearly, \nin full\n\n[[Page S5317]]\n\npublic view, whether he believes that certain interrogation techniques \nconstitute torture. He could say yes or no without disclosing sources \nand methods.\n  It is my hope that General Hayden will be more forthcoming once he is \nconfirmed as Director of the CIA.\n  The challenge ahead of General Hayden is daunting, but it is \nabsolutely critical to our nation's security that he succeed.\n  I believe General Hayden is the sound intelligence professional the \nCIA needs to regain its footing as the world's premier spy service and \nthe hub of our nation's intelligence analysis and research and \ndevelopment capabilities.\n  I look forward to working with him to protect the American people.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in several crucial respects, the CIA today \nis in disarray, and fixing our premier intelligence agency must be a \ntop priority. The CIA must become as effective as we need it to be in \ncombating terrorism and in serving all of our national security \ninterests. The keys to a strong and competent CIA are the independence \nand proficiency of its leadership.\n  I had a lengthy private discussion with General Hayden in deciding \nhow I would vote on his confirmation. Our discussion confirmed the \nconfidence that I have long had in General Hayden's professionalism and \ncompetence. I remain outraged about the controversial domestic \nsurveillance initiatives that the NSA has overseen at the White House's \ndirection, but the fact remains that President Bush and Vice President \nCheney--not General Hayden--were the ``deciders'' in ordering this \nsurveillance of Americans, with then-White House Counsel Gonzales \nacting in his capacity to validate a program that was structured and \noperated outside the checks and balances of existing law.\n  The CIA right now is in desperate need of professionalism after the \ndebacle of the Agency's outgoing leadership, and my discussions with \nGeneral Hayden have led me to conclude that he has the competence, the \nexperience, and the independence to serve capably in helping to repair \nthe damage that has been done to the Agency. I will vote for his \nconfirmation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nGeneral Hayden as the new Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. \nBased on my review of his long record as a career intelligence man and \nhis answers to some important questions during his confirmation \nhearing, I am hopeful General Hayden will provide the CIA the kind of \nnon-partisan leadership it has sorely lacked for the past several \nyears.\n  And I am also hopeful that this nomination signifies that the Bush \nadministration has recognized, finally, that professionals, not \npartisans should be put in charge of national security.\n  General Hayden has impeccable credentials and a career in \nintelligence matters that is as impressive as it is long. Anyone can \nread the public record and quickly see that this man is more than \nqualified for this job.\n  And my personal meeting with General Hayden shortly after he was \nnominated only served to reinforce that impression. I met with him \nprivately--one on one--in my office just off this floor, for more than \n45 minutes.\n  During the course of that meeting, we discussed General Hayden's \ncareer in the Air Force from 1969 until today and his dedicated service \nto America's intelligence community that ultimately earned him a fourth \nstar.\n  My meeting convinced me that General Hayden understands and respects \nthe role of Congress in national security matters. He seems to grasp \nhow essential it is that he consult regularly with the congressional \nleadership on these critical issues. And he seems to recognize the need \nto keep the congressional oversight committees fully informed about the \nintelligence community's activities.\n  All of these are important because we are a nation at war and actions \nby the Bush administration have left our intelligence community--this \nNation's eyes and ears on those who mean us harm in disarray.\n  As a direct result of this administration's actions, the Central \nIntelligence Agency and those it placed under contract have been \ndirectly implicated in numerous instances of abuse of detainees that \nhave given this nation a black eye around the world and been \ncounterproductive to winning the fight against terrorism.\n  The findings of our intelligence community are increasingly \nquestioned by the American people and the world.\n  And scores of incredibly talented and experienced career intelligence \nprofessionals have been driven from their jobs because they insisted on \nspeaking the truth rather than tow the Administration's line.\n  Things apparently got so out of hand at CIA in recent months that the \nPresident's intelligence advisory board finally had to intervene and \nrecommend change.\n  All of these developments have harmed national security and placed \nAmericans at greater risk. And it is against this difficult backdrop \nthat the Senate debates the nomination of General Hayden. As Senator \nLevin said in the confirmation hearings, ``The next Director must right \nthis ship and restore the CIA to its critically important position.''\n  I want to briefly lay out the three major challenges that I believe \nGeneral Hayden faces in ensuring that he achieves the success the \nSenate expects of his tenure.\n  The first challenge is independence.\n  General Hayden needs to speak truth to power and call the shots as he \nsees them, not as he thinks his boss wants them seen. Rebuilding the \nindependence of intelligence also means ending its politicization. \nGeneral Hayden must stand up to an administration that has either \nattempted to bully the intelligence community into saying what it \nwanted or worked around it when it couldn't get the answers it needed. \nGeneral Hayden must provide assurances to Congress that intelligence \nassessments, and professional intelligence civil servants, will be \nprotected from outside interference, not politicized.\n  The second challenge is openness to oversight.\n  This administration has refused to follow the law and Senate rules \nthat require keeping the intelligence committees fully and currently \ninformed of important intelligence practices. Administration ideologues \nhave apparently authorized detention and interrogation practices that \nhave backfired in our efforts in the war on terror, and concocted \ncontroversial legal arguments for presidential powers backing a \nwarrantless surveillance program that circumvents the law--all without \nkeeping Congress properly informed as required under the law. General \nHayden must ensure that Congress is able to carry out its \nconstitutional obligations on critical national security matters.\n  The third challenge is fixing our strategy in the war on terror.\n  After more than 4 years of the war on terror, Osama bin Laden remains \nat large and al-Qaida and other radical fundamentalist terrorist \norganizations pose a grave threat to our security. Terrorist attacks \nhave increased not decreased on this administration's watch. Two of the \nthree so-called axes of evil are more dangerous today than they were \nwhen President Bush first uttered that memorable phrase and the third, \nIraq, is on the verge of becoming what it was not before the war--a \nhaven and launching pad for international terrorists. And America's \nstanding in the world has reached record lows in critical regions of \nthe world.\n  In the short run, General Hayden must insist that the Bush \nadministration redouble and refocus its efforts that go after ``high \nvalue targets''. It is a travesty--a travesty--that nearly 5 years \nafter 9/11, the Bush administration has not captured or killed Osama \nbin Laden. The CIA must lead efforts to understand the challenge posed \nby Iran and North Korea and their nuclear ambitions.\n  General Hayden must also build a global human intelligence capability \nover the next several years with diverse officers who understand the \ncultures and speak the languages of every key target across the entire \nglobe. The CIA must play a leading role in understanding how to help \nwin the battle of ideas going on within the Islamic world, and how to \nchange the calculus of the young so that new generations of terrorists \nare not created.\n  These are all large and important challenges, with grave consequences \nfor America and the world. Based on\n\n[[Page S5318]]\n\neverything I have seen I am hopeful he is up to the task. And I am \nhopeful this administration will let him do the job for which it \nnominated him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of General Michael V. Hayden, United States \nAir Force, to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about the \nnomination of General Michael V. Hayden to be Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency. I regret that I was not able to vote to confirm \nhis nomination at this time, and I would like to take a few minutes to \nexplain my vote.\n  As my colleagues may know, I voted to confirm General Hayden when he \nwas nominated to be the Deputy Director of National Intelligence, DNI. \nI stand by that vote for two reasons. First, General Hayden is \nobviously qualified on paper to fill the position. Second, he was \nserving as Deputy to the current DNI, John Negroponte. So there was a \nclear line of authority.\n  But today when the Senate voted on his nomination to be Director of \nthe CIA, these two circumstances were significantly different. First, \nissues like the potentially illegal wiretapping of American citizens' \nphone lines by the National Security Agency--a program which General \nHayden reportedly designed and ran--have come to light. And second, he \nwill no longer be serving as a deputy but as head of one of our \nNation's premier intelligence agencies--yet he is not resigning his \ncommission as a uniformed officer. That raises the question of whether \nand to what degree he will be independent from decisions made at the \nPentagon.\n  Some of my colleagues have insisted that Secretary of Defense Donald \nRumsfeld will no longer be in the chain of command overseeing General \nHayden in his position at the CIA. Certainly, there is precedent for \nuniformed officers serving as head of the CIA. However, when we look at \nthis precedent we also have to realize that circumstances have changed. \nA not insignificant part of the reason that we invaded Iraq is because \nour Nation's intelligence was politicized, and because intelligence \nactivities were manipulated to justify a predetermined conclusion--that \nIraq had weapons of mass destruction.\n  Much of this intelligence manipulation was performed by intelligence \nbureaus within the Pentagon, under the supervision of Secretary \nRumsfeld, who has been steadily expanding the Pentagon's role in U.S. \nintelligence activities. It would seem to this Senator that given \nSecretary Rumsfeld's track record, concentrating intelligence in his \nhands would be unwise to say the least.\n  The truth is that we don't really know how much independence General \nHayden will show with respect to the Secretary of Defense. After all, \nhe is a military officer, with an active commission. And the record is \nmixed with respect to predicting how the cards will fall. On one hand, \nthere are reports that he stood up to Secretary Rumsfeld and other \npolitical appointees in the President's Cabinet on certain occasions. \nOn the other hand, he reportedly designed and strongly supported a \nprogram to wiretap the homes of American citizens, whose legality is in \nquestion.\n  If he was just following orders, these circumstances raise serious \nquestions about his ability to exercise independence as Director of the \nCIA. If, as is widely believed, he was the driving force behind the \nNSA's wiretapping program, then I question his ability to balance the \nimportant need to defend our Nation from threats with the equally \nimportant need to protect constitutional rights of all Americans.\n  I frankly think it is a shame that Congress didn't take a few more \ndays, or even a couple of weeks, to more deeply probe these fundamental \nissues of security and liberty. Indeed, if this body had taken \nsufficient steps to get answers about the NSA's wiretapping program, \nand if General Hayden had considered leaving his role as an active \nmilitary officer during his tenure as CIA Director, then it is possible \nthat the concerns I mentioned might have been alleviated.\n  I also regret the fact, however, that President Bush didn't pick \nsomebody who was equally qualified but not tied in to controversial \nprograms such as collecting telephone information and listening in to \nconversations between American citizens. Because in this time of \ndifficulty for the CIA, we don't just need someone who is qualified, we \nalso need someone who is credible. While the extent of General Hayden's \ninvolvement in these activities is as yet unclear, I am concerned that \nhis role could potentially undermine his ability to carry out his \nduties as head of the CIA.\n  Mr. President, despite some opposition, General Hayden was confirmed \nearlier this morning by the Senate. At this juncture, I can only hope \nthat he proves my concerns to be unfounded. I wish him only the best in \npursuing a goal that I know we all share--the safety and well-being of \nAmerican citizens in this time of war.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President will be immediately notified.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I know Senator Nelson will have 2 minutes \nof remarks to make; 30 seconds for me. The next vote will be our last. \nWe anticipate a voice vote on the confirmation of Dirk Kempthorne after \ncloture is invoked. We are working on agreement for when we return. I \nexpect the next votes to occur on the morning of Tuesday, June 6.\n\n\n               100 Hours of Service as Presiding Officer\n\n  Two quick congratulations: On behalf of the entire Senate, I \ncongratulate two Senators for their presiding service. Earlier this \nweek, Senator Vitter reached the 100-hour mark and will receive the \nGolden Gavel Award; and later this morning, Senator Isakson will get \nhis 100th hour of service. We thank them both for their efforts in the \nChair.\n  (Applause, Members rising.)\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/26/senate-section/article/S5319-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5319-S5322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5319]]\n NOMINATION OF GENERAL MICHAEL V.

The President will be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action.\n  Senator Nelson is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today as a voice to \ncounter that of the giant multinational oil corporations. It has been \nduring three decades of my public service that I have held fast to a \npromise to fight to keep big oil away from Florida's coastlines, to \nkeep that industry from soiling our homes and from ruining our economy.\n  In Florida, a clean, healthy environment is the infrastructure of our \ntourism-driven economy, and it is the source of sustenance for millions \nof residents and visitors alike. In America, where we have only 3 \npercent of the world's oil reserves, our addiction to ``black gold'' \nwill not be broken just by more drilling but by mounting an aggressive \neffort to fully exploit greater efficiencies in alternative fuels.\n  As part of my promise to Florida, I have said that I could not \nsupport an Interior Secretary who would advance this administration's \nwillingness to acquiesce to the oil lobby and its ever-increasing \ndesire for greater profits beyond the recent record levels.\n  Mr. President, I know this nominee is a person deserving of our \nrespect. He is a gentleman. In fact, he will receive an overwhelming \nvote of support from the Senate. But I must stand on my principles to \noppose this nomination. I do so for the future of Florida and for the \nfuture of our country.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on \nExecutive Calendar No. 630, the nomination of Dirk Kempthorne, of \nIdaho, to be Secretary of the Interior shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

On this vote, the yeas are 85, the nays are 8. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I am not here to cast doubt on the \nqualifications of Governor Kempthorne to be the next Secretary of the \nInterior. In fact, I believe he is eminently qualified for the job. \nUnfortunately, that is also the problem. I fear that the Governor is \nall too qualified to take the helm of an agency that, in the past 5 \nyears, has drastically shifted its mission from one of conservation and \nprotection, to one of exploitation and commercialism. Governor \nKempthorne's record as a Senator, where he cast one vote in favor of \nthe environment in six years, does not give me much hope that he will \nbe able to reverse the trend.\n  If we are to ensure that our grandchildren will be able to marvel at \nthe majestic grandeur of this country's untouched wide open spaces, or \nlearn of their Nation's heritage at our historic treasures, or observe \nthe beauty of the astounding array of wildlife that roams the \ncontinent--it is essential that the next Secretary of the Interior \nrecommits the Department to being a good steward of the land for all \nthe people, and not a good server of it for the oil, mining, and timber \ncompanies. Given his consistently held positions for drilling in \nprotected areas of the Arctic and off our coastlines, weakening the \nEndangered Species Act, and opposing the protection of roadless areas \nin National Forests, among others, I do not believe that Governor \nKempthorne will make a change in the direction of the Interior \nDepartment.\n  I want it to be clear that the real problem is not with the nominee. \nThe real problem is with the policies of the administration, and the \nwillingness of the Secretary to carry them out without question. This \nadministration has certainly been no friend to the environment, and the \nprevious Secretary of the Interior was particularly adept at enabling \nits primary impulses. Whether it is in the waters off our beaches, in \nthe sensitive lands of the Arctic, or the wild places of the West, the \nadministration has consistently appeared to be working for the \ninterests of the oil and gas companies first, and the interests of the \npublic second. They have consistently pushed for opening the Alaska \nNational Wildlife Refuge. They have proposed opening the Mid-Atlantic \nto oil and gas drilling--barely 75 miles off the coast of New Jersey. \nAnd, according to the Government Accountability Office, they more than \ntripled the number of drilling permits approved for the West--to the \npoint where GAO found that the Bureau of Land Management was having \ntrouble meeting its environmental responsibilities.\n  The administration's disdain of public lands extends to the point \nthat they have now proposed selling it off to fund other programs or \nreduce the deficit. To his credit, the Governor flatly stated that he \ndid not approve of reducing the deficit this way, but he was not nearly \nas clear about whether he would use public land sales to fund other \nprograms. The Governor should not treat our public lands as if they \nwere an inventory that needed to be gotten rid of, but rather as an \nasset that needs to be protected and nurtured for future generations.\n  In New Jersey, we don't have an overabundance of public land, which \nmakes us value what we do have a great deal. Even in the most densely \npopulated State in the Nation, we have a number of treasures valued by \nall New Jerseyans--the Pinelands, the Highlands, the Delaware Water \nGap, our National Wildlife Refuges, our historic sites, and more. This \nis where we take our children to show them the beauty of nature, where \nwe learn about our\n\n[[Page S5320]]\n\npast, where we take our vacations, and where we welcome visitors from \nother States and other countries. But many of these would not exist \nwithout the help of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The Fund has \nnot only helped the Federal Government preserve these and other sites, \nit has also helped the State create parks, ballfields, and other \nrecreation areas. Liberty State Park, a green oasis in the middle of \nthe New Jersey metropolitan area, less than a half mile from Ellis \nIsland and the Statue of Liberty, would still be a tangle of deserted \nrailroad tracks if it wasn't for the help of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. Unfortunately, the administration has been carrying \non a multi-year assault on the fund, slicing it from $573 million in \n2002 to $142 million this year, and proposing only $85 million for \n2007. For the second straight year, they have proposed eliminating the \nState grant program entirely. This is not the way to run a program that \nis supposed to provide $900 million each year for land acquisition.\n  I am also very concerned about the overall direction that the \nNational Park Service has been moving in under this administration. \nFirst, the administration has inexplicably proposed rewriting the \nNational Park Service's management policies to take away the clear \nmandate to preserve the parks for future generations. We have not \ngotten any satisfactory answers as to why they have proposed this, but \nit is completely at odds with my view of why we have national parks, \nwhich is to protect our natural treasures for our children and our \ngrandchildren. But even if the policies are not rewritten, our parks \nare in danger of simply falling apart. The National Parks Service faces \na multibillion-dollar maintenance backlog, yet the administration has \nproposed slashing the account to fund that maintenance by over 30 \npercent.\n  This does not bode well for Ellis Island, where a large number of \nhistoric buildings are in danger of disappearing forever into crumbled \nbrick because the National Park Service has been stalling for years \ninstead of approving a redevelopment plan for the south side of the \nisland. This part of the island belongs to New Jersey, and a dedicated \nnonprofit group has spent years raising millions of dollars to prepare \nfor the rehabilitation of these structures, only to be thwarted by the \nNational Park Service.\n  Right next door, the Statue of Liberty has been held hostage by fear \nsince 9/11. The pedestal has been reopened, but visitors are still \nforbidden from making the unforgettable climb up to her crown to look \nout onto the harbor. Just yesterday, the Senate passed the amendment, \noffered by Senator Schumer and myself, that would require the Secretary \nof the Interior to take the necessary security precautions and open the \nstairway to Lady Liberty's crown once more. There is no reason it \nshould have taken this long to take the precautions necessary to ensure \nthat the statue is safe to climb, and there is no reason any longer for \nit to be held hostage to fear.\n  The National Park Service is not the only agency in the Interior \nDepartment facing crippling budget cuts that threaten its very mission. \nWildlife refuges throughout New Jersey are going to be losing staff in \nthe upcoming fiscal year; at least one refuge will be left without any \nstaff at all. The largest of our refuges, Edwin B. Forsythe, is going \nto have to close one of its offices, and make due with only one law \nenforcement officer for its 47,000 acres. This doesn't just detract \nfrom the experience for visitors. It also makes it tougher to protect \nagainst vandalism, littering, and other activities that harm the tens \nof thousands of birds and mammals that depend on the refuge as a \nsanctuary in a highly urbanized region.\n  This last point is extremely important. Making sure that wildlife has \naccess to the habitat it needs to thrive is absolutely essential, \nparticularly if endangered species are to survive. But right now the \nendangered species act is under attack. Last year, the other chamber \npassed a bill that would severely weaken a number of crucial \nprotections under that Act, including the elimination of critical \nhabitat. The Governor has a long record on endangered species issues, \nand much of it gives me great cause for concern. I hope that he will \ntake a careful look at this issue and not simply endorse policies \ndesigned to protect developers first and endangered species second.\n  I have just scratched the surface of the antienvironmental policies \nof the current administration. As I have limited myself to discussing \nthe Department of the Interior, I have not mentioned the misguided \npolicies designed to rollback the progress we have made in cleaning our \nair, our lakes, and our rivers, or the refusal of the administration to \nface the facts on global warming. We quite simply might never have the \ntime to completely cover that ground. But Governor Kempthorne has \ndemonstrated himself in the past to be aligned with the environmental \nphilosophy of this administration, and therefore I cannot support his \nnomination as Secretary of Interior. I have no illusions, however. I am \nfully aware that he will be confirmed, and I hope that he proves me \nwrong. Because we are in danger of making mistakes that we can not \neasily correct. And we need to reaffirm our commitment to being good \nstewards of the land for future generations. As Theodore Roosevelt \nsaid: ``I recognize the right and duty of this generation to develop \nand use the natural resources of our land; but I do not recognize the \nright to waste them, or to rob, by wasteful use, the generations that \ncome after us.'' I hope that the administration will take these words \nto heart.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to recognize the \ndistinguished achievement of my friend and fellow Idahoan Dirk \nKempthorne, who will be sworn in today as the 49th Secretary of the \nInterior of the United States. Throughout years of public service from \nmayor of Idaho's capitol, United States Senator, Governor, and now \nInterior Secretary, Dirk is a man of many accomplishments and is of the \nhighest character and integrity.\n  I have known Dirk since the 1980s when we both served the public in \nIdaho. As a matter of fact, I kind of owe my current job to him, as I \nwon his seat when he left the Senate to go back to Idaho to become \nGovernor.\n  Dirk has dedicated his life to public service. From his time in the \nIdaho Department of Lands, as mayor, as Senator, and as Governor, he \nhas always been recognized by those from both sides of the aisle for \nhis tremendous leadership skills. He utilizes his thorough \nunderstanding of policy together with cultured consensus-building \nabilities to see the most effective policies carried out through \nlegislation and governance. These qualities will serve the nation well \nas he takes on the many challenges facing the Department of the \nInterior in the 21st century.\n  Through the diversity of his public service, especially as mayor and \nGovernor, Dirk understands the real value of federalism, one that \nrecognizes that the Government closest to the people is asked to do the \nmost, often with fewest resources. His service as mayor taught him the \nlessons that ultimately led to his leadership in many relevant and \nimportant issues during his time in the Senate.\n  A further reflection of that approach is his pioneering work on \nEndangered Species Act issues. In addition to taking his seat in the \nSenate, Dirk preceded me as chairman of the Environment Subcommittee \nwith jurisdiction over species conservation. In that capacity, he led a \nbipartisan effort to update and improve our Nation's laws to better \nprotect and promote the recovery of endangered and threatened species \nwhile recognizing the funding challenges. As Governor, Dirk kept up \nthis beacon call and launched a successful public education initiative \nthrough the National Governors Association and Western Governors \nAssociation on the importance of ESA issues. Dirk is a respected \nnational authority on resource issues and a promoter of collaborative \ndecisionmaking to solve environmental conflicts.\n  As Governor, he has also forged a strong working relationship with \nthe five nationally recognized Native American tribes that reside in \nIdaho. Dirk recognizes the complexity of our trustee relationship with \nour tribes and has continuously sought to work cooperatively on matters \nthat affect both the State and Native Americans.\n  As chief steward of Idaho for the past 8 years, Dirk has vigorously \nchampioned innovation in environmental and natural resource sciences. \nUnder\n\n[[Page S5321]]\n\nhis guidance, the State has taken a leadership role in applying \nscientific and technological innovation and research to the complex \nworld of environmental and natural resource management. Dirk has also \nworked to advance the environmental mission of the Department of \nEnergy's Idaho National Laboratory. He understands that Idaho's \ndiversifying economy and unique resources require a dynamic mix of \nnatural resource protection, appropriate rural economic development, \nand smooth integration of scientific advancements, educational \nresearch, and business know-how.\n  Following the wildfires of 2000, Dirk worked with his fellow \nGovernors and Federal officials to help bring a new approach to forest \nhealth and wildfire management. Under his leadership, Idaho has \nestablished effective and well-received wolf and grizzly bear \nmanagement plans aimed at enhancing the State's responsibilities as \nFederal management is removed.\n  There is no question in my mind that Dirk Kempthorne will make a \nsuperlative Secretary and establish a proud and esteemed legacy, and I \ncongratulate him on this remarkable achievement and high honor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the position we are voting on, \nSecretary of the Interior Department, holds great importance for our \ncountry. The Department determines the fate of many of our public \nlands, including national parks and wildlife refuges. Of great \nimportance to New Jersey, the Secretary of Interior determines what \nactivities can take place on the Outer Continental Shelf. The Secretary \nof Interior implements critical laws like the Endangered Species Act, \nand administers some of our most important conservation programs like \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund. It should be a job for somebody \nwho believes in protecting our nation's great natural heritage, not \nselling it off to the highest bidder.\n  I served in the Senate with Governor Kempthorne, and we were members \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee at the same time. He is a \nskilled legislator and a congenial person, and I will vote to invoke \ncloture on his nomination, and for his confirmation. But I do want to \ntake this opportunity to express some concerns about Governor \nKempthorne's record on the environment, and about the Bush \nadministration's record, as well.\n  The League of Conservation Voters has given Governor Kempthorne a \nlifetime score of 1 percent, meaning he voted against the environment \nas judged by LCV 99 percent of the time. That does not give me great \nconfidence on how he will address issues of preserving wilderness, \nprotecting wildlife, or defending our coastal waters. Of course, these \nare areas where the administration has already compiled a poor record.\n  I am also concerned about whether Governor Kempthorne will continue \nthe pattern of pressuring scientists to alter their views to suit ill-\nadvised Bush administration policies.\n  Last year, we learned that an administration official named Philip \nCooney--an oil lobbyist before and after his White House stint--had \naltered scientific documents to change their conclusions about global \nwarming. This year, we have seen numerous reports of Bush \nadministration political appointees trying to intimidate and muzzle \nclimate scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \nand the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n  Similar concerns have been raised at Interior-based agencies. Twenty \npercent of Interior scientists who answered a survey by the Union of \nConcerned Scientists responded that they had been ``directed to \ninappropriately exclude or alter technical information from a \nscientific document.'' Moreover, 44 percent of the respondents said \nthat they have been ``directed, for non-scientific reasons, to refrain \nfrom making findings that are protective of species.''\n  The Fish & Wildlife Service fired a whistleblower who exposed the \nBush administration's use of flawed science to favor development \nprojects over protecting habitat for the Florida Panther.\n  This administration's contempt for science is deeply disturbing, and \nit would be a great disappointment if Governor Kempthorne were to \ncontinue to pursue policies based on ignoring, suppressing, or \nintimidating scientists.\n  Our country is blessed with countless national treasures from coast \nto coast and, in my view, the Interior Secretary's most important job \nis to restore and preserve those treasures. Despite the serious \nreservations I have raised here, I will support this nomination in the \nhope that Governor Kempthorne will shift this administration's unwise \npolicy emphasis on development over preservation, and I urge him to \nrespect unfettered scientific inquiry in the agencies he will oversee.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am mindful of Wisconsin's historic \ndedication to conservation and am keenly aware of the legacy of Gaylord \nNelson, John Muir, Aldo Leopold, and Sigurd Olson. My constituents \nregularly remind me of Wisconsin's environmental heritage and they \nexpect their leaders to help build a positive environmental future.\n  As the Secretary of the Interior, Governor Kempthorne will have the \nopportunity to chart a responsible course for managing our Nation's \npublic lands--a course very different from the one that the American \npeople have endured over the past 5 years. I am encouraged by Governor \nKempthorne's reputation for collaboration and consensus. While Governor \nKempthorne's environmental record does give me cause for concern, it \nhas been my practice to defer to presidents in considering nominees for \nCabinet positions. Consistent with that practice, I will vote to \nconfirm this nominee.\n  In his testimony before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nGovernor Kempthorne stated his belief that ``there is a no more \nbeautiful cathedral than the outdoors.'' I will take Governor \nKempthorne at his word and hope that he will lead the Department of the \nInterior in a manner consistent with those words.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the vote on the nomination of Dirk Kempthorne, and following \nthat vote that Senator Landrieu be recognized for 10 minutes, Senator \nStevens for 10 minutes, Senator Reed for 10 minutes, to be followed by \nSenator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Dirk Kempthorne, of Idaho, to be Secretary of the Interior?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to speak about Governor \nKempthorne's nomination, and now confirmation by this body, to be \nSecretary of the Interior, and I hope he will help us work through a \ncompromise that has eluded this Nation for some 45 years.\n  The Secretary of the Interior is in a pivotal position to help bring \nreason and rationale to this debate. I think that we, by confirming him \nthis morning, have put the right man in the job for what is ahead.\n  The Secretary of the Interior helps lead the debate and discussion \nabout the Nation's energy policies. There are many facets of that \npolicy, and it is multidimensional. It is one of the toughest issues \nfaced by this Congress. Because it is so regional, it brings very \npassionate debate on both sides of the issue.\n  I was pleased to cast my vote this morning for Governor Kempthorne, a \nformer Member of this body, and a man who has shown a great deal of \nability in terms of mediating very difficult issues. He showed that \nskill when he was a Member of the Senate, and I have no doubt that he \nwill show the same skill as he becomes Secretary of the Department of \nthe Interior.\n  One of the issues on which I look forward to working with him and my \ncolleagues is the issue I have spoken about so many times on the Senate \nfloor relative to offshore oil and gas drilling, a balance, a \npartnership of mutual respect between the Gulf Coast States and the \nNation regarding a partnership that is mutually beneficial.\n  As the Nation struggles to find new ways to produce oil and gas using \nthe\n\n[[Page S5322]]\n\ngreat minds of this Nation and the great technology that has been \ndeveloped; as the Nation needs so desperately more oil and more gas, \nparticularly natural gas; with the prices so high so that supplies can \nbe increased and, hopefully, demand can be reduced, prices can come \ndown, prices can stabilize, and the entire economy, from the Midwest to \nthe Northeast to the far West can benefit from that effort, I wanted to \nshow a graph of what I am speaking about because I think a picture is \nworth a thousand words, and I know I only have a few more minutes. This \nis why I continue to come to the Senate floor to say that the gulf \ncoast is America's only energy coast.\n  This represents the miles and miles of pipeline, rigs, and \ninfrastructure that have been developed in the Gulf of Mexico since the \nfirst well was drilled off of Creole, LA, in the gulf in the 1940s. By \nthe way, that community was just completely wiped out in the last \nhurricanes, Hurricanes Rita and Katrina. But right off of Creole, a \ntiny little community in southwest Louisiana, the first offshore oil \nplatform was drilled. Subsequently, over decades this infrastructure \nhas been built and it has been built better and better and stronger \nusing better technology, and as a result this country has benefited \nsignificantly from this contribution.\n  Another way to look at it is the oil and gas leasing that has \noccurred--which Secretary Kempthorne will now be responsible for, how \nthese leases occur, where they occur, and when they occur. As you can \nsee, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas have served as hosts to \nthis industry, and we have served proudly. But there is a crisis now in \nthe Gulf of Mexico, and it was brought to the televisions of every \nAmerican--every American--with the landfall of Katrina and Rita and the \nsubsequent flooding.\n  This is the devastation that has occurred along the gulf coast, the \nflooding in the city of New Orleans and in communities throughout \nLouisiana, and the frightening and real erosion of America's only \ncoastal wetlands the coastal wetlands of Louisiana. We have lost over a \nmillion square miles of wetlands, and we are losing 33 football fields \na day. Thirty-three football fields a day are being lost in this great \nand extraordinary wetland.\n  When people say: Senator, how are the beaches in Louisiana?\n  I say: We don't have beaches in Louisiana. We love the beaches that \nare in Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi. We have vacationed on them \nour whole lives. But we have the greatest delta system in America, \nbuilt over a million years by the Mississippi River itself, the land \nthat we actually live on. On this land are great wetlands that supply \nfishing, that host and serve as the home of the mighty Mississippi \nRiver, and serve as a platform for oil and gas.\n  As the Secretary will come to know, this oil and gas could not be \nretrieved or mined from the Gulf of Mexico without the partnership of \nthese Gulf Coast States. So what we are asking for is fairness. We are \nasking for a percentage, a percentage in dollars, from this drilling to \ncome back into this area and help us restore our wetlands and invest in \nthe infrastructure necessary to protect this great coast so that we can \nprovide our people with a bright and strong economic future.\n  I am going to submit a longer statement for the Record. Again, I \nsubmit, looking at this chart, and just showing one more, that when we \nsay the gulf coast is America's energy coast, these are the pipelines \nthat come from the Gulf of Mexico. You can see even the Rocky \nMountains. We are proud of the production that goes out West. We are \nproud of that production. But as you can see, a lot of our gas is \ncoming from Canada and, hopefully, more of our gas will come from \nAlaska.\n  I see my friend and colleague from Alaska, the senior Senator, on the \nSenate floor. We hope we can get more gas from Canada and from Alaska \nbecause we need it. But I want people to see where the gas is coming \nfrom. The gas is coming from Louisiana, and if you want more of it, \nthen, No. 1, help us to save our State from washing away in the gulf; \nand, No. 2, help us to share in some of these revenues that will go \nright back into these communities to support the industry and the \npeople and the schools and the churches and the towns that make this \nall possible. And, if not, then go find your gas somewhere else. I mean \nthat. Go find it somewhere else because we have a lot of it down here. \nWe are happy to give it, but we need some respect and cooperation on \nthis point.\n  The Senator from Alaska is here to speak, and I am going to be back \nlater this afternoon to finish the remarks that I want to put in the \nRecord. I see Secretary Kempthorne standing here. I appreciate him \nbeing on the floor to hear these remarks. I am looking forward to \nhaving him come to Louisiana. I said he is not much use to us with a \nbroken foot, so he has to get that foot fixed and then come on back so \nwe can take him out to offshore oil and gas rigs. He has promised to do \nthat, and I am sure he will get up to Alaska sometime soon to see the \ngreat work that Alaska does. He, of course, is very familiar, having \nbeen the Governor of Idaho, with the West. But, Governor, we are \nlooking forward to having you come down and visit us on the gulf coast.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/26/senate-section/article/S5322-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday the House of Representatives \npassed the bipartisan American-Made Energy and Good Jobs Act. This bill \ndirects the Secretary of the Interior to establish and implement a \nleasing program to enable the exploration, development, and production \nof Alaska's oil and gas resources in the Arctic Coastal Plain.\n  I come today to commend our House colleagues for taking this action. \nOpening the Coastal Plain to development will help stabilize energy \nprices, spur economic growth, and enhance our national security. The \nCoastal Plain is believed to be the second largest oilfield ever \ndiscovered in North America, capable of producing at least 1 million \nbarrels of oil per day. The National Defense Council estimates the \ndevelopment of the resources in our Coastal Plain will create between \n700,000 and 1 million American jobs.\n  A majority in both Houses of this Congress and 70 percent of all \nAmericans support exploration and development of Alaska's Coastal \nPlain. Our Senate colleagues should join those in the House and act to \nauthorize development of these domestic resources.\n  Going forward, the United States must increase domestic production to \nsecure our energy independence. Our Nation is in the midst of an energy \ncrisis. In 2003, gasoline cost $1.56 per gallon. This week, prices at \nthe pump are averaging $2.88 per gallon in my State and in some places \nover $4 a gallon.\n  In the 1990s, natural gas prices in the lower 48, as we call it, \naveraged $2.50 per thousand cubic feet. Today, natural gas costs \napproximately $6 per thousand cubic feet, more than twice as much. This \nsituation will only grow more serious. It is estimated that our LNG \nimports will increase by 500 percent in the near future. We also now \nface increased competition for that LNG from foreign nations.\n  In the last 14 years, India's oil consumption has doubled. China was \nthe second largest oil importer in the world in 2004. According to the \nEnergy Information Administration, by 2025, the world energy \nconsumption will increase by 57 percent.\n  Americans cannot conserve our way out of this problem, and we cannot \nsuspend the law of supply and demand. If we continue to lock up our \nlands, this country will not have the energy needed to keep up with the \nglobal economy. Conservation and alternative fuels are part of the \noverall solution, but to end\n\n[[Page S5323]]\n\nthis crisis, we must also increase our domestic production of oil and \ngas resources.\n  In 2004, Congress provided the financial incentives to move forward \nwith the Alaska natural gas pipeline. This pipeline, constructed to \nmove 35 trillion cubic feet of gas known to be in the Prudhoe Bay area, \nwhen completed, will deliver about 4 billion cubic feet of natural gas \nper day to the American market.\n  I now have serious concerns about the process for this pipeline being \nconstructed. Federal officials told me that it would take 44 months \nonce the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission receives an application \nto proceed with it. Congress can shorten this timeframe by declaring a \nstate of emergency, and we have to realize that it is a national \nemergency with regard to our future gas supply. Congress cannot \nintervene, however, until the State of Alaska has taken action on this \ngas pipeline. The pipeline is to move gas from State lands, lands which \nthe State of Alaska is the owner of, and the Alaska Natural Gas \nPipeline Act of 2004 stipulated that if an application was not received \nby the Federal Government by 2006 for the construction of this \npipeline, the Department of Energy could study the feasibility of a \npipeline to be built and owned by the Federal Government. This study is \nnow underway.\n  While Federal ownership is not the preferred course of action, given \nour Nation's current energy crisis and the emergency we face, this \nNation must ensure that this project moves forward as quickly as \npossible.\n  Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal published an interview \nwith Lord John Browne, the chief executive officer of the British \nPetroleum Company. Lord Browne told the paper: ``The growth for us in \nAlaska is gas.'' He was talking about, of course, the BP Company.\n  He said: ``Oil will continue, but gas will flip over and replace oil \nas the economic driver.'' He is talking about the enormous potential of \ngas in the Alaska economy. And he added that: ``Once our pipeline is \napproved, we can look forward to 50 years''--we can look forward to 50 \nyears--``of increased gas supplies.''\n  Now, our State and the Federal Government have to act quickly so that \nwe can begin to lay the foundation for this next 50 years of increased \ndomestically produced natural gas.\n  Alaska's energy resources are needed now. Our State's potential is \nstaggering. Trillions--I am told 32,000 trillion--of cubic feet of gas \nhydrates lie beneath the permafrost under the North Slope lands of \nAlaska. We have half the Nation's coastline. It holds some of the \nworld's greatest prospects for ocean and tidal energy. Two-thirds of \nthe Continental Shelf of the United States is off our State. In \naddition to that, we hope someday we will join the producers of \nethanol. Ethanol can be made from wood chips. Our State forests contain \nmillions of acres--millions of acres--of trees that are available for \nharvest, including particularly the Birch trees which I am told is a \ngood source of material for this type of fuel to make ethanol.\n  Alaskans are pioneers, but we are also realists. It will take decades \nbefore our Nation can fully commercialize alternative energy sources. \nSolving our country's energy crisis will require conservation. It will \nrequire development of alternative fuels, but it also requires domestic \nproduction of our domestic oil and gas resources. Those who advocate \nonly one or two of these approaches are misleading the American public. \nThere is an urgent need for us to develop our domestic resources now, \nand there is an urgent need for us to develop alternative fuels and to \nconserve. We must do all of that, Mr. President.\n  Federal action is required and State action is required immediately \nif we are to develop this gas pipeline. This gas pipeline project must \ngo forward, and authorization of the development of our resources in \nour Coastal Plain and the ANWR proposal is absolutely necessary. I urge \nthe Senate to join the House in authorizing the development which was \nauthorized by the Congress in 1980. For over 25 years we have had a \nmajority in the Senate which approves the development and exploration \nand development of oil and gas resources of the Arctic plain. It is \nonly a filibuster that has stopped us. America needs these resources to \nmeet the increased demand for our energy and to provide for relief from \nour continued increased dependence upon foreign sources for energy. I \nurge the Senate to join our colleagues in the House and authorize \ndevelopment of our Coastal Plain. I also urge my own State of Alaska to \nmove quickly to approve the application for the natural gas pipeline so \nit can move forward also.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a short time ago the Senate approved the \nnomination of GEN Michael Hayden to be the Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency. I think it was an appropriate confirmation by this \nbody, but I do think it is also appropriate to comment on the \nnomination of General Hayden.\n  Twenty months ago, I came to the Senate floor to oppose the \nnomination of Porter Goss for the same position, as Director of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency. At that time, I stated that the Director \nof Central Intelligence is a unique position. It should stand above \npolitics. The citizens of the United States have the right to assume \nthat the Director of Central Intelligence is providing objective \ninformation and analysis to allow the President to make the best \npossible decisions.\n  I didn't believe that a partisan choice was the proper choice then, \nand it seems in fact that was the case. Mr. Goss is an example of where \nthis administration believed that its political agenda was more \nimportant than the security of our country. The CIA was in turmoil \nthen, and it is in turmoil now. The Agency's assessments were \ndistrusted then and are still subject to skepticism now. Many more \nexperienced operatives have resigned. Mr. Goss, a political operative \nchosen by President Bush to lead the Central Intelligence Agency \nthrough a difficult period while engaged in a war, failed in this \nmission. So the administration is trying again.\n  This time, the President has chosen an intelligence veteran. General \nHayden has served our Nation for the past 37 years as a distinguished \nintelligence officer in the U.S. Air Force. He has most recently held \npositions as Director of the National Security Agency and the Principal \nDeputy Director of National Intelligence. General Hayden is well versed \nin intelligence matters, he is well known in the community, and I do \nnot believe he is a partisan political operative. There is evidence \nthat General Hayden has been and can be independent and objective. \nGeneral Hayden is a better choice, a much better choice, than Mr. Goss. \nHowever, I still have some concerns.\n  First, there has been much discussion about General Hayden's position \nin the military and his ability to be independent from the Defense \nDepartment in his assessments and in his operations. While the law has \nalways allowed a military officer to serve in this position, I believe \nthere is a valid reason for concern. The fiscal year 2007 national \nDefense authorization bill addresses this issue. It states that flag \nand general officers assigned to certain positions in the Office of the \nDirector of National Intelligence and the CIA shall not be subject to \nthe supervision or control of the Secretary of Defense or exercise any \nsupervision or control of military or civilian personnel in the \nDepartment of Defense, except as authorized by law. I believe this is \nan important provision and only one reason the Defense authorization \nbill should be considered as soon as possible, to get this position on \nthe books of law.\n  However, I also believe we have to go a step further. I think if a \nmilitary officer is chosen as the Director of National Intelligence or \nDirector of Central Intelligence, that position should be a terminal \nassignment. That position should be recognized by the officer and by \nother members in the Department of Defense and the administration as \nthe final assignment of that particular officer. I believe it best for \nour national security if an officer who takes one of these top \nintelligence positions is free from considerations about his future \nmilitary career--what\n\n[[Page S5324]]\n\nassignments he might be given, who he might be angering in the \nDepartment of Defense, who he might be pleasing within the Department \nof Defense, either consciously or subconsciously.\n  As I said earlier, intelligence should be above politics, and it also \nshould be above the politics within the Pentagon of assignments and of \nbudgets and of other considerations. A law stating that the position as \nDirector of Central Intelligence or National Intelligence is a final \nmilitary assignment would help clarify this position in detail. It is \nan issue I will raise again during the consideration of the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  General Hayden has agreed, in consultation with Senator Warner and \nalso in consultation with his family, that it is his intent to make \nthis his final military assignment. I have no doubt that he will do \nthat, but I believe it is important to formalize this provision in the \nlaw. That is why I will bring this to the attention of our colleagues \nwhen the Defense authorization bill comes to the floor.\n  There is another issue, of course, that is of concern. That issue is \nthe administration's terrorist surveillance program. General Hayden \nheaded the National Security Agency when the program was proposed and \nimplemented. From what we know today, that program conducted electronic \nsurveillance of international telephone calls and collected millions of \ndomestic phone records. Let me be clear. A vote in support of General \nHayden should not be construed as an endorsement of this \nadministration's surveillance program. Nor should concerns about the \nadministration's programs be viewed as an unwillingness to adopt \naggressive intelligence activities against those who truly threaten \nthis country. I believe we still do not know enough of the facts about \nthese programs. From what I do know, however, I have grave concerns.\n  A thorough investigation must be conducted and must be conducted in a \ntimely manner, but General Hayden was not the creator of the program, \nnor was he the one to provide the legal authority for the program. He \nstated he needed authority to implement such a surveillance program and \nthe administration provided him with the authority he felt was \nsufficient. On this issue, at this time I will give General Hayden the \nbenefit of the doubt.\n  I did support the nomination of General Hayden. I am certain he knows \nhe is taking a very difficult job at a very difficult moment.\n  Many other honorable men and women have joined this administration. \nThey have come to this administration with years of experience and \nexpertise, and they have found themselves in very difficult dilemmas, \nwhere their experience and their expertise was challenged by this \nadministration. Their objectivity, their sense of duty--not to a \nparticular President but to the country overall--has been seriously \nchallenged. In certain cases, the only remedy for these individuals is \nto resign rather than continue to support policies that they feel in \ntheir hearts and in their minds are not serving the best interests of \nthis country. General Hayden might come to such a decision point, and I \nhope, given his skill, his experience, and his dedication to duty, that \nhe would take the harder right than the easier wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/26/senate-section/article/S5324-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5324-S5325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATION UNDER THE NATIONAL SECURITY ACT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I voted against General Hayden for the \nposition of Director of Central Intelligence as a protest vote against \nthe administration's policy of not informing the Congress, with special \nemphasis on the Judiciary Committee, in a way which enables the \nCongress and the Judiciary Committee to do our constitutional job on \noversight. I have no quarrel with General Hayden. He is a man with an \noutstanding record. I have no objection to his retaining his military \nstatus. He has testified in a way, before the Intelligence Committee, \nwhich was candid. I would be especially pleased to support a fellow \nPennsylvanian. But in light of what the administration has done on the \nNSA program, which he has headed for many years, I feel constrained to \nvote ``no'' as a protest.\n  The administration has not complied with the National Security Act of \n1947, which requires notification of all members of the Intelligence \nCommittee. That was only done in the few days prior to the confirmation \nhearings on General Hayden. In fact, the administration for years \nnotified only the so-called Gang of 8, the majority and minority \nleaders of the House and Senate, and the chairmen, vice chairman, and \nranking members of the Intelligence Committees. Just because that had \nbeen the practice, it is not justification for violating the express \nlanguage of the National Security Act of 1947, which requires \nnotification of all members of the Intelligence Committees.\n  During the 104th Congress, I chaired the Intelligence Committee, and \nfor that period of time I was a member of the so-called Gang of 8. \nCandidly, I don't think the administration told the Gang of 8 very much \nabout what went on.\n  Be that as it may, admittedly the administration did not tell anybody \nbut the Gang of 8 about their electronic surveillance program until it \nwas disclosed by the New York Times on December 16 and the Judiciary \nCommittee brought in the Attorney General and had pressed on in a \nseries of hearings; then, belatedly, a subcommittee was formed in the \nIntelligence Committee and seven additional members were informed. \nThen, at first, the House resisted to having only part of their \nIntelligence Committee informed, but, finally, 11 Members of the House \nwere informed. Then, in the wake of the Hayden nomination, the \nadministration finally complied with the Act by informing all of the \nmembers of the Intelligence Committee--I think, plainly, so that they \ncould get General Hayden confirmed.\n  When the Judiciary Committee called in Attorney General Gonzales on \nFebruary 6, which was the first day we could do it after the mid-\nDecember disclosures and the hearings which we had scheduled on Justice \nAlito, it was an embarrassing performance. The Attorney General refused \nto say anything of substance about what the program was. We were ready \nto retire into a closed session, had that been productive, but it was a \nsituation where the Judiciary Committee was stonewalled, plain and \nsimple.\n  The Attorney General then wrote us a letter on February 28 seeking to \nclarify and explain what he had testified to before--and only more \nquestions were raised. We have still not resolved the issue as to \nwhether we will recall the Attorney General before the Judiciary \nCommittee, but there is a question as to its value and whether we can \nget anything from a repeat performance from Attorney General Gonzales. \nAs I say, that remains an open question.\n  In the interim, I have proposed legislation which would turn over the \nadministration's surveillance program to the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court. That court has a record of expertise. That court \nhas a record for not leaking and we could have it make the \ndetermination as to the constitutionality of the program.\n  We had a hearing where we brought in four ex-judges of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court who know its operations in great \ndetail. They made some suggestions which were incorporated into my \nproposed legislation, thereby improving it. They answered the questions \nabout the possibility of an advisory opinion and the issue of the case \nin controversy requirement.\n  I have since conferred with Senator Feinstein and Congresswoman Jane \nHarman, ranking member on Intelligence in the House, about working on \nlegislation. Both of those individuals have been privy to briefings by \nthe administration on the program. There was a suggestion that, with \nadditional resources and with some structural changes--for example, \nexpanding the 3-day period to 7 days--the FISA Court would be in a \nposition to pass, on an individual basis, the program. Whether that is \nso or not, I don't know, but that is a possibility.\n  When the disclosures were made about the telephone companies \nproviding substantial information to the administration and the NSA, \nthe Judiciary Committee scheduled a hearing. We had it set for June 6. \nYesterday, in an executive session, the issue was considered about \nsubpoenas, since two of\n\n[[Page S5325]]\n\nthe four telephone companies had requested subpoenas; the issue was \nalso raised as to a closed session.\n  There were objections raised by some members of the committee about \ncalling in the telephone companies. Suggestions were made by other \nmembers of the committee about calling in other members of the \nadministration.\n  Since we were in the middle of the debate on immigration, we held a \nvery brief meeting in cramped circumstances in the President's Room off \nthe Senate floor. It was decided to defer the hearing with the \ntelephone companies by 1 week to give the committee an opportunity on \nJune 6, the same date we had previously scheduled a hearing, to \nconsider these issues and decide them at greater length.\n  An interesting suggestion was made by one of the members of the \ncommittee--that in the past, when that member of the Judiciary \nCommittee was on the Intelligence Committee, he had called for a secret \nsession of the full Senate to discuss matters which had been disclosed \nto him in the Intelligence Committee which he was barred from saying \npublicly. That is an avenue which I am currently pursuing.\n  The stonewalling of the Congress--and particularly the Judiciary \nCommittee and precluding the Judiciary Committee from discharging our \nconstitutional duty of oversight--is particularly problemsome in light \nof a pattern of expanding executive authority.\n  A ranking member of the administration reportedly told a ranking \nmember of Congress that ``we don't have to tell you anything.'' We have \nscheduled a hearing on signing statements where the President has \nasserted his authority to pick and choose what he likes and what he \ndoesn't like in legislation which was passed by the Congress and signed \nby the President.\n  The Constitution gives the President the authority to veto but not to \ncherry pick.\n  We have the case of Judith Miller, the newspaper reporter put in jail \nfor 85 days during an investigation of a national security issue as to \nwhether the identity of the CIA agent had been disclosed, but there was \nalso an investigation as to whether there had been perjury or \nobstruction of justice during the national security investigation. \nPerjury and obstruction of justice are serious charges, but they do not \nrise to the level of a national security issue, which would be the \nthreshold for such action as jailing a reporter for 85 days.\n  We now have the situation where the Attorney General, on a Sunday \ntalk show last week, raised the possibility of prosecuting newspapers \nunder a World War I espionage statute.\n  We have the situation where the congressional quarters of Congressman \nJefferson were subject to a search and seizure warrant without prior \nnotification of the Speaker of the House of Representatives or someone \nin the House, with very serious questions raised there.\n  I am advised by one of the members of those informed on the \nadministration's surveillance program that, reportedly, the FBI now \nseeks to question Members of Congress about disclosures on the \nadministration's surveillance program.\n  These are all circumstances and situations which pose very \nsubstantial peril to the separation of powers, and Congress has not \nasserted its Article I powers and ought to do so.\n  I have talked to FBI Director Mueller and to the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral about the search and seizure on Congressman Jefferson. This is \na matter which ought to be inquired into--perhaps quietly--to see if a \nprotocol can be arrived at about what would be done if this situation \nwere to reoccur in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. SPECTER pertaining to the introduction of S. 852 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, for how long am I to be recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For as much time as the Senator consumes.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, thank you, and I thank my good friend from \nWest Virginia.

The person he is \ngoing to speak about was a great person, a person I very much admired, \nas I admire the Senator from West Virginia--a wonderful relationship, \nwonderful, wonderful.

Mr. President, I thank my dear friend, Senator Baucus, for \nhis kind remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/26/senate-section/article/S5325-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5325-S5326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SENATOR LLOYD BENTSEN\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I join my \ncolleagues in mourning the passing of a great man, an extraordinary \nstatesman, and a good friend: Senator Lloyd Bentsen.\n  Lloyd Bentsen was the noblest of Americans. Courtly, thoughtful, and \nsoft-spoken, Senator Bentsen embodied the finest traditions of America.\n  Lloyd Bentsen and I shared a perspective. It was based on the states \nthat we came from. I used to tease Senator Bentsen that Montana is what \nTexas would be like, if all the things that Texans say about Texas were \ntrue.\n  We shared an outlook born in the wide open spaces of our great Land. \nWe came from states that are larger than counties in Europe. You can go \ngreat distances in Montana or Texas without seeing another soul. And \nwith that comes a view that values our fellow man.\n  We also shared a view of this Senate. We could not have been more \ncompatible. We shared a goal, always to accomplish something good on \nbehalf of the American people.\n  We also shared a hallway on the 7th floor of the Hart Senate office \nbuilding. I had good fortune to get an office next door to Senator \nBentsen's. Our two teams were very closely woven together.\n  Very often I would wonder where in the world my staff was. They would \nbe down the hall talking to Bentsen's staff because they we are so \ncompatible and had such good ideas.\n  My staff would often go to his for sage advice, as I would go to him. \nWe would often walk over together for votes.\n  Senator Bentsen was a role model. He was smart, tough, and \ndisciplined. He was always focused. He always maintained his temper. \nAnd he always kept his integrity. He was a Senators' Senator.\n  Lloyd Bentsen was a singular person. He was reserved, even-tempered, \nand fair. He reserved judgment, learned the facts, and listened to all \npoints of view. And then he would take a strong position. And more \noften than not, that position would prevail.\n  Lloyd Bentsen had the strongest commitment to duty. Even after 14 \nhours of floor work, he would walk into a room for all-night budget \nnegotiations. He would not complain. He would say: ``This is what I \nsigned up for.''.\n  Lloyd Bentsen contributed greatly to this Country. He served bravely \nin the Air Force. He served 6 years in the House of Representatives. He \nserved 22 years in this Senate. He served 6 years as chairman of the \nFinance Committee. And he served 2 years as Secretary of the Treasury.\n  Lloyd Bentsen stood for responsibility, probity, and civility. He was \na champion of sound tax policy. He fought for and achieved some of the \nmost significant deficit reduction in our Nation's history. He played \nkey roles in the 1990 budget summit and President Clinton's 1993 \ndeficit reduction legislation.\n  And Senator Bentsen was a leader in international trade. We worked \nclosely together for more than a decade, early on, to develop a \nDemocratic position that supported free trade. We did so with an \naggressive policy that broke down international trade barriers to \nAmerican products. We worked closely on a series of initiatives, for at \nleast a decade.\n  Chairman Bentsen skillfully and successfully worked to win passage of \nthe 1988 Trade and Competitiveness Act. He guided the United States-\nCanada Free Trade Agreement through the Senate.\n\n[[Page S5326]]\n\nAnd in Texas, he is known as the father of the North American Free \nTrade Agreement.\n  Senator Bentsen ran against the first President Bush twice. Bentsen \nran against and beat Bush in the election for Senator from Texas, in \n1970. And later, Senator Bentsen ran with Governor Dukakis on the 1988 \nPresidential ticket.\n  But after that election, Chairman Bentsen was still for giving \nPresident Bush authority to negotiate trade agreements. He simply \nthought that it was the right thing for the country.\n  Senator Bentsen embodied the finest characteristics of public \nservice. Some might say that he embodied a different era of the United \nStates Senate. If that is so, then we are the poorer for having lost \nit. We are certainly the poorer for having lost him.\n  Our hearts go out to B.A., and the entire Bentsen family, on their \ngreat loss. Lloyd Bentsen was always very sweet and deferential to B.A. \nHe often said the B.A. stood for ``best asset.'' Lloyd and B.A. Bentsen \nwere married for 63 years.\n  Very often I would see the two of them together. It reminds me of the \nrelationship of Senator and Mrs. Byrd.\n  They were very close; teasing each other. It was a wonderful \nrelationship to behold. I have many memories of Lloyd and B.A. being \ntogether, whether flying on a plane to South America or here in the \nSenate, wherever.\n  My heart goes out to you B.A. and to your family.\n  Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote:\n\n     Were a star quenched on high,\n     For ages would its light,\n     Still travelling downward from the sky,\n     Shine on our mortal sight.\n\n     So when a great man dies,\n     For years beyond our ken,\n     The light he leaves behind him lies\n     Upon the paths of men.\n\n  Senator Lloyd Bentsen was a great man. And for years beyond our ken, \nthe light that Lloyd Bentsen leaves behind will lie upon the paths of \nmen, upon the paths of the United States, and upon the paths of this \nSenate.\n  I very much thank my friend from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMontana, Mr. Baucus, for that lovely thought to which he refers by the \ngreat poet Longfellow, in his alluding to our former fellow colleague, \nLloyd Bentsen.\n  I thank the Senator from Montana for speaking as he has about our \nlate former colleague, Lloyd Bentsen.\n  Lloyd and I served in the House together, too. We had a great \nadmiration for him there. I said, ``There is a young man going \nplaces''--and he went. He went places.\n\n  I join with my colleague, Senator Baucus, today in his message as \nwords of reverence for Lloyd Bentsen, and for B.A., Lloyd's lovely \nwife. I suppose she is in Texas today.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. She is.\n  Mr. BYRD. I want to associate myself, again, may I say, with my \ncolleague in every word he has chosen to speak about Lloyd Bentsen.\n  Mr. President, for how much time am I recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For as much time as the Senator wishes to \nconsume.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/26/senate-section/article/S5326-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5326-S5327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING OUR FALLEN HEROES\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I speak today in memory of our fallen \nheroes. Next Monday, the last Monday in May, the Nation honors the men \nand women who have given their lives in battle.\n  In the aftermath of the Civil War, the practice of decorating the \ngraves of those who died in battle was already an established custom in \nmany places, especially in the South, but it was a tribute to the \nhealing of the Nation that both sides were able to put aside their past \ndifferences to mourn the fallen together after that terrible conflict.\n  Although many communities lay claim to being the birthplace of \nMemorial Day, since World War I, when the holiday changed from honoring \njust those who died fighting in the Civil War to honoring those who \nwere lost in battle in any war--those Americans--Memorial Day belongs \nto us all.\n  Mr. President, death knows no divisions or political views. Death \nknows no distinctions between uniforms or battlegrounds. The Nation \nknew that all too well after the Civil War. Death unites the fallen--\ndeath unites the fallen--in God's care. And death heaps grief and loss \nin equal measure on all those left to mourn.\n  It is a lesson that some strident few today need to be reminded of, \nas they use military burials as a place of protest. No matter what \nviews one may hold about the current conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nor indeed of any conflicts anywhere, there is no place for intrusions \nduring these solemn rites, no cause worth offering further pain to the \nfamilies of the fallen.\n  The men and women in our military who don the uniform of the United \nStates are not, as someone has so inelegantly put it, ``the deciders.'' \nThey must, instead, put aside their personal views and focus on working \nseamlessly with the other members of their unit, so that the unit \nsurvives.\n  Every death is accompanied by stories of heroism, from the one who \nsacrificed his all to keep his fellow soldiers safe, to the heroes who \nbrought the fallen home. No protests can change, and none should mar, \nthose acts of bravery or those honored dead.\n  Memorial Day is a day to put aside our own schedules and to spend \nsome time remembering those who have risked all and lost all in service \nto the Nation. It is a day to recall and revere their bravery, their \nduty, their strength, and their humanity. It is a day of tribute to \nthem, and to their families, to whom the Nation owes so much.\n  The poet Joyce Kilmer, himself a sergeant with the ``Fighting 69th'' \nDivision, who lost his own life in 1918 during World War I, wrote a \npoem called ``Memorial Day.''\n\n     The bugle echoes shrill and sweet,\n     But not of war it sings to-day.\n     The road is rhythmic with the feet\n     Of men-at-arms who come to pray.\n\n     The roses blossom white and red\n     On tombs where weary soldiers lie;\n     Flags wave above the honored dead\n     And martial music cleaves the sky.\n\n     Above their wreath-strewn graves we kneel,\n     They kept the faith and fought the fight.\n     Through flying lead and crimson steel\n     They plunged for Freedom and the Right.\n\n     May we, their grateful children, learn\n     Their strength, who lie beneath this sod,\n     Who went through fire and death to earn\n     At last the accolade of [Almighty] God.\n\n     In shining rank on rank arrayed\n     They march, the legions of the Lord;\n     He is their Captain unafraid,\n     The Prince of Peace . . . Who brought a sword.\n\n  Mr. President, all too often these days, Memorial Day is just another \n3-day weekend, an opportunity to work on the yard a little bit, an \nopportunity to go shopping, or to host a backyard barbecue. Fewer and \nfewer Americans honor the men and women in uniform and their fallen \ncompatriots. Fewer, still, visit military cemeteries or actually \ndecorate graves in the old-fashioned way.\n  But for those who went to Arlington National Cemetery on Thursday, \nMay 25, I say you may have witnessed the beautiful scene known as \n``Flags-In.'' Just prior to each Memorial Day weekend, every available \nsoldier from the 3rd U.S. Infantry Division, the Old Guard, honors \ntheir fallen brethren by placing a small American flag before each of \nthe more than 220,000 gravestones and 7,300 niches at the cemetery's \ncolumbarium. An additional 13,500 flags are set in place at the \nSoldier's and Airman's Home National Cemetery, also in Washington, DC.\n  Flags are placed at the graves of each of the four individuals at the \nTomb of the Unknowns by the tomb sentinels. Then, in order to ensure \nthat each flag remains in place and standing proudly, the Old Guard \npatrols the cemetery throughout the weekend, watching over their fallen \ncomrades. It is a stirring sight to see that, truly, none of these \ngreat sacrifices are forgotten, and to witness how seriously these \nyoung soldiers take their duty.\n  There will be speeches on Memorial Day--formerly referred to as \nDecoration Day. And I have made many of those speeches in my long years \non Memorial Day. And on this coming Memorial Day, there will again be \nspeeches, and wreaths will be laid. A moment of silence will be \nobserved. For these few moments, our Nation both mourns and celebrates. \nPrivately, we mourn the loss of so many young men and women, fathers \nand mothers, sons and daughters, friends and relatives.\n\n[[Page S5327]]\n\n  Our hearts and our prayers go out to all the families who have lost a \nloved one in the Nation's service, and especially to those families who \nhave borne their tragedies so recently and whose tears are still so \nclose to the surface.\n  The Senate's thoughts and prayers are also with those whose family \nmembers have been wounded and who fight now for their lives.\n  As a nation, we celebrate and we honor the patriotism and the heroism \nthat have kept us free, kept us united, and kept us strong for these \npast two and a third centuries. It is on the shoulders of these brave \nlegions of the fallen and their comrades in uniform, past and present, \nthat our Nation is carried to greatness.\n  Technological and scientific progress is a source of pride and \nstrength, economic prosperity a boon, and our Constitution--thank God--\na blessing. But none of these gifts is sustainable without the will and \nthe resolve to defend them, to the death if necessary.\n  Those we honor on Memorial Day have gone that extra mile. They have \nworn the uniform with pride, and they have won and kept our freedom \nwith their effort and their sacrifice. They have fought together around \nthe globe, in the dark, in the mud, in the dust, on holidays, \nanniversaries, and weekends. Some have missed the births of their \nchildren. Some have missed growing old with their loved ones. They will \nenjoy no more 3-day weekends, no family vacations, no backyard \nbarbecues. But in our moment of silence, as the flags snap in front of \nthe rows upon rows of marble markers, let us think on all that they \nhave given for us, and be humbled.\n  Edgar Guest, a prolific poet of the first half of the last century, \nwrote many favorite poems of mine. His work was published in the \nnewspapers, for he worked for the Detroit Free Press. His poem, \nMemorial Day, suggests a fitting tribute to all those we honor on \nMemorial Day.\n  Let me read a few lines.\n\n     The finest tribute we can pay\n     unto our hero dead today,\n     is not a rose wreath, white and red,\n     in memory of the blood they shed;\n     it is to stand beside each mound,\n     each couch of consecrated ground,\n     and pledge ourselves as warriors true\n     unto the work they died to do.\n\n     Into god's valleys where they lie\n     at rest, beneath the open sky,\n     triumphant now o'er every foe,\n     as living tributes let us go.\n\n     No wreath of rose or immortelles\n     or spoken word or tolling bells\n     will do to-day, unless we give\n     our pledge that liberty shall live.\n\n     Our hearts must be the roses red\n     we place above our hero dead;\n     today beside their graves we must\n     renew allegiance to their trust;\n     must bare our heads and humbly say\n     we hold the flag as dear as they,\n     and stand, as once they stood, to die\n     to keep the stars and stripes on high.\n\n     The finest tribute we can pay\n     unto our hero dead today\n     is not of speech or roses red,\n     but living, throbbing hearts instead,\n     that shall renew the pledge they sealed\n     with death upon the battlefield:\n     that freedom's flag shall bear no stain\n     and free men wear no tyrant's chain.\n  Mr. President, I have another statement which I must give. I see the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, on the floor. I \nwill yield to him if he wishes.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator for his characteristic courtesy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/26/senate-section/article/S5327-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5327-S5328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MEMORIAL DAY, MAY 29, 1937\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Monday next is Memorial Day. Monday next, \nbeing May 29, my memory goes back to May 29, 1937. It was a Saturday. I \nwas working in the meat shop as a meat cutter at the Koppers Store in \nStotesbury, Raleigh County, WV. It was a coal mining community. I \nstarted working there in the gas station for Koppers Store for $50 a \nmonth. I walked 4 miles to work and 4 miles back home, unless I might \ncatch a bread truck or a milk truck.\n  But on that Saturday, May 29, 1937, at 5 o'clock p.m., my two senior \nmeat cutters at the Koppers Store in Stotesbury, WV, and I closed up \nthe meat department and went home. I put on my best suit--actually, my \nonly suit--and where did I go? I headed off to Sophia, 4 miles away, to \nthe house of the local hard-shell Baptist preacher U.G. Nichols. And \nthere I met with my high school sweetheart, Erma Ora James. May God \nbless her sweet memory. She was the beautiful daughter of a coal miner. \nThis was a coal miner who helped to teach me to play the old fiddle \ntunes long ago: ``Sally Goodin,'' ``Mississippi Sawyer,'' ``Arkansas \nTraveler,'' and ``She'll Be Comin Round the Mountain,'' and so on.\n  At 6 o'clock that evening, Preacher Nichols pronounced Erma--God \nbless her sweet name--and me ``husband and wife.'' That union, I am \nvery proud to say, endured for 68 years, 9 months, and 24 days. So on \nMay 29, 3 days from now, Erma and I would have celebrated our 69th \nwedding anniversary. That is something to brag about. Dizzy Dean said \nit was all right to brag, if you have done it, and Erma and I did it. \nErma didn't quite go all the way. But on May 29, Erma and I would have \ncelebrated our 69th wedding anniversary. That is something not heard \nabout very often these days, a 69th wedding anniversary.\n  The Scriptures tell us that ``whoso findeth a wife findeth a good \nthing and obtaineth favour of the Lord.'' Well, on that blessed day in \n1937--a long time ago--I certainly found a good thing. In looking back \non the life that Erma and I shared, I can say, in accordance with the \nscriptural passage, that I must have been favored by the Lord.\n  ``The joys of marriage are the heaven on earth,'' wrote the English \ndramatist, John Ford, five centuries ago. How right John Ford was. When \nI think of Erma, I still think of the beautiful line from a song that I \nused to hear and play, I believe, when I played the fiddle: ``She came \nlike an angel from the sky.'' For almost 69 years, this angel from the \nsky not only tolerated me, but she was the guiding light for me. She \nwas my teacher. She taught me how to drive an automobile. She was my \nbanker, my accountant.\n  Very early in our marriage, as a matter of fact, on Sunday, the day \nafter the Saturday evening on which Erma and I made our vows, I turned \nto her and said: ``Here is my wallet.'' I think I had saved up probably \n$300. I said: ``You keep it. When I need a dollar, I'll come to you and \nask for it.'' That is the way it was, and that is the way it has been \nthroughout our 69 years.\n  What a job she did from the meager paychecks, and they were meager. \nCan you imagine. I started at $50 a month, and by the time I married, I \nhad advanced. I was getting $70 a month when I married that sweetheart. \nShe bought from this meager paycheck the things that we needed, our \ngroceries. She paid the bills. She saved some money for a rainy day, \nand she gave me a monthly allowance.\n  Erma was my greatest critic, and she was my greatest supporter.\n  When I left the West Virginia Legislature to come to Congress, the \nother body, the House of Representatives, and this body, which also \nmakes up the Congress, I was carrying 22 credit hours at Marshall \nCollege, now Marshall University, but she, Erma, managed our little \ngrocery store. She took care of our two daughters, and she kept the \nhome fires burning.\n  When I was attending law school while serving in the U.S. Congress, \nshe would drive from our home at that time in Arlington, VA. She would \nmeet me on Capitol Hill here, around 5:30 p.m., and she would give me \nmy supper. She brought it to me in a paper bag. I would eat my supper \nwhile Erma drove me in our car to American University Law School for my \nclasses at 6 p.m. Then she would return later that evening, 8 o'clock \nor 9 o'clock, to pick me up and take me to our home in Arlington.\n  I also said, quite truly, that Erma had put three kids through \nschool: our two daughters and me. Erma was the mother of two most \nwonderful children, my daughters Mona Carole and Marjorie Ellen. \nMarjorie Ellen was here yesterday with me as we had lunch with some \nfriends in recognition--one might call it celebration, but I call it in \nrecognition--of our 69th wedding anniversary. These two daughters have \ngrown up to become outstanding women and mothers themselves. Marjorie \nwas here with me and with her husband, John Moore. Like me, those \ndaughters owe so much to the marvelous and wonderful woman they called \n``mother.''\n  Through the years, Erma was my constant companion. She was there with \nme, by my side, on the campaign trails. She was with me in 1958 when, \nas\n\n[[Page S5328]]\n\na Congressman, I made a tour of the economically depressed areas of the \nState and other parts of the country. She was with me in April 1969, in \nMexico City, Mexico, when I served as a delegate to the Mexico-United \nStates Interparliamentary Conference. She was with me on all my trips \nto Europe and Asia. She was always there. Erma was always there with me \nat my side.\n  She is with me today, I know. For nearly 69 years, that woman, the \ngreatest woman I ever met--I have met queens and great women of the \nworld--was with me. She was always with me. She is with me now, I know. \nFor nearly 69 years, she was my comfort in times of sorrow. She was \nstoic and brave. She never flinched in times of trouble.\n\n       We have lived and loved together through many changing \n     years; we have shared each other's gladness and wept each \n     other's tears; I have known ne're a sorrow that was long \n     unsoothed by Erma; for thy smiles can make a summer where \n     darkness else would be.\n\n  I quoted from the lines of Charles Jeffries, ``We Have Lived and \nLoved Together.''\n  This quiet, self-contained coal miner's daughter confronted \ndemonstrators and protesters in front of our home in Arlington. She \nspent many evenings alone when I had to stay late at the Capitol \nattending the Nation's business. She always was most comfortable with \nthe unassuming, down-to-earth West Virginia folks, back in the hills of \nWest Virginia, like those back in the hills of Kentucky from which my \nfriend, Senator Mitch McConnell, comes. She met with kings and shahs, \nprinces and princesses, Governors and Senators, Presidents. She \nentertained the high and the mighty, the powerful and the wealthy of \nthis Nation in a foreign land because it was important to her husband \nwho served as the majority leader of this Senate and various other \nSenatorial offices. She did it all with an innate, inherent \ngraciousness, incredible patience, and a soft, warm smile. She was a \nremarkable lady of great wisdom, but most of all, great gentleness, yet \nshe could be tough when she saw injustice or unfairness.\n  I was always so proud of her. In fact, the entire State of West \nVirginia took pride in Erma. That is why she was named West Virginia \nDaughter of the Year in 1990. Oh, could we call back the vanished \nyears. And she was named West Virginia Mother of the Year a few years \nlater.\n  Marriage is a sacred institution. It is more than the result of \nrepeating a few vows. Marriage is an oath, an oath before God. I have \nadmired the ancient Romans so much, as did Montesquieu, because they \nwould not break an oath. They would go to their death rather than break \nan oath. The ancient Romans. So marriage is an oath before God, a \nsacred and noble contract between a man and a woman. Read it in the \nBible.\n  It is a glorious commitment, a commitment of love, of caring, and of \nsacrifice. It is a commitment that Erma and I honored and enjoyed for \nalmost 69 years, through the bad times as well as the good, down the \nrough roads as well as the smooth ones. Our life's journey was not \nalways smooth and easy traveling. In fact, it was as bumpy at some \ntimes and as curvy as a West Virginia mountain road. But over the \nyears, Erma and I learned that the challenge of a marriage is the \nability to overcome imperfections, not just to ignore them. We always \nremembered our devotion to each other, despite our shortcomings and \ndespite the difficulties we encountered along life's way.\n  And when Erma and I married on that blessed Saturday evening nearly \n69 years ago, we were so proud and we were so poor that I could not \neven take a day off from work. We did not have the money for a \nhoneymoon, so after the wedding we went to a square dance, where I \nplayed the fiddle and she danced. On Monday morning, where was I? I was \nback at work in the grocery store in that coal-mining camp of \nStotesbury. I was back at the meat counter in a coal-mining camp of \nStotesbury. Although our fortunes did change, allowing us the \nopportunity to celebrate our anniversary in more special ways over the \nyears, my Erma, my Erma never changed. She never changed. From being \nthe wife of a meatcutter at the Koppers store in Stotesbury, WV, to \nbeing the wife of the majority leader of the U.S. Senate, Erma never \nstopped being herself. Her enduring patience and her steadfast support \nwere the stabilizing constants in our marriage.\n\n  Could I have made this journey without her? Could I have accomplished \nas much as I have accomplished--whatever that may have been--without \nher? I think not. The more important point is that I did it with Erma, \nand I would not have had it any other way. She was God's greatest gift \nto me.\n  I don't know what I ever did to deserve her, but somewhere along the \nline, I must have done something that was especially good. The good \nLord, the King, the Lord of Hosts, smiled down on me at 6 o'clock in \nthe evening on May 29, 1937.\n  So may I close with these few words that come from a poem, ``An Old \nSweetheart of Mine,'' by James Whitcomb Riley.\n\n     Is this her presence here with me,\n     Or but a vain creation of a lover's memory?\n     A fair, illusive vision that would vanish into air,\n     Dared I even touch the silence with the whisper of a prayer?\n     Nay, let me then believe in all the blended false and truth--\n     The semblance of the old love and the substance of the new,\n     The then of changeless sunny days--the now of shower and \n           shine,\n     But love forever smiling--as that old sweetheart of mine.\n\n  Mr. President, I simply say that I give thanks to Almighty God for a \nlong and good marriage and the richness which that hallowed institution \nhas given to my life because of one very extraordinary woman.\n  May God bless her and hold her to his bosom in Heaven until I come to \nbe with her--this extraordinary woman, the daughter of a coal miner, \nErma James Byrd.\n  Mr. President, these are a few lines which were the favorite lines of \nErma. The author's name is Isla Pascal Richardson. The lines are these:\n\n     If I should ever leave you,\n     Whom I love\n     To go along the silent way,\n     Grieve not,\n     Nor speak of me with tears.\n\n     But laugh and talk of me\n     As if I were there beside you.\n     For I will come--I'll come!\n     Would I not find a way?\n     Were tears and grief not be barriers?\n\n     And when you hear a song or see a bird I loved,\n     Please do not let your thoughts of me be sad.\n     For I am loving you just as I always have . . .\n     You were so good to me.\n\n     There are so many things I wanted still to do--\n     So many things to say to you . . .\n     Remember, that I did not fear death.\n     It was just leaving you that was so hard to face.\n\n       We cannot see beyond this life\n       But this you know . . . I loved you so\n  Never doubt that I am with you still!\n\n  Mr. President:\n\n     Love does not die with the body\n\n  And nothing in heaven or on earth\n  Can keep apart those who love one another.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask the Senate to pause for a moment\n\n[[Page S5329]]\n\ntoday in loving memory and honor of 1st Lt Robert Lewis Henderson II.\n  Lieutenant Henderson of Alvaton, KY, served with the 2123rd \nTransportation Company in the Kentucky Army National Guard, based in \nOwensboro, KY. On April 17, 2004, he gave his life in defense of our \ncountry in the city of Ad Diwaniyah, Iraq. He had served his Nation as \na citizen-soldier for 16 years--nearly half his life. Lieutenant \nHenderson was 33 years old.\n  On that day in April 2 years ago, as night approached, Lieutenant \nHenderson and three of his fellow soldiers were escorting a convoy of \nthe Army's 1st Armored Division.\n  Their mission was to transport the 1st Armored Division, with its \nessential M1A1 Abrams tanks and missile launchers, toward the fierce \nfighting in Al Najaf, where Coalition forces battled terrorists.\n  Staff Sergeant Michael Grimes, a fellow Kentuckian who was with \nLieutenant Henderson in the Humvee, recalls that Rob ``was proud to be \nin the Kentucky Guard and on the mission that day.''\n  Lieutenant Henderson and his team drove through an area of Ad \nDiwaniyah that our troops have come to call ``ambush alley.'' The \nforeboding nickname proved apt as Lieutenant Henderson's convoy, \ndriving up the street, came upon an overturned tractor trailer in an \nintersection.\n  Lieutenant Henderson, who was driving the lead Humvee, tried to go \naround the obstacle, but as the escort team slowed, terrorists ambushed \nthem.\n  Lieutenant Henderson sustained what proved to be a fatal gunshot in \nthe leg, but he still managed to drive his team to a strategic position \nwhere they could return fire and then warn the convoy of impending \ndanger. His final act was to protect his friends and fellow soldiers.\n  His actions ``probably saved hundreds of lives,'' said Kentucky \nNational Guard Adjutant GEN Donald Storm.\n  For his valorous service, Lieutenant Henderson was awarded the Bronze \nStar Medal and the Purple Heart. And he was awarded the Kentucky \nDistinguished Service Medal, for demonstrating all the qualities of a \ngreat soldier, remaining combat-focused while decisively engaged with \nthe enemy, performing his duties, and accomplishing his mission.\n  Rob enlisted in the Kentucky National Guard in 1988, when he was just \n17 years old, as a student at Warren Central High School in Bowling \nGreen, KY. His mother, Lillian Henderson, recalls when he told her, \n``If you don't sign for me at 17, I'll sign for myself at 18.''\n  Surely Rob knew the honor and the sacrifice that came with serving \none's country. Rob's father, Robert ``Lou'' Henderson, served in the \nArmy during the Korean War. Lou passed away after a struggle with \ncancer in 1994, but his son continued the family legacy.\n  After 8 years as an enlisted soldier, Rob felt he still had more to \ngive. In 1997, he went to Officer Candidate School at Fort Eustis, VA. \nBy 1998, he had made first lieutenant.\n  Lieutenant Henderson deployed to Kuwait in January 2004. Rob and his \nunit were charged with transporting convoys of heavy armored units \nwhich traveled from Kuwait to the front lines in Iraq.\n  As platoon leader, Rob was tasked with overseeing the complicated \nlogistics of these missions. From scheduling maintenance on the heavy \ntrucks to securing fuel, Rob's duties encompassed ``most everything,'' \nrecalled his friend SGT Doug Pollard, who also served in the Kentucky \nGuard.\n  Sergeant Pollard, who met Rob when Rob first enlisted, said that \n``from day one, Rob was about nothing less than hard work and taking \ncare of other soldiers.''\n  Lieutenant Henderson ``led from the front,'' a popular Army \nexpression for officers who lead by example on the front lines. \nSergeant Grimes said, ``Rob would never ask a man to do anything that \nhe wouldn't have done himself.''\n  1SG Michael Oliver, also of the Kentucky Guard, agreed. ``Normally, \nas an officer you sit back, supervise and direct,'' he said. \n``Lieutenant Henderson loved . . . to get right in there.''\n  Rob's passion for life shone through in his civilian duties as well. \nHe worked as a sales manager at a Lowe's hardware store in Bowling \nGreen. He had worked at several Lowe's stores throughout Kentucky, \nbeing promoted with each new post.\n  Working as much as 60-plus hours a week, Rob fulfilled his Guard \ntraining on the weekends, with the same commitment he showed in all \naspects of life. While working at Lowe's, Rob also met Lisa, the love \nof his life. They married in January 2003.\n  Raised in Rockfield, a small Warren County town outside Bowling \nGreen, Rob Henderson grew up playing football and baseball and cheering \nfor the University of Notre Dame. He also had a fascination with \ntrucks.\n  Rob worked hard on his home--especially the outside. Lisa Henderson \nrecalls her husband's attention to detail, saying, ``he was obsessed \nwith mowing the grass, and just insisted that our yard look better than \nany of our neighbors.'' Often seen in jeans and work boots, he loved \nplaying with his and Lisa's two dogs.\n  Rob was excitedly awaiting the birth of his and Lisa's first child. \nLisa recalls hearing the excitement in Rob's voice when she called to \ntell him they would be having a baby. Rob was training with his platoon \nin Greenville, KY, and he was so thrilled that he raced off the phone \nto go tell his whole unit.\n  Peyton Joshua Henderson was born in July 2004, 3 months after a \nmemorial service was held for Lieutenant Henderson in a small chapel \nerected at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait.\n  More than 150 of Lieutenant Henderson's fellow soldiers gathered \ninside. Dozens more clustered outside the entrance, all to pay their \nrespects to their fallen leader, brother soldier, and friend. .\n  We thank Rob's wife Lisa for sharing her stories of Rob with us. She \nand young Peyton join us in the Capitol today. We are also honored that \nRob's mother, Lillian Henderson, has shared her memories of her son. \nAnd today we are thinking of Rob's sister, Jackie Hawkins, and his \nhalf-sister, Monica Walker, as well.\n  Mr. President, I cannot help but feel humbled when I think of \nLieutenant Henderson's final selfless act. A good soldier to the end, \nhe put his men first. It is easy to see his heroism now, but when I \nlook back at the brave 17-year-old who stepped forward to honor his \nfather and his country, I can see the heroism was already there.\n  This Nation can never repay our heroes or their families, but we will \nnever forget them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/26/senate-section/article/S5329-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5329-S5330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FORMATION OF A NEW IRAQI GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last evening, during his press conference \nwith Prime Minister Blair relative to Iraq, President Bush stated:\n\n       The formation of a new government represents a new \n     beginning for Iraq and a new beginning for the relationship \n     between Iraq and our coalition.\n\n  I hope that is not overly optimistic, but, frankly, I am afraid that \nit is because of the incompleteness of the Iraqi Government. Its two \nmost important positions--the Minister of Defense and the Minister of \nthe Interior--have not been filled. These are critical positions \nbecause numerous police and army units have been dominated by militia \nmembers who are loyal to sectarian or political leaders and not to the \ncentral Government, and because many militia members outside the police \nand the army are engaged in a rampage against innocent civilians.\n  While there have been disagreements on a number of issues related to \nIraq, almost everyone has agreed that the new Iraqi Government would \nhave to be a government of national unity with specific emphasis on \nindependent nonsectarian choices for the positions of Minister of \nDefense and Minister of the Interior if there was to be a chance of \nquelling the sectarian violence and defeating the insurgency.\n  Our senior military leaders have been telling us for years that there \nis no military solution to the violence in Iraq and no way to defeat \nthe insurgency without a political solution among the Iraqis \nthemselves.\n  The Government that was announced last weekend and approved by the \nIraqi Council of Representatives does not represent a political \nsolution because it did not include the two most important ministries: \nthe Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Interior.\n\n[[Page S5330]]\n\n  The plain truth is that the various Iraqi political actors were not \nwilling to make the compromises necessary to bring about a government \nof national unity within the time allotted by the Iraqi Constitution. \nAnd they still haven't. We hope they will at any time, but they still \nhaven't.\n  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, appearing on FOX News last \nSunday, minimized the lack of selections for these two positions when \nshe said:\n\n       People are dramatizing the fact that they didn't get \n     certain posts that they hoped to get.\n\n  She went on to say:\n\n        . . . let's give them three days or four days, or five or \n     six days, to come up with the best possible interior \n     ministry. You know, the five days that they will take to vet \n     people more thoroughly, to make sure they have the right \n     person, will be well worth it.\n\n  On ``Meet the Press'' that afternoon, Secretary Rice even spoke of \nthat failure as a plus, a positive, saying:\n\n        . . . I think it actually shows some maturity that they \n     were able to go ahead with the formation of the government so \n     that they can start working, but that they can take a little \n     bit longer.\n\n  How is that a sign of maturity? In my view, both the mature and the \nnecessary thing under the constitution of Iraq was for the Iraqi \npolitical leaders to make the compromises necessary to form the entire \nGovernment, including, in particular, the Minister of Defense and the \nMinister of the Interior, the two most important ministries.\n  It was also disappointing that neither President Bush nor our \nSecretary of State mentioned anything about the need to amend the Iraqi \nConstitution. General Casey noted in testimony before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee:\n\n       We've looked for the constitution to be a national compact, \n     and the perception now is that it's not, particularly among \n     the Sunni.\n\n  The Iraqi Constitution itself provides for the appointment of a \ncommittee to propose amendments to their constitution. That committee \nhas 4 months to complete its work and to recommend amendments to the \nconstitution to the full Parliament.\n  For a long time, I have been calling for President Bush and officials \nof his administration to put pressure on the Iraqis, to meet the \ntimetables they have set in their own constitution to form a unity \ngovernment and to make the changes in the constitution that would make \nit a unifying document. I have called for that pressure to be in the \nform of conditioning our continued presence in Iraq on Iraqis meeting \ntheir self-imposed deadlines.\n  The President told me in the presence of several Members of the \nCongress and in the presence of his own security team that position is \nactually helpful. For us to tell the Iraqis that our continued presence \ndepends upon their doing what only they can do, which is to meet their \nself-imposed deadlines for a full government to be appointed and for \nthem to amend their constitution to make it a unifying document.\n  These are critically important matters. There needs to be a \ngovernment of national unity. We can't save Iraqis from themselves. We \ncan't form a government of national unity. We can't amend their \nconstitution. If they want a nation, it is up to them to get on with it \naccording to their own constitutional deadlines.\n  It is not going to happen if we just tell the Iraqis we are there as \nlong as they need us. That is an open-ended commitment which cannot \nstand because the American people will not stand for it and should not \nstand for it.\n  I hope the President and the Secretary of State and the U.S. \nAmbassador are saying privately what they haven't yet said publicly: \nthat it is up to the Iraqis to determine their fate and to pull \ntogether a national unity government because that is the only hope they \nhave of defeating the insurgency and avoiding civil war.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/26/senate-section/article/S5330-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE ENRON CONVICTIONS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, 5 years ago, the Enron Corporation, the \nseventh largest publicly traded corporation in America with a $100 \nbillion in annual revenue, collapsed. Its sudden plunge into bankruptcy \ndestroyed the savings of thousands, eliminated the jobs of tens of \nthousands more, and, more fundamentally, damaged Americans' faith in \nU.S. capital markets. In the years following, the extent of Enron's \nmisconduct became clear--the dishonest accounting, nonpayment of taxes, \nexcessive executive compensation, collusion with banks and brokers, the \nlies to the investing public and their own employees.\n  Many Enron executives have since pleaded guilty and accepted \nresponsibility for their role in the Enron disaster. Enron's two most \nsenior executives, however, did not. They spent the last 5 years \ndenying responsibility and fighting all efforts to hold them \naccountable. But yesterday, a jury found Ken Lay and Jeffrey Skilling \nguilty of 25 counts of securities fraud, wire fraud, false statements, \nand other misconduct. The jury held both men accountable for Enron's \nmisdeeds.\n  Some want to portray those convictions as the end of an era of \ncorporate corruption. They are already urging Congress to weaken the \nSarbanes-Oxley Act, the law enacted to prevent future Enron \ncatastrophes. For example, they want to exempt 80 percent the publicly \ntraded companies from rules requiring internal controls to ensure that \ntheir books accurately reflect their finances. They want to weaken or \neliminate the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board that now \npolices the accounting industry. They want to weaken other corporate \nreforms as well, from rules requiring oversight of hedge funds to rules \nrequiring mutual funds to have independent directors.\n  But corporate corruption is not over. Just this year, AIG, one of the \ncountry's largest financial firms, agreed to pay $1.6 billion to settte \nState and Federal allegations of securities fraud and bid-rigging. \nFannie Mae, an American symbol of financial success and affordable \nhousing, paid $400 million to settle allegations of accounting fraud. \nIn April, the former chief executive of Computer Associates, a leading \nhigh tech company, pled guilty to securities fraud and obstruction of \njustice. Another 20 publicly traded corporations are currently under \ninvestigation for playing games with the timing of stock option grants \nto maximize the profits that their top executives could pocket. The \nlist, unfortunately, goes on.\n  The message that should be taken from the Enron convictions is not \nthat corporate oversight is too tough, but that corporate executives \nmust and can be held accountable when they misuse funds, abuse their \npositions, and mislead the investing public.\n  I am told that some corporations are waiting for my good friend, Paul \nSarbanes to leave the Senate before attacking the law that he \nchampioned. They want him out of the way first. But my friend fought \ntoo hard and too long for the corporate reforms embodied in Sarbanes-\nOxley to be tossed aside or watered down. This country cannot afford \nmore Enrons, and I, for one, believe the Senate cannot and will not \nturn back the clock on corporate oversight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/26/senate-section/article/S5330-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5330-S5331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SENATOR ROBERT BYRD AND ERMA BYRD\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, next week, on June 2, Ms. Nancy Jean Price \nwill retire from my office having served the people of South Carolina \nfor over 30 years as a congressional constituent liaison. I rise today \nto recognize the outstanding service and dedication she demonstrated \nthroughout her extensive and distinguished career.\n  A native South Carolinian, Jean is the daughter of Mr. Joe B. and \nMrs. Trula W. Price. She graduated from Lander University in Greenwood \nand began her career as a congressional staffer in the office in the \nofficer of former U.S. Representative Butler Derrick, who represented \nSouth Carolina's Third Congressional District from 1974 to 1994. Jean \nwore many hats for Congressman Derrick in his Anderson, SC, district \noffice. Whether working as a constituent liaison, a special events \ncoordinator, a caseworker, or even as a manager, Jean went above and \nbeyond what was required to address any task or challenge she \nconfronted.\n  Following Congressman Derrick's retirement in 1994, I was elected to \nCongress and was fortunate Jean accepted a constituent services \nposition in my Aiken office. After my election to the Senate in 2002, I \npromoted Jean to low-country regional director, and she helped \nestablish our office in Mt. Pleasant.\n  In the 12 years Jean has worked on my staff, she has consistently and \nselflessly served constituents, answered questions, and solved \ncountless problems. In doing so, Jean has garnered the personal and \nprofessional respect and admiration of her friends and colleagues. She \nis an upstanding member of society. She represents the very finest in \nChristian values dedicating much of her free time to church and \ncommunity work in various leadership and service positions. But above \nall, Jean has been dedicated to her family.\n  While well deserved, Jean's retirement is a great loss for me and the \nState of South Carolina. Her service heart will serve as the gold \nstandard for all staff that follow behind her. I will miss Jean, but I \nwish her a prosperous retirement and great success and happiness in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/26/senate-section/article/S5331-6", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5331-S5332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE PATRIOT LOAN ACT OF 2006\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to comment on legislation introduced \nyesterday, S. 3122, the Patriot Loan Act of 2006. It is called the \nPatriot Loan Act for that is who the legislation is intended to \nbenefit, patriot citizen-soldiers who are called from their employment \nat America's small businesses to serve our country in uniform. I am \nproud to join with Senator Olympia Snowe, who serves as the chair of \nthe Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, as an \noriginal cosponsor of this important bill.\n  All of us in the Senate come from States affected by the mobilization \nof our Guard and Reserve personnel. In my home State, the Idaho \nNational Guard's 116th Brigade Combat Team turned last fall from its \n18-month deployment to Iraq. I visited members of the 116th while they \nwere in Iraq and discovered that a good number of them\n\n[[Page S5332]]\n\nleft jobs at small businesses across Idaho. I also held a hearing in \nIdaho last August regarding the reemployment rights of returning Guard \nand Reserve members, with particular focus on how those rights would \nimpact members of the 116th. At that hearing it was emphasized that, \nwhile legal rights to reemployment are critical, they do little good \nfor those who have no employer, or no small business, to return to. I \nresolved then to find some way to assist small businesses to cope with \nthe financial hardships of frequent and lengthy mobilizations of its \nemployees or owners during the war on terrorism. I believe S. 3122 will \nprovide some of that needed assistance.\n  The legislation would enhance the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration's Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan, or \n``MREIDL,'' Program. That program provides loan assistance to small \nbusinesses to help them meet ordinary and necessary operating expenses \nafter essential employees are called to active duty in their roles as \ncitizen soldiers.\n  S. 3122 would raise the maximum military reservist loan amount from \n$1.5 million to $2 million. It would also allow the Small Business \nAdministration's administrator, by direct loan or through banks, to \noffer unsecure loans of up to $25,000, an increase from the current \n$5,000 loan limit: So that there are no processing delays, S. 3122 \nwould require the SBA administrator to give these loan applications \npriority, and would require that loan applicants be adequately assisted \nduring the application process by utilizing existing support networks, \nsuch as Small Business Development Centers.\n  Finally, S. 3122 would ensure proactive outreach about the MREIDL \nProgram for Guard and Reserve members by requiring SBA and the \nDepartment of Defense to develop a joint Web site and printed materials \nwith information about the program, and it would require a joint SBA \nand DD feasibility study on other methods of possible assistance.\n  Just as the Guard and Reserve are serving us now, we must do what we \ncan to ensure that their sacrifices do not place them in financial \nharm's way on their return home. I strongly urge my colleagues to \nsupport this measure, and I, again, thank Senator Snowe for her \nleadership in introducing it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/26/senate-section/article/S5332-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5332-S5333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CATASTROPHE INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, yesterday, I introduced four \nbills, 3114, 3115, 3116, and 3117 that are aimed at providing a \ncomprehensive solution to strengthen our Nation's property and casualty \ninsurance market. Without serious reform, the Federal Government will \nbe forced to continue to spend billions of dollars of taxpayer money to \ncover the costs of natural disasters in the United States. Worse, \nwithout Federal action, property insurance soon will become more \nexpensive and harder to find, preventing some consumers from insuring \ntheir homes and businesses.\n  As we know too well, the last few years have brought a devastating \ncycle of natural catastrophes in the United States. In 2004 and 2005, \nwe witnessed a series of powerful hurricanes that caused unthinkable \nhuman tragedy and property loss. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita alone \ncaused over $200 billion in total economic losses, including insured \nand uninsured losses.\n  Recently in my own home State of Florida, eight catastrophic storms \nin 15 months caused more than $31 billion in insured damages. Now \nFlorida is witnessing skyrocketing insurance rates, insurance companies \nare canceling hundreds of thousands of policies, and Florida's State \ncatastrophe fund is depleted.\n  In short, the inability of our private markets to fully handle the \nfallout from natural disasters has made our Nation's property and \ncasualty insurance marketplace unstable. This market instability \nrepeatedly has forced the Federal Government to absorb billions of \ndollars in uninsured losses. This is a waste of taxpayer money, \nespecially when we know there are ways to design the system to \nanticipate and plan for the financial impacts of catastrophes.\n  As insurance companies struggle to maintain their businesses, costs \nare passed on to homeowners and small businesses in Florida and in \nother States. In essence, the people who can least afford it are being \nforced to bear the disproportionate share of the billions of dollars of \nlosses caused by natural catastrophes.\n  Many Floridians have seen their insurance bills double in the last \nfew years. As I travel around Florida, I hear repeatedly from my \nconstituents that they may soon be unable to afford property and \ncasualty insurance. That is a frightening proposition for people living \nin a State where increasingly vicious hurricane seasons are predicted. \nI am sure we all agree--consumers never should be put in the untenable \nposition of having to choose between purchasing insurance and \npurchasing other necessities.\n  While our Nation's property and casualty insurance system is not yet \ncompletely broken, it is clear that Congress needs to act now to shore \nup the system. Private sector insurance is currently available to \nspread some catastrophe-related losses throughout the Nation and \ninternationally, but most experts believe that there will be \nsignificant insurance and reinsurance shortages. These shortages could \nresult in future dramatic rate increases for consumers and businesses \nand the unavailability of catastrophe insurance.\n\n  Let me be clear: these issues will not just affect Florida or the \ncoastal States. Natural catastrophes can strike anywhere in our \ncountry. For example, a major earthquake fault line runs through \nseveral of our Midwestern States. We also saw firsthand the devastating \neffects of a volcano eruption at Mount St. Helens in Washington State.\n  In the past few decades, major disasters have been declared in almost \nevery State. As I mentioned earlier, the Federal Government has \nprovided and will continue to provide billions of dollars and resources \nto pay for these catastrophic losses, at huge costs to all American \ntaxpayers.\n  Congress has struggled with these issues for decades. Although we \nhave talked about these issues time and again, nothing much has gotten \naccomplished. The most notable step Congress did take was to create the \nNational Flood Insurance Program. But Congress needs to do much more. \nIt is time for a comprehensive approach to solving our Nation's \nproperty and casualty insurance issues.\n  These matters are usually within the purview of the States, and I \ncannot undersate the importance of State-based solutions to these \ninsurance issues. Nonetheless, the Federal Government also has a \ncritical interest in ensuring appropriate and fiscally responsible risk \nmanagement of catastrophes.\n  For example, mortgages require reliable property insurance, and the \nunavailability of reliable property insurance would make most real \nestate transactions impossible. Moreover, the public health, safety, \nand welfare demand that structures damaged or destroyed in catastrophes \nbe reconstructed as soon as possible.\n  Therefore, the inability of the private sector insurance and \nreinsurance markets to maintain sufficient capacity to enable Americans \nto obtain property insurance coverage in the private sector endangers \nthe national economy and our public health, safety, and welfare.\n  In order to help protect consumers and small businesses, today I am \nintroducing four bills as part of a comprehensive approach to fixing \nour troubled insurance system. Let me summarize each of the four bills \nand tell you how this integrated approach makes good policy sense.\n  The first piece of legislation I am introducing today is the \nHomeowners Protection Act of 2006, S3117. This bill is a companion bill \nto a bipartisan piece of legislation introduced by Florida \nRepresentatives Brown-Waite, Hastings, and others.\n  This bill would establish a fund within the U.S. Department of \nTreasury, which would sell Federal catastrophe insurance to State \ncatastrophe funds, like the fund I helped to set up in Florida. State \ncatastrophe funds essentially act as reinsurance mechanisms for \ninsurance companies who lack resources to compensate homeowners for \ntheir losses.\n  Under this bill, State catastrophe funds would be eligible to \npurchase reinsurance from the Federal fund at sound rates. However, a \nState catastrophe fund would be prohibited from\n\n[[Page S5333]]\n\ngaining access to the Federal fund until private insurance companies \nand the State catastrophe fund met their financial obligations.\n  Why is this good for homeowners? Because this backup mechanism will \nimprove the solvency and capacity of homeowners insurance markets, \nwhich will reduce the chance that consumers will lose their insurance \ncoverage or be hit by huge premium increases.\n  Importantly, the Homeowners Insurance Protection Act of 2006 also \nrecognizes that part of the problem with our broken property and \ncasualty insurance system lies with outdated building codes and \nmitigation techniques. Noted insurance experts and consumer groups have \nbeen pointing out this problem for many years. So, under the bill, the \nSecretary of the Treasury would establish an expert commission to \nassist States in developing mitigation, prevention, recovery, and \nrebuilding programs that would reduce the types of enormous damage we \nhave seen caused by recent hurricanes.\n  I note that this bill covers not just hurricanes, but catastrophes \nsuch as earthquakes, cyclones, tornados, catastrophic winter storms, \nand volcanic eruptions. These are disasters that can--and do--occur in \nmany different States. Again, every State and every taxpayer is \naffected by this problem, not just Florida.\n  This bill has widespread support from a broad range of stakeholders, \nincluding ProtectingAmerica.org, a national coalition of first \nresponders, businesses, and emergency managers. This organization is \ncochaired by former FEMA Director James Lee Witt, one of the most \nrespected names in disaster prevention and preparedness.\n  The second bill I am introducing today is the Catastrophe Savings \nAccounts Act of 2006, S. 3115. The companion bill was introduced in the \nHouse of Representatives by a bipartisan group of Members including Tom \nFeeney and Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\n  This bill proposes changing the Federal Tax Code to allow homeowners \nto put money aside--on a tax-free basis--to grow over time. If and when \na catastrophe hits, a homeowner could take the accumulated savings out \nof the account to cover uninsured losses, deductible expenses, and \nbuilding upgrades to mitigate damage that could be caused in future \ndisasters. Homeowners could even reduce their insurance premiums \nbecause their tax-free savings would allow them to choose higher \ndeductibles.\n  The benefits of this approach are pretty straightforward and very \nconsumer friendly. Homeowners would be encouraged to plan in advance \nfor future disasters, and they wouldn't be taxed to do it. Moreover, \nhomeowners wouldn't be as dependent on insurance companies to help them \nout immediately after a disaster. As one expert has noted, why should a \nconsumer continue to give insurance companies thousands of dollars each \nyear when the consumer could deposit the same amount of money annually \nin a tax-free, interest-bearing savings account controlled by the \nconsumer?\n  The third bill I am introducing today is the Policyholder Disaster \nProtection Act of 2006, S. 3116. This bill was introduced in the House \nof Representatives by Mark Foley and has eight cosponsors.\n  Under this bill, insurance companies would be permitted to accumulate \ntax-deferred catastrophic reserves, much the way that homeowners would \nbe permitted under the bill I just discussed. Depending on their size, \ninsurance companies could save up to a certain capped amount, which \nwould grow over time.\n  Our current Federal Tax Code actually provides a disincentive for \ninsurance companies to accumulate reserve funds for catastrophes. Under \nthe current system, insurance companies can only reserve against losses \nthat already have occurred, instead of future losses. The United States \nis the only industrialized nation that actually taxes reserves in this \nway. It is time for reform, so that consumers are better protected.\n  Make no mistake though--this bill is not a giveaway to the insurance \ncompanies. Instead, the Policy Disaster Protection Act of 2006 would \nstrictly regulate when and how insurance companies could access their \nreserves, to make sure the money is used only for its intended \npurposes.\n  If implemented correctly, this bill could result in approximately $15 \nbillion worth of reserves being saved up by insurance companies, which \nlater could be spent to pay for policyholder claims and to keep \ninsurance policies available and affordable. Consumers could feel more \nprotected knowing that their insurance company would have the money \nsaved to help them out after a major disaster. Moreover, this approach \nshould help make the insurance market more stable and less prone to \ninsurers going bankrupt.\n  Finally, the fourth bill, S. 3114, that I am introducing as part of \nmy comprehensive reform package is the Commission on Catastrophic \nDisaster Risk and Insurance Act of 2006.\n  Under this bill, Congress would create a Federal commission--made up \nof a cross-section of the best experts in the Nation--to quickly \nrecommend to Congress the best approach to addressing catastrophic risk \ninsurance. The experts on the commission would be required to analyze \nthe three bills that I am introducing today, along with other potential \napproaches to reforming our insurance system.\n  Creating a Federal commission is not always the best answer, \nespecially if it can slow down reform efforts. But in this case, the \nopposite would occur. I say that with cofidence--because I am following \na successful model that I used when I was insurance commissioner for \nthe State of Florida in the 1990s. After Hurricane Andrew devastated \nSouth Florida in 1992, I created a nonpartisan commission comprised of \nuniversity presidents.\n  I asked the Florida commission to study the problems with the \nproperty and casualty insurance market and recommend what legislative \nreforms were necessary to restore health to Florida's system. Within \nmonths, the commission acted--breaking through the deep political \nlogjam and inertia--to recommend the legislative reforms that \nultimately became State law.\n  That model worked then, and I think it can work now on a Federal \nlevel. Without the work of an expert, neutral commission to help guide \nus in these incredibly complex matters, I fear that Congress will never \nfind the consensus necessary to reform the system and bring stability.\n  Let me emphasize again what we need to accomplish to reform our \ncurrent insurance system and to effectively plan for catastrophic \nlosses.\n  We need a comprehensive approach that will make sure the United \nStates is truly prepared for the financial fallout from natural \ndisasters. We need a property and casualty insurance system that is not \nforced to spend valuable taxpayer dollars after a catastrophe strikes. \nWe need a system that protects consumers and small businesses from \nlosing their insurance policies or being forced to pay exorbitant \ninsurance rates. We need ways to encourage responsible construction and \nmitigation techniques. And we need a system that helps insurance \ncompanies use their resources in cost-effective ways so that they will \nnot go insolvent after major disasters.\n  Our American economy depends on a healthy property and casualty \ninsurance system. By enacting meaningful reforms, we can ensure that \nour economy remains protected and remains the most resilient economy in \nthe world. I know this complicated process won't be easy for us--but \nlet's roll up our shirtsleeves and get it done.\n  I request that the four bills I discussed--S. 3114, S. 3115, S. 3116, \nand S. 3117--be printed in the Congressional Record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/26/senate-section/article/S5333-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5333-S5335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PASSAGE OF S. 2611\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this was a truly historic week for the \nSenate. With passage of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of \n2006, S. 2611, we have succeeded in maintaining several key components \nof the bill that passed out of the Judiciary Committee 2 months ago--\ncomponents that I believe are crucial to fixing our broken immigration \nsystem.\n  For starters, supporters of comprehensive reform in the Senate banded \ntogether to defeat efforts to remove or further weaken provisions in \nthis bill that will allow the estimated 11 million to 12 million \nundocumented immigrants currently living in the United States to earn \nlegal status. As both the\n\n[[Page S5334]]\n\nPresident and the Secretary of Homeland Security have said, mass \ndeportation is not a realistic option. Neither is amnesty. This \nlegislation would require those who are here illegally to come forward, \npay hefty fines, pay taxes, learn English and civics, work, and wait in \nthe back of the line--before earning the privilege of permanent \nresident status and ultimately a path to citizenship if they choose to \npursue it. These core provisions remain in the bill, and that is \ncritical.\n  However, I am disappointed in the changes to the legalization process \nthat were made as part of the Hagel-Martinez compromise when the bill \nwas first taken up on the Senate floor in April. The compromise would \ntreat differently those people who have been here for more than 5 years \nand those who entered the country illegally in the last 2 to 5 years. \nThis approach is overly complicated and difficult to administer, and it \nis unfair to treat these two categories of people differently. During \nfloor consideration, I voted to remove these arbitrary distinctions \nfrom the bill. Unfortunately, that vote failed, and I believe we must \naccept this compromise as the only way to move forward with \ncomprehensive immigration reform this year.\n  I am pleased that efforts to gut the guest worker program were not \nsuccessful and that the Senate added additional measures to strengthen \nlabor protections for U.S. workers. We need a guest worker program that \nallows employers to turn to foreign labor as a last resort when they \ngenuinely cannot find American workers to do the job. But it is \nimportant that any guest worker program contain strong labor \nprotections, as the program outlined in the legislation does. These \nprotections will help ensure that the program does not adversely affect \nwages and working conditions for U.S. workers, and that we do not \ncreate a second-class of workers, who are subject to lower wages and \nfewer workplace protections. Furthermore, by permitting these workers \nto enter the country legally, we can try to avoid a future flow of \nundocumented workers who would otherwise create a new underground \neconomy.\n  New border security measures are, of course, an absolutely critical \nelement of any immigration reform bill. This bill contains important \nprovisions to increase and improve the personnel, equipment, \ninfrastructure, and other resources our country needs to protect the \nborder, and I strongly support those measures. But border security \nalone is not enough. According to a recent Cato Institute report, the \nprobability of catching an illegal immigrant has fallen over the past \ntwo decades from 33 percent to 5 percent, despite the fact that we have \ntripled the number of border agents and increased the enforcement \nbudget tenfold. We also must create realistic legal channels for \nimmigrants to come to the United State and that allow undocumented \nimmigrants who pass background checks to earn legal status. This reform \nof our immigration system is important to our national security because \nit will enable our border agents to focus their efforts on terrorists \nand others who pose a serious threat to Nation.\n  The bill contains other important proposals, such as the DREAM Act, \nwhich provides higher education opportunities for children who are \nlong-term U.S. residents and came to this country illegally through no \nfault of their own; and the AgJOBS bill to help agricultural workers; \nand family reunification. These provisions may not have been subject to \nas much debate as other elements of the bill, but they are just as \nimportant.\n  The amendment process also brought improvements to title III of the \nbill, which creates a new mandatory, nationwide electronic employment \nverification system. If not implemented correctly, such a system could \nresult in countless U.S. citizens and other work-authorized individuals \nbeing denied work as a result of errors or discrimination, a result \nthat none of us want. The new version of title III contains important \nprivacy, due process, and labor protections to ensure that \nimplementation of this system is as fair and accurate as possible. That \nsaid, this system is a dramatic expansion of an existing pilot program \nthat has faced a variety of serious problems, and I have concerns about \nexpanding it to a nationwide mandatory scheme. Its implementation will \nrequire robust congressional oversight to ensure that citizens and \nwork-authorized immigrants are not turned down for jobs because of \nmistaken results.\n  Although the border security measures and the core reforms to our \nimmigration system that are in this bill are very important, I do have \nconcerns about some aspects of this bill, including some changes that \nwere made to this bill during the amendment process on the Senate \nfloor.\n  One successful floor amendment would require the Government to build \n370 miles of fence along the southern border. Every Member of this body \nrecognizes that border security is critical to our Nation's security, \nbut I opposed the border fencing amendment because I cannot justify \npouring Federal dollars into efforts that have questionable \neffectiveness. Border fencing costs between $1 million and $3 million \nper mile. And yet we will be committing vast resources to an initiative \nthat I have serious doubts will even work. While fencing can be \neffective in urban areas, adding hundreds of miles of fencing in rural \nsections of the border will not stem the flow of people who are willing \nto risk their lives to come to this country.\n\n  I was also disappointed that the Senate approved the amendment making \nEnglish the national language of the United States. Instead of \nconsidering divisive English-only amendments that fan the flames of \ntension over the issue of immigration, we should be providing recent \nimmigrants with more opportunities to learn English. I also am \nconcerned that this amendment's language could limit the ability of the \nFederal Government to communicate with its citizens, which could have \npotentially devastating consequences in situations like national \nemergencies. That is why I supported an alternative amendment proposed \nby Senator Salazar, which simply recognized English as the ``common and \nunifying'' language of the United States.\n  I continue to have serious concerns about some provisions in title II \nof the bill. Despite improvements that were made in the Judiciary \nCommittee, title II still contains provisions that are both ill-advised \nand unnecessary. Title II contains measures that require excessive \ndeference to executive agency decisionmaking in a variety of \nimmigration contexts; that expand the categories of individuals subject \nto the most draconian immigration consequences and apply some of these \nchanges retroactively; and that require that civil immigration \nviolators be put in the central criminal database used by local, State \nand Federal agencies around the country. Eroding due process rights for \npeople in this country will not make us safer, nor is it in keeping \nwith our Nation's values of fairness and justice. It will be important \nthat we work to improve some of these provisions in the conference \nprocess.\n  I was very pleased, however, that the Senate voted in favor of an \namendment that I offered on the floor to strike a provision in title II \nthat could have had devastating consequences for asylum seekers. The \nprovision would have made it harder for asylum seekers, victims of \ntrafficking, and other immigrants to get a temporary stay of removal \nwhile they pursue their appeal than it would be to win on the merits. \nThis absurd result has been rejected by seven courts of appeals, and \nthe Senate is now on record as well. Although there are many other \nproblems with title II of the bill, this was a significant improvement \nand reinstates a critical due process protection.\n  An amendment offered by Senator Ensign relating to Social Security \nbenefits, which was tabled, has been the subject of a great deal of \nmisinformation. Under current law, undocumented immigrants are not \nentitled to Social Security benefits, and there is nothing in the \nunderlying bill that would change this. Under the Ensign Social \nSecurity amendment, immigrants who paid into Social Security and later \nearned legal status would have been prevented from having their \nearnings that they already paid into the system count toward their \nretirement benefits. The amendment, which I opposed, would have limited \nthe Social Security benefits only of U.S. citizens and those\n\n[[Page S5335]]\n\nin the country legally. This amendment would have harmed elderly or \ndisabled individuals who would be impoverished despite having paid into \nthe Social Security system for many years and would deny innocent \nAmerican children who are born to these workers survivor benefits, \nregardless of how long their mother or father worked and paid taxes in \nthe United States. In addition, the Ensign amendment would have forced \ntaxpayers to pay more for the means-tested welfare programs to which \nthese impoverished individuals would have had to turn. For these \nreasons, I opposed the Ensign amendment, and I am pleased that the \nmajority of my colleagues did as well.\n\n  Mr. President, the end result of several weeks of hard work is \nbipartisan, compromise legislation that will bring meaningful reforms \nto a system that has long been broken. The bill is far from perfect, \nbut on balance, I believe it is a victory for supporters of \ncomprehensive reform. But as the saying goes, it ain't over 'til it's \nover. In order for this legislation to become law, we need our \ncolleagues in the House to work with the Senate during the conference \ncommittee process and to adopt a comprehensive approach to this issue. \nAnd we need the President, who has come out in favor of comprehensive \nreform, to stay invested in this process. He has spoken, but now he \nmust act. We will need his help in convincing members of the House to \nabandon ill-conceived notions like criminalizing undocumented people \nand those who provide humanitarian support to them, and chiseling away \nat due process rights. The President's leadership, and the willingness \nof House leaders to work with the Senate, will be crucial in order to \nretain the important reform provisions contained in this bill during \nthe conference process.\n  This is a defining moment for America, and I am hopeful that the \nSenate, the House, and the President will work together so that we can \nbuild on this success and enact a comprehensive reform bill by the end \nof this Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/26/senate-section/article/S5335-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COSPONSORSHIP OF S. 1112\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to lend my support to S. 1112, \nthe College 529 InvEST Act of 2005, which I cosponsored today. A \ncollege education is more important today then it has ever been before. \nAs the intrinsic value of a college education has increased, so too has \nthe financial costs associated with it. In the last 10 years, the cost \nof a 4-year college education at a public institution increased 59 \npercent, while in public institutions it has grown by 42 percent. This \nincreased cost dramatically outpaces average family income growth \nduring the same time period.\n  It is not surprising that Montanans have expressed concerns about how \nthey will pay such a hefty pricetag for their children's futures. It is \nour responsibility in the Senate to make saving for college manageable \nfor many families who also struggle to save for their own retirement \nand may live from paycheck to paycheck. Federal programs can defray \nsome of the costs, but this alone cannot pay the bills. Tax relief \npassed in 2001 permitted States to implement their own plans, creating \na tax benefit for those families who chose to invest in them. Since \n1998, 12,539 qualified tuition program accounts total more than $146 \nmillion in Montana alone.\n  Without congressional action, the tax benefits of these plans will \nexpire in 2010. Withdrawals made after 2010 will be subjected to \ntaxation that means in just a little over 3 years from now, parents who \ninvested in these 529 plans for the tax benefits will face an \nunanticipated tax liability. This sunset provision casts serious doubt \non the likelihood a family would set up a 529 plan given such \nuncertainty. S. 1112 would make the tax provisions of these important \nplans permanent, providing much-needed certainty to parents and their \nchildren heading off to college in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/26/senate-section/article/S5335-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HOLD ON NOMINATION OF DAVID BERNHARDT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to attempt, once again, to \nraise awareness of the plight of countless rural communities due to the \nimpending expiration of the Secure Rural Schools and County Self-\nDetermination Act. I regret that the lack of concern at the White House \nand the inertia in Congress forces me to put a hold on David Bernhardt, \nthe administration's nominee for Interior Solicitor. It is time for \neveryone to focus their attention on the needs of the more than 700 \nrural counties in over 40 States that are depending on the \nreauthorization of this county payments legislation.\n  Thus far, the administration's solution to funding county payments is \nunacceptable. The county payments law, which provides a stable revenue \nsource for education, roads, and other county services in rural areas, \nis due to expire at the end of this year. In early 2005, I coauthored a \nbipartisan bill, S. 267, to reauthorize county payments for another 7 \nyears. The bill has 26 Senate cosponsors. In February, the \nadministration proposed reauthorizing the law for only 5 years while \ncutting funding by 60 percent and funding that reduced portion with a \ncontroversial Federal land sale scheme. In response, Senator Baucus \nproposed a sensible, alternative funding source for county payments, a \nproposal which I was pleased to cosponsor. Our legislation fully funds \ncounty payments by ensuring that a portion of Federal taxes are \nwithheld from payments by the Federal Government to government \ncontractors. The Federal Government currently does not withhold taxes \nwhen it pays government contractors. Recently, however, over my \nobjections, Congress approved a major tax bill that uses the Baucus \nproposal to instead provide tax cuts for this country's most fortunate \nfew. This lack of regard for the historic obligations of the Federal \nGovernment to rural counties severs a vitally important funding \nlifeline to communities throughout the country.\n  I will hold this nominee--and many nominees coming after him, if need \nbe--until the administration finds an acceptable way to fund county \npayments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/26/senate-section/article/S5335-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5335-S5336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DO THE WRITE THING CHALLENGE 2006\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Do the Write Thing Challenge, or DtWT, \nis a national program that gives middle school students the opportunity \nto reflect on and express themselves about youth violence in their \ncommunities. DtWT combines classroom discussion with a writing contest \nthat focuses on personal responsibility in solving youth violence \nproblems. Since it was created in 1994, more than 350,000 middle school \nstudents have participated in DtWT activities, and the program has \ngrown to include participants from 28 different jurisdictions, \nincluding Detroit, MI.\n  In 2005, more than 32,000 students participated in the DtWT writing \ncontest. To participate, students are asked to write an essay, poem, \nplay, or song that addresses the impact of violence on their life, the \ncauses of youth violence, and the things that they can do to prevent \nyouth violence around them. As part of their participation in the \ncontest, students are also asked to make a personal commitment that \nthey will put their thoughts into action by working to help stop youth \nviolence in their daily lives.\n  Each year, a DtWT Committee made up of community, business, and \ngovernmental leaders from each participating jurisdiction reviews the \nwriting submissions of the students and picks two national finalists, \none boy and one girl, from their area. I am pleased to recognize this \nyear's national finalists from Detroit, Demetrius Adams and Tiffini \nBaldwin, for their outstanding work and dedication to the prevention of \nyouth violence.\n  Both Demetrius and Tiffini wrote about the serious effect that guns, \ngangs, and drugs can have on the lives of teenagers. Their writings \ndemonstrate a deep understanding of the impact that a single act of \nviolence can have on an entire community. I am impressed by the \nmaturity they have shown in their work and congratulate them on being \nselected as national finalists.\n  In July, Demetrius and Tiffini will join the other DtWT national \nfinalists in Washington, DC, for National Recognition Week. During the \nweek's activities, the national finalists will attend a recognition \nceremony and have their work permanently placed in the Library of \nCongress. In addition, they will have the opportunity to share\n\n[[Page S5336]]\n\ntheir thoughts on youth violence with Members of Congress and other \npolicymakers. In the past, students have had the opportunity to meet \nwith the Secretary of Education, the Attorney General, and other \nrepresentatives from the Department of Justice.\n  I know my colleagues join me in celebrating the work of all of the \nDtWT participants from around the country. I would also like to thank \nthe DtWT organizers for their commitment to engaging with and educating \nchildren about nonviolence. Their important efforts help to increase \nawareness of the issue and facilitate the development of local \nsolutions to the youth violence problem in our Nation.\n  While it is important that we recognize the hard work of the DtWT \nparticipants and organizers, it is also important that we support their \nefforts through our actions in the Senate. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in supporting legislation that would help prevent youth violence by \nincreasing the number of police officers on our streets, by increasing \nresources for school and community violence prevention programs, and by \nmaking it more difficult for children and criminals to acquire \ndangerous firearms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/26/senate-section/article/S5336-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5336-S5338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REVEREND WILLIAM SLOANE COFFIN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to remember my friend Rev. \nWilliam Sloane Coffin who passed away in Vermont on April 12, 2006, at \nhis home in Strafford.\n  Bill Coffin was an extraordinary man who leaves behind a legacy of \ninspired service for social justice that few Americans have matched. He \ndedicated his life to speaking out on behalf of those who would \notherwise be forgotten, to improving the lives of the underprivileged, \nand to calling for justice for victims of discrimination in our \nsociety.\n  As chaplain of Yale University, Bill used that pulpit like none \nbefore him, to serve not only the Yale community but to inspire the \nentire Nation. While many Senators may remember him best for his moral \nleadership and courageous activism during the Vietnam War, Bill also \nestablished himself as a dedicated leader for racial and social \njustice. He was a member of the Freedom Riders who rode interstate \nbuses in the South to challenge segregation laws. He was a visionary \nand powerful leader in pointing out the hypocrisy of religious and \nsexual discrimination\n  Mr. Gary Trudeau, creator of the cartoon ``Doonesbury'' and fellow \nYale graduate, may have immortalized Bill Coffin in his Reverend Sloan \ncharacter. But that was only one chapter of a lifetime of using his \nministry to fight injustice. After his long service at Yale, Bill \nbecame pastor of Riverside Church in New York City where he continued \nto advocate for the downtrodden all over the world. Bill continued to \nbe a forceful presence for good long after he left Riverside.\n  Mr. President, Vermonters were fortunate to have Bill Coffin as a \nresident of our unique State. Vermonters have a long history of \nindependent thought, of standing up for what is right, and Bill Coffin \nset a standard for all of us. I was privileged to know him personally \nand to be able to call him a friend. I know his other friends and \nneighbors felt the same way. We were all made better, and felt better \nabout ourselves, when we were in the company of Bill Coffin.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a column by William F. Buckley and an \neditorial in the Valley News be printed in the Congressional Record so \nthat other Senators may have a further appreciation of this great and \ngood man.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Valley News, April 14, 2006]\n\n                           William S. Coffin\n\n       The Upper Valley has its share of accomplished and \n     prominent residents, but we can think of few whose presence \n     seemed such a gift as did that of The Rev. William Sloane \n     Coffin, who lived here full time from the late 1980s until \n     his death Wednesday at his home in Strafford.\n       The Upper Valley phase of Coffin's life showcased the same \n     devotion to social justice as his earlier chapters as pastor \n     of Riverside Church in New York City and chaplain of Yale \n     University. His focus shifted somewhat--the Vietnam War and \n     black Americans' civil rights while he worked in New Haven, \n     Conn., and New York City; nuclear disarmament, gay Americans' \n     civil rights and the environment while in Vermont--but the \n     larger theme remained constant. He was committed to speaking \n     truth to power, and he did that by talking about the issues \n     of the day with striking clarity and wisdom.\n       One of the last op-eds he wrote for the Valley News \n     appeared just a few weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks, and \n     reviewing it now, more than four years later, makes us wish \n     it had had more of an impact in guiding this nation's leaders \n     about the topic at hand--how to best respond to terrorism.\n       ``What Americans do realize now,'' Coffin wrote, ``is that \n     life can change on a dime. On Sept. 11, we lost, and lost \n     forever, our sense of invulnerability and invincibility. Hard \n     as that may be, let us not grieve their passing; they were \n     illusions.\n       ``Today it is the Devil's strategy to persuade Americans to \n     let go of the good to fight evil. I hope we will resist. I \n     hope that first we will present to the world conclusive \n     evidence of whom these hijackers were, from whence they came, \n     and who knowingly harbored them.\n       ``Then I hope we shall try to build international consensus \n     for appropriate measures, both to halt the violence and the \n     circumstances that gave rise to it.''\n       Here in the Upper Valley, though, we had the opportunity \n     not only to appreciate the power of Coffin's message but also \n     to witness the force of his personality. Whether at a dining \n     room table, behind a church pulpit, at a piano or on a stage \n     at a political rally, Coffin commanded, enjoyed and rewarded \n     attention. The message was difficult to separate from the \n     virtuoso performance of high-spiritedness, humor and insight. \n     Not even a failing body, including the slurred speech left in \n     the wake of a stroke, blunted the force of his personality. \n     Strafford Selectwoman Kay Campbell had it just right when she \n     noted that Coffin, despite his national stature, had a knack \n     for ``treating us like we were all special.''\n       Bill Coffin was an accomplished, amazing and fascinating \n     man, and many Upper Valley residents feel blessed not just to \n     have benefited from his wisdom but for the opportunity of \n     seeing him in action.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From Yale Daily News, Apr. 14, 2006]\n\n                    Coffin's Passion Topped Ideology\n\n                      (By William F. Buckley, Jr.)\n\n       It was the routine, when Charles Seymour was president of \n     Yale, that the chairman (as we were then designated) of the \n     News should visit with President Seymour for a half hour \n     every week, mutual conduits for information in both \n     directions. We became friends and he told me at one meeting \n     with some enthusiasm that the student speaker at the annual \n     Alumni Day lunch at the Freshman Commons the day before \n     ``gave the single most eloquent talk I have ever heard from \n     an undergraduate.'' I thought hard about that comment one \n     year later when I was selected to give the annual talk to the \n     alumni, which speech moved nobody at all because the day \n     before, the text having been examined by public relations \n     director Richard Lee, I was asked to be so kind as to \n     withdraw; and I did. (What I did with the speech was stick it \n     into the appendix of ``God and Man at Yale'').\n       I didn't meet William Sloane Coffin '49 DIV '56 until some \n     while later, when of course I congratulated him on electing \n     the correct political extremity in the controversies of the \n     day. He was never slow to catch an irony, and his wink \n     brought on a trans-ideological friendship that induced great \n     pleasure.\n       The friendship was publicly confirmed by Coffin with an \n     extraordinary gesture. Garry Trudeau '70 ART '73 was lining \n     up speakers for an event celebrating the reunion of his \n     class. His reunion coincided with a reunion of my own class, \n     and he came to me and asked if I would consent to debate with \n     Bill Coffin as I had done for Trudeau's class in freshman \n     year.\n       Well, I said, okay, though I knew that Charles Seymour's \n     estimate of successful speakers would certainly prevail yet \n     again. But there was a remarkable feature of that afternoon. \n     I climbed the steps at the Yale Law School Auditorium to \n     extend a hand to Bill Coffin--who brushed it aside and \n     embraced me with both arms. This was a dramatic act. It was \n     testimony not only to Coffin's wide Christian gateway to the \n     unfaithful, but also to his extraordinary histrionic skills. \n     I'd have lost the argument anyway. I have defended my \n     political faith as often as Coffin did his own, but you \n     cannot, in the end, win an argument against someone who is \n     offering free health care and an end to nuclear bombs. But \n     there was never any hope for survival after his public \n     embrace.\n       We were always, however lightly, in touch. ``Sweet \n     William,'' he addressed me in June 2003, enclosing a copy of \n     a speech he had delivered at Yale the week before. ``The \n     enclosed speech to the Class of '68, you will be sorry to \n     hear, was received with tumultuous applause. Don't worry, \n     however, you, alas, represent the ruling view. I hope you \n     feel with Saint Paul, `Though our outer nature is wasted away \n     our inner nature is being renewed each day.' Affectionately \n     as always, Bill.''\n       I replied ``Wm, I am not surprised your speech was greeted \n     by tumultuous applause. That is what demagogy is designed to \n     do, dear William.'' He replied some months later, enclosing a \n     copy of a page from the Boston Globe in which both of us were \n     quoted. ``Dear Wm, Could it be that in this time and our old \n     age that we might be on the same page? Do let me know, \n     affectionately, Bill.''\n       I replied that I had seen his new book Letters to a Young \n     Doubter. ``... I think of you\n\n[[Page S5337]]\n\n     often, and did so most directly when I published, a fortnight \n     ago, the obituary I did on William F. Rickenbacker. He is the \n     only other fleeted spirit I ever addressed as Dear Wm, which \n     he always reciprocated with letters address to me as Dear \n     Wm--both of us signing off as . . . Wm. As I am now, anxious \n     to get a note off to you, especially since you have taken to \n     writing books again, instead of reproachful letters to, your \n     pal--`Wm.' ''\n       Our disagreements were heated, and it is through the \n     exercise of much restraint that I forebear doing more than \n     merely to record that they were heated; on my way, heatedly, \n     to record that Bill Coffin was a bird of paradise, and to \n     extend my sympathy to all who, however thoughtlessly, lament \n     his failure to bring the world around to his views.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I am pleased today to introduce \nlegislation with Senator Specter to reaffirm the exclusivity of the \nForeign Surveillance Intelligence Act of 1978, FISA, and streamline the \nprocess by which it works.\n  This measure brings the so-called Terrorist Surveillance Program \nbeing conducted by the National Security Agency under the process \nrequired by FISA. The bill will enhance our national security and \nprovide constitutional protections against government intrusion into \nthe privacy of ordinary Americans.\n  Specifically, the bill that we introduce today would:\n  Restate, in no uncertain terms, that FISA is the exclusive means by \nwhich our Government can conduct electronic surveillance of U.S. \npersons on U.S. soil for foreign intelligence purposes;\n  Expressly state that there is no such thing as an ``implied'' repeal \nof our FISA laws. No future bill can be interpreted as authorizing an \nexception from FISA unless it expressly makes such exception;\n  Increase flexibility under FISA by extending the period of emergency \nelectronic surveillance from 72 hours to 7 days, which should cover all \ncontingent needs; and\n  Authorize designated supervisors at the NSA and the FBI to initiate \nemergency electronic surveillance, provided that the surveillance is \nreported to the Attorney General within 24 hours, and approved by the \nAG within 3 days and the FISA Court within 7 days. The purpose of this \nis to prevent bureaucratic delay in an emergency circumstance.\n  In addition to these major provisions, the legislation we introduce \ntoday makes several additional changes to reinforce FISA's exclusivity \nand adapt existing FISA authorities and procedures.\n  These changes are designed to allow applications to move faster from \nthe field to the FISA Court, and to allow that Court to handle any \nincreased caseload that will result from bringing the current NSA \nprogram into the FISA regime.\n  These additional authorities, streamlined procedures, and additional \nresources respond directly to needs described by the Attorney General, \ncurrent and former FISA Court judges, and outside experts. \nSpecifically, the bill:\n  Allows the Attorney General to delegate his authority to approve \napplications going to the FISA Court to two other Senate-confirmed \nJustice Department officials;\n  Takes FISA's current allowance for 15 days of warrantless electronic \nsurveillance following a declaration of war and extend it to the 15 \ndays:\n  1. Following a Congressional authorization to use military force, or\n  2. A major terrorist attack against our nation for the same period of \ntime.\n  Authorizes additional personnel at the NSA, the FBI, the Department \nof Justice, and the FISA Court, to reduce the time it takes to \ninitiate, review, and file a FISA application.\n  Allows for additional judges to the FISA Court as needed to manage \nthe caseload;\n  Facilitates a review of the FISA application process, culminating in \na report designed to eliminate any unnecessary delay in the filings; \nand\n  Mandates the creation of a secure, classified document management \nsystem to facilitate electronic filing.\n  In addition to reaffirming FISA's exclusivity, as I mentioned before, \nthe legislation:\n  Prohibits the use of Federal funds for any future electronic \nsurveillance of U.S. Persons that does not fully comply with the law; \nand\n  Requires that the full Intelligence Committees be briefed on all \nelectronic surveillance, and related, programs.\n  We are in a war against terrorists, who seek to attack us in \nunpredictable and asymmetric ways.\n  Intelligence is the key to our defense; we must know about the \nterrorists' intentions and capabilities to do us harm if we are to stop \nthem.\n  Electronic surveillance, including surveillance conducted within the \nUnited States on U.S. persons, is part of our defense. The men and \nwomen at the NSA and the FBI who do this work are careful, dedicated \nofficials.\n  But even in this war on terror, we should not sacrifice basic \nprotections enshrined in the Constitution, including the fourth \namendment protections against unreasonable search and seizures.\n  The FISA Court was created in 1978, following the Church Committee's \ninvestigation of some of our Government's worst civil rights \nviolations--J. Edgar Hoover's spying on Martin Luther King, Jr., and \nVietnam-era ``enemies lists,'' for example. These abuses were the \nresult of domestic spying--electronic surveillance--under the guise of \nforeign intelligence.\n  In response, Congress, working with both the Ford and Carter \nadministrations, drafted and later enacted FISA in 1978 to be the \nexclusive means to conduct electronic surveillance of U.S. persons. It \ncreated a special court--operating in secret--that has to approve a \nwarrant for every domestic wiretap, and provides for careful \ncongressional oversight.\n  Over the years, this FISA court has rejected only a small handful of \nthousands of warrant requests, and has never had a significant leak. \nAfter the PATRIOT Act was passed in October 2001, for example, the \nJustice Department stated that FISA has worked efficiently and well.\n  In the past 28 years, technology has changed, as have our enemies. \nAnd from time to time, when requested by various administrations, we \nhave made technical changes to FISA.\n  But the need to protect privacy rights by requiring individual \nwarrants from a FISA judge, and the exclusivity of FISA, have remained \nconstant.\n  The domestic electronic surveillance that has been conducted since \nOctober 2001 operates, for the most part, outside of the law. In \naddition, the way the administration has moved forward with this \nprogram has brought us to the brink of a constitutional confrontation.\n  The legislation that Senator Specter and I are introducing today \nbrings the surveillance program under appropriate supervision and \nrestores the checks and balances between the branches of government.\n\n  As one who has been briefed on the details of the NSA surveillance \nprogram, I have come to believe that this surveillance can be done, \nwithout sacrifice to our national security, through court-issued \nindividualized warrants for all content collection of U.S. persons \nunder the FISA process.\n  Further, testimony and letters from the Attorney General, former \nDirector of the NSA General Hayden, and other administration officials \nhave provided no reason, other than that of timeliness, why the NSA \nprogram couldn't proceed under the FISA regime.\n  This legislation would help transform the FISA process into one agile \nenough to meet the administration's need for timely action, while also \npreserving judicial oversight and our important constitutional privacy \nprotections.\n  In an April 6 hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, Attorney \nGeneral Gonzales openly suggested that warrants might have been \nobtainable for everything that the NSA is doing, and then testified \nthat the main ``problem'' he saw with FISA was one of ``timing.''\n  After the Attorney General's testimony, I wrote to him asking him why \nthese timing problems could not be addressed directly, so that we could \nreturn to the FISA process followed by all Presidents since Jimmy \nCarter.\n  The Justice Department's response does not provide a reason why \nFISA's timing problems are incapable of being fixed. All it \ndemonstrates is that this administration is not interested in trying to \nfix them.\n  This bill addresses all of the concerns noted in the Attorney \nGeneral's letter.\n  The primary concern raised was that current law requires the Attorney \nGeneral to determine that FISA's factual predicates have been met \nbefore authorizing the surveillance to begin. In other words, he \nsuggests that there is\n\n[[Page S5338]]\n\nimportant surveillance he might delay, or even avoid, if he must \ndetermine in advance that a court will grant approval. But this bill \neliminates the requirement for Attorney General approval before \nsurveillance begins.\n  Under this bill, if the circumstances warrant, an Attorney General-\ndesignated supervisor of the NSA or FBI can begin emergency \nsurveillance immediately. The designated officer would have to notify \nthe Attorney General's office within 24 hours of starting, and then get \napproval from the AG within 72 hours. The Department of Justice would \nthen need to obtain an emergency warrant from the FISA court within 7 \ndays of the initiation of surveillance.\n  The Attorney General's role would simply be to decide whether to stop \nthe surveillance--not authorize it on the front end. And even on this \ndecision to stop surveillance, the bill allows him to delegate that \ndecision to two other Department of Justice officials. If the Court \ndoes not issue a warrant, the information cannot be used in any legal \nproceeding.\n  This provision is respectful of the administration's needs. The 7-day \nemergency window in this bill more than doubles the existing 3-day \nperiod that exists for emergencies now. It also extends substantial \nadditional resources to the Department of Justice and the intelligence \nagencies. And as I say, our bill expressly authorizes a designated \nagent to go ahead with necessary surveillance right away.\n  The Attorney General's letter also asserts that FISA is unworkable \nbecause prompt action increases the chance that the target of \nsurveillance may ultimately be notified if the FISA Court later turns \ndown the warrant.\n  The risk here is no different than the risk every prior \nAdministration has faced. And it is also infinitesimal, since only a \nsmall handful of FISA applications--only 4 out of 18,747 from 1979-\n2005, according to press reports--have ever been refused by the FISA \nCourt.\n  Even in the extremely rare case of where a FISA Court denies an \nemergency warrant, and therefore directs notification of the target of \nsurveillance, the FISA law has a provision that exempts the Attorney \nGeneral from notifying the target if he certifies that doing so would \nimperil national security.\n  Despite the remote chances of national security being compromised, \nthe legislation gives the Attorney General the benefit of the doubt, \nand provides that if the Attorney General or his designees stops the \nNSA or FBI surveillance within 72 hours, the target of surveillance \nwill not be notified.\n  Beyond the Attorney's General letter, the White House, the Department \nof Justice, and intelligence officials say that court review of the \nsurveillance is not necessary for three reasons:\n  First, they argue that the President has the constitutional authority \nto order the surveillance, regardless of statutory prohibitions. This \nis a question for the courts to decide.\n  It is highly debatable whether the President has plenary article II \nconstitutional power, but even if he does, he clearly does not have \nplenary authority to decide which of his powers are plenary. If he did, \nany Executive Branch official could open mail, or enter homes at any \ntime without a warrant in the name of national security, and the \ndoctrine of separation of powers as we know it would end.\n\n  Secondly, the administration argues that the NSA electronic \nsurveillance program is subject to numerous reviews and safeguards at \nboth the Department of Justice and the National Security Agency, thus \nmaking outside oversight unnecessary.\n  This argument flies in the face of our system of government. We have \nthree separate branches of government, each with checks and balances on \nthe other two. The framers of the Constitution did not vest the \nExecutive Branch with the right to oversee itself; that is the \nresponsibility of the Congress and the Courts.\n  We have also recently seen how this arrangement of internal reviews, \neven if it were acceptable, simply does not work. Within the Department \nof Justice, the Office of Professional Responsibility was recently \nasked to review the legality of the activities of those involved in the \nsurveillance program outside of FISA, but we have learned that OPR was \ndenied the security clearances needed to do their work.\n  Finally, as I noted before, the Executive Branch says that outside \nreview by the Congress and the courts would hamstring their ability to \nprevent terrorist attacks. I do not believe that is true, based on the \nbriefings I have received, but even if it were, the answer is to amend \nFISA, not to throw it out. The FISA law has been changed since \nSeptember 11 through the PATRIOT Act and the renewal of the PATRIOT \nAct. It can be done again. In short, if the President sees problems \nwith an existing law, the simple answer is that he should ask to change \nit--not refuse to follow the law.\n  This war on terror will be a long war, and it will be mostly fought \nin the shadows.\n  It is thus especially important that the Congress and the American \npeople be assured that we are waging that war in a way that upholds our \nprinciples and follows the Constitution.\n  I believe that our national security and core privacy interests can \nboth be protected, given the right tools and authorities, if each \nbranch of government will work together to fulfill their respective \nroles and obligations.\n  Congress was able to do that more than 25 years ago when it first \nenacted FISA, and I am confident we can do it again today.\n  I have been waiting for the NSA to submit views regarding metadata--\nthat is, information about communications that does not include \ncontent. It is my strong belief that any and all metadata collection \nprograms should be approved by FISA on a program basis. I would hope to \nadd such a provision to this bill at a later time or to introduce a new \nbill to cover this subject.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/26/senate-section/article/S5338-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               NATIONAL MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Gregg \nAgena of Mililani Middle School for being recognized as the national \nmiddle school teacher of the year by the National Association for \nSports and Physical Education.\n  Initially, Gregg was honored by being named the Southwest District \nMiddle School Physical Educator of the Year. The Southwest District of \nthe National Association for Sport and Physical Education, NASPE, is a \nsix-State region, which includes Hawaii. There were four other \nfinalists for the national recognition, and it is with esteemed pride \nthat I recognize and congratulate Gregg for receiving the national \nhonor.\n  The award, which was announced at the NASPE national convention in \nSalt Lake City, UT, is a recognition of outstanding teaching at the \nmiddle school level and for motivating students to participate in \nphysical activity throughout their entire lives. As a former educator \nand principal, I know firsthand of the countless hours that go into \ncreating curricula, and it makes me proud to see outstanding teachers \nreceive recognition for their hard work.\n  Gregg, who received both his undergraduate and graduate degrees from \nthe University of Hawaii at Manoa, my alma mater, has also been \nrecognized as the Nike Teacher of the Year, Hawaii Middle School \nPhysical Education Teacher of the Year, and the recipient of the Ola \nPono, which is Hawaii's Drug Free Award.\n  I would also like to recognize Kay Bicoy of Pearl City High School, \nwho was named the Southwest District High School Physical Educator of \nthe Year by NASPE. This was the first time that a public school teacher \nfrom the state of Hawaii was selected as a district award recipient, \nand it is with immense pride that I recognize not only one, but two \nteachers from my home State for such an accomplishment.\n  The dedication of Gregg and Kay to their field and to the children of \nHawaii are undeniable. I congratulate them both not only for these \noutstanding recognitions, but especially for their dedication to \neducating the youth from the state of Hawaii, and I wish them the very \nbest in their future endeavors.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/26/senate-section/article/S5339-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5339]]\n                          ALLAN W.

Mr. McWilliams served as ward representative from \n1982 until 1991 and assumed his current role as the town's recorder in \n1991.\n  Mr. McWilliams, who is affectionately known as ``Bugs,'' has made \nnumerous contributions as one of the town's leaders. During his tenure \non the town council, Mr. McWilliams has worked to promote fiscal \nresponsibility, lower taxes and responsible planned growth. He has \noverseen the development of a professional community police force and \nhas helped to implement a long-range capital planning project. As a \nresident of Berryville for more than 50 years and an owner of a \nbusiness in downtown Berryville for the past 27 years, Mr. McWilliams \nis truly committed to the growth and success of this town.\n  Mr. McWilliams, who is married to Barbara and is the father to \nJeffery and Michelle, has brought an innovative spirit and common-\nsense, principled leadership to the Town of Berryville.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. \nGerald D. Fischbach for his service as the Executive Vice President for \nHealth and Biomedical Sciences and Dean of the Faculties of Medicine \nand Health Sciences at Columbia University in New York. Gerry Fischbach \nis a highly respected neuroscientist and educator. I have known Dean \nFischbach since 1998 when he served as Director of the National \nInstitute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS, at the National \nInstitutes of Health, NIH, during the Clinton administration.\n  As executive vice president and dean, Gerry Fischbach was charged \nwith running the Columbia University Medical Center, CUMC, in northern \nManhattan. The CUMC comprises the College of Physicians and Surgeons, \nthe Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Nursing, the \nCollege of Dental Medicine, and the Mailman School of Public Health. \nDean Fischbach worked tirelessly to advance the Medical Center's three \nprimary missions, providing high quality patient care, conducting \ninnovative biomedical research, and educating generations of doctors, \nscientists, nurses, dentists, and public health professionals.\n  Gerry Fischbach is a native of Mount Vernon, New York and graduated \nfrom Colgate University. After graduating from Cornell Medical School \nin New York City, he completed his internship at the University of \nWashington Hospital in Seattle. In 1966, he began his lifelong \ndedication to research and education at the NIH. Before coming to \nColumbia, Dean Fischbach held Chairmanships at both Harvard University \nand Washington University in St. Louis, and was Director of the NINDS \nat NIH.\n  Throughout his career, Dean Fischbach has studied the formation and \nmaintenance of synapses, the junctions between nerve cells and their \ntargets through which information is transferred. His work has focused \non the neuromuscular junction, where he pioneered using cultured \nneurons and muscle cells to characterize the biochemical, cellular, and \nelectrophysiological mechanisms underlying the development and function \nof this junction. Beginning in the 1970s, Dean Fischbach began to study \nthe mechanism by which motor neurons regulate the number of \nacetylcholine receptors on muscle cells. In 1993, this work culminated \nwith the purification and cloning of the acetylcholine receptor-\ninducing activity, ARIA, protein, which stimulates skeletal muscle \ncells to synthesize acetylcholine receptors. Dean Fischbach's work was \nkey in demonstrating that synaptic development relies on biochemical \nmechanisms.\n  While at Columbia, Dean Fischbach initiated and implemented a \nstrategic planning process and oversaw the completion and dedication of \nthe new Irving Cancer Research Center. No stranger to Congress from his \ndays at NINDS, he has been active in the effort to expand eligibility \nfor federal funding for stem cell research, and has lectured, written, \nand testified before Congress numerous times on the subject. During his \ntenure, he created the Columbia Center for Neuroscience Initiatives and \nthe CUMC Stem Cell Consortium, both to promote better understanding of \nthe human brain and develop treatments for diseases that affect \nmillions of Americans.\n  New York is blessed with an abundance of top research institutions \nand teaching hospitals, New York's jewels, as my predecessor Senator \nMoynihan used to call them, and there is no doubt that Columbia's \nmedical center is one of the finest in the country. Columbia receives \nmore NIH funding than any other New York institution, and two out of \nthe past five Nobel Prize winners for Physiology and Medicine have been \nColumbia faculty. I have become very familiar with the outstanding \nclinical care provided by CUMC and the New York Presbyterian Hospital. \nDr. Craig Smith, the surgeon who operated on my husband, is a Columbia \nfaculty member.\n  My colleagues may have noticed that the one word I have not used in \nmy remarks is ``retire.'' Although Gerry Fishbach may be stepping down \nfrom his current position, he is not retiring. He will remain an active \nCUMC faculty member and researcher. He also will serve as the \nScientific Advisor for the Simons Foundation, a New York-based \nfoundation dedicated to advancing the basic and clinical frontiers of \nautism research.\n  There will be more time to spend with his wife Ruth, a noted \nbioethicist, their children and grandchildren at their home in Wood's \nHole, and I suspect there may be a few more rounds of golf in his \nfuture. Gerry Fischbach will continue to do what he has devoted his \nlife to: expanding, creating, and disseminating knowledge of the brain \nand working on developing means to treat disease. He will also continue \nto be active on health and science policy issues like stem cell \nresearch and it would not surprise me, once absolved from the day-to-\nday responsibilities of Dean, if he is not more visible on Capitol \nHill.\n  Dean Fischbach is leaving Columbia University Medical Center in good \nhands. Dr. Lee Goldman will assume the executive vice president and \ndean position in late June. A distinguished cardiologist, Dr. Goldman \ncomes to Columbia from the University of California San Francisco where \nhe is Chair of the Department of Medicine. I want to welcome Dr. \nGoldman to New York and look forward to working with him.\n  I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing this great New \nYorker, Dr. Gerald D. Fischbach. Congratulations Gerry and best to you \nand Ruth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/26/senate-section/article/S5339-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ANNUAL NEW JERSEY LAW ENFORCEMENT MEMORIAL SERVICE\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I commemorate the 21st annual \nNew Jersey Law Enforcement Memorial Service held this week in Ocean \nGrove, NJ. This ceremony, which is hosted by the New Jersey State \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, NJSACP, honors the sacrifice made by \nlaw enforcement officers who have given their lives in the line of \nduty. Its participants represent the entire New Jersey law enforcement \ncommunity, including State and local police agencies as well as \nprosecutors and federal agents based in New Jersey.\n  Events such as the New Jersey Law Enforcement Memorial Service and \nlast week's commemoration of National Police Week are the least we can \ndo to express our gratitude to the brave men and women who risk their \nlives every day in service to our communities, States, and Nation. Our \nNation lost 155 law enforcement officers in 2005. Their ultimate \nsacrifice and the important work they did every day must never be \nforgotten.\n  I am proud that my State of New Jersey honors these heroes in the \noldest statewide law enforcement memorial service in the country, and I \nask that the Senate join me in commending the NJSACP for hosting this \nimportant event.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/26/senate-section/article/S5340-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5340]]\n   IN RECOGNITION OF THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD CUTTER ICEBREAKER \n                       ``MACKINAW'' AND HER CREW\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I pay \ntribute to the United States Coast Guard Cutter Icebreaker Mackinaw on \nher 62 years of exceptional service on the Great Lakes. The Coast \nGuard's largest cutter assigned to the Great Lakes, the Mackinaw will \nbe decommissioned on Saturday, June 10, 2006. The power and majesty of \nthe Mackinaw have made her a unique and awe-inspiring cutter, setting a \nhigh standard by which other icebreakers are measured.\n  Construction of the Mackinaw began on March 20, 1943, by the Toledo \nShipbuilding Company of Ohio. With the Great Lakes serving as a vital \nlink for industry and commerce, the Coast Guard needed a vessel that \ncould accomplish in one pass what took smaller icebreakers three or \nfour passes to accomplish. Out of this need was born the legendary \n``Mighty Mac.'' At a length of 290 feet, a beam of 74 feet, a \ndisplacement of 5,252 tons, and a maximum speed of 16 knots, the \nMackinaw was the most powerful icebreaker in the world when she was \ncommissioned on December 20, 1944.\n  In the years since then, the Mackinaw has served proudly on the Great \nLakes, with Cheboygan, Michigan, as her home port. In addition to her \nmission of breaking ice in the fall and spring, the Mackinaw has been \ncalled upon to serve as a buoy tender, carry fuel and supplies to light \nstations, serve as a training vessel and assist vessels in distress \nwhen necessary. The Mackinaw has completed all of these duties with \ndistinction.\n  Along the way, the Mackinaw has captured the imagination of the \npeople of the Great Lakes, and they call her by many names: ``The \nMighty Mac,'' ``Big Mac,'' ``Ice Cream Machine,'' ``Great White \nMother,'' ``Mack Attack,'' ``Guardian of the Eighth Sea,'' and ``Grand \nLady of the Great Lakes.''\n  The great success of the Mackinaw is due, not only to the \ncapabilities of the vessel herself, but also to her crew. Over the last \n62 years, more then 3,000 men and women have served this country aboard \nthe Mackinaw. These men and women should be saluted for their \ndedication, hard work, and tireless efforts in protecting and securing \nthe safe passage of vessels on the Great Lakes.\n  The crew of the Mackinaw is also to be commended for their volunteer \nefforts. Since 2000, the Mackinaw has taken on the special mission of \nacting as Chicago's Christmas Ship. Each December, the crew makes the \n350 mile trip from Cheboygan, Michigan to Chicago, Illinois, bringing \nChristmas trees to be distributed to disadvantaged families in Chicago. \nSince its inception, this program has provided more than 6,000 trees to \nfamilies in need during the holiday season.\n  On the eve of her decommissioning, I would like to praise the United \nStates Coast Guard Cutter Icebreaker Mackinaw for her 62 years of \nservice on the Great Lakes. And I thank the current and former crew of \nthis great ship for their service and commitment. The Mackinaw will be \nlong remembered for a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/26/senate-section/article/S5340-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IN RECOGNITION OF THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD CUTTER ``ACACIA'' AND \n                                HER CREW\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I pay \ntribute to the United States Coast Guard Cutter Acacia on her 62 years \nof exceptional service on the Great Lakes. The ``Ace of the Great \nLakes'' will be remembered for her strength, integrity, and rich \nmaritime history. The Acacia is the last of the Coast Guard's classic \nWorld War II era 180 foot buoy tenders, and when she is decommissioned \non Wednesday, June 7, 2006, it will be the end of an era.\n  The Acacia, constructed during World War II by the Zenith Dredge \nCompany of Duluth, Minnesota, was launched on September 1, 1944. She \nwas named after the U.S. Lighthouse Service Acacia, the only Lighthouse \nService vessel sunk during World War II. In the years since her \ncommissioning, the Acacia has served proudly on the Great Lakes, \ncalling Charlevoix, Michigan, home port for the last 16 years.\n  Affectionately known as ``The Big A,'' the Acacia's primary duties \nhave been the maintenance of more than 210 buoys, lighthouses and other \nnavigational aids in the Great Lakes. Servicing these aids to \nnavigation has required travel from as far south as Calumet Harbor to \nas far north as Little Bay De Noc. The Acacia's icebreaking \ncapabilities were also vital to maintaining the safe passage of coal \nships in the channels between Toledo, Ohio and Detroit, Michigan every \nwinter through her participation in Operation Coal Shovel.\n  In addition, the Acacia has assisted in icebreaking and search and \nrescue operations on the Great Lakes and throughout the world. \nInternationally, the Acacia and her crew took part in operation Uphold \nDemocracy in 1994, supporting the Department of Defense in patrolling \nthe coastline of Haiti. Whether working on the Great Lakes or in \ninternational waters, the Acacia and her crew have completed all of \ntheir missions with class and integrity.\n  As we pay tribute to the Acacia, I want to recognize the \ncontributions of her crew to her great success. The proud men and women \nwho have served this country aboard the Acacia over the last 62 years \nare to be saluted for their commitment, hard work, and impressive skill \nin protecting and securing the safe passage of vessels on the Great \nLakes.\n  On the eve of her decommissioning, I would like to praise the United \nStates Coast Guard Cutter Acacia for her service on the Great Lakes. \nAnd I thank the current and former crew of this great ship for their \nservice and commitment.

A bill to provide student borrowers with basic rights, \nincluding the right to timely information about their loans and the \nright to make fair and reasonable loan payments, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce legislation to \nprotect the rights of student borrowers trying to repay their loans. \nStudents are borrowing now more than ever to pay for higher education. \nNeed-based grant aid has stagnated while college costs have grown. The \nresult is more students borrowing and higher levels of borrowing. In \n1993, less than one-half of students graduating from 4-year colleges \nand universities had student loans. Now two-thirds do.\n  Unlike other debt, you take out student loans to invest in yourself. \nFor most people, that is a wise investment. In the long run student \nloans help people earn more money and have more choices in their \ncareers. Student borrowers must also take their responsibilities \nseriously, so future generations of students can also benefit from the \nchance to borrow money--so they do not have to burden their families.\n  But today it is harder to pay back loans than when I left school or \nwhen most of the Members of this Chamber did. The average debt burden \nfor college graduates has increased 58 percent over the past decade, \nafter accounting for inflation. And too many borrowers are overly \nburdened as they repay student loans. When I travel in New York, I meet \nyoung people all the time who say to me, ``You know, Senator, I'd like \nto go to nursing school or I'd like to be a teacher or I'd like to go \ninto law enforcement, but I've got so much debt that I can't afford to \ndo that.'' We need to make sure that student loans do not stand in \npeople's way and prevent them from following their dreams.\n  The burden of student loan debt can put people in economic handcuffs, \nforcing them out of important but low-paying professions or forcing \nthem to delay the purchase of a home. Today 54 percent of former \nstudents wish they had borrowed less for college, up from 31 percent in \n1991. Student loan debt may even prevent borrowers from pursuing a \nhigher degree. According to the Nellie Mae Corporation, 40 percent of \ncollege graduates who do not go to graduate school blame student loan \ndebt. Most disturbingly, the prospect that student loans will be \nburdensome may prevent successful high school students from going to \ncollege. Twenty percent of low-income high school graduates who are \nqualified for college do not go to college.\n  The Student Borrower Bill of Rights will make it easier for students \nto repay and give them rights that are enforceable. The bill will give \nstudents the right to shop for loans in a free marketplace. It will \ngive students access to better information about their loans. The bill \nwill give student borrowers the right to make fair, monthly payments \nthat do not exceed a percentage of their incomes and fair interest \nrates and fees. The bill would also give students the right to borrow \nwithout exploitation.\n  We need this bill now to help students struggling to go to college. \nFor the average family it now takes more income to pay for a child to \ngo to college than it did, as a percentage, 25 years ago.\n  So we need to do everything we can to ensure all students can afford \ncollege. It is in their best interest and it is in the Nation's best \ninterest.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Student Borrower \nBill of Rights.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 3274. A bill to create a fair and efficient system to resolve \nclaims of victims for bodily injury caused by asbestos exposure, and \nfor other purposes; read the first time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am introducing a revised bill on \nasbestos reform, with the sponsorship of Senator Leahy.\n  This is a subject which the Senate had considered earlier this year, \nand it is one which I hope we will return to.\n\n[[Page S5345]]\n\n  To give impetus to that, I am introducing an amended version of the \nasbestos trust bill which makes very substantial improvements to \nsatisfy interests and concerns raised by a number of Senators.\n  The bill provides for a more prompt recovery for the sickest \nclaimants; stronger medical criteria; preserves the ability of the \nbankruptcy trusts to continue paying impaired claims; has an improved \nallocation formula for well-insured and financially strapped defendant \ncompanies; and it has a tighter control on so-called leakage.\n  Last Friday, we lost a great American judge, Judge Edward R. Becker, \nwho made such an enormous contribution to the structuring of this \nasbestos reform legislation. He gave his own time, came to Washington \nat his own cost to preside over many meetings with the so-called \nstakeholders, the manufacturers, the trial lawyers, the AFL-CIO \nrepresenting labor, and the insurance companies. He was working on this \nbill making calls to Senators right up until the time that prostate \ncancer took him a week ago today.\n  When I gave him a report of our progress when it was obvious that the \nend was very near, he said, ``Win one for the Gipper.'' And we want to \nwin one for the Gipper, for Judge Becker. We want to win this one for \nAmerica.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my prepared statement \nand the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mr. SPECTER. I have sought recognition to comment about the \n     status of on-going developments on asbestos reform and am \n     pleased to introduce an amended version of S.852, the \n     Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2006, The \n     ``FAIR Act''. In introducing this legislation today, I remind \n     the Senate of important unfinished business that it is duty-\n     bound to complete for the sake of thousands of victims dying \n     from asbestos-related disease who are unable to secure \n     compensation in today's broken tort system.\n       Judge Edward R. Becker and I worked for nearly three years \n     on ways to improve S. 852, even after the bill was side-\n     tracked on the Senate floor on February 14, 2006. Sadly, \n     Judge Becker passed away on May 19, 2006. Judge Becker--a \n     federal Judge for 34 years--stands today as one of the \n     greatest citizens in the history of the city of Philadelphia, \n     one of the greatest judges in the history of the United \n     States, and one of my most dear and trusted friends. His \n     contributions and tireless work on this legislation helped \n     bring the bill to its current point, and his commitment to \n     solving the asbestos crisis in this country should be \n     remembered as the Senate moves forward on this bill. This new \n     bill is a product of our continued efforts to develop the \n     most fair and rationale system to replace the broken asbestos \n     tort system.\n\n  More than three months have past since the Senate was prematurely \ndiverted in its consideration of this important legislation. To remind \nmy I colleagues, the majority leader brought the committee-reported \nasbestos bill to the floor on February 6 and the following day this \nbody voted overwhelmingly (98-1) to invoke cloture on the motion to \nproceed. While we pursued substantive debate, opponents of the bill \nraised a non-substantive and never-before used procedural obstacle that \nblocked the Senate from further considering the legislation. This \nobstacle, a budgetary point of order, lacked any merit because the \nproposed asbestos trust fund simply does not collect or spend a single \npenny from the American taxpayer. And let me make clear that the \ncommitment to using private, non-taxpayer funds is iron-clad. The trust \nfund considered back in February and introduced again here today is \ncapitalized exclusively by defendant companies, insurers and existing \nbankruptcy trusts that have known asbestos liabilities. The bill \nexpressly provides that ``[r]epayment of moneys borrowed by the \nadministrator . . . is limited solely to amounts available in the \n[Fund].'' It also states that ``Nothing in this Act shall be construed \nto create any obligation of funding from the United States Government, \nincluding any borrowing authorized . . .'' With these explicit \nstatements throughout the bill, it is abundantly clear that this \nlegislation would not be a burden on the U.S. Treasury. In fact, the \nCongressional Budget Office confirmed these statements in a letter \ndated February 13, 2006, concluding that ``the legislation would be \ndeficit-neutral over the life of the fund.'' Therefore, it is time for \nthe Senate to set aside these obstructionist tactics and move forward \nwith this important legislation on its merits.\n  The bill that I am introducing today will provide substantial \nassurances of acceptable compensation to asbestos victims and \nsubstantial assurances to manufacturers and insurers to resolve \nasbestos claims with finality. Over the past three decades, a solution \nto the asbestos crisis has eluded Congress and the courts. Some 77 \ncompanies have gone bankrupt, thousands of individuals who have been \nexposed to asbestos have deadly diseases--mesothelioma and other such \nailments--and are not being compensated or, because of the unfairness \nof the current system, see little of the awards they do win. A May 10, \n2005 report released by the RAND Institute for Civil Justice estimates \nthat nonmalignants make up about 90 percent of the litigation and most \nare unimpaired. According-to RAND, the number of claims continues to \nrise, with over 730,000 claims filed already and some 200,000 pending. \nThe number of asbestos defendants also has risen sharply, from about \n300 in the 1980s, to more than 8,400 today. Most of these defendants \nwere users of the product, not asbestos manufacturers. These companies \naccount for 85 percent of the U.S. economy and represent nearly every \nU.S. industry; including automakers, shipbuilders, textile mills, \nretailers, insurers, shipbuilders, electric utilities and virtually \nevery company involved in manufacturing or construction in the last \nthirty years.\n  Asbestos leaves many victims in its wake. First and foremost, those \nwho are sick and their families have suffered greatly and do not \nreceive fair compensation in the tort system. Asbestos victims filing \nclaims receive only about 42 cents for every dollar spent on asbestos \nlitigation. The other 58 cents are consumed by the extremely high costs \nof litigation where 31 cents of every dollar go to defense costs, and \n27 go to plaintiffs' attorneys and other related costs.\n\n  The flawed asbestos litigation system not only hurts the sick and \ntheir chances of receiving fair compensation, but also claims other \nvictims. These include employees, retirees and shareholders of affected \ncompanies whose jobs, savings and retirement plans are jeopardized by \nthe tidal wave of asbestos lawsuits. With asbestos litigation affecting \nso many companies, this also impacts the overall economy, including \njobs, pensions, stock prices, tax revenues and insurance costs. Indeed, \naccording to a 2002 study by Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, asbestos \nbankruptcies have cost nearly 60,000 workers their jobs and $200 \nmillion in lost wages. To make matters worse, employees' retirement \nfunds have shrunk by 25 percent.\n  Even this country's highest court has practically begged the Congress \nto fix this national asbestos litigation problem. In 1997--the first of \nseveral times it has commented on the growing asbestos problem--the \nSupreme Court observed:\n\n       The most objectionable aspects of this asbestos litigation \n     can be briefly summarized: dockets in both federal and state \n     courts continue to grow; long delays are routine; trials are \n     too long; the same issues are litigated over and over; \n     transaction costs exceed the victims' recovery by nearly two \n     to one; exhaustion of assets threatens and distorts the \n     process; and future claimants may lose altogether. . . .\n\n  To the extent anyone argues that today's bill should proceed through \nregular order, I would suggest that they take a hard look at the \nextensive consideration and analysis given to this bill beginning in \nearly 2003 when then Chairman Hatch first introduced S. 1125. Since \nthat time, the Judiciary Committee has held over 10 markups, 7 \nhearings, and, of course, countless stakeholder meetings that were \nmoderated by the late Judge Becker. I can't think of any other bill \nwhere more time, more effort, and more man-hours have been committed to \nthoroughly understand and address all the complex issues in this bill. \nTo assert that the legislation was not carefully drafted is one \nargument that has no basis in reality. As a result of this process, we \nnow have before us a carefully analyzed and well thought through bill \nthat tries to anticipate every turn, every problem and every \ncontingency that could occur down the road if this Fund becomes law.\n  The legislation being introduced today builds on prior iterations of \nthe trust fund concept. Under the proposal,\n\n[[Page S5346]]\n\nthe Department of Labor would house a national no-fault asbestos trust \nfund privately financed and guaranteed by defendant companies and \ninsurers with proven asbestos liabilities. The bill totally exempts \nsmall business from paying into the Fund and provides a litany of \nsafeguards to ensure that defendant companies do not encounter \ninsolvencies or inequities because of their contributions.\n  Asbestos victims would submit their claims to the fund under specific \nand detailed procedures and receive fair compensation for their \nasbestos injuries they can meet certain medical criteria. These \ncriteria are designed to prioritize monetary compensation for those \nwith an actual impairment from asbestos disease while providing medical \nmonitoring to those who are not sick or unimpaired. Most important, the \nbill caps attorneys fees at 5 percent for any monetary compensation \nthat a victim receives through the Fund.\n  The national trust fund would operate as a surrogate for the tort \nsystem which would by and large cease to operate upon enactment. \nClaimants with individualized cases at trial or beyond would be \npermitted to pursue that claim in the tort system. But such cases would \nbe few and far between when measured against the massive amount of \nunimpaired consolidated lawsuits that are the prime culprit to today's \nlitigation mess.\n  The bill provides for a well thought out start up process that \nensures swift compensation to terminal asbestos victims and mandates a \nreversion to a modified tort system in the event the trust fund cannot \npay claims or exhausts the entire $140 billion. This latter point is \nespecially important to note given repeated concerns that I have heard \nfrom many members about the taxpayer being on the hook. Unlike the \nBlack Lung Program or other federal compensation program for that \nmatter, the asbestos trust fund will affirmatively sunset once the $140 \nbillion is used or if the Fund cannot pay claims. The sunset enables \nvictims to pursue their claims in court but in a more equitable tort \nenvironment that prohibits forum shopping and use of junk science to \nprove an asbestos claim.\n  Every single time a concern has been raised, Judge Becker and I have \nstudied the issue extensively. A case in point was in September 2005, \nwhen the analysis by the Bates White firm alleged that the proposed \nfund would face claims of over $140 billion, I called for a hearing on \nthis issue. The hearing, which was held by the Judiciary Committee on \nNovember 17, 2005, we heard testimony on both sides of the issue. The \nBates White study proved to be fatally flawed. In fact, in December \n2005, CBO confirmed its original cost estimate, reaffirming that $140 \nbillion would be sufficient to cover claims filed for compensation \nunder the trust fund.\n  The asbestos trust fund bill that I am introducing today with Senator \nLeahy should come as no surprise to anyone because it essentially \nembodies the substitute bill that was pending on the floor months ago \nduring the Senate's full consideration of asbestos reform last \nFebruary. The trust fund bill being introduced today also includes \nspecific floor amendments filed by Members from both sides of the aisle \nand a handful of additional new changes that we believe respond \ndirectly to concerns raised during the asbestos floor debate. The floor \namendments incorporated in this bill include, among others, the Kyl \n1.67 percent hardship amendment, Landrieu amendment on gulf coast \nhurricanes and World Trade Center victims, and Coburn amendment \nregarding B-readers.\n  Other changes made include measures that address the well-insured \ndefendant problem, and limitation on so called ``dormant claims'' that \nare barred from recovery through the Fund. For the benefit of my \ncolleagues and their staff, we will circulate a detailed section by \nsection summary of the bill early next week during the recess and an \nindex of key changes from the substitute. But for now, I would like to \nhighlight some of the additional features that I believe respond to \nconcerns raised by Members on both sides of the aisle:\n  Prompter Recovery for the Sickest Claimants: The new bill establishes \nsafeguards to protect ``gaming'' of the start-up process so that those \nclaimants that are the sickest receive prompt compensation. The bill \nalso authorizes the Administrator to begin receiving, reviewing and \ndeciding claims immediately following enactment of the FAIR Act. To \nensure that claims processing begins immediately, the Administrator \nalso is authorized to contract with entities experienced in claims \nprocessing on an expedited basis.\n  Stronger Medical Criteria: The new bill strengthens the medical \ncriteria by adopting numerous amendments and suggestions offered by Dr. \nCoburn that would authorize random audits of affidavits, clarify that a \nclaimant's diagnosis be made by a ``treating'' rather than ``examining \nphysician'', require claimants to provide detailed, specific and \ncredible affidavits as proof of significant asbestos exposure, and \ndisqualify certain plaintiffs' friendly B-readers from participating in \nclaims administration. The current tort system is riddled with fraud, \nstemming largely from the ``financially-motivated'' relationship \nbetween plaintiffs' attorneys and many of the doctors conducting \nmedical tests and screening. While S. 852 contained provisions which \naddressed this issue (e.g., specified criminal penalties for falsified \nclaims, 5 percent limit on attorneys' fees), these added measures \nprovide increased protection against fraudulent practices in \ndetermining the eligibility of a claimant for compensation under the \ntrust fund.\n  Preserves the Ability of Bankruptcy Trusts to Continue Paving \nImpaired Claims: The new bill allows existing bankruptcy trusts to \nretain at least 10 percent of their assets to continue paying pending \nimpaired claims during the Fund start-up period. This measure ensures \nthat impaired claimants receive compensation to pay medical bills while \npreventing such claimants from ``double-dipping'' by recovering more \nthan they would receive under the FAIR Act.\n  Improved Allocation Formula for Well-Insured and Financially Strapped \nDefendant Companies: Due to the inherent financial pressures that \ncontributions to the trust fund could impose on manufacturers, the new \nbill would provide for a much improved allocation formula for defendant \ncompanies who contribute to the Fund. It incorporates the Kyl 1.67 \npercent hardship amendment which allows companies to contribute \nannually 1.67 percent of their gross revenues in lieu of the tiering \nformula set forth in the bill. This measure is particularly helpful to \nthose smaller to medium size companies that are assigned to the higher \ncontribution tiers because of their significant asbestos liabilities. \nThe bill also incorporates a provision that addresses the often-heard \nproblem involving well insured defendants who currently pay little to \nno out-of-pocket costs in the tort system. Similar to the Kyl hardship \nprovision, this proposal would allow certain smaller to medium size \ncompanies to contribute to the Fund based on 5 percent of their \nadjusted cash flows rather than the amount specified in their assigned \ntier.\n\n  Tighter Control on So-Called ``Leakage'': The new bill further \naddresses the ``leakage'' issue by improving the start-up process to \nensure that exigent claims proceed through the trust fund rather than \nthe tort system. The new bill also closes significant loopholes to \nensure that preempted claims are not revived and prevents so-called \n``dormant claims'' (e.g., inactive claims in the tort system that are \nstill listed on court dockets) from being filed with the Fund.\n  The new bill remains both integrated and comprehensive and reflective \nof a remarkable will to enact legislation. This has become evident to \nme based on over a hundred meetings that I have personally had with \nMembers and staff on the asbestos problem. The Senate plainly wants a \nmore rational asbestos claims system, and I believe that this new \nlegislation offers a realistic prospect of accomplishing that result.\n  If this amended bill is rejected, I do not see the agenda of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee revisiting this issue. I cannot conceive of \na more strenuous effort being directed to this subject that has been \ndone over the past three years. Let me make clear that this is the last \nbest chance.\n  This said, I remain confident that during debate on the Senate floor, \nwe can forge and enact a bill that is fair to the claimants and to \nbusiness and that will put an end once and for all to this\n\n[[Page S5347]]\n\nnightmare chapter in American legal, economic and social history. If we \ncan summon the legislative will in a bipartisan spirit, it can be done. \nAnything less, would preserve the injustices of a system that even the \nhighest court of this country has called upon the Congress to fix.\n  Over the coming weeks, I plan on moving ahead with this bill and will \ndo everything in my power to see that the Senate finishes its business \non asbestos reform. The Judiciary Committee has worked too hard and too \nlong on this bill to see it all go to waste over a procedural and \ntechnical nuance. I urge the Leader to schedule time for this important \nlegislation in the coming months, and by introducing this bill today I \nam hopeful that we make a first big stride in that direction. The time \nis now for asbestos reform and any further delay by this body will only \nprolong the suffering of asbestos victims, companies and their \nemployees. I yield the floor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 3274\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Millions of Americans have been exposed to forms of \n     asbestos that can have devastating health effects.\n       (2) Various injuries can be caused by exposure to some \n     forms of asbestos, including pleural disease and some forms \n     of cancer.\n       (3) The injuries caused by asbestos can have latency \n     periods of up to 40 years, and even limited exposure to some \n     forms of asbestos may result in injury in some cases.\n       (4) Asbestos litigation has had a significant detrimental \n     effect on the country's economy, driving companies into \n     bankruptcy, diverting resources from those who are truly \n     sick, and endangering jobs and pensions.\n       (5) The scope of the asbestos litigation crisis cuts across \n     every State and virtually every industry.\n       (6) The United States Supreme Court has recognized that \n     Congress must act to create a more rational asbestos claims \n     system. In 1991, a Judicial Conference Ad Hoc Committee on \n     Asbestos Litigation, appointed by Chief Justice William \n     Rehnquist, found that the ``ultimate solution should be \n     legislation recognizing the national proportions of the \n     problem . . . and creating a national asbestos dispute \n     resolution scheme . . .''. The Court found in 1997 in Amchem \n     Products Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 595 (1997), that \n     ``[t]he argument is sensibly made that a nationwide \n     administrative claims processing regime would provide the \n     most secure, fair, and efficient means of compensating \n     victims of asbestos exposure''. In 1999, the Court in Ortiz \n     v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 819, 821 (1999), found that the \n     ``elephantine mass of asbestos cases . . . defies customary \n     judicial administration and calls for national legislation''. \n     That finding was again recognized in 2003 by the Court in \n     Norfolk & Western Railway Co. v. Ayers, 123 S. Ct. 1210 \n     (2003).\n       (7) This crisis, and its significant effect on the health \n     and welfare of the people of the United States, on interstate \n     and foreign commerce, and on the bankruptcy system, compels \n     Congress to exercise its power to regulate interstate \n     commerce and create this legislative solution in the form of \n     a national asbestos injury claims resolution program to \n     supersede all existing methods to compensate those injured by \n     asbestos, except as specified in this Act.\n       (8) This crisis has also imposed a deleterious burden upon \n     the United States bankruptcy courts, which have assumed a \n     heavy burden of administering complicated and protracted \n     bankruptcies with limited personnel.\n       (9) This crisis has devastated many communities across the \n     country, but hardest hit has been Libby, Montana, where \n     tremolite asbestos, 1 of the most deadly forms of asbestos, \n     was contained in the vermiculite ore mined from the area and \n     despite ongoing cleanup by the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, many still suffer from the deadly dust.\n       (10) The asbestos found in Libby, Montana, tremolite \n     asbestos, has demonstrated an unusually high level of \n     toxicity, as compared to chrysotile asbestos. Diseases \n     contracted from this tremolite asbestos are unique and highly \n     progressive. These diseases typically manifest in a \n     characteristic pleural disease pattern, and often result in \n     severe impairment or death without radiographic interstitial \n     disease or typical chrysotile markers of radiographic \n     severity. According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and \n     Disease Registry previous studies by the National Institutes \n     of Occupational Safety and Health document significantly \n     increased rates of pulmonary abnormalities and disease \n     (asbestosis and lung cancer) among former workers.\n       (11) Environmental Protection Agency supported studies have \n     determined that the raw vermiculite ore mined and milled in \n     Libby, Montana contained 21 to 26 percent asbestos, by \n     weight. The milled ore, resulting from the processing in \n     Libby, which was shipped out of Libby contained markedly \n     reduced percentages of asbestos. A 1982 Environmental \n     Protection Agency-supported study concluded that ore shipped \n     out of Libby contained 0.3 to 7 percent asbestos, by weight.\n       (12) In Libby, Montana, exposure pathways are and were not \n     limited to the workplace, rather, for decades there has been \n     an unprecedented 24 hour per day contamination of the \n     community's homes, playgrounds, gardens, and community air, \n     such that the entire community of Libby, Montana, has been \n     designated a Superfund site and is listed on the \n     Environmental Protection Agency's National Priorities List.\n       (13) These multiple exposure pathways have caused severe \n     asbestos disease and death not only in former workers at the \n     mine and milling facilities, but also in the workers' spouses \n     and children, and in community members who had no direct \n     contact\n\n[[Page S5348]]\n\n     with the mine. According to the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, some potentially important alternative pathways for \n     past asbestos exposure include elevated concentrations of \n     asbestos in ambient air and recreational exposures from \n     children playing in piles of vermiculite. Furthermore, the \n     Environmental Protection Agency has determined that current \n     potential pathways of exposure include vermiculite placed in \n     walls and attics as thermal insulation, vermiculite or ore \n     used as road bed material, ore used as ornamental \n     landscaping, and vermiculite or concentrated ore used as a \n     soil and garden amendment or aggregate in driveways.\n       (14) The Environmental Protection Agency also concluded, \n     ``Asbestos contamination exists in a number of potential \n     source materials at multiple locations in and around the \n     residential and commercial area of Libby. . . While data are \n     not yet sufficient to perform reliable human-health risk \n     evaluations for all sources and all types of disturbance, it \n     is apparent that releases of fiber concentrations higher than \n     Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards may \n     occur in some cases . . . and that screening-level estimates \n     of lifetime excess cancer risk can exceed the upper-bound \n     risk range of 1E-04 usually used by the Environmental \n     Protection Agency for residents under a variety of exposure \n     scenarios. The occurrence of nonoccupational asbestos-related \n     disease that has been observed among Libby residents is \n     extremely unusual, and has not been associated with asbestos \n     mines elsewhere, suggesting either very high and prolonged \n     environmental exposures and/or increased toxicity of this \n     form of amphibole asbestos.''.\n       (15) According to a November 2003 article from the Journal \n     Environmental Health Perspectives titled, Radiographic \n     Abnormalities and Exposure to Asbestos-Contaminated \n     Vermiculite in the Community of Libby, Montana, USA, Libby \n     residents who have evidence of ``no apparent exposure'', \n     i.e., did not work with asbestos, were not a family member of \n     a former worker, etc., had a greater rate of pleural \n     abnormalities (6.7 percent) than did those in control groups \n     or general populations found in other studies from other \n     states (which ranged from 0.2 percent to 4.6 percent). \n     ``Given the ubiquitous nature of vermiculite contamination in \n     Libby, along with historical evidence of elevated asbestos \n     concentrations in the air, it would be difficult to find \n     participants who could be characterized as unexposed.''.\n       (16) Nothing in this Act is intended to increase the \n     Federal deficit or impose any burden on the taxpayer. The \n     Office of Asbestos Disease Compensation established under \n     this Act shall be privately funded by annual payments from \n     defendant participants that have been subject to asbestos \n     liability and their insurers. Section 406(b) of this Act \n     expressly provides that nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to create any obligation of funding from the United \n     States or to require the United States to satisfy any claims \n     if the amounts in the Fund are inadequate. Any borrowing by \n     the Fund is limited to monies expected to be paid into the \n     Fund, and the Administrator shall have no fiscal authority \n     beyond the amount of private money coming into the Fund.

Such procedures, as provided in section \n     106(f), shall include, pending promulgation of final \n     regulations, adoption of interim regulations as needed for \n     processing of terminal health claims.\n       (2) Eligible terminal health claims.--A claim shall qualify \n     for treatment as a terminal health claim if--\n       (A) the claimant is living and provides a diagnosis of \n     mesothelioma meeting the requirements of section 121(d)(9);\n       (B) the claimant is living and provides a credible \n     declaration or affidavit, from a diagnosing physician who has \n     examined the claimant within 120 days before the date of such \n     declaration or affidavit, that the physician has diagnosed \n     the claimant as being terminally ill from an asbestos-related \n     illness and having a life expectancy of less than 1 year due \n     to such asbestos-related illness; or\n       (C) the claimant is the spouse or child of an eligible \n     terminal health claimant who--\n       (i) was living when the claim was filed with the Fund, or \n     if before the implementation of interim regulations for the \n     filing of claims with the Fund, on the date of enactment of \n     this Act;\n       (ii) has since died from a malignant disease or condition; \n     and\n       (iii) has not received compensation from the Fund for the \n     disease or condition for which the claim was filed.\n       (3) Additional terminal health claims.--The Administrator \n     may, in final regulations promulgated under section 101(c), \n     designate additional categories of claims that qualify as \n     terminal health claims under this subsection except that \n     exceptional medical claims may not proceed.\n       (4) Claims facility.--To facilitate the prompt payment of \n     terminal health claims prior to the Fund being certified as \n     operational, the Administrator shall contract with a claims \n     facility, which applying the medical criteria of section 121, \n     shall process and pay claims in accordance with section \n     106(f)(2). The processing and payment of claims shall be \n     subject to regulations promulgated under this Act.\n       (5) Authorization for contracts with claims facilities.--\n     The Administrator may enter into contracts with a claims \n     facility for the processing of claims (except for exceptional \n     medical claims) in accordance with this title.\n       (d) Prioritization of Claims.--The Administrator shall, in \n     final regulations promulgated under section 101(c), designate \n     categories of claims to be handled on an expedited basis.

If the claimant fails to perfect the claim \n     within that 30-day period or the Administrator or claims \n     facility determines that the claim does not meet the \n     requirements of a terminal health claim, the claim shall not \n     be eligible to proceed under this paragraph. A claimant may \n     appeal any decision issued by a claims facility with the \n     Administrator in accordance with section 114.\n\n       (vii) Failure to certify.--If the Administrator or claims \n     facility is unable to process the claim and does not make a \n     determination regarding the certification of the claim as \n     required under clause (vi), the Administrator or claims \n     facility shall within 10 days after the end of the 60-day \n     period referred to under clause (vi)(I) provide notice of the \n     failure to act to the claimant and the defendants in the \n     pending Federal or State court action or the defendants \n     identified under clause (iii)(IV).

The Administrator or claims facility shall list all \n     terminal health claims for which notice has been provided \n     under this clause on the website established under clause \n     (v).\n       (ix) Settlement offer.--Any participant or participants \n     may, within 30 days after receipt of such notice as provided \n     under clause (vii) or (viii), file and serve on all parties \n     and the Administrator a good faith settlement offer in an \n     aggregate amount not to exceed the total amount to which the \n     claimant would receive under section 131. If the aggregate \n     amount offered by all participants exceeds the award \n     determined by the Administrator, all offers shall be deemed \n     reduced pro rata until the aggregate amount equals the award \n     amount.

The court \n     shall approve any such accepted offer within 20 days after a \n     request, unless there is evidence of bad faith or fraud. No \n     court approval is necessary if the terminal health claim was \n     certified by the Administrator or claims facility under \n     clause (vi).\n       (x) Acceptance or rejection.--Within 20 days after receipt \n     of the settlement offer, or the amended settlement offer, the \n     claimant shall either accept or reject such offer in writing. \n     If the amount of the settlement offer made by the \n     Administrator, claims facility, or participants equals 100 \n     percent of what the claimant would receive under the Fund, \n     the claimant shall accept such settlement in writing.\n       (xi) Opportunity to cure.--If the settlement offer is \n     rejected for being less than what the claimant would receive \n     under the Fund, the participants shall have 10 business days \n     to make an amended offer. If the amended offer equals 100 \n     percent of what the claimant would receive under the Fund, \n     the claimant shall accept such settlement offer in writing. \n     If the settlement offer is again rejected as less than what \n     the claimant would receive under the Fund or if participants \n     fail to make an amended offer, the claimant shall recover 150 \n     percent of what the claimant would receive under the Fund. If \n     the amount of the amended settlement offer made by the \n     Administrator, claims facility, or participants equals 150 \n     percent of what the claimant would receive under the Fund, \n     the claimant shall accept such settlement in writing.\n       (xii) Payment schedule.--\n\n       (I) Mesothelioma claimants.--For mesothelioma claimants--\n\n       (aa) an initial payment of 50 percent shall be made within \n     30 days after the date the settlement is accepted and the \n     second and final payment shall be made 6 months after date \n     the settlement is accepted; or\n       (bb) if the Administrator determines that the payment \n     schedule would impose a severe financial hardship on the \n     Fund, or if the court determines that the settlement offer \n     would impose a severe financial hardship on the participant, \n     the payments may be extended 50 percent in 6 months and 50 \n     percent 11 months after the date the settlement offer is \n     accepted.\n\n       (II) Other terminal claimants.--For other terminal \n     claimants, as defined under section 106(c)(2)(B) and (C)--\n\n       (aa) the initial payment of 50 percent shall be made within \n     6 months after the date the settlement is accepted and the \n     second and final payment shall be made 12 months after date \n     the settlement is accepted; or\n       (bb) if the Administrator determines that the payment \n     schedule would impose a severe financial hardship on the \n     Fund, or if the court determines that the settlement offer \n     would impose a severe financial hardship on the participants, \n     the payments may be extended 50 percent within 1 year after \n     the\n\n[[Page S5353]]\n\n     date the settlement offer is accepted and 50 percent in 2 \n     years after date the settlement offer is accepted.\n\n       (III) Release.--Once a claimant has received final payment \n     of the accepted settlement offer, and penalty payment if \n     applicable, the claimant shall release any outstanding \n     asbestos claims.\n\n       (xiii) Recovery of costs.--\n\n       (I) In general.--Any participant whose settlement offer is \n     accepted may recover the cost of such settlement by deducting \n     from the participant's next and subsequent contributions to \n     the Fund the full amount of the payment made by such \n     participant to the terminal health claimant, unless the \n     Administrator finds, on the basis of clear and convincing \n     evidence, that the participant's offer is not in good faith. \n     Any such payment shall be considered a payment to the Fund \n     for purposes of section 404(e)(1) and in response to the \n     payment obligations imposed on participants in title II.\n       (II) Reimbursement.--Notwithstanding subclause (I), if the \n     deductions from the participant's next and subsequent \n     contributions to the Fund do not fully recover the cost of \n     such payments on or before its third annual contribution to \n     the Fund, the Fund shall reimburse such participant for such \n     remaining cost not later than 6 months after the date of the \n     third scheduled Fund contribution.\n\n       (xiv) Failure to make offer.--If participants fail to make \n     a settlement offer within the 30-day period described under \n     clause (ix) or make amended offers within the 10 business day \n     cure period described under clause (xi), the claimant shall \n     be entitled to recover 150 percent of what the claimant would \n     receive under the Fund before the stay being lifted under \n     subparagraph (B).\n       (xv) Failure to pay.--If a participant fails to pay an \n     accepted settlement offer within the payment schedule under \n     clause (xii), the claimant shall be entitled to recover 150 \n     percent of what the claimant would receive under the Fund \n     before the stay being lifted under subparagraph (B). If the \n     stay is lifted under subparagraph (B) the claimant may seek a \n     judgment or order for monetary damages from the court where \n     the case is currently pending or the appropriate Federal or \n     State court for claims arising after the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n       (B) Stay terminated and reversion to court.--If 9 months \n     after a terminal health claim has been filed under \n     subparagraph (A), a claimant has not received a settlement \n     under subparagraph (A)(xii) and the Administrator has not \n     certified to Congress that the Fund or claims facility is \n     operational and paying terminal health claims at a reasonable \n     rate, the stay of claim provided under paragraph (1) shall be \n     lifted and such terminal health claimant, may immediately \n     seek a judgment or order for monetary damages from the court \n     where the case is currently pending or the appropriate \n     Federal or State court for claims arising after the date of \n     enactment of this Act. If a claimant has failed to file a \n     claim or notice of intent to seek a settlement, as required \n     under subparagraph (A)(ii), the provisions of this \n     subparagraph shall not apply.\n       (C) Credit of claim and effect of operational fund.--\n       (i) Collateral source.--If an asbestos claim is pursued in \n     Federal or State court in accordance with this paragraph, any \n     recovery by the claimant shall be a collateral source \n     compensation for purposes of section 134.\n       (ii) Recovery of costs.--Any participant may recover the \n     cost of any claim continued in court for up to the amount the \n     claimant would receive under the Fund by deducting from the \n     participant's next and subsequent contributions to the Fund \n     for that amount of the payment made by such participant to \n     the terminal health claimant.\n       (3) Pursual of nonterminal asbestos claims in federal or \n     state court.--\n       (A) In general.--\n       (i) Pursual of claims.--Notwithstanding any other provision \n     of this Act, if not later than 24 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator cannot certify to \n     Congress that the Fund is operational and paying all valid \n     claims at a reasonable rate, any person with a nonterminal \n     asbestos claim stayed, except for any person whose claim does \n     not exceed a Level I claim, may pursue that claim in the \n     Federal district court (if the claim is otherwise within the \n     jurisdiction of the court) or State court located within--\n\n       (I) the State of residence of the claimant; or\n       (II) the State in which the asbestos exposure occurred.\n\n       (ii) Rule of construction.--This subparagraph shall not be \n     construed as creating a new Federal cause of action.\n       (B) Defendants not found.--If any defendant cannot be found \n     in the State described under subparagraph (A) (i) or (ii), \n     the claim may be pursued in the Federal district court or \n     State court located within any State in which the defendant \n     may be found.\n       (C) Determination of most appropriate forum.--If a person \n     alleges that the asbestos exposure occurred in more than 1 \n     county (or Federal district), the trial court shall determine \n     which State and county (or Federal district) is the most \n     appropriate forum for the claim. If the court determines that \n     another forum would be the most appropriate forum for a \n     claim, the court shall dismiss the claim. Any otherwise \n     applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled beginning \n     on the date the claim was filed and ending on the date the \n     claim is dismissed under this subparagraph.\n       (D) State venue requirements.--Nothing in this paragraph \n     shall preempt or supersede any State law relating to venue \n     requirements within that State which are more restrictive.\n       (E) Credit of claim and effect of operational or \n     nonoperational fund.--\n       (i) Credit of claim.--If an asbestos claim is pursued in \n     Federal or State court in accordance with this paragraph, any \n     recovery by the claimant shall be a collateral source \n     compensation for purposes of section 134.\n       (ii) Operational certification.--Operational certification \n     shall be a filing in the Federal Register confirming that the \n     Fund is capable of operating and paying all valid asbestos \n     claims at a reasonable rate.\n       (iii) Operational preconditions.--\n\n       (I) The Administrator may not issue a operational \n     certification until--\n\n       (aa) 60 days after the funding allocation information \n     required under section 221(e) has been published in the \n     Federal Register; and\n       (bb) insurers subject to section 212(a)(3) submit their \n     names and information to the Administrator within 30 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act and 60 days after the \n     Administrator publishes such information in the Federal \n     Register.\n       (iv) Operational fund.--If the Administrator issues an \n     operational certification and notifies Congress that the Fund \n     has become operational and paying all valid asbestos claims \n     at a reasonable rate, any nonterminal asbestos claim in a \n     civil action in Federal or State court that is not on trial \n     before a jury which has been impaneled and presentation of \n     evidence has commenced, but before its deliberation, or \n     before a judge and is at the presentation of evidence shall \n     be deemed a reinstated claim against the Fund and the civil \n     action before the Federal or State court shall be null and \n     void.\n       (v) Nonoperational fund.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, if the Administrator subsequently \n     issues a nonoperational certification and notifies Congress \n     that the Fund is unable to become operational and pay all \n     valid asbestos claims at a reasonable rate, all asbestos \n     claims have been stayed or not filed may be filed or \n     reinstated in the appropriate Federal or State court.\n       (4) Reservation of rights.--Except as otherwise provided in \n     this Act, participation in the offer and settlement process \n     under this subsection shall not affect or prejudice any \n     rights or defenses a party might have in any litigation.\n\n     SEC. 107.

GENERAL RULE CONCERNING NO-FAULT COMPENSATION.\n\n       An asbestos claimant shall not be required to demonstrate \n     that the asbestos-related injury for which the claim is being \n     made resulted from the negligence or other fault of any other \n     person.\n\n     SEC. 113. FILING OF CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) Who May Submit.--\n       (1) In general.--Any individual who has suffered from a \n     disease or condition that is believed to meet the \n     requirements established under subtitle C (or the personal \n     representative of the individual, if the individual is \n     deceased or incompetent) may file a claim with the Office for \n     an award with respect to such injury.\n       (2) Definition.--In this Act, the term ``personal \n     representative'' shall have the same meaning as that term is \n     defined in section 104.4 of title 28 of the Code of Federal \n     Regulations, as in effect on December 31, 2004.\n       (3) Limitation.--A claim may not be filed by any person \n     seeking contribution or indemnity.\n       (4) Effect of multiple injuries.--\n       (A) In general.--A claimant who receives an award for an \n     eligible disease or condition shall not be precluded from \n     submitting claims for and receiving additional awards under \n     this title for any higher disease level for which the \n     claimant becomes eligible, subject to appropriate setoffs as \n     provided under section 134.\n       (B) Libby, montana claims.--\n       (i) In general.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if a \n     Libby, Montana claimant worsens in condition, as measured by \n     pulmonary function tests, such that a claimant qualifies for \n     a higher nonmalignant level, the claimant shall be eligible \n     for an additional award, at the appropriate level, offset by \n     any award previously paid under this Act,\n\n[[Page S5354]]\n\n     such that a claimant would qualify for Level IV if the \n     claimant satisfies section 121(f)(8), and would qualify for \n     Level V if the claimant provides--\n\n       (I) a diagnosis of bilateral asbestos related nonmalignant \n     disease;\n       (II) evidence of TLC or FVC less than 60 percent;

ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS AND CLAIM AWARDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Review of claims.--The Administrator shall, in \n     accordance with this section, determine whether each claim \n     filed under the Fund or claims facility satisfies the \n     requirements for eligibility for an award under this Act and, \n     if so, the value of the award. In making such determinations, \n     the Administrator shall consider the claim presented by the \n     claimant, the factual and medical evidence submitted by the \n     claimant in support of the claim, the medical determinations \n     of any Physicians Panel to which a claim is referred under \n     section 121, and the results of such investigation as the \n     Administrator may deem necessary to determine whether the \n     claim satisfies the criteria for eligibility established by \n     this Act.\n       (2) Additional evidence.--The Administrator may request the \n     submission of medical evidence in addition to the minimum \n     requirements of section 113(c) if necessary or appropriate to \n     make a determination of eligibility for an award, in which \n     case the cost of obtaining such additional information or \n     testing shall be borne by the Office.\n       (b) Proposed Decisions.--Not later than 90 days after the \n     filing of a claim, the Administrator shall provide to the \n     claimant (and the claimant's representative) a proposed \n     decision accepting or rejecting the claim in whole or in part \n     and specifying the amount of the proposed award, if any. The \n     proposed decision shall be in writing, shall contain findings \n     of fact and conclusions of law, and shall contain an \n     explanation of the procedure for obtaining review of the \n     proposed decision.\n       (c) Payments if No Timely Proposed Decision.--If the \n     Administrator has received a complete claim and, after the \n     Fund has been certified subject to section 106(f)(3)(E) has \n     not provided a proposed decision to the claimant under \n     subsection (b) within 180 days after the filing of the claim, \n     the claim shall be deemed accepted and the claimant shall be \n     entitled to payment under section 133(a)(2). If the \n     Administrator subsequently rejects the claim the claimant \n     shall receive no further payments under section 133. If the \n     Administrator subsequently rejects the claim in part, the \n     Administrator shall adjust future payments due the claimant \n     under section 133 accordingly. In no event may the \n     Administrator recover amounts properly paid under this \n     section from a claimant.\n       (d) Review of Proposed Decisions.--\n       (1) Right to hearing.--\n       (A) In general.--Any claimant not satisfied with a proposed \n     decision of the Administrator under subsection (b) shall be \n     entitled, on written request made within 90 days after the \n     date of the issuance of the decision, to a hearing on the \n     claim of that claimant before a representative of the \n     Administrator. At the hearing, the claimant shall be entitled \n     to present oral evidence and written testimony in further \n     support of that claim.\n       (B) Conduct of hearing.--When practicable, the hearing will \n     be set at a time and place convenient for the claimant. In \n     conducting the hearing, the representative of the \n     Administrator shall not be bound by common law or statutory \n     rules of evidence, by technical or formal rules of procedure, \n     or by section 554 of title 5, United States Code, except as \n     provided by this Act, but shall conduct the hearing in such \n     manner as to best ascertain the rights of the claimant. For \n     this purpose, the representative shall receive\n\n[[Page S5355]]\n\n     such relevant evidence as the claimant adduces and such other \n     evidence as the representative determines necessary or useful \n     in evaluating the claim.\n       (C) Request for subpoenas.--\n       (i) In general.--A claimant may request a subpoena but the \n     decision to grant or deny such a request is within the \n     discretion of the representative of the Administrator. The \n     representative may issue subpoenas for the attendance and \n     testimony of witnesses, and for the production of books, \n     records, correspondence, papers, or other relevant documents. \n     Subpoenas are issued for documents only if such documents are \n     relevant and cannot be obtained by other means, and for \n     witnesses only where oral testimony is the best way to \n     ascertain the facts.\n       (ii) Request.--A claimant may request a subpoena only as \n     part of the hearing process. To request a subpoena, the \n     requester shall--\n\n       (I) submit the request in writing and send it to the \n     representative as early as possible, but no later than 30 \n     days after the date of the original hearing request; and\n       (II) explain why the testimony or evidence is directly \n     relevant to the issues at hand, and a subpoena is the best \n     method or opportunity to obtain such evidence because there \n     are no other means by which the documents or testimony could \n     have been obtained.\n\n       (iii) Fees and mileage.--Any person required by such \n     subpoena to attend as a witness shall be allowed and paid the \n     same fees and mileage as are paid witnesses in the district \n     courts of the United States. Such fees and mileage shall be \n     paid from the Fund.\n       (2) Review of written record.--In lieu of a hearing under \n     paragraph (1), any claimant not satisfied with a proposed \n     decision of the Administrator shall have the option, on \n     written request made within 90 days after the date of the \n     issuance of the decision, of obtaining a review of the \n     written record by a representative of the Administrator.

If such decision materially differs from the \n     proposed decision, the claimant shall be entitled to review \n     of the decision under subsection (d).\n       (2) Time and content.--If the claimant requests review of \n     all or part of the proposed decision the Administrator shall \n     issue a final decision on the claim not later than 180 days \n     after the request for review is received, if the claimant \n     requests a hearing, or not later than 90 days after the \n     request for review is received, if the claimant requests \n     review of the written record. Such decision shall be in \n     writing and contain findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n       (f) Representation.--A claimant may authorize an attorney \n     or other individual to represent him or her in any proceeding \n     under this Act.\n\n     SEC. 115.

or\n       (II) if the claimant is deceased, a coworker or a family \n     member of the claimant; and\n\n       (ii) is found in proceedings under this title to be--\n\n       (I) reasonably reliable, attesting to the claimant's \n     exposure; and\n       (II) credible and not contradicted by other evidence.\n\n       (B) Other proof.--Exposure to asbestos may alternatively be \n     established by invoices, construction or other similar \n     records, or any other reasonably reliable and credible \n     evidence.\n       (C) Additional evidence.--The Administrator may require \n     submission of other or additional evidence of exposure, if \n     available, for a particular claim when determined necessary, \n     as part of the minimum information required under section \n     113(c).\n       (D) Evaluation.--The Administrator shall prescribe \n     procedures to randomly evaluate the affidavits submitted to \n     satisfy the exposure requirements for any disease level.\n       (3) Take home exposure.--\n       (A) In general.--A claimant may alternatively satisfy the \n     medical criteria requirements of this section where a claim \n     is filed by a person who alleges their exposure to asbestos \n     was the result of living with a person who, if the claim had \n     been filed by that person, would have met the exposure \n     criteria for the given disease level, and the claimant lived \n     with such person for the time period necessary to satisfy the \n     exposure requirement, for the claimed disease level.\n       (B) Review.--Except for claims for disease Level IX \n     (mesothelioma), all claims alleging take home exposure shall \n     be submitted as an exceptional medical claim under section \n     121(g) for review by a Physicians Panel.\n       (4) Waiver for workers and residents of libby, montana.--\n     Because of the unique nature of the asbestos exposure related \n     to the vermiculite mining and milling operations in Libby, \n     Montana, the Administrator shall waive the exposure \n     requirements under this subtitle for individuals who worked \n     at the vermiculite mining and milling facility in Libby, \n     Montana, or lived or worked within a 20-mile radius of Libby, \n     Montana, for at least 12 consecutive months before December \n     31,\n\n[[Page S5357]]\n\n     2004. Claimants under this section shall provide such \n     supporting documentation as the Administrator shall require.\n       (5) Exposure presumptions.--\n       (A) In general.--The Administrator shall prescribe rules \n     identifying specific industries, occupations within such \n     industries, and time periods in which workers employed in \n     those industries and occupations typically had substantial \n     occupational exposure to asbestos as defined under section \n     121(a). Until 5 years after the Administrator certifies that \n     the Fund is paying claims at a reasonable rate, the \n     industries, occupations and time periods identified by the \n     Administrator shall at a minimum include those identified in \n     the 2002 Trust Distribution Process of the Manville Personal \n     Injury Settlement Trust as of January 1, 2005, as industries, \n     occupations, including proximity, and time periods in which \n     workers were presumed to have had significant occupational \n     exposure to asbestos. Thereafter, the Administrator may by \n     rule modify or eliminate those exposure presumptions required \n     to be adopted from the Manville Personal Injury Settlement \n     Trust, if there is evidence that demonstrates that the \n     typical exposure for workers in such industries and \n     occupations during such time periods did not constitute \n     substantial occupational exposure in asbestos.\n       (B) Claimants entitled to presumptions.--Any claimant who \n     demonstrates through meaningful and credible evidence that \n     such claimant was employed during relevant time periods in \n     industries and occupations identified under subparagraph (A) \n     shall be entitled to a presumption that the claimant had \n     substantial occupational exposure to asbestos during those \n     time periods.

ASSESSMENT ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Payment.--Each defendant participant or affiliated \n     group shall pay to the Fund in the amounts provided under \n     this subtitle as appropriate for its tier and subtier each \n     year until the earlier to occur of the following:\n       (A) The participant or affiliated group has satisfied its \n     obligations under this subtitle during the 30 annual payment \n     cycles of the operation of the Fund.\n       (B) The amount received by the Fund from defendant \n     participants, excluding any amounts rebated to defendant \n     participants under subsections (d) and (m), equals the \n     maximum aggregate payment obligation of section 202(a)(2).\n       (2) Limitation.--\n       (A) Definition.--In this paragraph, the term ``affiliated \n     group'' shall include any defendant participant that is an \n     ultimate parent.\n       (B) In general.--For any affiliated group, the total \n     payment in any year, including any guaranteed payment \n     surcharge under subsection (l) and any bankruptcy trust \n     guarantee surcharge under section 222(c), shall not exceed \n     the lesser of $16,702,400 or 1.67024 percent of the revenues \n     of the affiliated group for the most recent fiscal year \n     ending on or before December 31, 2002, or for the most recent \n     12-month fiscal year as of the date the limitation is \n     applied, whichever is greater.\n       (C) Exception.--The limitation in this paragraph shall not \n     apply to defendant participants in Tier I or to any \n     affiliated group whose revenues for the most recent fiscal \n     year ending on or before December 31, 2002, or for the most \n     recent 12-month fiscal year as of the date the limitation \n     applied, whichever is greater, exceeds $1,000,000,000.\n       (D) Determinations.--The revenues of the affiliated group \n     shall be determined in accordance with section 203(a)(2), \n     except for the applicable date. An affiliated group that \n     claims a reduction in its payment in any year shall file with \n     the Administrator, in accordance with procedures prescribed \n     by the Administrator, sufficient information to allow the \n     Administrator to determine the amount of any such reduction \n     in that year. If as a result of the application of the \n     limitation provided in this paragraph an affiliated group is \n     exempt from paying all or part of a guaranteed payment \n     surcharge or bankruptcy trust surcharge, then the reduction \n     in the affiliated group's payment obligation due to the \n     limitation in this subsection shall be redistributed in \n     accordance with subsection (l).\n       (E) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this paragraph shall \n     be construed as reducing the minimum aggregate annual payment \n     obligation of defendant participants as provided under \n     subsection (h).\n       (b) Small Business Exemption.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this subtitle, a person or affiliated group that \n     is a small business concern (as defined under section 3 of \n     the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632)), on December 31, \n     2002, is exempt from any payment requirement under this \n     subtitle and shall not be included in the subtier allocations \n     under section 203.\n       (c) Procedures.--The Administrator shall prescribe \n     procedures on how amounts payable under this subtitle are to \n     be paid, including, to the extent the Administrator \n     determines appropriate, procedures relating to payment in \n     installments.\n       (d) Adjustments.--\n       (1) In general.--Under expedited procedures established by \n     the Administrator, a defendant participant may seek \n     adjustment of the amount of its payment obligation based on \n     severe financial hardship or demonstrated inequity. The \n     Administrator may determine whether to grant an adjustment \n     and the size of any such adjustment, in accordance with this \n     subsection. A defendant participant has a right to obtain a \n     rehearing of the Administrator's determination under this \n     subsection under the procedures prescribed in subsection \n     (i)(10). The Administrator may adjust a defendant \n     participant's payment obligations under this subsection, \n     either by forgiving the relevant portion of the otherwise \n     applicable payment obligation or by providing relevant \n     rebates from the defendant hardship and inequity adjustment \n     account created under subsection (j) after payment of the \n     otherwise applicable payment obligation, at the discretion of \n     the Administrator.\n       (2) Financial hardship adjustments.--\n       (A) In general.--Any defendant participant in any tier may \n     apply for an adjustment under this paragraph at any time \n     during the period in which a payment obligation to the Fund \n     remains outstanding and may qualify for such an adjustment by \n     demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Administrator that \n     the amount of its payment obligation would materially and \n     adversely affect the defendant participant's ability to \n     continue its business and to pay or satisfy its debts \n     generally as and when they come due. Such an adjustment shall \n     be in an amount that in the judgment of the Administrator is \n     reasonably necessary to prevent such material and adverse \n     effect on the defendant participant's ability to continue its \n     business and to pay or satisfy its debts generally as and \n     when they come due.\n       (B) Factors to consider.--In determining whether to make an \n     adjustment under subparagraph (A) and the amount thereof, the \n     Administrator shall consider--\n       (i) the financial situation of the defendant participant \n     and its affiliated group as shown in historical audited \n     financial statements, including income statement, balance \n     sheet, and statement of cash flow, for the 3 fiscal years \n     ending immediately before the application and projected \n     financial statements for the 3 fiscal years following the \n     application;\n       (ii) an analysis of capital spending and fixed charge \n     coverage on a historical basis for the 3 fiscal years \n     immediately preceding a defendant participant's application \n     and for the 3 fiscal years following the application;\n       (iii) any payments or transfers of property made, or \n     obligations incurred, within the preceding 6 years by the \n     defendant participant to or for the benefit of any insider as \n     defined under section 101(31) of title 11, United States \n     Code, or any affiliate as defined under section 101(2) of \n     title 11, United States Code;\n       (iv) any prior extraordinary transactions within the \n     preceding 6 years involving the defendant participant, \n     including payments of extraordinary salaries, bonuses, or \n     dividends;\n       (v) the defendant participant's ability to satisfy its \n     payment obligation to the Fund by borrowing or financing with \n     equity capital, or through issuance of securities of the \n     defendant participant or its affiliated group to the Fund;\n       (vi) the defendant participant's ability to delay \n     discretionary capital spending; and\n       (vii) any other factor that the Administrator considers \n     relevant.\n       (C) Term.--A financial hardship adjustment under this \n     paragraph shall have a term of 5 years unless the \n     Administrator determines at the time the adjustment is made \n     that a shorter or longer period is appropriate in the light \n     of the financial condition of the defendant participant and \n     its affiliated group and other relevant factors, provided \n     that a financial hardship adjustment under this paragraph \n     shall terminate automatically in the event that the defendant \n     participant holding the adjustment files a petition under \n     title 11, United States Code.\n       (D) Renewal.--A defendant participant may renew a hardship \n     adjustment upon expiration by demonstrating that it remains \n     justified. Such renewed hardship adjustments shall have a \n     term of 5 years unless the Administrator determines at the \n     time of the renewed adjustment that a shorter or longer \n     period is appropriate in light of the financial condition of \n     the defendant participant and its affiliated group and other \n     relevant factors. A renewed financial hardship adjustment \n     under this paragraph shall terminate automatically in the \n     event that the defendant participant holding the adjustment \n     files a petition under title 11, United States Code.\n       (E) Procedure.--\n       (i) In general.--The Administrator shall prescribe the \n     information to be submitted in applications for adjustments \n     under this paragraph.\n       (ii) Financial information.--All audited financial \n     information required under this paragraph shall be as \n     reported by the defendant participant in its annual report \n     filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in \n     accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 \n     U.S.C. 78a et seq.). Any defendant participant that does not \n     file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission or \n     which does not have audited financial statements shall submit \n     financial statements prepared in accordance with generally \n     accepted accounting principles. The chairman, chief executive \n     officer, and chief financial officer of the defendant \n     participant shall certify under penalty of law the \n     completeness and accuracy of the financial statements \n     provided under this subparagraph.\n       (iii) Certification.--The chairman, chief executive \n     officer, and chief financial officer of the defendant \n     participant shall certify that any projected information and \n     analyses submitted to the Administrator were made in good \n     faith and are reasonable and attainable.\n       (3) Inequity adjustments.--\n       (A) In general.--A defendant participant--\n       (i) may qualify for an adjustment based on inequity by \n     demonstrating that the amount of its payment obligation under \n     the statutory allocation is exceptionally inequitable--\n\n       (I) when measured against the amount of the likely cost to \n     the defendant participant net of insurance of its future \n     liability in the tort system in the absence of the Fund;\n       (II) when measured against the likely cost of past and \n     potential future claims in the absence of this Act;\n       (III) when compared to the median payment rate for all \n     defendant participants in the same tier; or\n       (IV) when measured against the percentage of the prior \n     asbestos expenditures of the defendant that were incurred \n     with respect to claims that neither resulted in an adverse \n     judgment against the defendant, nor were the subject of a \n     settlement that required a\n\n[[Page S5365]]\n\n     payment to a plaintiff by or on behalf of that defendant;\n\n       (ii) shall qualify for a 2-tier main tier and a 2-tier \n     subtier adjustment reducing the defendant participant's \n     payment obligation based on inequity by demonstrating that \n     not less than 95 percent of such person's prior asbestos \n     expenditures arose from claims related to the manufacture and \n     sale of railroad locomotives and related products, so long as \n     such person's manufacture and sale of railroad locomotives \n     and related products is temporally and causally remote, and \n     for purposes of this clause, a person's manufacture and sale \n     of railroad locomotives and related products shall be deemed \n     to be temporally and causally remote if the asbestos claims \n     historically and generally filed against such person relate \n     to the manufacture and sale of railroad locomotives and \n     related products by an entity dissolved more than 25 years \n     before the date of enactment of this Act;\n       (iii) shall be granted a 2-tier adjustment reducing the \n     defendant participant's payment obligation based on inequity \n     by demonstrating that not less than 95 percent of such \n     participant's prior asbestos expenditures arose from asbestos \n     claims based on successor liability arising from a merger to \n     which the participant or its predecessor was a party that \n     occurred at least 30 years before the date of enactment of \n     this Act, and that such prior asbestos expenditures exceed \n     the inflation-adjusted value of the assets of the company \n     from which such liability was derived in such merger, and \n     upon such demonstration the Administrator shall grant such \n     adjustment for the life of the Fund and amounts paid by such \n     defendant participant prior to such adjustment in excess of \n     its adjusted payment obligation under this clause shall be \n     credited against next succeeding required payment \n     obligations; and\n       (iv) may, subject to the discretion of the Administrator, \n     be exempt from any payment obligation if such defendant \n     participant establishes with the Administrator that--\n\n       (I) such participant has satisfied all past claims; and\n       (II) there is no reasonable likelihood in the absence of \n     this Act of any future claims with costs for which the \n     defendant participant might be responsible.\n\n       (B) Guidelines.--\n       (i) In general.--In determining which defendant \n     participants may receive inequity adjustments, the \n     Administrator shall give preference in the following order:\n\n       (I) Defendant participants that have significant insurance \n     coverage applicable to asbestos claims, such that on the date \n     of enactment of this Act, 80 percent or more of their \n     available primary insurance limits for asbestos claims \n     remains available.\n       (II) Defendant participants for which, under the guidance \n     in section 404(a)(2)(E), 75 percent of the prior asbestos \n     expenditures of such defendant participants were caused by or \n     arose from premise liability claims.\n       (III) Defendant participants that can demonstrate that \n     their prior asbestos expenditures are inflated due to an \n     unusually large, anomalous verdict and that such verdict has \n     caused such defendants to be in a higher tier.\n       (IV) Any other factor determined reasonable by the \n     Administrator to have caused a serious inequity.\n\n       (ii) Consideration.--In determining whether a defendant \n     participant has significant insurance coverage applicable to \n     asbestos claims such that on the date of enactment of this \n     Act, 80 percent or more of their available primary insurance \n     limits for asbestos claims remains available, the \n     Administrator shall inquire and consider--\n\n       (I) the defendant participant's expected future liability \n     in the tort system and the adequacy of insurance available \n     measured against future liability; and\n       (II) whether the insurance coverage is uncontested, or \n     based on a final judgment or settlement.\n\n       (C) Payment rate.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), the \n     payment rate of a defendant participant is the payment amount \n     of the defendant participant as a percentage of such \n     defendant participant's gross revenues for the year ending \n     December 31, 2002.\n       (D) Term.--Subject to the annual availability of funds in \n     the defendant inequity adjustment account established under \n     subsection (j), an inequity adjustment under this subsection \n     shall have a term of 3 years.\n       (E) Renewal.--A defendant participant may renew an inequity \n     adjustment every 3 years by demonstrating that the adjustment \n     remains justified.\n       (F) Reinstatement.--\n       (i) In general.--Following the termination of an inequity \n     adjustment under subparagraph (A), and during the funding \n     period prescribed under subsection (a), the Administrator \n     shall annually determine whether there has been a material \n     change in conditions which would support a finding that the \n     amount of the defendant participant's payment under the \n     statutory allocation was not inequitable. Based on this \n     determination, the Administrator may, consistent with the \n     policies and legislative intent underlying this Act, \n     reinstate any or all of the payment obligations of the \n     defendant participant as if the inequity adjustment had not \n     been granted for that 3-year period.\n       (ii) Terms and conditions.--In the event of a reinstatement \n     under clause (i), the Administrator may require the defendant \n     participant to pay any part or all of amounts not paid due to \n     the inequity adjustment on such terms and conditions as \n     established by the Administrator.\n       (4) Tier ii adjustments for well-insured defendant \n     participants.--\n       (A) Definitions.--In this paragraph--\n       (i) the term ``adjusted cash flow from operating \n     activities'' means audited cash flows from operating \n     activities as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards \n     Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95 in \n     effect on the date of enactment of this Act, adjusted for \n     amounts--\n\n       (I) increased by cash paid for interest and taxes to the \n     extent that such amounts are included in cash flows from \n     operating activities;\n       (II) increased by payments made for asbestos indemnity, \n     defense costs, and any payments required under this Act, to \n     the extent that such amounts are included in cash flows from \n     operating activities;\n       (III) increased by nonrecurring and unusual cash charges, \n     including restructuring charges and other non-operating \n     costs, to the extent that such amounts are included in cash \n     flows from operating activities;\n       (IV) decreased by cash distributions to minority interests \n     to the extent that such amounts are included in cash flows \n     from investing activities and cash flows from financing \n     activities;\n       (V) increased by cash proceeds on sales of assets net of \n     related secured debt, affiliates, subsidiaries, and \n     investments to the extent that such amounts are included in \n     cash flows from investing and cash flows from financing \n     activities;\n       (VI) increased by cash distributions from nonconsolidated \n     affiliates and investments to the extent that such amounts \n     are included in cash flows from investing activities and cash \n     flows from financing activities;\n       (VII) increased by net cash flow used by, and decreased by \n     net cash flow gained from, working capital items to the \n     extent such amounts are not already adjusted under this \n     subparagraph and are included in cash flows from operating \n     activities;\n       (VIII) increased by net cash flow used by, and decreased by \n     net cash flow gained from, other nonworking capital assets \n     and liabilities, to the extent such amounts are not already \n     adjusted under this subparagraph and are included in cash \n     flows from operating activities;\n       (IX) decreased by reimbursements or cash proceeds received \n     from asbestos insurance policies for related expenses, to the \n     extent that such amounts are included in cash flows from \n     operating activities; and\n       (X) decreased by other nonoperating cash income; and\n\n       (ii) the term ``working capital'' means current assets \n     (excluding cash and short-term investments) less current \n     liabilities (excluding short-term debt).\n       (B) Election of alternative adjustment.--Except for \n     defendant participants that consent to be assigned to Tier II \n     under section 204(i)(7)(A), a defendant participant assigned \n     to subtier 3, 4, or 5 of Tier II may elect the adjustment \n     under this paragraph, which shall apply instead of an \n     adjustment under paragraph (3).\n       (C) Adjustment.--Subject to subparagraphs (D) and (E), the \n     annual payment obligation, taking into consideration the \n     limitation under subsection (a)(2), of any defendant \n     participant that elects the adjustment under this paragraph \n     shall be adjusted so as not to exceed the greater of $500,000 \n     or 5 percent of that defendant participant's adjusted cash \n     flow from operating activities for the most recent fiscal \n     year ending on or before December 31, 2002, or for the most \n     recent fiscal year.\n       (D) Limitation.--The aggregate total of adjustments under \n     this paragraph in any year may not exceed $100,000,000. If \n     the aggregate amount of adjustments authorized under this \n     paragraph exceeds $100,000,000, the adjustment to which each \n     defendant participant electing such an adjustment shall be \n     reduced pro rata until the aggregate of all adjustments \n     equals $100,000,000.\n       (E) Surcharges.--Defendant participants receiving an \n     adjustment under this paragraph shall also be subject to the \n     guaranteed payment surcharge under subsection (m) and the \n     bankruptcy trust surcharge under section 222(c). Such \n     surcharges shall be based on the full amount of any \n     adjustment to which the defendant participant would be \n     entitled under subparagraph (C) without regard to the \n     limitation under subparagraph (D).\n       (5) Limitation on adjustments.--The aggregate total of \n     inequity adjustments under paragraph (3) in effect in any \n     given year shall not exceed $200,000,000, except to the \n     extent that additional monies are available for such \n     adjustments as a result of carryover of prior years' funds \n     under subsection (j)(3) or as a result of monies being made \n     available in that year under subsection (k)(1)(A).\n       (6) Rulemaking and advisory panels.--\n       (A) Appointment.--The Administrator may appoint a Financial \n     Hardship Adjustment Panel and an Inequity Adjustment Panel to \n     advise the Administrator in carrying out this subsection.\n       (B) Membership.--The membership of the panels appointed \n     under subparagraph (A) may overlap.\n       (C) Coordination.--The panels appointed under subparagraph \n     (A) shall coordinate their deliberations and advice.\n       (D) Rules.--The Administrator may adopt rules consistent \n     with this Act to make the determination of hardship and \n     inequity adjustments more efficient and predictable.\n       (e) Limitation on Liability.--The liability of each \n     defendant participant to pay to the Fund shall be limited to \n     the payment obligations under this Act, and, except as \n     provided\n\n[[Page S5366]]\n\n     in subsection (f) and section 203(b)(2)(D), no defendant \n     participant shall have any liability for the payment \n     obligations of any other defendant participant.\n       (f) Consolidation of Payments.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of determining the payment \n     levels of defendant participants, any affiliated group \n     including 1 or more defendant participants may irrevocably \n     elect, as part of the submissions to be made under paragraphs \n     (1) and (3) of subsection (i), to report on a consolidated \n     basis all of the information necessary to determine the \n     payment level under this subtitle and pay to the Fund on a \n     consolidated basis.\n       (2) Election.--If an affiliated group elects consolidation \n     as provided in this subsection--\n       (A) for purposes of this Act other than this subsection, \n     the affiliated group shall be treated as if it were a single \n     participant, including with respect to the assessment of a \n     single annual payment under this subtitle for the entire \n     affiliated group;\n       (B) the ultimate parent of the affiliated group shall \n     prepare and submit each submission to be made under \n     subsection (i) on behalf of the entire affiliated group and \n     shall be solely liable, as between the Administrator and the \n     affiliated group only, for the payment of the annual amount \n     due from the affiliated group under this subtitle, except \n     that, if the ultimate parent does not pay when due any \n     payment obligation for the affiliated group, the \n     Administrator shall have the right to seek payment of all or \n     any portion of the entire amount due (as well as any other \n     amount for which the affiliated group may be liable under \n     sections 223 and 224) from any member of the affiliated \n     group;\n       (C) all members of the affiliated group shall be identified \n     in the submission under subsection (i) and shall certify \n     compliance with this subsection and the Administrator's \n     regulations implementing this subsection; and\n       (D) the obligations under this subtitle shall not change \n     even if, after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     beneficial ownership interest between any members of the \n     affiliated group shall change.\n       (3) Cause of action.--Notwithstanding section 221(e), this \n     Act shall not preclude actions among persons within an \n     affiliated group with respect to the payment obligations \n     under this Act.\n       (g) Determination of Prior Asbestos Expenditures.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of determining a defendant \n     participant's prior asbestos expenditures, the Administrator \n     shall prescribe such rules as may be necessary or appropriate \n     to assure that payments by indemnitors before December 31, \n     2002, shall be counted as part of the indemnitor's prior \n     asbestos expenditures, rather than the indemnitee's prior \n     asbestos expenditures, in accordance with this subsection.\n       (2) Indemnifiable costs.--If an indemnitor has paid or \n     reimbursed to an indemnitee any indemnifiable cost or \n     otherwise made a payment on behalf of or for the benefit of \n     an indemnitee to a third party for an indemnifiable cost \n     before December 31, 2002, the amount of such indemnifiable \n     cost shall be solely for the account of the indemnitor for \n     purposes under this Act.\n       (3) Insurance payments.--When computing the prior asbestos \n     expenditures with respect to an asbestos claim, any amount \n     paid or reimbursed by insurance shall be solely for the \n     account of the indemnitor, even if the indemnitor would have \n     no direct right to the benefit of the insurance, if--\n       (A) such insurance has been paid or reimbursed to the \n     indemnitor or the indemnitee, or paid on behalf of or for the \n     benefit of the indemnitee; and\n       (B) the indemnitor has either, with respect to such \n     asbestos claim or any similar asbestos claim, paid or \n     reimbursed to its indemnitee any indemnifiable cost or paid \n     to any third party on behalf of or for the benefit of the \n     indemnitee any indemnifiable cost.\n       (4) Treatment of certain expenditures.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of this Act, where--\n       (A) an indemnitor entered into a stock purchase agreement \n     in 1988 that involved the sale of the stock of businesses \n     that produced friction and other products; and\n       (B) the stock purchase agreement provided that the \n     indemnitor indemnified the indemnitee and its affiliates for \n     losses arising from various matters, including asbestos \n     claims--\n       (i) asserted before the date of the agreement; and\n       (ii) filed after the date of the agreement and prior to the \n     10-year anniversary of the stock sale,\n\n     then the prior asbestos expenditures arising from the \n     asbestos claims described in clauses (i) and (ii) shall not \n     be for the account of either the indemnitor or indemnitee.\n       (h) Minimum Annual Payments.--\n       (1) In general.--The aggregate annual payments of defendant \n     participants to the Fund shall be at least $3,000,000,000 for \n     each calendar year in the first 30 years of the Fund, or \n     until such shorter time as the condition set forth in \n     subsection (a)(2) is attained.\n       (2) Guaranteed payment account.--To the extent payments in \n     accordance with sections 202 and 203 (as modified by \n     subsections (b), (d), (f), (g), and (m) of this section) fail \n     in any year to raise at least $3,000,000,000, after \n     applicable reductions or adjustments have been taken \n     according to subsections (d) and (m), the balance needed to \n     meet this required minimum aggregate annual payment shall be \n     obtained from the defendant guaranteed payment account \n     established under subsection (k).\n       (3) Guaranteed payment surcharge.--To the extent the \n     procedure set forth in paragraph (2) is insufficient to \n     satisfy the required minimum aggregate annual payment, after \n     applicable reductions or adjustments have been taken \n     according to subsections (d) and (m), the Administrator shall \n     unless the Administrator implements a funding holiday under \n     section 205(b), assess a guaranteed payment surcharge under \n     subsection (l).\n       (i) Procedures for Making Payments.--\n       (1) Initial year: tiers ii-vi.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 90 days after enactment of \n     this Act, each defendant participant that is included in \n     Tiers II, III, IV, V, or VI shall file with the \n     Administrator--\n       (i) a statement of whether the defendant participant \n     irrevocably elects to report on a consolidated basis under \n     subsection (f);\n       (ii) a good-faith estimate of its prior asbestos \n     expenditures;\n       (iii) a statement of its 2002 revenues, determined in \n     accordance with section 203(a)(2);\n       (iv) payment in the amount specified in section 203 for the \n     lowest subtier of the tier within which the defendant \n     participant falls, except that if the defendant participant, \n     or the affiliated group including the defendant participant, \n     had 2002 revenues exceeding $3,000,000,000, it or its \n     affiliated group shall pay the amount specified for Subtier 3 \n     of Tiers II, III, or IV or Subtier 2 of Tiers V or VI, \n     depending on the applicable Tier; and\n       (v) a signature page personally verifying the truth of the \n     statements and estimates described under this subparagraph, \n     as required under section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of \n     2002 (15 U.S.C. 7201 et seq.).\n       (B) Relief.--\n       (i) In general.--The Administrator shall establish \n     procedures to grant a defendant participant relief from its \n     initial payment obligation if the participant shows that--\n\n       (I) the participant is likely to qualify for a financial \n     hardship adjustment; and\n       (II) failure to provide interim relief would cause severe \n     irreparable harm.\n\n       (ii) Judicial relief.--The Administrator's refusal to grant \n     relief under clause (i) is subject to immediate judicial \n     review under section 303.\n       (2) Initial year: tier i.--Not later than 60 days after \n     enactment of this Act, each debtor shall file with the \n     Administrator--\n       (A) a statement identifying the bankruptcy case(s) \n     associated with the debtor;\n       (B) a statement whether its prior asbestos expenditures \n     exceed $1,000,000;\n       (C) a statement whether it has material continuing business \n     operations and, if not, whether it holds cash or other assets \n     that have been allocated or earmarked for asbestos \n     settlements;\n       (D) in the case of debtors falling within Subtier 1 of Tier \n     I--\n       (i) a statement of the debtor's 2002 revenues, determined \n     in accordance with section 203(a)(2);

and\n       (B) publish in the Federal Register a notice--\n       (i) setting forth the criteria in this Act, and as \n     prescribed by the Administrator in accordance with this Act, \n     for paying under this subtitle as a defendant participant and \n     requiring any person who may be a defendant participant to \n     submit such information; and\n       (ii) that includes a list of all defendant participants \n     notified by the Administrator under subparagraph (A), and \n     provides for 30 days for the submission by the public of \n     comments or information regarding the completeness and \n     accuracy of the list of identified defendant participants.\n       (5) Response required.--\n       (A) In general.--Any person who receives notice under \n     paragraph (4)(A), and any other person meeting the criteria \n     specified in the notice published under paragraph (4)(B), \n     shall provide the Administrator with an address to send any \n     notice from the Administrator in accordance with this Act and \n     all\n\n[[Page S5367]]\n\n     the information required by the Administrator in accordance \n     with this subsection no later than the earlier of--\n       (i) 30 days after the receipt of direct notice;

If the amount that the \n     defendant participant is required to pay is less than any \n     previous payment made by the participant under this \n     subsection, the Administrator shall credit any excess payment \n     against the future payment obligations of that defendant \n     participant. The pendency of a petition for rehearing under \n     paragraph (10) shall not stay the obligation of the \n     participant to make the payment specified in the \n     Administrator's notice.\n       (7) Exemptions for information required.--\n       (A) Prior asbestos expenditures.--In lieu of submitting \n     information related to prior asbestos expenditures as may be \n     required for purposes of this subtitle, a nondebtor defendant \n     participant may consent to be assigned to Tier II.\n       (B) Revenues.--In lieu of submitting information related to \n     revenues as may be required for purposes of this subtitle, a \n     nondebtor defendant participant may consent to be assigned to \n     Subtier 1 of the defendant participant's applicable tier.\n       (8) New information.--\n       (A) Existing participant.--The Administrator shall adopt \n     procedures for requiring additional payment, or refunding \n     amounts already paid, based on new information received.\n       (B) Additional participant.--If the Administrator, at any \n     time, receives information that an additional person may \n     qualify as a defendant participant, the Administrator shall \n     require such person to submit information necessary to \n     determine whether that person is required to make payments, \n     and in what amount, under this subtitle and shall make any \n     determination or take any other act consistent with this Act \n     based on such information or any other information available \n     to the Administrator with respect to such person.\n       (9) Subpoenas.--The Administrator may request the Attorney \n     General to subpoena persons to compel testimony, records, and \n     other information relevant to its responsibilities under this \n     section. The Attorney General may enforce such subpoena in \n     appropriate proceedings in the United States district court \n     for the district in which the person to whom the subpoena was \n     addressed resides, was served, or transacts business.\n       (10) Rehearing.--A defendant participant has a right to \n     obtain rehearing of the Administrator's determination under \n     this subsection of the applicable tier or subtier of the \n     Administrator's determination under subsection (d) of a \n     financial hardship or inequity adjustment, and of the \n     Administrator's determination under subsection (m) of a \n     distributor's adjustment, if the request for rehearing is \n     filed within 30 days after the defendant participant's \n     receipt of notice from the Administrator of the \n     determination. A defendant participant may not file an action \n     under section 303 unless the defendant participant requests a \n     rehearing under this paragraph. The Administrator shall \n     publish a notice in the Federal Register of any change in a \n     defendant participant's tier or subtier assignment or payment \n     obligation as a result of a rehearing.\n       (j) Defendant Inequity Adjustment Account.--\n       (1) In general.--To the extent the total payments by \n     defendant participants in any given year exceed the minimum \n     aggregate annual payments required under subsection (h), \n     excess monies up to a maximum of $200,000,000 in any such \n     year shall be placed in a defendant inequity adjustment \n     account established within the Fund by the Administrator.\n       (2) Use of account monies.--Monies from the defendant \n     inequity adjustment account shall be preserved and \n     administered like the remainder of the Fund, but shall be \n     reserved and may be used only--\n       (A) to make up for any relief granted to a defendant \n     participant for demonstrated inequity under subsection (d) or \n     to reimburse any defendant participant granted such relief \n     after its payment of the amount otherwise due; and\n       (B) if the condition set forth in subsection (a)(2) is met, \n     for any purpose that the Fund may serve under this Act.\n       (3) Carryover of unused funds.--To the extent the \n     Administrator does not, in any given year, use all of the \n     funds allocated to the account under paragraph (1) for \n     adjustments granted under subsection (d), remaining funds in \n     the account shall be carried forward for use by the \n     Administrator for adjustments in subsequent years.\n       (k) Defendant Guaranteed Payment Account.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to subsections (h) and (j), if \n     there are excess monies paid by defendant participants in any \n     given year, including any bankruptcy trust credits that may \n     be due under section 222(d), such monies--\n       (A) at the discretion of the Administrator, may be used to \n     provide additional adjustments under subsection (d), up to a \n     maximum aggregate of $50,000,000 in such year; and\n       (B) to the extent not used under subparagraph (A), shall be \n     placed in a defendant guaranteed payment account established \n     within the Fund by the Administrator.\n       (2) Use of account monies.--Monies from the defendant \n     guaranteed payment account shall be preserved and \n     administered like the remainder of the Fund, but shall be \n     reserved and may be used only--\n       (A) to ensure the minimum aggregate annual payment required \n     under subsection (h), after applicable reductions or \n     adjustments have been taken according to subsections (d) and \n     (m) is reached each year; and\n       (B) if the condition set forth in subsection (a)(2) is met, \n     for any purpose that the Fund may serve under this Act.\n       (l) Guaranteed Payment Surcharge.--\n       (1) In general.--To the extent there are insufficient \n     monies in the defendant guaranteed payment account \n     established in subsection (k) to attain the minimum aggregate \n     annual payment required under subsection (h) in any given \n     year, the Administrator shall, unless the Administrator \n     implements a funding holiday under section 205(b), impose on \n     each defendant participant a surcharge as necessary to raise \n     the balance required to attain the minimum aggregate annual \n     payment required under subsection (h) as provided in this \n     subsection. Any such surcharge shall be imposed on a pro rata \n     basis, in accordance with each defendant participant's \n     relative annual liability under sections 202 and 203 (as \n     modified by subsections (b), (d), (f), (g), and (m) of this \n     section).\n       (2) Limitation.--\n       (A) Definition.--In this paragraph, the term ``economically \n     distressed industry'' means an industry, defined by a primary \n     5-digit NAICS code, wherein 2 or more defendant participants \n     are in Subtier 1 of Tier II under sections 202 and 203, and \n     at least \\2/3\\ of such Tier II defendant participants \n     suffered net operating losses in their United States \n     manufacturing business in 2005.\n       (B) In general.--In no case shall the Administrator--\n       (i) impose a surcharge under this subsection on any \n     defendant participant included in Subtier 3 of Tier V or VI \n     as described under section 203; or\n       (ii) notwithstanding paragraph (1), impose in any year a \n     surcharge under this subsection on any defendant participant \n     in an economically distressed industry in excess of 15 \n     percent of the amount set forth for Subtier 1 of Tier II \n     defendant participants under section 203(c)(2)(A).\n       (C) Reallocation.--Any amount not imposed under \n     subparagraph (B) shall be reallocated on a pro rata basis, in \n     accordance with each defendant participant's (other than a \n     defendant participant described under subparagraph (B) \n     relative annual liability under sections 202 and 203 (as \n     modified by subsections (b), (d), (f), and (g) of this \n     section).\n       (3) Certification.--\n       (A) In general.--Before imposing a guaranteed payment \n     surcharge under this subsection, the Administrator shall \n     certify that he or she has used all reasonable efforts to \n     collect mandatory payments for all defendant participants, \n     including by using the authority in subsection (i)(9) of this \n     section and section 223.\n       (B) Notice and comment.--Before making a final \n     certification under subparagraph (C), the Administrator shall \n     publish a notice in the Federal Register of a proposed \n     certification and provide in such notice for a public comment \n     period of 30 days.\n       (C) Final certification.--\n       (i) In general.--The Administrator shall publish a notice \n     of the final certification in the Federal Register after \n     consideration of\n\n[[Page S5368]]\n\n     all comments submitted under subparagraph (B).\n       (ii) Written notice.--Not later than 30 days after \n     publishing any final certification under clause (i), the \n     Administrator shall provide each defendant participant with \n     written notice of that defendant participant's payment, \n     including the amount of any surcharge.\n       (m) Adjustments for Distributors.--\n       (1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term \n     ``distributor'' means a person--\n       (A) whose prior asbestos expenditures arise exclusively \n     from the sale of products manufactured by others;\n       (B) who did not prior to December 31, 2002, sell raw \n     asbestos or a product containing more than 95 percent \n     asbestos by weight;\n       (C) whose prior asbestos expenditures did not arise out \n     of--\n       (i) the manufacture, installation, repair, reconditioning, \n     maintaining, servicing, constructing, or remanufacturing of \n     any product;\n       (ii) the control of the design, specification, or \n     manufacture of any product; or\n       (iii) the sale or resale of any product under, as part of, \n     or under the auspices of, its own brand, trademark, or \n     service mark; and\n       (D) who is not subject to assignment under section 202 to \n     Tier I, II, III or VII.\n       (2) Tier reassignment for distributors.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding section 202, the \n     Administrator shall assign a distributor to a Tier for \n     purposes of this title under the procedures set forth in this \n     paragraph.\n       (B) Designation.--After a final determination by the \n     Administrator under section 204(i), any person who is, or any \n     affiliated group in which every member is, a distributor may \n     apply to the Administrator for adjustment of its Tier \n     assignment under this subsection. Such application shall be \n     prepared in accordance with such procedures as the \n     Administrator shall promulgate by rule. Once the \n     Administrator designates a person or affiliated group as a \n     distributor under this subsection, such designation and the \n     adjustment of tier assignment under this subsection are \n     final.\n       (C) Payments.--Any person or affiliated group that seeks \n     adjustment of its Tier assignment under this subsection shall \n     pay all amounts required of it under this title until a final \n     determination by the Administrator is made under this \n     subsection. Such payments may not be stayed pending any \n     appeal. The Administrator shall grant any person or \n     affiliated group a refund or credit of any payments made if \n     such adjustment results in a lower payment obligation.\n       (D) Adjustment.--Subject to paragraph (3), any person or \n     affiliated group that the Administrator has designated as a \n     distributor under this subsection shall be given an \n     adjustment of Tier assignment as follows:\n       (i) A distributor that but for this subsection would be \n     assigned to Tier IV shall be deemed assigned to Tier V.\n       (ii) A distributor that but for this subsection would be \n     assigned to Tier V shall be deemed assigned to Tier VI.\n       (iii) A distributor that but for this subsection would be \n     assigned to Tier VI shall be deemed assigned to no Tier and \n     shall have no obligation to make any payment to the Fund \n     under this Act.\n       (E) Exclusive to inequity adjustment.--Any person or \n     affiliated group designated by the Administrator as a \n     distributor under this subsection shall not be eligible for \n     an inequity adjustment under subsection 204(d).\n       (3) Limitation on adjustments.--The aggregate total of \n     distributor adjustments under this subsection in effect in \n     any given year shall not exceed $50,000,000. If the aggregate \n     total of distributors adjustments under this subsection would \n     otherwise exceed $50,000,000, then each distributor's \n     adjustment shall be reduced pro rata until the aggregate of \n     all adjustments equals $50,000,000.\n       (4) Rehearing.--A defendant participant has a right to \n     obtain a rehearing of the Administrator's determination on an \n     adjustment under this subsection under the procedures \n     prescribed in subsection (i)(10).\n\n     SEC. 205. STEPDOWNS AND FUNDING HOLIDAYS.\n\n       (a) Stepdowns.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Reduction.--Subject to paragraph (2), the minimum \n     aggregate annual funding obligation under section 204(h) \n     shall be reduced by 10 percent of the initial minimum \n     aggregate funding obligation at the end of the 10th, 15th, \n     20th, and 25th years after the date of enactment of this Act. \n     Except as provided under subparagraph (B), the reductions \n     under this paragraph shall be applied on an equal pro rata \n     basis to the funding obligations of all defendant \n     participants.\n       (B) Calculation.--The reductions under this subsection \n     shall not apply to defendant participants in Tier I, Subtiers \n     2 and 3, and class action trusts. For defendant participants \n     whose payment obligation has been limited under section \n     204(a)(2) or who have received a financial hardship \n     adjustment under section 204(d)(2), aggregate potential \n     reductions under this subsection shall be calculated on the \n     basis of the defendant participant's tier and subtier without \n     regard to such limitation or adjustment. If the aggregate \n     potential reduction under this subsection exceeds the \n     reduction in the defendant participant's payment obligation \n     due to the limitation under section 204(a)(2) and the \n     financial hardship adjustment under section 204(d)(2), then \n     the defendant participant's payment obligation shall be \n     further reduced by the difference between the potential \n     reduction provided under this subsection and the reductions \n     that the defendant participant has already received due to \n     the application of the limitation provided in section \n     204(a)(2) and the financial hardship adjustment provided \n     under section 204(d)(2). If the reduction in the defendant \n     participant's payment obligation due to the limitation \n     provided in section 204(a)(2) and any financial hardship \n     adjustment provided under section 204(d)(2) exceeds the \n     amount of the reduction provided in this subsection, then the \n     defendant participant's payment obligation shall not be \n     further reduced under this paragraph.\n       (2) Limitation.--The Administrator shall suspend, cancel, \n     reduce, or delay any reduction under paragraph (1) if at any \n     time the Administrator finds, in accordance with subsection \n     (c), that such action is necessary and appropriate to ensure \n     that the assets of the Fund and expected future payments \n     remain sufficient to satisfy the Fund's anticipated \n     obligations.\n       (b) Funding Holidays.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Administrator determines, at any \n     time after 10 years following the date of enactment of this \n     Act, that the assets of the Fund at the time of such \n     determination and expected future payments, taking into \n     consideration any reductions under subsection (a), are \n     sufficient to satisfy the Fund's anticipated obligations \n     without the need for all, or any portion of, that year's \n     payment otherwise required under this subtitle, the \n     Administrator shall reduce or waive all or any part of the \n     payments required from defendant participants for that year.\n       (2) Annual review.--The Administrator shall undertake the \n     review required by this subsection and make the necessary \n     determination under paragraph (1) every year.\n       (3) Limitations on funding holidays.--\n       (A) In general.--Except as provided under subparagraph (B), \n     any reduction or waiver of the defendant participants' \n     funding obligations shall--\n       (i) be made only to the extent the Administrator determines \n     that the Fund will still be able to satisfy all of its \n     anticipated obligations; and\n       (ii) be applied on an equal pro rata basis to the funding \n     obligations of all defendant participants, except with \n     respect to defendant participants in Subtiers 2 and 3 of Tier \n     I and class action trusts, for that year.\n       (B) Calculation.--The reductions or waivers provided under \n     this subsection shall not apply to defendant participants in \n     Tier I, Subtiers 2 and 3, and class action trusts. For \n     defendant participants whose payment obligation has been \n     limited under section 204(a)(2) or who have received a \n     financial hardship adjustment under section 204(d)(2), \n     aggregate potential reductions under this subsection shall be \n     calculated on the basis of the defendant participant's tier \n     and subtier without regard to such limitation or adjustment. \n     If the aggregate potential reductions or waivers under this \n     subsection exceed the reduction in the defendant \n     participant's payment obligation due to the limitation under \n     section 204(a)(2) and the financial hardship adjustment under \n     section 204(d)(2), then the defendant participant's payment \n     obligation shall be further reduced by the difference between \n     the potential reductions or waivers provided under this \n     subsection and the reductions that the defendant participant \n     has already received due to the application of the limitation \n     provided in section 204(a)(2) and the financial hardship \n     adjustment provided under section 204(d)(2). If the reduction \n     in the defendant participant's payment obligation due to the \n     limitation provided in section 204(a)(2) and any of the \n     financial hardship adjustment provided under section \n     204(d)(2) exceeds the amount of the reductions or waivers \n     provided in this subsection, then the defendant participant's \n     payment obligation shall not be further reduced under this \n     paragraph.\n       (4) New information.--If at any time the Administrator \n     determines that a reduction or waiver under this section may \n     cause the assets of the Fund and expected future payments to \n     decrease to a level at which the Fund may not be able to \n     satisfy all of its anticipated obligations, the Administrator \n     shall revoke all or any part of such reduction or waiver to \n     the extent necessary to ensure that the Fund's obligations \n     are met. Such revocations shall be applied on an equal pro \n     rata basis to the funding obligations of all defendant \n     participants, except defendant participants in Subtiers 2 and \n     3 of Tier I and class action trusts, for that year.\n       (c) Certification.--\n       (1) In general.--Before suspending, canceling, reducing, or \n     delaying any reduction under subsection (a) or granting or \n     revoking a reduction or waiver under subsection (b), the \n     Administrator shall certify that the requirements of this \n     section are satisfied.\n       (2) Notice and comment.--Before making a final \n     certification under this subsection, the Administrator shall \n     publish a notice in the Federal Register of a proposed \n     certification and a statement of the basis therefor and \n     provide in such notice for a public comment period of 30 \n     days.\n       (3) Final certification.--\n       (A) In general.--The Administrator shall publish a notice \n     of the final certification in the Federal Register after \n     consideration of all comments submitted under paragraph (2).\n       (B) Written notice.--Not later than 30 days after \n     publishing any final certification under subparagraph (A), \n     the Administrator shall provide each defendant participant \n     with written notice of that defendant's funding obligation \n     for that year.\n\n[[Page S5369]]\n\n     SEC. 206. ACCOUNTING TREATMENT.\n\n       Defendant participants payment obligations to the Fund \n     shall be subject to discounting under the applicable \n     accounting guidelines for generally accepted accounting \n     purposes and statutory accounting purposes for each defendant \n     participant. This section shall in no way reduce the amount \n     of monetary payments to the Fund by defendant participants as \n     required under section 202(a)(2).\n\n                Subtitle B--Asbestos Insurers Commission\n\n     SEC. 210. DEFINITION.\n\n       In this subtitle, the term ``captive insurance company'' \n     means a company--\n       (1) whose entire beneficial interest is owned on the date \n     of enactment of this Act, directly or indirectly, by a \n     defendant participant or by the ultimate parent or the \n     affiliated group of a defendant participant;\n       (2) whose primary commercial business during the period \n     from calendar years 1940 through 1986 was to provide \n     insurance to its ultimate parent or affiliated group, or any \n     portion of the affiliated group or a combination thereof; and\n       (3) that was incorporated or operating no later than \n     December 31, 2003.\n\n     SEC. 211. ESTABLISHMENT OF ASBESTOS INSURERS COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established the Asbestos \n     Insurers Commission (referred to in this subtitle as the \n     ``Commission'') to carry out the duties described in section \n     212.\n       (b) Membership.--\n       (1) Appointment.--The Commission shall be composed of 5 \n     members who shall be appointed by the President, by and with \n     the advice and consent of the Senate.\n       (2) Qualifications.--\n       (A) Expertise.--Members of the Commission shall have \n     sufficient expertise to fulfill their responsibilities under \n     this subtitle.\n       (B) Conflict of interest.--\n       (i) In general.--No member of the Commission appointed \n     under paragraph (1) may be an employee or immediate family \n     member of an employee of an insurer participant. No member of \n     the Commission shall be a shareholder of any insurer \n     participant. No member of the Commission shall be a former \n     officer or director, or a former employee or former \n     shareholder of any insurer participant who was such an \n     employee, shareholder, officer, or director at any time \n     during the 2-year period ending on the date of the \n     appointment, unless that is fully disclosed before \n     consideration in the Senate of the nomination for appointment \n     to the Commission.\n       (ii) Definition.--In clause (i), the term ``shareholder'' \n     shall not include a broadly based mutual fund that includes \n     the stocks of insurer participants as a portion of its \n     overall holdings.\n       (C) Federal employment.--A member of the Commission may not \n     be an officer or employee of the Federal Government, except \n     by reason of membership on the Commission.\n       (3) Period of appointment.--Members shall be appointed for \n     the life of the Commission.\n       (4) Vacancies.--Any vacancy in the Commission shall be \n     filled in the same manner as the original appointment.\n       (5) Chairman.--The President shall select a Chairman from \n     among the members of the Commission.\n       (c) Meetings.--\n       (1) Initial meeting.--Not later than 30 days after the date \n     on which all members of the Commission have been appointed, \n     the Commission shall hold its first meeting.\n       (2) Subsequent meetings.--The Commission shall meet at the \n     call of the Chairman, as necessary to accomplish the duties \n     under section 212.\n       (3) Quorum.--No business may be conducted or hearings held \n     without the participation of a majority of the members of the \n     Commission.\n\n     SEC. 212. DUTIES OF ASBESTOS INSURERS COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Determination of Insurer Payment Obligations.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Definitions.--For the purposes of this Act, the terms \n     ``insurer'' and ``insurer participant'' shall, unless stated \n     otherwise, include direct insurers and reinsurers, as well as \n     any run-off entity established, in whole or in part, to \n     review and pay asbestos claims.\n       (B) Procedures for determining insurer payments.--\n       (i) Amount of payments.--The Commission shall determine the \n     amount that each insurer participant shall be required to pay \n     into the Fund under the procedures described in this section. \n     The Commission shall make the determination by first \n     promulgating a rule establishing a methodology for allocation \n     of payments among insurer participants and then applying such \n     methodology to determine the individual payment for each \n     insurer participant. The methodology shall be uniform for all \n     insurer participants.\n       (ii) Reserve study required.--The Commission shall conduct \n     a reserve study (the ``Reserve Study'') to determine the \n     appropriate reserve allocation of each insurer participant \n     and may request information from each insurer participant, \n     defendant participant, the Securities and Exchange Commission \n     or any State regulatory agency for the purpose of conducting \n     the Reserve Study. The Reserve Study shall calculate each \n     insurer's exposure to current and future asbestos claims in \n     the asbestos litigation environment before the date of \n     enactment of this Act. Such calculation shall be derived from \n     the following elements:\n\n       (I) An estimation of each defendant participant's current \n     and future exposure to expense and loss costs in the asbestos \n     litigation environment before the date of enactment of this \n     Act (``Ultimate Expense and Loss'').\n       (II) The application of a uniform set of assumptions \n     regarding the application of insurance and reinsurance to \n     Ultimate Expense and Loss and an analysis of each insurer \n     participant's unresolved or unexhausted insurance or \n     reinsurance coverage applicable to such Ultimate Expense and \n     Loss for each defendant participant;\n       (III) A projection of each insurer's exposure to claims by \n     entities that had not yet become defendants as of the date of \n     enactment of this Act, but might reasonably have been \n     anticipated to become defendants in the future if the \n     asbestos litigation environment before the date of enactment \n     of this Act had continued. Not later than 60 days after the \n     initial meeting of the Commission, the Commission shall \n     commence a rulemaking proceeding under section 213(a) to \n     propose and adopt a methodology for conducting the Reserve \n     Study and allocating payments among insurer participants on \n     the basis of the Reserve Study. Such methodology shall be \n     consistent with this subparagraph.\n\n       (iii) Permitted extrapolation of ultimate expense and loss \n     for peripheral defendant participants.--The Commission may \n     establish an appropriate methodology to extrapolate Ultimate \n     Expense and Loss for Tier VI defendant participants for the \n     purposes of the Reserve Study. Considerations for such \n     methodology shall include the nature of that Tier VI \n     defendant participant's asbestos liability, the number of \n     pending and historic asbestos claims against the Tier VI \n     defendant participant, and the jurisdictions in which such \n     Tier VI defendant participant had been sued for asbestos \n     liability.\n       (iv) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subparagraph \n     shall affect the initial payment requirement in section \n     212(e)(1).\n       (C) Scope.--Every insurer, reinsurer, and runoff entity \n     with asbestos-related obligations in the United States shall \n     be subject to the Commission's and Administrator's authority \n     under this Act, including allocation determinations, and \n     shall be required to fulfill its payment obligation without \n     regard as to whether it is licensed in the United States. \n     Every insurer participant not licensed or domiciled in the \n     United States shall, upon the first payment to the Fund, \n     submit a written consent to the Commission's and \n     Administrator's authority under this Act, and to the \n     jurisdiction of the courts of the United States for purposes \n     of enforcing this Act, in a form determined by the \n     Administrator. Any insurer participant refusing to provide a \n     written consent shall be subject to fines and penalties as \n     provided in section 223.\n       (D) Issuers of finite risk policies.--\n       (i) In general.--The issuer of any policy of retrospective \n     reinsurance purchased by an insurer participant or its \n     affiliate after 1990 that provides for a risk or loss \n     transfer to insure for asbestos losses and other losses (both \n     known and unknown), including those policies commonly \n     referred to as ``finite risk'', ``aggregate stop loss'', \n     ``aggregate excess of loss'', or ``loss portfolio transfer'' \n     policies, shall be obligated to make payments required under \n     this Act directly to the Fund on behalf of the insurer \n     participant who is the beneficiary of such policy, subject to \n     the underlying retention and the limits of liability \n     applicable to such policy.\n       (ii) Payments.--Payments to the Fund required under this \n     Act shall be treated as loss payments for asbestos bodily \n     injury (as if such payments were incurred as liabilities \n     imposed in the tort system) and shall not be subject to \n     exclusion under policies described under clause (i) as a \n     liability with respect to tax or assessment. Within 90 days \n     after the scheduled date to make an annual payment to the \n     Fund, the insurer participant shall, at its discretion, \n     direct the reinsurer issuing such policy to pay all or a \n     portion of the annual payment directly to the Fund up to the \n     full applicable limits of liability under the policy. The \n     reinsurer issuing such policy shall be obligated to make such \n     payments directly to the Fund and shall be subject to the \n     enforcement provisions under section 223. The insurer \n     participant shall remain obligated to make payment to the \n     Fund of that portion of the annual payment not directed to \n     the issuer of such reinsurance policy.\n       (2) Amount of payments.--\n       (A) Aggregate payment obligation.--The total payment \n     required of all insurer participants over the life of the \n     Fund shall be equal to $46,025,000,000, less any bankruptcy \n     trust credits under section 222(d).\n       (B) Accounting standards.--In determining the payment \n     obligations of participants that are not licensed or \n     domiciled in the United States or that are runoff entities, \n     the Commission shall use accounting standards required for \n     United States licensed direct insurers.\n       (C) Captive insurance companies.--No payment to the Fund \n     shall be required from a captive insurance company, unless \n     and only to the extent a captive insurance company, on the \n     date of enactment of this Act, insures the asbestos \n     liability, directly or indirectly, of (and that arises out of \n     the manufacture, sale, distribution or installation of \n     materials or products by, or other conduct of) a person or \n     persons other than and unaffiliated with its ultimate parent \n     or affiliated group or pool in which the ultimate parent \n     participates or participated, or unaffiliated with a person \n     that was its ultimate parent or\n\n[[Page S5370]]\n\n     a member of its affiliated group or pool at the time the \n     relevant insurance or reinsurance was issued by the captive \n     insurance company.\n       (D) Several liability.--Unless otherwise provided under \n     this Act, each insurer participant's obligation to make \n     payments to the Fund is several. Unless otherwise provided \n     under this Act, there is no joint liability, and the future \n     insolvency by any insurer participant shall not affect the \n     payment required of any other insurer participant.\n       (3) Payment of criteria.--\n       (A) Inclusion in insurer participant category.--\n       (i) In general.--Insurers that have paid, or been assessed \n     by a legal judgment or settlement, at least $1,000,000 in \n     defense and indemnity costs before the date of enactment of \n     this Act in response to claims for compensation for asbestos \n     injuries arising from a policy of liability insurance or \n     contract of liability reinsurance or retrocessional \n     reinsurance shall be insurer participants in the Fund. Other \n     insurers shall be exempt from mandatory payments.\n       (ii) Inapplicability of section 202.--Since insurers may be \n     subject in certain jurisdictions to direct action suits, and \n     it is not the intent of this Act to impose upon an insurer, \n     due to its operation as an insurer, payment obligations to \n     the Fund in situations where the insurer is the subject of a \n     direct action, no insurer subject to mandatory payments under \n     this section shall also be liable for payments to the Fund as \n     a defendant participant under section 202.\n       (B) Insurer participant allocation methodology.--\n       (i) In general.--The Commission shall establish the payment \n     obligations of individual insurer participants to reflect, on \n     an equitable basis, the relative tort system liability of the \n     participating insurers in the absence of this Act, \n     considering and weighting, as appropriate (but exclusive of \n     workers' compensation), such factors as--\n\n       (I) historic premium for lines of insurance associated with \n     asbestos exposure over relevant periods of time;\n       (II) recent loss experience for asbestos liability;\n       (III) amounts reserved for asbestos liability;\n       (IV) the likely cost to each insurer participant of its \n     future liabilities under applicable insurance policies; and\n       (V) any other factor the Commission may determine is \n     relevant and appropriate.\n\n       (ii) Determination of reserves.--The Commission may \n     establish procedures and standards for determination of the \n     asbestos reserves of insurer participants. The reserves of a \n     United States licensed reinsurer that is wholly owned by, or \n     under common control of, a United States licensed direct \n     insurer shall be included as part of the direct insurer's \n     reserves when the reinsurer's financial results are included \n     as part of the direct insurer's United States operations, as \n     reflected in footnote 33 of its filings with the National \n     Association of Insurance Commissioners or in published \n     financial statements prepared in accordance with generally \n     accepted accounting principles.\n       (C) Payment schedule.--The aggregate annual amount of \n     payments by insurer participants over the life of the Fund \n     shall be as follows:\n       (i) For years 1 and 2, $2,700,000,000 annually.\n       (ii) For years 3 through 5, $5,075,000,000 annually.\n       (iii) For years 6 through 27, $1,147,000,000 annually.\n       (iv) For year 28, $166,000,000.\n       (D) Certain runoff entities.--A runoff entity shall include \n     any direct insurer or reinsurer whose asbestos liability \n     reserves have been transferred, directly or indirectly, to \n     the runoff entity and on whose behalf the runoff entity \n     handles or adjusts and, where appropriate, pays asbestos \n     claims.\n       (E) Financial hardship and exceptional circumstance \n     adjustments.--\n       (i) In general.--Under the procedures established in \n     subsection (b), an insurer participant may seek adjustment of \n     the amount of its payments based on exceptional circumstances \n     or severe financial hardship.\n       (ii) Financial adjustments.--An insurer participant may \n     qualify for an adjustment based on severe financial hardship \n     by demonstrating that payment of the amounts required by the \n     Commission's methodology would jeopardize the solvency of \n     such participant.\n       (iii) Exceptional circumstance adjustment.--An insurer \n     participant may qualify for an adjustment based on \n     exceptional circumstances by demonstrating--\n\n       (I) that the amount of its payments under the Commission's \n     allocation methodology is exceptionally inequitable when \n     measured against the amount of the likely cost to the \n     participant of its future liability in the tort system in the \n     absence of the Fund;\n       (II) an offset credit as described in subparagraphs (A) and \n     (C) of subsection (b)(4); or\n       (III) other exceptional circumstances.\n\n     The Commission may determine whether to grant an adjustment \n     and the size of any such adjustment, but except as provided \n     under paragraph (1)(B), subsection (f)(3), and section \n     405(f), any such adjustment shall not affect the aggregate \n     payment obligations of insurer participants specified in \n     paragraph (2)(A) and subparagraph (C) of this paragraph.\n       (iv) Time period of adjustment.--Except for adjustments for \n     offset credits, adjustments granted under this subsection \n     shall have a term not to exceed 3 years. An insurer \n     participant may renew its adjustment by demonstrating to the \n     Administrator that it remains justified.\n       (F) Funding holidays.--\n       (i) In general.--If the Administrator determines, at any \n     time after 10 years following the date of enactment of this \n     Act, that the assets of the Fund at the time of such \n     determination and expected future payments are sufficient to \n     satisfy the Fund's anticipated obligations without the need \n     for all, or any portion of, that year's payment otherwise \n     required under this subtitle, the Administrator shall reduce \n     or waive all or any part of the payments required from \n     insurer participants for that year.\n       (ii) Annual review.--The Administrator shall undertake the \n     review required by this subsection and make the necessary \n     determination under clause (i) every year.\n       (iii) Limitations of funding holidays.--Any reduction or \n     waiver of the insurer participants' funding obligations \n     shall--\n\n       (I) be made only to the extent the Administrator determines \n     that the Fund will still be able to satisfy all of its \n     anticipated obligations; and\n       (II) be applied on an equal pro rata basis to the funding \n     obligations of all insurer participants for that year.\n\n       (iv) New information.--If at any time the Administrator \n     determines that a reduction or waiver under this section may \n     cause the assets of the Fund and expected future payments to \n     decrease to a level at which the Fund may not be able to \n     satisfy all of its anticipated obligations, the Administrator \n     shall revoke all or any part of such reduction or waiver to \n     the extent necessary to ensure that the Fund's obligations \n     are met. Such revocations shall be applied on an equal pro \n     rata basis to the funding obligations of all insurer \n     participants for that year.\n       (b) Procedure for Notifying Insurer Participants of \n     Individual Payment Obligations.--\n       (1) Notice to participants.--Not later than 30 days after \n     promulgation of the final rule establishing an allocation \n     methodology under subsection (a)(1), the Commission shall--\n       (A) directly notify all reasonably identifiable insurer \n     participants of the requirement to submit information \n     necessary to calculate the amount of any required payment to \n     the Fund under the allocation methodology; and\n       (B) publish in the Federal Register a notice--\n       (i) requiring any person who may be an insurer participant \n     (as determined by criteria outlined in the notice) to submit \n     such information; and\n       (ii) that includes a list of all insurer participants \n     notified by the Commission under subparagraph (A), and \n     provides for 30 days for the submission of comments or \n     information regarding the completeness and accuracy of the \n     list of identified insurer participants.\n       (2) Response required by individual insurer participants.--\n       (A) In general.--Any person who receives notice under \n     paragraph (1)(A), and any other person meeting the criteria \n     specified in the notice published under paragraph (1)(B), \n     shall respond by providing the Commission with all the \n     information requested in the notice under a schedule or by a \n     date established by the Commission.\n       (B) Certification.--The response submitted under \n     subparagraph (A) shall be signed by a responsible corporate \n     officer, general partner, proprietor, or individual of \n     similar authority, who shall certify under penalty of law the \n     completeness and accuracy of the information submitted.\n       (3) Notice to insurer participants of initial payment \n     determination.--\n       (A) In general.--\n       (i) Notice to insurers.--Not later than 120 days after \n     receipt of the information required by paragraph (2), the \n     Commission shall send each insurer participant a notice of \n     initial determination requiring payments to the Fund, which \n     shall be based on the information received from the \n     participant in response to the Commission's request for \n     information. An insurer participant's payments shall be \n     payable over the schedule established in subsection \n     (a)(3)(C), in annual amounts proportionate to the aggregate \n     annual amount of payments for all insurer participants for \n     the applicable year.\n       (ii) Public notice.--Not later than 7 days after sending \n     the notification of initial determination to insurer \n     participants, the Commission shall publish in the Federal \n     Register a notice listing the insurer participants that have \n     been sent such notification, and the initial determination on \n     the payment obligation of each identified participant.\n       (B) No response; incomplete response.--If no response is \n     received from an insurer participant, or if the response is \n     incomplete, the initial determination requiring a payment \n     from the insurer participant shall be based on the best \n     information available to the Commission.\n       (4) Commission review, revision, and finalization of \n     initial payment determinations.--\n       (A) Comments from insurer participants.--Not later than 30 \n     days after receiving a notice of initial determination from \n     the Commission, an insurer participant may provide the \n     Commission with additional information to support adjustments \n     to the required payments to reflect severe financial hardship \n     or exceptional circumstances, including the provision of an \n     offset credit for\n\n[[Page S5371]]\n\n     an insurer participant for the amount of any asbestos-related \n     payments it made or was legally obligated to make, including \n     payments released from an escrow, as the result of a \n     bankruptcy judicially confirmed after May 22, 2003, but \n     before the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (B) Additional participants.--If, before the final \n     determination of the Commission, the Commission receives \n     information that an additional person may qualify as an \n     insurer participant, the Commission shall require such person \n     to submit information necessary to determine whether payments \n     from that person should be required, in accordance with the \n     requirements of this subsection.\n       (C) Revision procedures.--The Commission shall adopt \n     procedures for revising initial payments based on information \n     received under subparagraphs (A) and (B), including a \n     provision requiring an offset credit for an insurer \n     participant for the amount of any asbestos-related payments \n     it made or was legally obligated to make, including payments \n     released from an escrow, as the result of a bankruptcy \n     confirmed after May 22, 2003, but before the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (5) Examinations and subpoenas.--\n       (A) Examinations.--The Commission may conduct examinations \n     of the books and records of insurer participants to determine \n     the completeness and accuracy of information submitted, or \n     required to be submitted, to the Commission for purposes of \n     determining participant payments.\n       (B) Subpoenas.--The Commission may request the Attorney \n     General to subpoena persons to compel testimony, records, and \n     other information relevant to its responsibilities under this \n     section. The Attorney General may enforce such subpoena in \n     appropriate proceedings in the United States district court \n     for the district in which the person to whom the subpoena was \n     addressed resides, was served, or transacts business.\n       (6) Escrow payments.--Without regard to an insurer \n     participant's payment obligation under this section, any \n     escrow or similar account established before the date of \n     enactment of this Act by an insurer participant in connection \n     with an asbestos trust fund that has not been judicially \n     confirmed by final order by the date of enactment of this Act \n     shall be the property of the insurer participant and returned \n     to that insurer participant.\n       (7) Notice to insurer participants of final payment \n     determinations.--Not later than 60 days after the notice of \n     initial determination is sent to the insurer participants, \n     the Commission shall send each insurer participant a notice \n     of final determination.\n       (c) Insurer Participants Voluntary Allocation Agreement.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the \n     Commission proposes its rule establishing an allocation \n     methodology under subsection (a)(1), direct insurer \n     participants licensed or domiciled in the United States, \n     other direct insurer participants, reinsurer participants \n     licensed or domiciled in the United States, or other \n     reinsurer participants, may submit an allocation agreement, \n     approved by all of the participants in the applicable group, \n     to the Commission.\n       (2) Allocation agreement.--To the extent the participants \n     in any such applicable group voluntarily agree upon an \n     allocation arrangement, any such allocation agreement shall \n     only govern the allocation of payments within that group and \n     shall not determine the aggregate amount due from that group.\n       (3) Certification.--The Commission shall determine whether \n     an allocation agreement submitted under subparagraph (A) \n     meets the requirements of this subtitle and, if so, shall \n     certify the agreement as establishing the allocation \n     methodology governing the individual payment obligations of \n     the participants who are parties to the agreement. The \n     authority of the Commission under this subtitle shall, with \n     respect to participants who are parties to a certified \n     allocation agreement, terminate on the day after the \n     Commission certifies such agreement. Under subsection (f), \n     the Administrator shall assume responsibility, if necessary, \n     for calculating the individual payment obligations of \n     participants who are parties to the certified agreement.\n       (d) Commission Report.--\n       (1) Recipients.--Until the work of the Commission has been \n     completed and the Commission terminated, the Commission shall \n     submit an annual report, containing the information described \n     under paragraph (2), to--\n       (A) the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate;\n       (B) the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (C) the Administrator.\n       (2) Contents.--The report under paragraph (1) shall state \n     the amount that each insurer participant is required to pay \n     to the Fund, including the payment schedule for such \n     payments.\n       (e) Interim Payments.--\n       (1) Amount of interim payment.--Within 90 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, insurer participants shall \n     make an aggregate payment to the Fund not to exceed 50 \n     percent of the aggregate funding obligation specified under \n     subsection (a)(3)(C) for year 1.\n       (2) Reserve information.--Within 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, each insurer participant shall submit \n     to the Administrator a certified statement of its net held \n     reserves for asbestos liabilities as of December 31, 2004.\n       (3) Allocation of interim payment.--The Administrator shall \n     allocate the interim payment among the individual insurer \n     participants on an equitable basis using the net held \n     asbestos reserve information provided by insurer participants \n     under subsection (a)(3)(B). Within 60 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall publish in the \n     Federal Register the name of each insurer participant, and \n     the amount of the insurer participant's allocated share of \n     the interim payment. The use of net held asbestos reserves as \n     the basis to determine an interim allocation shall not be \n     binding on the Administrator in the determination of an \n     appropriate final allocation methodology under this section. \n     All payments required under this paragraph shall be credited \n     against the participant's ultimate payment obligation to the \n     Fund established by the Commission. If an interim payment \n     exceeds the ultimate payment, the Fund shall pay interest on \n     the amount of the overpayment at a rate determined by the \n     Administrator. If the ultimate payment exceeds the interim \n     payment, the participant shall pay interest on the amount of \n     the underpayment at the same rate. Any participant may seek \n     an exemption from or reduction in any payment required under \n     this subsection under the financial hardship and exceptional \n     circumstance standards established under subsection \n     (a)(3)(E).\n       (4) Appeal of interim payment decisions.--A decision by the \n     Administrator to establish an interim payment obligation \n     shall be considered final agency action and reviewable under \n     section 303, except that the reviewing court may not stay an \n     interim payment during the pendency of the appeal.\n       (f) Transfer of Authority From the Commission to the \n     Administrator.--\n       (1) In general.--Upon termination of the Commission under \n     section 215, the Administrator shall assume all the \n     responsibilities and authority of the Commission, except that \n     the Administrator shall not have the power to modify the \n     allocation methodology established by the Commission or by \n     certified agreement or to promulgate a rule establishing any \n     such methodology.\n       (2) Financial hardship and exceptional circumstance \n     adjustments.--Upon termination of the Commission under \n     section 215, the Administrator shall have the authority, upon \n     application by any insurer participant, to make adjustments \n     to annual payments upon the same grounds as provided in \n     subsection (a)(3)(D). Adjustments granted under this \n     subsection shall have a term not to exceed 3 years. An \n     insurer participant may renew its adjustment by demonstrating \n     that it remains justified. Upon the grant of any adjustment, \n     the Administrator shall increase the payments, consistent \n     with subsection (a)(1)(B), required of all other insurer \n     participants so that there is no reduction in the aggregate \n     payment required of all insurer participants for the \n     applicable years. The increase in an insurer participant's \n     required payment shall be in proportion to such participant's \n     share of the aggregate payment obligation of all insurer \n     participants.\n       (3) Credits for shortfall assessments.--If insurer \n     participants are required during the first 5 years of the \n     life of the Fund to make up any shortfall in required insurer \n     payments under subsection (a)(1)(B), then, beginning in year \n     6, the Administrator shall grant each insurer participant a \n     credit against its annual required payments during the \n     applicable years that in the aggregate equal the amount of \n     shortfall assessments paid by such insurer participant during \n     the first 5 years of the life of the Fund. The credit shall \n     be prorated over the same number of years as the number of \n     years during which the insurer participant paid a shortfall \n     assessment. Insurer participants which did not pay all \n     required payments to the Fund during the first 5 years of the \n     life of the Fund shall not be eligible for a credit. The \n     Administrator shall not grant a credit for shortfall \n     assessments imposed under section 405(f).\n       (4) Financial security requirements.--Whenever an insurer \n     participant's A.M. Best's claims payment rating or Standard \n     and Poor's financial strength rating falls below A-, and \n     until such time as either the insurer participant's A.M. \n     Best's Rating or Standard and Poor's rating is equal to or \n     greater than A-, the Administrator shall have the authority \n     to require that the participating insurer either--\n       (A) pay the present value of its remaining Fund payments at \n     a discount rate determined by the Administrator; or\n       (B) provide an evergreen letter of credit or financial \n     guarantee for future payments issued by an institution with \n     an A.M. Best's claims payment rating or Standard & Poor's \n     financial strength rating of at least A+.\n       (g) Accounting Treatment.--Insurer participants' payment \n     obligations to the Fund shall be subject to discounting under \n     the applicable accounting guidelines for generally accepted \n     accounting purposes and statutory accounting purposes for \n     each insurer participant. This subsection shall in no way \n     reduce the amount of monetary payments to the Fund by insurer \n     participants as required under subsection (a).\n       (h) Judicial Review.--The Commission's rule establishing an \n     allocation methodology, its final determinations of payment \n     obligations and other final action shall be judicially \n     reviewable as provided in title III.\n\n     SEC. 213. POWERS OF ASBESTOS INSURERS COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Rulemaking.--The Commission shall promulgate such rules \n     and regulations as necessary to implement its authority under\n\n[[Page S5372]]\n\n     this Act, including regulations governing an allocation \n     methodology.

MANAGEMENT OF THE FUND.\n\n       (a) In General.--Amounts in the Fund shall be held for the \n     exclusive purpose of providing benefits to asbestos claimants \n     and their beneficiaries and to otherwise defray the \n     reasonable expenses of administering the Fund.\n       (b) Investments.--\n       (1) In general.--Amounts in the Fund shall be administered \n     and invested with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence, \n     under the circumstances prevailing at the time of such \n     investment, that a prudent person acting in a like capacity \n     and manner would use.\n       (2) Strategy.--The Administrator shall invest amounts in \n     the Fund in a manner that enables the Fund to make current \n     and future distributions to or for the benefit of asbestos \n     claimants. In pursuing an investment strategy under this \n     subparagraph, the Administrator shall consider, to the extent \n     relevant to an investment decision or action--\n       (A) the size of the Fund;\n       (B) the nature and estimated duration of the Fund;\n       (C) the liquidity and distribution requirements of the \n     Fund;\n       (D) general economic conditions at the time of the \n     investment;\n       (E) the possible effect of inflation or deflation on Fund \n     assets;\n       (F) the role that each investment or course of action plays \n     with respect to the overall assets of the Fund;\n       (G) the expected amount to be earned (including both income \n     and appreciation of capital) through investment of amounts in \n     the Fund; and\n       (H) the needs of asbestos claimants for current and future \n     distributions authorized under this Act.\n       (c) Bankruptcy Trust Guarantee.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, the Administrator shall have the authority to \n     impose a pro rata surcharge on all participants under this \n     subsection to ensure the liquidity of the Fund, if--\n       (A) the declared assets from 1 or more bankruptcy trusts \n     established under a plan of reorganization confirmed and \n     substantially consummated on or before July 31, 2004, are not \n     available to the Fund because a final judgment that has been \n     entered by a court and is no longer subject to any appeal or \n     review has enjoined the transfer of assets required under \n     section 524(j)(2) of title 11, United States Code (as amended \n     by section 402(f) of this Act); and\n       (B) borrowing is insufficient to assure the Fund's ability \n     to meet its obligations under this Act such that the required \n     borrowed amount is likely to increase the risk of termination \n     of this Act under section 405 based on reasonable claims \n     projections.\n       (2) Allocation.--Any surcharge imposed under this \n     subsection shall be imposed over a period of 5 years on a pro \n     rata basis upon all participants, in accordance with the \n     relative aggregate funding obligations under sections \n     202(a)(2) and 212(a)(2)(A).\n       (3) Certification.--\n       (A) In general.--Before imposing a surcharge under this \n     subsection, the Administrator shall publish a notice in the \n     Federal Register and provide in such notice for a public \n     comment period of 30 days.\n       (B) Contents of notice.--The notice required under \n     subparagraph (A) shall include--\n       (i) information explaining the circumstances that make a \n     surcharge necessary and a certification that the requirements \n     under paragraph (1) are met;\n       (ii) the amount of the declared assets from any trust \n     established under a plan of reorganization confirmed and \n     substantially consummated on or before July 31, 2004, that \n     was not made, or is no longer, available to the Fund;\n       (iii) the total aggregate amount of the necessary \n     surcharge; and\n       (iv) the surcharge amount for each tier and subtier of \n     defendant participants and for each insurer participant.\n       (C) Final notice.--The Administrator shall publish a final \n     notice in the Federal Register and provide each participant \n     with written notice of that participant's schedule of \n     payments under this subsection. In no event shall any \n     required surcharge under this subsection be due before 60 \n     days after the Administrator publishes the final notice in \n     the Federal Register and provides each participant with \n     written notice of its schedule of payments.\n       (4) Maximum amount.--In no event shall the total aggregate \n     surcharge imposed by the Administrator exceed the lesser of--\n       (A) the total aggregate amount of the declared assets of \n     the trusts established under a plan of reorganization \n     confirmed and substantially consummated prior to July 31, \n     2004, that are no longer available to the Fund; or\n       (B) $4,000,000,000.\n       (5) Declared assets.--\n       (A) In general.--In this subsection, the term ``declared \n     assets'' means--\n       (i) the amount of assets transferred by any trust \n     established under a plan of reorganization confirmed and \n     substantially consummated on or before July 31, 2004, to the \n     Fund that is required to be returned to that trust under the \n     final judgment described in paragraph (1)(A); or\n       (ii) if no assets were transferred by the trust to the \n     Fund, the amount of assets the Administrator determines would \n     have been available for transfer to the Fund from that trust \n     under section 402(f).\n       (B) Determination.--In making a determination under \n     subparagraph (A)(ii), the Administrator may rely on any \n     information reasonably available, and may request, and use \n     subpoena authority of the Administrator if necessary to \n     obtain, relevant information from any such trust or its \n     trustees.\n       (d) Bankruptcy Trust Credits.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, but subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, \n     the Administrator shall provide a credit toward the aggregate \n     payment obligations under sections 202(a)(2) and 212(a)(2)(A) \n     for assets received by the Fund from any bankruptcy trust \n     established under a plan of reorganization confirmed and \n     substantially consummated after July 31, 2004.\n       (2) Allocation of credits.--The Administrator shall \n     allocate, for each such bankruptcy trust, the credits for \n     such assets between the defendant and insurer aggregate \n     payment obligations as follows:\n       (A) Defendant participants.--The aggregate amount that all \n     persons other than insurers contributing to the bankruptcy \n     trust would have been required to pay as Tier I defendants \n     under section 203(b) if the plan of reorganization under \n     which the bankruptcy trust was established had not been \n     confirmed and substantially consummated and the proceeding \n     under chapter 11 of title 11, United States Code, that \n     resulted in the establishment of the bankruptcy trust had \n     remained pending as of the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (B) Insurer participants.--The aggregate amount of all \n     credits to which insurers are entitled to under section \n     202(c)(4)(A) of the Act.\n\n     SEC. 223. ENFORCEMENT OF PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS.\n\n       (a) Default.--If any participant fails to make any payment \n     in the amount of and according to the schedule under this Act \n     or as prescribed by the Administrator, after demand and a 30-\n     day opportunity to cure the default, there shall be a lien in \n     favor of the United States for the amount of the delinquent \n     payment (including interest) upon all property and rights to \n     property, whether real or personal, belonging to such \n     participant.\n       (b) Bankruptcy.--In the case of a bankruptcy or insolvency \n     proceeding, the lien imposed under subsection (a) shall be \n     treated in the same manner as a lien for taxes due and owing \n     to the United States for purposes of the provisions of title \n     11, United States Code, or section 3713(a) of title 31, \n     United States Code.

The positions taken or statements made by \n     the Administrator in any such proceeding shall not be binding \n     on or attributed to the insureds or cedents in any other \n     proceeding. The outcome of such a proceeding shall not have a \n     preclusive effect on the insureds or cedents in any other \n     proceeding and shall not be admissible against any subrogee \n     under this section.

EFFECT ON INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE CONTRACTS.\n\n       (a) Erosion of Insurance Coverage Limits.--\n       (1) Definitions.--In this section, the following \n     definitions shall apply:\n       (A) Deemed erosion amount.--The term ``deemed erosion \n     amount'' means the amount of erosion deemed to occur at \n     enactment under paragraph (2).\n       (B) Early sunset.--The term ``early sunset'' means an event \n     causing termination of the program under section 405(g) which \n     relieves the insurer participants of paying some portion of \n     the aggregate payment level of $46,025,000,000 required under \n     section 212(a)(2)(A).\n       (C) Earned erosion amount.--The term ``earned erosion \n     amount'' means, in the event of any early sunset under \n     section 405(g), the percentage, as set forth in the following \n     schedule, depending on the year in which the defendant \n     participants' funding obligations end, of those amounts \n     which, at the time of the early sunset, a defendant \n     participant has paid to the fund and remains obligated to pay \n     into the fund.\n\n  Year After Enactment In Which Defendant Participant's Funding \n  Obligation Ends:                               Applicable Percentage:\n  2.........................................................67.06  ....\n\n  3.........................................................86.72  ....\n\n  4.........................................................96.55  ....\n\n  5........................................................102.45  ....\n\n  6.........................................................90.12  ....\n\n  7.........................................................81.32  ....\n\n  8.........................................................74.71  ....\n\n  9.........................................................69.58  ....\n\n  10........................................................65.47  ....\n\n  11........................................................62.11  ....\n\n  12........................................................59.31  ....\n\n  13........................................................56.94  ....\n\n  14........................................................54.90  ....\n\n  15........................................................53.14  ....\n\n  16........................................................51.60  ....\n\n  17........................................................50.24  ....\n\n  18........................................................49.03  ....\n\n  19........................................................47.95  ....\n\n  20........................................................46.98  ....\n\n  21........................................................46.10  ....\n\n  22........................................................45.30  ....\n\n  23........................................................44.57  ....\n\n  24........................................................43.90  ....\n\n  25........................................................43.28  ....\n\n  26........................................................42.71  ....\n\n  27........................................................42.18  ....\n\n  28........................................................40.82  ....\n\n  29........................................................39.42  ....\n\n       (D) Remaining aggregate products limits.--The term \n     ``remaining aggregate products limits'' means aggregate \n     limits that apply to insurance coverage granted under the \n     ``products hazard'', ``completed operations hazard'', or \n     ``Products--Completed Operations Liability'' in any \n     comprehensive general liability policy issued between \n     calendar years 1940 and 1986 to cover injury which occurs in \n     any State, as reduced by--\n       (i) any existing impairment of such aggregate limits as of \n     the date of enactment of this Act; and\n       (ii) the resolution of claims for reimbursement or coverage \n     of liability or paid or incurred loss for which notice was \n     provided to the insurer before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (E) Scheduled payment amounts.--The term ``scheduled \n     payment amounts'' means the future payment obligation to the \n     Fund under this Act from a defendant participant in the \n     amount established under sections 203 and 204.\n       (F) Unearned erosion amount.--The term ``unearned erosion \n     amount'' means, in the event of any early sunset under \n     section 405(g), the difference between the deemed erosion \n     amount and the earned erosion amount.\n       (2) Quantum and timing of erosion.--\n       (A) Erosion upon enactment.--The collective payment \n     obligations to the Fund of the insurer and reinsurer \n     participants as assessed by the Administrator shall be deemed \n     as of the date of enactment of this Act to erode remaining \n     aggregate products limits available to a defendant \n     participant only in an amount of 38.1 percent of each \n     defendant participant's scheduled payment amount.\n       (B) No assertion of claim.--No insurer or reinsurer may \n     assert any claim against a defendant participant or captive \n     insurer for insurance, reinsurance, payment of a deductible, \n     or retrospective premium adjustment arising out of that \n     insurer's or reinsurer's payments to the Fund or the erosion \n     deemed to occur under this section.\n       (C) Policies without certain limits or with exclusion.--\n     Except as provided under subparagraph (E), nothing in this \n     section shall require or permit the erosion of any insurance \n     policy or limit that does not contain an aggregate products \n     limit, or that contains an asbestos exclusion.\n       (D) Treatment of consolidation election.--If an affiliated \n     group elects consolidation as provided in section 204(f), the \n     total erosion of limits for the affiliated group under \n     paragraph (2)(A) shall not exceed 38.1 percent of the \n     scheduled payment amount of the single payment obligation for \n     the entire affiliated group. The total erosion of limits for \n     any individual defendant participant in the affiliated group \n     shall not exceed its individual share of 38.1 percent of the \n     affiliated group's scheduled payment amount, as measured by \n     the individual defendant participant's percentage share of \n     the affiliated group's prior asbestos expenditures.\n       (E) Rule of construction.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this section, nothing in this Act shall be \n     deemed to erode remaining aggregate products limits of a \n     defendant participant that can demonstrate by a preponderance \n     of the evidence that 75 percent of its prior asbestos \n     expenditures were made in defense or satisfaction of asbestos \n     claims alleging bodily injury arising exclusively from the \n     exposure to asbestos at premises owned, rented, or controlled \n     by the defendant participant (a ``premises defendant''). In \n     calculating such percentage, where expenditures were made in \n     defense or satisfaction of asbestos claims alleging bodily \n     injury due to exposure to the defendant participant's \n     products and to asbestos at premises owned, rented, or \n     controlled by the defendant participant, half of such \n     expenditures shall be deemed to be for such premises \n     exposures. If a defendant participant establishes itself as a \n     premises defendant, 75 percent of the payments by such \n     defendant participant shall erode coverage limits, if any, \n     applicable to premises liabilities under applicable law.\n       (3) Method of erosion.--\n       (A) Allocation.--The amount of erosion allocated to each \n     defendant participant shall be allocated among periods in \n     which policies with remaining aggregate product limits are \n     available to that defendant participant pro rata by policy \n     period, in ascending order by attachment point.\n       (B) Other erosion methods.--\n       (i) In general.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the \n     method of erosion of any remaining aggregate products limits \n     which are subject to--\n\n       (I) a coverage-in-place or settlement agreement between a \n     defendant participant and 1 or more insurance participants as \n     of the date of enactment; or\n       (II) a final and nonappealable judgment as of the date of \n     enactment or resulting from a claim for coverage or \n     reimbursement pending as of such date, shall be as specified \n     in such agreement or judgment with regard to erosion \n     applicable to such insurance participants' policies.\n\n       (ii) Remaining limits.--To the extent that a final \n     nonappealable judgment or settlement agreement to which an \n     insurer participant and a defendant participant are parties \n     in effect as of the date of enactment of this Act \n     extinguished a defendant participant's right to seek coverage \n     for asbestos claims under an insurer participant's policies, \n     any remaining limits in such policies shall not be considered \n     to be remaining aggregate products limits under subsection \n     (a)(1)(A).\n       (4) Restoration of aggregate products limits upon early \n     sunset.--\n       (A) Restoration.--In the event of an early sunset, any \n     unearned erosion amount will be deemed restored as aggregate \n     products limits available to a defendant participant as of \n     the date of enactment.\n       (B) Method of restoration.--The unearned erosion amount \n     will be deemed restored to each defendant participant's \n     policies in such a manner that the last limits that were \n     deemed eroded at enactment under this subsection are deemed \n     to be the first limits restored upon early sunset.\n       (C) Tolling of coverage claims.--In the event of an early \n     sunset, the applicable statute of limitations and contractual \n     provisions for the filing of claims under any insurance \n     policy with restored aggregate products limits shall be \n     deemed tolled after the date of\n\n[[Page S5382]]\n\n     enactment through the date 6 months after the date of early \n     sunset.\n       (5) Payments by defendant participant.--Payments made by a \n     defendant participant shall be deemed to erode, exhaust, or \n     otherwise satisfy applicable self-insured retentions, \n     deductibles, retrospectively rated premiums, and limits \n     issued by nonparticipating insolvent or captive insurance \n     companies. Reduction of remaining aggregate limits under this \n     subsection shall not limit the right of a defendant \n     participant to collect from any insurer not a participant.\n       (6) Effect on other insurance claims.--Other than as \n     specified in this subsection, this Act does not alter, \n     change, modify, or affect insurance for claims other than \n     asbestos claims.\n       (b) Dispute Resolution Procedure.--\n       (1) Arbitration.--The parties to a dispute regarding the \n     erosion of insurance coverage limits under this section may \n     agree in writing to settle such dispute by arbitration. Any \n     such provision or agreement shall be valid, irrevocable, and \n     enforceable, except for any grounds that exist at law or in \n     equity for revocation of a contract.\n       (2) Title 9, united states code.--Arbitration of such \n     disputes, awards by arbitrators, and confirmation of awards \n     shall be governed by title 9, United States Code, to the \n     extent such title is not inconsistent with this section. In \n     any such arbitration proceeding, the erosion principles \n     provided for under this section shall be binding on the \n     arbitrator, unless the parties agree to the contrary.\n       (3) Final and binding award.--An award by an arbitrator \n     shall be final and binding between the parties to the \n     arbitration, but shall have no force or effect on any other \n     person. The parties to an arbitration may agree that in the \n     event a policy which is the subject matter of an award is \n     subsequently determined to be eroded in a manner different \n     from the manner determined by the arbitration in a judgment \n     rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction from which no \n     appeal can or has been taken, such arbitration award may be \n     modified by any court of competent jurisdiction upon \n     application by any party to the arbitration. Any such \n     modification shall govern the rights and obligations between \n     such parties after the date of such modification.\n       (c) Effect on Nonparticipants.--\n       (1) In general.--No insurance company or reinsurance \n     company that is not a participant, other than a captive \n     insurer, shall be entitled to claim that payments to the Fund \n     erode, exhaust, or otherwise limit the nonparticipant's \n     insurance or reinsurance obligations.\n       (2) Other claims.--Nothing in this Act shall preclude a \n     participant from pursuing any claim for insurance or \n     reinsurance from any person that is not a participant other \n     than a captive insurer.\n       (d) Finite Risk Policies Not Affected.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, except subject to section 212(a)(1)(D), this Act \n     shall not alter, affect or impair any rights or obligations \n     of--\n       (A) any party to an insurance contract that expressly \n     provides coverage for governmental charges or assessments \n     imposed to replace insurance or reinsurance liabilities in \n     effect on the date of enactment of this Act; or\n       (B) subject to paragraph (2), any person with respect to \n     any insurance purchased by a participant after December 31, \n     1990, that expressly (but not necessarily exclusively) \n     provides coverage for asbestos liabilities, including those \n     policies commonly referred to as ``finite risk'' policies.\n       (2) Limitation.--No person may assert that any amounts paid \n     to the Fund in accordance with this Act are covered by any \n     policy described under paragraph (1)(B) purchased by a \n     defendant participant, unless such policy specifically \n     provides coverage for required payments to a Federal trust \n     fund established by a Federal statute to resolve asbestos \n     injury claims.\n       (e) Effect on Certain Insurance and Reinsurance Claims.--\n       (1) No coverage for fund assessments.--Subject to section \n     212(a)(1)(D), no participant or captive insurer may pursue an \n     insurance or reinsurance claim against another participant or \n     captive insurer for payments to the Fund required under this \n     Act, except under a written agreement specifically providing \n     insurance, reinsurance, or other reimbursement for required \n     payments to a Federal trust fund established by a Federal \n     statute to resolve asbestos injury claims or, where \n     applicable, under finite risk policies under subsection (d).\n       (2) Certain insurance assignments voided.--Any assignment \n     of any rights to insurance coverage for asbestos claims to \n     any person who has asserted an asbestos claim before the date \n     of enactment of this Act, or to any trust, person, or other \n     entity not part of an affiliated group as defined in section \n     201(1) of this Act established or appointed for the purpose \n     of paying asbestos claims which were asserted before such \n     date of enactment, or by any Tier I defendant participant, \n     before any sunset of this Act, shall be null and void. This \n     subsection shall not void or affect in any way any \n     assignments of rights to insurance coverage other than to \n     asbestos claimants or to trusts, persons, or other entities \n     not part of an affiliated group as defined in section 201(1) \n     of this Act established or appointed for the purpose of \n     paying asbestos claims, or by Tier I defendant participants.\n       (3) Insurance claims preserved.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, this Act shall not alter, affect, or \n     impair any rights or obligations of any person with respect \n     to any insurance or reinsurance for amounts that any person \n     pays, has paid, or becomes legally obligated to pay in \n     respect of asbestos or other claims, including claims filed, \n     pursued, or revived under section 405(h), except to the \n     extent that--\n       (A) such claims are preempted, barred, or superseded by \n     section 403;\n       (B) any such rights or obligations of such person with \n     respect to insurance or reinsurance are prohibited by \n     paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (e); or\n       (C) the limits of insurance otherwise available to such \n     participant in respect of asbestos claims are deemed to be \n     eroded under subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 405.

\n     and\n       (2) to satisfy the Fund's debt repayment obligation, \n     administrative costs, and other financial obligations.\n       (d) Claims Analysis and Verification of Unanticipated \n     Claims.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Administrator concludes, on the \n     basis of the annual report submitted under this section, \n     that--\n       (A) the average number of claims that qualify for \n     compensation under a claim level or designation exceeds 125 \n     percent of the number of claims expected to qualify for \n     compensation under that claim level or designation in the \n     most recent Congressional Budget Office estimate of asbestos-\n     injury claims for any 3-year period, the Administrator shall \n     conduct a review of a statistically significant sample of \n     claims qualifying for compensation under the appropriate \n     claim level or designation; or\n       (B) the average number of claims that qualify for \n     compensation under a claim level or designation is less than \n     75 percent of the number of claims expected to qualify for \n     compensation under that claim level or designation in the \n     most recent Congressional Budget Office estimate of asbestos-\n     injury claims for any 3-year period, the Administrator shall \n     conduct a review of a statistically significant sample of \n     claims deemed ineligible for compensation under the \n     appropriate claim level or designation.\n       (2) Determinations.--The Administrator shall examine the \n     best available medical evidence and any recommendation made \n     under subsection (b)(5) in order to determine which 1 or more \n     of the following is true:\n       (A) Without a significant number of exceptions, all of the \n     claimants who qualified for compensation under the claim \n     level or designation suffer from an injury or disease for \n     which exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing \n     factor.\n       (B) A significant number of claimants who qualified for \n     compensation under the claim level or designation do not \n     suffer from an injury or disease for which exposure to \n     asbestos was a substantial contributing factor.\n       (C) A significant number of claimants who were denied \n     compensation under the claim level of designation did suffer \n     from an injury or disease for which exposure to asbestos was \n     a substantial contributing factor.\n       (D) The Congressional Budget Office projections \n     underestimated or overestimated the actual number of persons \n     who suffer from an injury or disease for which exposure to \n     asbestos was a substantial contributing factor.\n       (3) Recommendations concerning claims criteria.--If the \n     Administrator determines that a significant number of the \n     claimants who qualified for compensation under the claim \n     level under review do not suffer from an injury or disease \n     for which exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing \n     factor, or that a significant number of the claimants who \n     were denied compensation under the claim level under review \n     suffered from an injury or disease for which exposure to \n     asbestos was a substantial contributing factor, the \n     Administrator shall recommend to Congress, under subsection \n     (f), changes to the compensation criteria in order to ensure \n     that the Fund provides compensation for injury or disease for \n     which exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing \n     factor, but does not provide compensation to claimants who do \n     not suffer from an injury or disease for which asbestos \n     exposure was a substantial contributing factor.\n       (e) Recommendations of Administrator and Advisory \n     Committee.--\n       (1) Referral.--If the Administrator recommends changes to \n     this Act under subsection (d), the recommendations and \n     accompanying analysis shall be referred to the Advisory \n     Committee on Asbestos Disease Compensation established under \n     section 102 (in this subsection referred to as the ``Advisory \n     Committee'').\n       (2) Advisory committee recommendations.--The Advisory \n     Committee shall hold expedited public hearings on the \n     alternatives and recommendations of the Administrator and \n     make its own recommendations for reform of the program under \n     titles I and II.\n       (3) Transmittal to congress.--Not later than 90 days after \n     receiving the recommendations of the Administrator, the \n     Advisory Committee shall transmit the recommendations of the \n     Administrator and the recommendations of the Advisory \n     Committee to the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and \n     the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (f) Shortfall Analysis.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Analysis.--If the Administrator concludes, at any time, \n     that the Fund may not be able to pay claims as such claims \n     become due at any time within the next 5 years and to satisfy \n     its other obligations, the Administrator shall prepare an \n     analysis of the reasons for the situation, an estimation of \n     when the Fund will no longer be able to pay claims as such \n     claims become due, a description of the range of reasonable \n     alternatives for responding to the situation, and a \n     recommendation as to which alternative best serves the \n     interest of claimants and the public. The report may include \n     a description of changes in the diagnostic, exposure, or \n     medical criteria of section 121 that the Administrator \n     believes may be necessary to protect the Fund. The \n     Administrator shall submit such analysis to the Committee on \n     the Judiciary of the Senate and the Committee on the \n     Judiciary of the House of Representatives. Any \n     recommendations made by the Administrator for changes to the \n     program shall, in addition, be referred to the Advisory \n     Committee on Asbestos Disease Compensation established under \n     section 102 for review.\n       (B) Range of alternatives.--The range of alternatives under \n     subparagraph (A) may include--\n       (i) termination of the program set forth in titles I and II \n     of this Act in its entirety;\n       (ii) reform of the program set forth in titles I and II of \n     this Act (including changes in the diagnostic, exposure, or \n     medical criteria, changes in the enforcement or application \n     of those criteria, enhancement of enforcement authority, \n     changes in the timing of payments, changes in contributions \n     by defendant participants, insurer participants (or both such \n     participants), or changes in award values); or\n       (iii) any measure that the Administrator considers \n     appropriate.\n       (C) Insurer shortfall assessments.--Beginning in year 6 of \n     the life of the Fund, if the Administrator determines that a \n     shortfall in payment of the annual amounts required to be \n     paid by insurer participants under section 212(a)(3)(C) is \n     the substantial factor that would cause the Administrator to \n     recommend the termination of this Act under subsection (g), \n     then the Administrator may impose shortfall assessments on \n     insurer participants in addition to the payments imposed \n     under section 212, except that the Administrator shall not \n     impose such assessments if the additional amounts would not \n     be sufficient to permit the Administrator to avoid \n     recommending termination of this Act. During any given year, \n     the total of such shortfall assessments shall not exceed the \n     amount by which, during the prior year, total payments by \n     insurer participants fell short of the aggregate amounts \n     required to be paid under section 212(a)(3)(C). Shortfall \n     assessments shall be allocated among insurer participants \n     using the methodology adopted by the Asbestos Insurers \n     Commission under section 212(a)(1)(B).\n       (2) Considerations.--In formulating recommendations, the \n     Administrator shall take into account the reasons for any \n     shortfall, actual or projected, which may include--\n       (A) financial factors, including return on investments, \n     borrowing capacity, interest rates, ability to collect \n     contributions, and other relevant factors;\n       (B) the operation of the Fund generally, including \n     administration of the claims processing, the ability of the \n     Administrator to collect contributions from participants, \n     potential problems of fraud, the adequacy of the criteria to \n     rule out idiopathic mesothelioma, and inadequate flexibility \n     to extend the timing of payments;\n       (C) the appropriateness of the diagnostic, exposure, and \n     medical criteria, including the adequacy of the criteria to \n     rule out idiopathic mesothelioma;\n       (D) the actual incidence of asbestos-related diseases, \n     including mesothelioma, based on epidemiological studies and \n     other relevant data;\n       (E) compensation of diseases with alternative causes; and\n       (F) other factors that the Administrator considers \n     relevant.\n       (3) Recommendation of termination.--Any recommendation of \n     termination should include a plan for winding up the affairs \n     of the Fund (and the program generally) within a defined \n     period, including paying in full all claims resolved at the \n     time the report is prepared. Any plan under this paragraph \n     shall provide for priority in payment to the claimants with \n     the most serious illnesses.\n       (4) Resolved claims.--For purposes of this section, a claim \n     shall be deemed resolved when the Administrator has \n     determined the amount of the award due the claimant, and \n     either the claimant has waived judicial review or the time \n     for judicial review has expired.\n       (g) Sunset of Act.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Termination.--Subject to paragraph (4), titles I \n     (except subtitle A) and II and sections 403 and 404(e)(2) \n     shall terminate as provided under paragraph (2), if--\n       (i) the Administrator has begun the processing of claims; \n     and\n       (ii) as part of the review conducted to prepare an annual \n     report under this section, the Chief Financial Officer of the \n     Department of Labor, giving due consideration to the audit \n     conducted under subsection (h), determines that if any \n     additional claims are resolved, the Fund will not have \n     sufficient nontaxpayer resources and borrowing authorized \n     under section 221 when needed to pay 100 percent of all \n     resolved claims while also meeting all other obligations of \n     the Fund under this Act, including the payment of--\n\n       (I) debt repayment obligations; and\n       (II) remaining obligations to the asbestos trust of a \n     debtor and the class action trust.\n\n       (B) Remaining obligations.--For purposes of subparagraph \n     (A)(ii)(II), the remaining obligations to the asbestos trust \n     of the debtor and the class action trust shall be determined \n     by multiplying the amount of assets transferred to the Fund \n     by such debtor or class action trust by the applicable \n     percentage set forth in the following schedule depending on \n     the year in which a termination shall take effect under \n     paragraph (2). The applicable percentage shall be adjusted \n     between years by quarter-annual increments.\n\n\n[[Page S5384]]\n\n\n  Year After Enactment in Which\n  the Termination is Effective                   Applicable Percentage:\n  1........................................................100.00  ....\n\n  2.........................................................93.95  ....\n\n  3.........................................................87.98  ....\n\n  4.........................................................82.40  ....\n\n  5.........................................................76.97  ....\n\n  6.........................................................71.66  ....\n\n  7.........................................................66.50  ....\n\n  8.........................................................61.48  ....\n\n  9.........................................................56.61  ....\n\n  10........................................................52.01  ....\n\n  11........................................................47.65  ....\n\n  12........................................................43.52  ....\n\n  13........................................................39.62  ....\n\n  14........................................................35.96  ....\n\n  15........................................................32.55  ....\n\n  16........................................................29.36  ....\n\n  17........................................................26.39  ....\n\n  18........................................................23.65  ....\n\n  19........................................................21.11  ....\n\n  20........................................................18.76  ....\n\n  21........................................................16.62  ....\n\n  22........................................................14.66  ....\n\n  23........................................................12.86  ....\n\n  24........................................................11.24  ....\n\n  25.........................................................9.78  ....\n\n  26.........................................................8.48  ....\n\n  27.........................................................7.32  ....\n\n  28.........................................................6.29  ....\n\n  29.........................................................5.37  ....\n\n  30.........................................................4.55  ....\n\n  31.........................................................3.83  ....\n\n  32.........................................................3.20  ....\n\n  33.........................................................2.66  ....\n\n  34.........................................................2.18  ....\n\n  35.........................................................1.77  ....\n\n  36.........................................................1.42  ....\n\n  37.........................................................1.13  ....\n\n  38.........................................................0.89  ....\n\n  39.........................................................0.70  ....\n\n  40.........................................................0.54  ....\n\n  41.........................................................0.40  ....\n\n  42.........................................................0.29  ....\n\n  43.........................................................0.19  ....\n\n  44.........................................................0.12  ....\n\n  45.........................................................0.05  ....\n\n  46 and thereafter..........................................0.00  ....\n\n       (2) Effective date of termination.--A termination under \n     paragraph (1) shall take effect 180 days after the date of a \n     determination of the Administrator under paragraph (1) and \n     shall apply to all asbestos claims that have not been \n     resolved by the Fund as of the date of the determination.\n       (3) Resolved claims.--If a termination takes effect under \n     this subsection, all resolved claims shall be paid in full by \n     the Fund.\n       (4) Extinguished claims.--A claim that is extinguished \n     under the statute of limitations provisions in section 113(b) \n     is not revived at the time of sunset under this subsection.\n       (5) Continued funding.--If a termination takes effect under \n     this subsection, participants will still be required to make \n     payments as provided under subtitles A and B of title II. If \n     the full amount of payments required by title II is not \n     necessary for the Fund to pay claims that have been resolved \n     as of the date of termination, pay the Fund's debt and \n     obligations to the asbestos trusts and class action trust, \n     and support the Fund's continued operation as needed to pay \n     such claims, debt, and obligations, the Administrator may \n     reduce such payments. Any such reductions shall be allocated \n     among participants in approximately the same proportion as \n     the liability under subtitles A and B of title II.\n       (6) Sunset claims.--\n       (A) Definitions.--In this paragraph--\n       (i) the term ``sunset claims'' means claims filed with the \n     Fund, but not yet resolved, when this Act has terminated; and\n       (ii) the term ``sunset claimants'' means persons asserting \n     sunset claims.\n       (B) In general.--If a termination takes effect under this \n     subsection, the applicable statute of limitations for the \n     filing of sunset claims under subsection (h) shall be tolled \n     for any past or pending sunset claimants while such claimants \n     were pursuing claims filed under this Act. For those \n     claimants who decide to pursue a sunset claim in accordance \n     with subsection (h), the applicable statute of limitations \n     shall apply, except that claimants who filed a claim against \n     the Fund under this Act before the date of termination shall \n     have 2 years after the date of termination to file a sunset \n     claim in accordance with subsection (h).\n       (7) Establishment of master asbestos trust.--\n       (A) Creation.--Within 120 days after the determination of \n     the Administrator under paragraph (1), the Administrator \n     shall create a trust to be the successor to the asbestos \n     trusts and any class action trust, to receive funds equal to \n     the amount determined by the Administrator to be necessary to \n     pay the remaining aggregate obligations to the asbestos \n     trusts and any class action trust under paragraph (1) \n     (A)(iii) and (B), and to use such funds for the exclusive \n     purpose of providing benefits in accordance with the terms of \n     this paragraph to persons who would have held valid asbestos \n     claims against the asbestos trusts or any class action trust \n     had this Act not been enacted and to otherwise defray the \n     reasonable expenses of administering the master trust.\n       (B) Jurisdiction.--The United States District Court for the \n     District of Columbia shall have exclusive jurisdiction, \n     without regard to amount in controversy, over the master \n     trust and all civil actions involving the application and \n     construction of this subparagraph and the trust documents, \n     including any action for the payment of benefits due under \n     the terms of this subparagraph after exhaustion of trust \n     remedies and any action for breach of fiduciary duty on the \n     part of any fiduciary of the master trust.\n       (C) Trustees.--The district court shall appoint, upon \n     petition by the Administrator after consultation with the \n     Advisory Committee, 3 trustees to administer the master \n     trust. Each trustee, and any successor to each trustee, must \n     be independent, free of any adverse interest and have \n     sufficient qualifications and experience to fulfill the \n     responsibilities described in this section.\n       (D) Trust advisory committee.--The Administrator, in \n     consultation with the Advisory Committee, shall appoint 3 \n     persons to represent the interests of trust beneficiaries as \n     members of a trust advisory committee to consult with and \n     advise the trustees respecting the administration of the \n     master trust and resolution of asbestos claims. At least 1 of \n     the members of the trust advisory committee shall be selected \n     from among individuals recommended by recognized national \n     labor federations, and at least 1 of the members of the trust \n     advisory committee shall be experienced in representing the \n     interests of trust beneficiaries.\n       (E) Legal representative.--The district court shall \n     appoint, upon petition by the Administrator after \n     consultation with the Advisory Committee, a legal \n     representative of persons who may in the future have claims \n     against the master trust for the purpose of protecting the \n     rights of such persons respecting the master trust and \n     consulting with and advising the trustees respecting the \n     administration of the master trust and resolution of asbestos \n     claims. The legal representative shall have standing to \n     appear and be heard as a representative of the future \n     asbestos claimants in any civil action before the district \n     court relating to the master trust. The legal representative \n     shall not represent the interests of any person who has filed \n     a claim for benefits against the master trust with respect to \n     such claim.\n       (F) Trust documents.--The Administrator, in consultation \n     with the Advisory Committee, shall create such trust \n     documents as may be necessary to create and govern the \n     operations of the master trust. The trust documents shall \n     contain provisions that--\n       (i) address the payment of compensation to and \n     reimbursement of necessary and reasonable expenses of the \n     trustees, trust advisory committee members and legal \n     representative, and appointment of successors to such \n     persons, subject to approval by the district court in the \n     case of successors to the trustees and legal representative; \n     and\n       (ii) provide for the master trust's obligation to defend \n     and indemnify the Administrator, trustees, members of the \n     trust advisory committee, legal representative and their \n     respective successors against and from legal actions and \n     related losses to the extent that a corporation is permitted \n     under the laws of Delaware to defend and indemnify its \n     officers and directors.\n       (G) Duty of trustees.--The trustees shall administer the \n     master trust in accordance with the terms of this \n     subparagraph and the Trust Documents for the exclusive \n     purpose of providing benefits to persons with valid claims \n     against the master trust and otherwise defraying the \n     reasonable expenses of administering the master trust, and \n     shall manage and invest the assets of the trust with the \n     care, skill, prudence, and diligence, under like \n     circumstances prevailing at the time, that a prudent person \n     acting in like capacity and manner would use.\n       (H) Claims resolution procedures.--The trustees, in \n     consultation with the trust advisory committee and the legal \n     representative, shall adopt claims resolution procedures that \n     provide for fair and expeditious payment of benefits to all \n     persons described in subparagraph (A). The claims resolution \n     procedures adopted and implemented by the trustees shall \n     contain--\n       (i) pro rata distributions of award amounts that are \n     subject to adjustment, if necessary, based on periodic \n     evaluations of the value of the master trust's assets and \n     estimates of the numbers and values of present and future \n     asbestos claims for benefits that may be awarded by the \n     master trust and other mechanisms that provide reasonable \n     assurance that the master trust will value, and be in a \n     financial position to pay, similarly situated asbestos claims \n     presented to it that involve similar diseases in \n     substantially the same manner;\n       (ii) proof requirements, claim submission procedures, and \n     claim evaluation and allowance procedures that provide for \n     expeditious filing and evaluation of all asbestos claims \n     submitted to the master trust;\n       (iii) provisions for priority review and payment of \n     claimants whose circumstances require expedited evaluation \n     and compensation;\n       (iv) exposure requirements for asbestos claimants to \n     qualify for a remedy that fairly reflect the legal \n     responsibility of at least 1 entity whose liabilities were \n     channeled to an asbestos trust or any class action trust; and\n       (v) review and dispute resolution procedures for disputes \n     regarding the master trust's disallowance or other treatment \n     of claims for benefits.\n       (I) Medical criteria.--The trustees, in consultation with \n     the trust advisory committee and the legal representative, \n     shall adopt and maintain uniform medical criteria that fairly \n     reflect a current state of applicable law and scientific and \n     medical knowledge. The trustees may adopt the medical \n     criteria of section 121.\n\n[[Page S5385]]\n\n       (J) Award amounts.--The trustees, in consultation with the \n     trust advisory committee and the legal representative, shall \n     adopt a matrix of award amounts for disease categories that \n     applies to all claimants who qualify for payment under the \n     medical criteria and claims resolution procedures. The \n     trustees may adopt the matrix of award amounts of section 131 \n     or such other matrix that the trustees determine provides \n     similar benefits for similar claims and fairly reflects the \n     liability of the entities whose liabilities were channeled to \n     the asbestos trusts and any class action trust.\n       (K) Payments to claimants.--The trustees shall pay each \n     qualifying claimant a benefit equal to the product of the \n     master trust payment percentage and the award amount to such \n     claimant.

If the court determines that \n     another forum would be the most appropriate forum for a \n     claim, the court shall dismiss the claim.

Mr. President, today, I join the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Specter, in introducing an amended version of S. \n852, the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2006, the FAIR \nAct. This legislation enhances our previous trust fund bill by adopting \nmany of the amendments filed in February by Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle. We have incorporated amendments that further protect against \nfraud and make sure the sickest victims are paid as soon as possible. \nWe added crucial provisions that make the trust fund accessible to \nvictims who were exposed to asbestos during the attacks on the World \nTrade Center and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. We clarified the bill \nlanguage to ensure that inactive dormant claims cannot be revived to \noverwhelm the trust fund.\n  This legislation also contains a few additional changes that we \nbelieve respond directly to concerns raised by our colleagues during \nfloor debate. The floor amendments incorporated in this bill include, \namong others, the Kyl funding amendment that will protect small and \nmedium sized businesses. We also addressed the concerns of businesses \nthat currently pay nothing or very little because they are well-\ninsured. None of these changes undermine the existing guarantee on \noverall private funding at $140 billion.\n  Also importantly, we preserved the ability of the existing bankruptcy \ntrusts to continue paying impaired victims while the trust fund becomes \noperational. This will smooth the transition for victims who were \nexposed by companies that are currently protected from suit by \nbankruptcy. And finally, we clarified the statute of limitations for \nour Nation's war veterans so they will have better access to the trust \nfund.\n  None of the additional provisions contained in this substitute \ndiminish the bill's key principle: That the asbestos trust fund will be \ncomprised solely of private money. Nothing in this bill will reduce the \nprotection of victims against insurance subrogation. I am proud to \nreport that we have also maintained our core medical criteria so that \nthose who have been impaired by asbestos exposure will receive \ncompensation appropriate to their injuries.\n  Earlier this week, we were all saddened to learn of the passing of \nJudge Edward R. Becker. As many of my colleagues are keenly aware, \nJudge Becker worked patiently with Senators and all of the stakeholders \non this legislation for almost 3 years. We engaged in an exhaustive \nprocess of committee hearings, deliberations and negotiations. Judge \nBecker was crucial to each step in the process. We would not have made \nthe bipartisan progress that this legislation reflects without his \ntireless efforts.\n  Unfortunately, time is running out for this session of Congress. I \nknow that some partisans will claim that we should refrain from \nreaching across the aisle during an election year but this persistent \nproblem compels us to move forward to try and help the thousands of \nvictims of asbestos exposure. I urge the Senate majority leader to give \nus sufficient floor time to debate and vote on this important \nlegislation on its merits.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLEN (for himself, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Craig, Mr. \n        Inhofe, Mr. Lott, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Ensign, Mr. \n        Martinez, Mr. Burr, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Sununu, and Mr. Thune):\n  S 3275. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide a \nnational standard in accordance with which nonresidents of a State may \ncarry concealed firearms in the State; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself, my good \nfriend from Nebraska, Senator Nelson, and 11 other Senators--Senators \nCraig, Inhofe, Lott, Dole, Vitter, Ensign, Martinez, Burr, Crapo, \nSununu, and Thune--to introduce legislation to amend title 18, United \nStates Code, to provide a national standard under which nonresidents of \na State may carry concealed firearms in the State. The bill is a \ncompanion bill to H.R. 4547, which Congressmen Cliff Stearns of Florida \nand Rick Boucher of Virginia have introduced in the House.\n  Our bill would allow any person with a valid concealed carry permit \nor license issued by a State to carry a concealed firearm in any other \nState if they meet certain criteria. The laws of\n\n[[Page S5389]]\n\neach State that govern where concealed firearms may be carried would \nstill apply and would be fully respected within its borders. The bill \nwould simply require States to recognize each other's concealed carry \npermits and licenses, just as they recognize drivers' licenses. It \nwould not create a Federal licensing system.\n  The right-to-carry movement has enjoyed great success throughout our \nNation. To cite just one example, the murder rate in my Commonwealth of \nVirginia has plunged a dramatic 40 percent since the right-to-carry law \nthat I signed as Governor took effect in 1995.\n  This is commonsense legislation. It recognizes that Congress has \naffirmed an individual's right to carry firearms for ``protective \npurposes in the Gun Control Act, 1968, and in the Firearm Owners' \nProtection Act, 1986. In addition, last year, when this Congress passed \nthe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act on a strong bi-partisan \nvote, we preserved all law-abiding citizens' access to firearms and \nammunition for all lawful purposes, including, of course, self-defense.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join with Senator Nelson and me in \ncosponsoring this bill to increase the safety of the many law-abiding \nAmericans who have chosen to carry a firearm for protection against \ncriminal attack.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Alexander, \n        and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 3322. A bill to build operational readiness in civilian agencies, \nand for other purposes; considered and passed.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, this legislation is the result of a \nconversation begun in 2003 between members of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee and the leadership of the State Department. Since \nthat time, the legislation has gone through a number of evolutions and \nhas passed the committee unanimously both as a freestanding bill and as \npart of the State Department authorization bill. I am asking the Senate \nto pass it now as a free-standing bill.\n  International crises are inevitable, and in most cases, U.S. national \nsecurity interests will be threatened by sustained instability. The war \non terrorism necessitates that we not leave nations crumbling and \nungoverned. We have already seen how terrorists can exploit nations \nafflicted by lawlessness and desperate circumstances. They seek out \nsuch places to establish training camps, recruit new members, and tap \ninto a global black market in weapons.\n  In this international atmosphere, the United States must have the \nright structures, personnel, and resources in place when an emergency \noccurs. A delay in our response of a few weeks, or even days, can mean \nthe difference between success and failure. Clearly we need a full \nrange of tools to prevail. Our committee's focus has been on boosting \nthe civilian side of our stabilization and reconstruction capabilities, \nwhile encouraging improved mechanisms for civilian and military \nagencies to work together on these missions.\n  Over the years, our Government has cobbled together plans, people, \nand projects to respond to post-conflict situations in the Balkans, in \nAfghanistan, in Iraq, and elsewhere. The efforts of those engaged have \nbeen valiant, but these emergencies have been complex and time \nsensitive. In my judgment, our ad hoc approach has been inadequate to \ndeal quickly and efficiently with complex emergencies. In turn, our \nlack of preparation for immediate stabilization contingencies has made \nour subsequent reconstruction efforts more difficult and expensive.\n  This legislation builds on legislation, S. 2127, that Senators Biden \nand Hagel and I introduced in early 2004 to encourage and support a \nwell-organized, sufficiently resourced and strongly led civilian \ncounterpart to the military in post-conflict zones. It is our view that \nthe civilian side needs both operational capability and a significant \nsurge capacity. This legislation gives statutory status to the State \nDepartment's Office of the Coordinator of Reconstruction and \nStabilization and makes the position of Coordinator subject to the \nadvice and consent of the Senate. The legislation authorizes the \nestablishment of a civilian response corps with both Active-Duty and \nReserve components and provides the office flexibility in personnel \nmanagement, pay, and benefits to build that corps and create surge \ncapacity in an emergency. Finally, it authorizes expenditures for a \ncrisis response fund, for the civilian response corps, and for a \nsubstantial training, planning and operational capacity for the office.\n  The State Department has come a long way in recognizing the role it \ncould and should be playing. It established the Office of the \nCoordinator of Reconstruction and Stabilization in July of 2004. Under \nthe leadership of Carlos Pascual, the office conducted a government-\nwide inventory of the civilian assets that might be available for \nstabilization and reconstruction tasks in post-conflict zones. It has \nundertaken the planning necessary to recruit, train, and organize a \nReserve corps of civilians for rapid deployment. It also is formulating \ninteragency contingency plans--informed by our past experiences--for \ncountries and regions of the world where the next crisis could suddenly \narise.\n  In December 2005, the President signed a directive putting the \nSecretary of State in charge of interagency stabilization and \nreconstruction efforts. Last month, Secretary Rice promised to dedicate \n15 of the 100 new positions she is requesting for fiscal year 2007 to \nthe Reconstruction and Stabilization Office. This will increase staff \nto about 95 individuals, with seconded personnel and contractors \nincluded in that count.\n  Despite this good progress, significant gaps in our capabilities \nremain. Our legislation calls for a 250-person Active-Duty corps, in \naddition to the Reserves, made up of both State Department and OSAID \nemployees. Such a corps could be rapidly deployed with the military for \nboth initial assessments and operational purposes. They would be the \nfirst civilian team on the ground in post-conflict situations, well in \nadvance of the establishment of an embassy. This Active-Duty corps \nwould be able to do a wide range of civilian jobs that are needed in a \npost-conflict or otherwise hostile environment.\n\n  Such a 250-person corps would be no larger than the typical Army \ncompany, but it would be a force multiplier. It would be equipped with \nthe authority and training to take broad operational responsibility for \nstabilization missions. Establishment of such a corps is a modest \ninvestment when seen as part of the overall national security budget. \nEven in peace time, we maintain Active-Duty military forces of almost \n1.4 million men and women who train and plan for the possibility of \nwar. Given how critical post-conflict situations have been to American \nnational security in the last decade, I believe it is reasonable to \nhave a mere 250 civilians who are training for these situations and are \ncapable of being deployed anywhere in the world, at any time they may \nbe needed.\n  This legislation also calls on the heads of other executive branch \nagencies to establish personnel exchange programs designed to enhance \nstabilization and reconstruction capacity. The Departments of \nAgriculture, Treasury, Commerce, Health and Human Services--indeed \nvirtually all the civilian agencies--can make unique contributions to \nthe overall effort.\n  Once the Department embraced the concept of organizing and leading \nthe civilian effort, the main roadblock became resources. So far, only \nabout $21 million has been provided for the operations of the office, \ndespite administration requests for substantially more funding. For \n2007, the administration has requested a $75 million crisis response \nfund to be made available as a contingency for stabilization and \nreconstruction crises. Of this amount, the administration would like to \nspend $25 million for the organization, training, and emergency \ndeployment of the Reserve component of the response corps. This \nlegislation authorizes the crisis response fund and $80 million for the \noperations of the new State Department office and the Active-Duty \ncorps, including training, equipment, and travel.\n  So far, the office has heroically stretched dollars by recruiting \npersonnel on detail from other agencies, taking advantage of DOD-funded \ntraining, and getting the State Department to pay for the overhead of \nnew office space from other sources. But such a hand-to-mouth existence \nhas obvious disadvantages. Detailed personnel rarely stay long, and \ninstitutional memory\n\n[[Page S5390]]\n\nbecomes short. Relying on DOD funds puts the office in the passenger \nseat when it should have the resources to pursue uniquely civilian-\noriented goals.\n  In addition, the crisis response fund outlined in our legislation has \nnot been appropriated. On the Senate side, we were able to secure $20 \nmillion for the fund in the fiscal year 2006 Foreign Operations \nAppropriations bill. The entire amount, however, was eliminated in the \nconference committee with the House.\n  One stopgap measure that the Congress did pass in fiscal year 2006 \nwas the authority to transfer up to $100 million from the Pentagon to \nthe State Department for boosting the civilian response to particular \ntrouble spots. However, this money will not provide the resources \nnecessary over the long term to improve the State Department's capacity \nto be a capable partner in responding to complex emergencies.\n  The foreign affairs budget is always a tougher sell to Congress than \nthe military budget. President Bush has attempted to reverse the \ndownward spiral in overall foreign affairs spending that took place in \nthe 1990s. In that decade, both the executive and legislative branches \nrushed to cash in on the peace dividend. But President Bush has \nconsistently requested increases for the 150 Account in his budgets. \nFor the fiscal year 2007 budget, he requested a 10.3-percent increase \nover the CBO-determined baseline of fiscal year 2006.\n  But, if previous years are any example, the amount appropriated will \nfall far short of the amount requested. Last year, the President's \nannual request for foreign affairs was cut by $2.1 billion. The \nCongress cut the fiscal 2005 annual request by a similar amount. \nAccording to a Congressional Research Service report that I requested, \nCongress has provided $5.8 billion less than the President has \nrequested for foreign affairs in regular and supplemental spending \nbills since September 11, 2001.\n  Today, when we are in the midst of a global struggle of information \nand ideas: when anti-Western riots can be set off by the publication of \na cartoon; when we are in the midst of a crisis with Iran that will \ndecide whether the nonproliferation regime of the last half century \nwill be abandoned; when we have entered our fourth year of attempting \nto stabilize Iraq; and when years of effort to move the Arab-Israeli \npeace process are at risk--even then, we are unable to muster the \nnecessary support for the President's budget in foreign affairs.\n  As all this suggests, we have a long way to go in creating the kind \nof robust civilian capacity that we need. Both the State Department and \nthe Defense Department are keenly aware of the importance of this \nlegislation. If we cannot think this through and plan better as a \ngovernment, the United States may come to depend even more on our \nmilitary for tasks and functions far beyond its current role. But I \nremain optimistic that we can build on the progress already made to \ncreate a strong and reliable civilian component that boosts our \nstabilization and reconstruction capabilities. Passing this legislation \nwill demonstrate that there is a keen understanding in the Senate that \nwe need to move forward. It will support executive branch actions \nalready taken and encourage further progress. I urge its passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUNNING (for himself, Mr. Obama, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Burns, and \n        Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 3325. A bill to promote coal-to-liquid fuel activities; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Coal-to-\nLiquid Fuel Promotion Act of 2006. Last month, I chaired an Energy \nCommittee hearing on this promising technology that can turn coal into \ndiesel fuel. Working with industry and the scientific community, I have \nput together a comprehensive piece of legislation with the goal of \nproviding the right combination of incentives to create a backbone of \ncoal-to-liquids infrastructure in the United States.\n  The first step is for the Department of Energy to help with planning \nthese large-scale coal-to-liquids plants. This legislation will create \na loan program where the private sector can obtain a loan of up to $20 \nmillion, matched dollar-for-dollar by non-federal money, to pay for the \nsignificant costs of planning, permitting and engineering a coal-to-\nliquid facility. This program will have minimal cost to the taxpayers \nas these loans will be repaid, within 5 years, after a planned plant is \nfinanced. The federal government will also provide loan guarantees for \ncoal-to-liquids facilities by expanding the program authorized in the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005.\n  It is not enough to simply help engineer plants or provide a loan \nguarantee--there must be an economic motivation for investors to put up \nthe $1 to $2 billion it costs to build a large-scale coal-to-liquids \nplant. To that end, this bill will create a separate investment tax \ncredit for coal-to-liquids technology. It will also extend the fuel tax \ncredit for coal-to-liquids fuels until 2020. The combination of these \nincentives will be the one-two punch needed to jumpstart investment in \nthis marketplace. This package of incentives is essential to developing \na domestic coal-to-liquid fuels market.\n  With this domestically produced fuel from coal, we can bring down gas \nprices and be closer to energy independence. And these two goals, which \nare essential to our national security, bring me to the last part of \nthis legislation. The Department of Defense consumes large amounts of \nfuel--for our airplanes, ships and tanks--and nearly all of it is based \non petroleum and too much of it comes from the Middle East. It is time \nwe ensure that our military has a safe, domestic source of \ntransportation fuel. My legislation will authorize funding for the \ncontinued testing and evaluation of coal-to-liquid fuels by the \nmilitary. It includes authorization to engage in long-term contracts \nwith producers to ensure a stable, domestic fuel for our armed forces. \nThis bill also authorizes the Department of Energy and Department of \nDefense to evaluate coal-to-liquids fuels for storage in the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve and allows the government to turn to this domestic \nsource of fuel for filling the reserve.\n  With this legislation America can take a huge step toward energy \nindependence. My bill will foster a domestic marketplace for coal-to-\nliquids fuels, bring down gasoline costs and provide our military with \na secure, domestic fuel source. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. McCain, Mr. \n        Frist, Mr. Reid, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Allard, Mr. Allen, Mr. \n        Bennett, Mr. Biden, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brownback, \n        Mr. Bunning, Mr. Burns, Mr. Burr, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Chambliss, \n        Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins, Mr. DeWine, Mrs. Dole, \n        Mr. Domenici, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Hagel, \n        Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \n        Leahy, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Menendez, \n        Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Obama, Mr. Salazar, Mr. \n        Santorum, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Smith, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Sununu, \n        Mr. Voinovich, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S.J. Res. 38. A joint resolution approving the renewal of import \nrestrictions contained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of \n2003, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today, along with my colleagues, \nSenators Feinstein and McCain, I rise to introduce an extension of the \nBurmese Freedom and Democracy Act.\n  We are joined by a host of original cosponsors: Senators Frist, Reid, \nAlexander, Allard, Allen, Bennett, Biden, Bingaman, Boxer, Brownback, \nBunning, Burns, Burr, Chafee, Chambliss, Clinton, Cochran, Collins, \nDeWine, Dole, Domenici, Durbin, Ensign, Feingold, Hagel, Harkin, \nKennedy, Kerry, Kohl, Kyl, Leahy, Lieberman, Lugar, Martinez, Menendez, \nMikulski, Murkowski, Obama, Salazar, Santorum, Sarbanes, Smith, \nStabenow, Sununu, Voinovich, and Wyden.\n  This broad bipartisan coalition reflects the overwhelming consensus \nwithin this body that the issue of freedom in Burma--and the immediate \nthreat that that country poses to the entire region--is one of major \nimportance. To put it simply, America has a moral obligation to \ncontinue to stand with the Burmese people against the country's \ndictatorial regime, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC).\n\n[[Page S5391]]\n\n  As many of you know, last year the extension of sanctions was signed \ninto law by President Bush on July 27, 2005, and it enjoyed strong \nbipartisan support. It passed the Senate by a vote of 97-1.\n  The past year has brought more news from Burma that has ranged from \nthe disconcerting to the horrific. First, the SPDC inexplicably decided \nto move the nation's capital from Rangoon to the hinterlands. Thus, \ninstead of using state resources for the betterment of the Burmese \npeople, who desperately need it, the SPDC will use state funds to build \na brand new, unneeded capital located deep within the interior.\n  Second, Nobel Peace Prize winner Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and scores of \nother prisoners of conscience remain imprisoned by the SPDC. There are \nrumors that she may be released soon, and I hope they prove true.\n  Third, last fall the SPDC began a brutal military campaign against \nethnic minorities, creating thousands of new internally displaced \npersons (IDPs); these thousands to be added to the approximately half \nmillion already without a home in Burma. Burma has the biggest IDP \nproblem in Asia, Mr. President.\n  This bill ensures that the United States will not be a party to such \nbrutality and oppression. As in the past, the legislation prohibits \nimports into the United States from Burma. The bill also maintains a \nfreeze on the assets held by Burmese Government officials in U.S. \nfinancial institutions. In addition, the bill authorizes the President \nto assist democracy activists dedicated to nonviolent opposition to the \nregime in Burma.\n  America is not alone in the effort to promote freedom and democracy \nin that nation. In addition to our allies in Europe, the ASEAN Inter-\nParliamentary Myanmar Caucus, a grouping of members of parliament from \nsix countries in ASEAN, just this week issued a strong statement on \nBurma. The group called on the U.N. Security Council to ``adopt[] a \nresolution on Burma that would empower them to intervene in Burma's \ncrises. It is time for real action. It is time for a new, democratic \nand peaceful Burma.''\n  Clearly, it is time for the Security Council to discuss and debate a \nlegally-binding, nonpunitive resolution on Burma that calls for the \nimmediate and unconditional release of Suu Kyi and all other political \nprisoners in that country; an end to abuses against minorities \n(including the use of rape as a weapon of war); and the beginning of a \nmeaningful national reconciliation process that includes the unfettered \nparticipation of the National League for Democracy (NLD) and ethnic \nminorities with the SPDC.\n  Let me be clear that a briefing on Burma before the U.N. Security \nCouncil by U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Ibrahim \nGambari should not serve as a substitute for a resolution on this \nmatter. We need less talk and more action at the U.N. in support of \ndemocracy, freedom and justice in Burma.\n  Let me offer a comment or two about Mr. Gambari's recent visit to \nBurma. I do not share his optimistic view that the SPDC is ready to \n``turn the page.'' In my view, the junta is only interested in \ndeflecting and deflating growing pressure by the international \ncommunity to change its repressive ways--and in avoiding the U.N. \nSecurity Council's consideration of a resolution that addresses the \nthreat the SPDC poses to its own people and the entire region. This may \nexplain why rumors of Suu Kyi's release abound.\n  However, even if Suu Kyi were to be released there is no reason--\nabsolutely none--for anyone to decrease pressure on the junta. The SPDC \nis to be judged not by what it says--we've certainly heard much of the \nsame before--but by what it does. We have yet to see any evidence of \nthe formation of a credible reconciliation process that includes the \nfull and unfettered participation of the National League for Democracy \nand ethnic nationalities--who, by the way, are being slaughtered and \nraped by an ongoing military offensive waged by the junta.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Feinstein, Frist, Brownback, \nLautenberg, Durbin, Feingold, Mikulski and Lugar in sending a letter to \nPresident Bush today asking that the United States work to secure a \nresolution at the Security Council as soon as possible.\n  Until the SPDC's demonstrates by its actions that it is serious about \nreconciliation and reform in Burma, the international community has no \nchoice but to use more sticks--and less carrots--to increase pressure \non the junta.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today once again with my friend \nand colleague Senator McConnell to introduce legislation to renew the \nban on all imports from Burma for another year.\n  Our legislation also amends the original Burmese Freedom and \nDemocracy Act of 2003 to allow the sanctions to be renewed, one year at \na time, for up to 6 years.\n  It is critical that the Congress and the administration send a strong \nsignal to the military junta, the State Peace and Development Council, \nthat our resolve has not weakened and we are still committed to a free \nand democratic Burma. Unless the SPDC makes ``substantial and \nmeasurable progress'' towards a true national dialogue on national \nreconciliation and recognition of the results of the 1990 elections--\ndecisively won by the National League for Democracy--the import ban \nmust remain in place.\n  Let us review the facts.\n  Aung San Suu Kyi, Nobel Peace Prize recipient and leader of the \nNational League for Democracy, remains under house arrest. She has \nspent the better part of the past 16 years imprisoned or under house \narrest.\n  The human rights situation in Burma is deplorable and demands a \nclear, unified response from the international community: 1,300 \npolitical prisoners are still in jail; according to a report by the \nAsian human rights group, Assistance Association for Political \nPrisoners, 127 democracy activists have been tortured to death since \n1988; 70,000 child soldiers have been forcibly recruited; the practice \nof rape as a form of repression has been sanctioned by the Burmese \nmilitary; use of forced labor is widespread; human trafficking is \nrampant; and the government engages in the production and distribution \nof opium and methamphetamine.\n  Senator McConnell and I coauthored the ``Burmese Freedom and \nDemocracy Act of 2003'' which imposed a complete ban on all imports \nfrom Burma.\n  It was overwhelmingly renewed in 2004 and 2005, and now Congress has \nthe opportunity to reauthorize the sanctions for one more year.\n  But the United States cannot act alone. The United Nations and the \ninternational community have a vital role to play.\n  Along with Senator McConnell and others, we have repeatedly made the \ncase that given the numerous human rights abuses, the spread of HIV/\nAIDS, the illicit production and trafficking of narcotics, and the \ntrafficking of human beings by the military junta, the situation in \nBurma should be referred to the United Nations Security Council for \ndebate and appropriate action.\n  A recent report by former Czech president Vaclav Havel and retired \narchbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa--``Threat to Peace: A Call for \nthe UN Security Council to Act on Burma''--confirms the need for U.N. \nintervention. It details how the situation in Burma fulfills each of \nthe criteria used for past intervention by the Security Council: \noverthrow of an elected government; armed conflicts with ethnic \nminorities; widespread human right violations; outflow of refugees, \nover 700,000; and drug production and trafficking and the spread of \nHIV/AIDS.\n\n  It is time for the United Nations to act on this report and debate \nand pass a binding, nonpunitive, resolution on Burma that recognizes \nthe threat the regime poses to the region and calls for Suu Kyi and all \nprisoners of conscience to be released.\n  Some may argue that because Suu Kyi remains under house arrest and \nthe Burmese people lack basic human rights and a representative \ngovernment, the sanctions have failed and it is time to lift the import \nban.\n  I could not disagree more.\n  First, Aung San Suu Kyi and the democratic opposition continue to \nsupport a ban on all imports from Burma.\n  If we lift this ban now, without any measure of progress towards \ndemocracy and human rights, we will turn our backs on them and give \ncomfort to their oppressors.\n  Second, the international community is coming together to put \npressure on Burma.\n\n[[Page S5392]]\n\n  In July 2005, ASEAN forced Burma to forgo its scheduled rotation as \nchairman of the organization.\n  On December 16, 2005, the U.N. Security Council debated the situation \nin Burma for the first time.\n  Next week, United Nations Undersecretary for Political Affairs will \nbrief members of the Security Council on his meeting with Suu Kyi, her \nfirst meeting with a foreigner since 2004.\n  Why would we turn back now when the military junta is increasingly \nisolated and the plight of the Burmese people is on the agenda of the \ninternational community?\n  Indeed, while we are far from our goal of a free and democratic \nBurma, we are making progress and we should stay the course.\n  I remind my colleagues that under the provisions of this legislation, \nwe will have the opportunity to debate sanctions on Burma every year. \nThat is how it should be.\n  Sanctions are not a panacea for every foreign policy dispute. But, \nwhen they are backed by a robust international response, they can be \neffective and they can compel change.\n  Archbishop Desmond Tutu has rightly said, ``As long as [Suu Kyi] \nremains under house arrest, not one of us is truly free''.\n  Today I urge the SPDC to release Aung San Suu Kyi, recognize the 1990 \nelections, and engage in a true dialogue with the National League for \nDemocracy.\n  I urge the United Nations Security Council to debate and pass a \nbinding, non-punitive resolution on Burma that recognizes the threat \nthe regime poses to the region and calls for Suu Kyi and all prisoners \nof conscience to be released.\n  And, finally, I urge United States Senate to renew the sanctions on \nBurma for another year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/26/senate-section/article/S5392-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 496--COMMENDING THE KANSAS CITY KANSAS COMMUNITY \n     COLLEGE DEBATE TEAM FOR THEIR NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP VICTORIES\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. Roberts) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

We will have a few more in a \nlittle bit that we have agreed to on both sides. We have completed an \nimmigration bill that we worked on for about a month--initially, for 2 \nweeks, then a pause, and then for the last 2 weeks--a bill that, as I \nsaid yesterday, does reflect the will of this body. Not everybody \nagrees with it. Not anybody, I think, agrees with everything in that \nlegislation. But it is comprehensive legislation that demonstrates that \nwe are governing, addressing the very real problems, real challenges \nthat face us in America today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/26/senate-section/article/S5393-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5393-S5394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MARRIAGE PROTECTION AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. When we come back we will deal with a range of issues. I \nwill have a little more to say about that in a bit, but the first issue \nwe will come back to has to do with another institution, the \ninstitution of marriage.\n  Throughout human history and culture, the union of a man and a woman \nhas been recognized as the essential cornerstone of society. For \nmillennia, marriage has served as a public act, a civil institution to \nbind men and women in the task of producing and nurturing their \noffspring. In some eras it has existed apart from romance, love, and \nmutual regard. In ours, we have embraced the ideal of marriage that \ndeepens and enriches the bonds of love, that grows with every shared \nmemory, endeavor, and challenge: husband and wife, father and mother, \nbuilding a family and a community over a lifetime.\n  At its root, marriage is and always has been a public institution \nthat formalizes that family bond--its intent to further the community's \ninterest in successfully rearing the next generation of healthy and \nprosperous citizens. But now, this fundamental institution is under \nattack. There is a concerted effort underway to redefine marriage \nagainst millennia of human experience and against the expressed wishes \nof the American people. Activist courts are usurping the power to \ndefine this social institution. And if marriage is redefined for \nanyone, it is redefined for everyone.\n  The threat is real. Just last year voters in 13 States passed by \nenormous margins State constitutional amendments protecting marriage; \n19 States have State constitutional amendments also to protect \nmarriage, and 5 more States have amendments pending. In total, 45 \nStates have either State constitutional amendments or laws to protect \nmarriage.\n  Tennessee will give voters the opportunity to voice their opinions on \nthe sanctity of marriage this November. It is one of seven States with \nsimilar amendments pending to their constitutions. If a marriage \nprotection law passes in Tennessee, we will join those 45 other States \nthat have approved legislation that defines marriage as a union between \na man and a woman and, indeed, no State has ever rejected an effort to \nprotect traditional marriage when it has been on the ballot.\n  So with this progress at the State level that expresses the \noverwhelming support of the American people, what is the problem? Why \ndoes it need to come to the floor of this body?\n  Voting for marriage on the State ballot is not enough to protect the \ninstitution. I need to explain. Because same sex marriage advocates \ncannot win at the ballot box, activists are continuing their campaign \nto convince State and Federal courts to rewrite traditional marriage \nlaws. Currently, nine States have lawsuits pending challenging marriage \nlaws. In five States, courts could redefine marriage by the end of the \nyear--California, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Washington.\n  In California, Maryland, New York, and Washington, State trial courts \nhave already followed Massachusetts and found the definition of \nmarriage in their State constitutions unconstitutional. All these cases \nare on appeal.\n  Already we have seen a Federal judge in Nebraska overturn a \ndemocratically enacted Nebraska State constitutional amendment \nprotecting marriage. That ruling is now under appeal in the Eighth \nCircuit. Another Federal case in Washington challenges the \nconstitutionality of the Federal Defense of Marriage Act. The case is \nstayed, pending resolution of litigation in the Washington State \nSupreme Court.\n  Because of these attempts to overturn State laws and constitutional \namendments, this Senate needs to act. The American people deserve a \nfull debate on this foundational issue before marriage is redefined for \neveryone. That is why, when we return from the Memorial Day recess, I \nwill bring the marriage protection amendment to the Senate floor to \nensure the definition of marriage endures and remains true to the \nwishes of the majority of the American people.\n  The amendment is straightforward. The amendment is simple. It reads:\n\n       Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the \n     union of a man and a woman. Neither this Constitution, nor \n     the Constitution of any State, shall be construed to require \n     that marriage or the legal incidents thereof be conferred \n     upon any union other than the union of a man and a woman.\n\n  That is it. It is simple, straightforward--it is two sentences. The \ntruth is, on the question of marriage, the Constitution will be \namended. The only question is whether it will be amended by Congress as \nthe representative of the people or by judicial fiat. Will activist \njudges amend the Constitution or will the people amend the Constitution \nto preserve marriage as it has always been understood?\n\n[[Page S5394]]\n\n  I say the people should have a voice. The American people have a \nright to settle the question of what marriage will be in the United \nStates. Marriage is an issue that rightly belongs in the hands of the \npeople, of the American people. So before the courts impose a vast, \nuntested social experiment for which children will bear the ultimate \nconsequence, let the people hold a thorough debate. The matter before \nus is critical. The debate before us is essential. Let it be held now \nfor this and future generations of Americans, and let it ultimately \nlead the way forward.\n\n\n                           MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. President, I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 435, S.J.

Mr. President, on May 30, 1868, mourners placed flowers on \nthe graves of Union and Confederate soldiers at Arlington National \nCemetery in Washington, DC. This marked the first observance of \nMemorial Day.\n  On Monday, America will continue this tradition by honoring our \nNation's fallen soldiers in ceremonies across the country.\n  Ever since GEN George Washington defeated the British at Yorktown, \nAmerican soldiers have honorably defended the cause of liberty in \nconflicts at home and, indeed, around the world.\n  Today, our men and women in uniform are bravely waging the war on \nterror, taking the battle to the enemy so that the enemy does not do \nbattle here at home.\n  America thanks our soldiers for their dedication, for their \ndetermination, and for their patriotism. We honor the 25 million living \nveterans who have served their country in past wars with honor and \ncourage. And we remember those patriots who have given the ultimate \nsacrifice in service to their country.\n  Two years ago, I had the privilege of attending the dedication of the \nNational World War II Memorial. It was the largest gathering of \nsurviving veterans in 60 years and an experience I will never forget. \nOne of the veterans was asked how did they do it, how did ordinary \nyoung men set aside their fear in the face of extraordinary odds \nagainst determined enemies. The veteran replied simply:\n\n       There's nothing else you can do but do your best and keep \n     firing until the ammunition runs out.\n\n  One of the inscriptions on the monument is a quote by President \nTruman. It embodies the patriotic spirit of this annual remembrance. It \nreads:\n\n       Our debt to the heroic men and valiant women in the service \n     of our country can never be repaid. They have earned our \n     undying gratitude. America will never forget their \n     sacrifices.\n\n  So on Monday, we remember, we honor, and we respect America's heroes, \nthe men and women who did their best, and we repay in small measure the \ndebt we owe them for their service and their sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/26/senate-section/article/S5398-4", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5398-S5399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
