Today, we will start with a 30-minute period for morning \nbusiness. After morning business, we will resume consideration of the \ntax reconciliation bill. This morning when we return to that bill, \nthere will be 10 hours remaining under the statutory time limitation. \nIf all time is used, the debate will not run out until 8 tonight, at \nthe earliest. I hope that we will not need all of that time.\n  I encourage the chairman and ranking member to yield back time if it \nis not necessary so that instead of finishing at 8, within that \nstatutory limit, it would be earlier. If there are to be a series of \nvotes, we could start those votes at a much earlier time. If all of \nthat time is used until 8 and we have votes, it is going to be a very \nlong night. So, again, I encourage the chairman and ranking member----\n  Mr. REID. Will the distinguished majority leader yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. I would be glad to.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. I have spoken to our manager of the bill, Senator Baucus. \nHe would agree to have the time that is used for the votes to be \ncounted against the time. That has not been entered yet. I do not think \nSenator Grassley would have any objection to that. Maybe we should \nenter into that agreement at this time.\n  Mr. FRIST. I think that would be ideal. I still think we might be \nable to yield some time back in addition to that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time required for \nvoting be part of the 10 hours that remain in terms of the statutory \nlimit.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in addition to that, I know everybody is \nconcerned about travel plans and when we are going to leave. I have \nbeen very clear throughout that we have business to do. This is the \nlast legislative effort before we leave for Christmas, but it is also \nimportant that we recognize we still have four conference reports that \nare open that we are waiting to bring and take to the floor. So I \nencourage our colleagues to try to close those reports as soon as \npossible. Again, there are four that are outstanding.\n  In addition, I made it very clear that we are going to address the \nPATRIOT Act legislation before we leave. There are good discussions \nunderway. I know those discussions were continuing late into last \nnight. I encourage all of our colleagues to understand the importance \nof that legislation. We want to get it right and make sure that it is \nin good shape to bring to the floor, but we do need to address that \nbefore we leave.\n  Terrorism reinsurance, TRIA, is another issue that is coming along \nwell. It is very important legislation, and there has been a lot of \nwork, but we need to actually bring that to the floor as soon as \npossible. We have a number of nominations that are being considered, \nand we will have to make certain decisions on those over the next 24 \nhours.\n  Lastly, I am running through the list in my own mind of things we \nhave to do before we leave, a continuing resolution--I was talking to \nthe Democratic leader about the continuing resolution which we have to \ndo to keep the Government open--will be coming from the House sometime \ntoday. Because the President has to sign that by tomorrow night, we \nneed to act expeditiously on that continuing resolution because we \nactually have to physically send that to the President, who is overseas \nat this point.\n\n  So we have a lot of work to do. We will stay here tomorrow and into \nSaturday and, if we have to, go into the\n\n[[Page S13068]]\n\nearly part of next week, which we should not have to do but we will in \norder to finish the Nation's business. The time that we come back in \nDecember, if we come back in December--and I think that the Democratic \nleader and I have been very open that we have to plan on coming back \nfor a short period of time, not knowing what we are going to be able to \nfinish today, tomorrow, Saturday, and Monday, but in all likelihood we \nwill have to come back for a couple of days in December, but that is \nnot a time that we will be doing new legislation. I do not want anybody \nto think that if we do not do it now, we are going to be doing it in \nDecember because December will be to come in for as brief a period as \npossible to put the final touches on bills we cannot finish. So we have \nto finish the work right now.\n  I am going to make a brief statement on another issue but will turn \nto the Democratic issue on the schedule.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Just a question. If it is determined that we come back, it \nis my understanding it would not be until the 12th of December, at the \nearliest; is that the Senator's feelings at this time?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, again, because it is so unclear to people, \nwhat we have said is it will not be before December 12. It will not \nnecessarily be on the 12th either but during that week. I think all of \nour Members--because there are a lot of travel plans that have been \nmade and people are going back to their States and overseas, we are \ngoing to have to keep that week flexible, but it would be the intention \nto come back as late in that week as possible, in large part because we \nare waiting for the House to catch up--that is the way I think of it in \nmy own mind--to catch up with legislation. I think that we need to keep \nflexible. My intention is not to bring people back for an entire week.\n  Again, on scheduling, the Democratic leader and I talk about it every \nday, so we will keep people posted, again recognizing the importance of \nthat time to be spent with constituents, family, and overseas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/17/senate-section/article/S13068-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13068-S13069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          GETTING THE JOB DONE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, there is a lot going on in Washington. The \nenvironment seems to be very partisan. When we look at the newspapers, \nwe see the comments that have been made back and forth, but I have to \ntake a couple of minutes and restate what I have mentioned and implied \nover the last several days; that in spite of all of that, in spite of \nthe vitriolic comments that are being made, the Senate, this \ninstitution, is doing its work. It is governing in a way in which I \nthink we can all be proud. If we look over the last 48 hours, one will \nsee how our overall agenda of renewal and reform is being accomplished. \nWe have had several legislative advances that do make America safer and \nmore prosperous. As I mentioned, we will be continuing our work through \ntoday, tomorrow, and possibly Saturday, delivering these meaningful \nsolutions to the real challenges and real problems that everyday people \nare having across this great country. It is important for people to be \nreminded of that.\n  I think of four things that have been started in the last 48 hours: \nThe Defense authorization bill, a very important bill that we spent a \ngood amount of time on with a lot of amendments, but ultimately it \nunderscored our absolute commitment to our troops overseas and to the \ngoals that have been set out by this administration. So I am very proud \nthat we did pass that bill. It gives our soldiers the resources, the \ntraining, the technology and the support they deserve and that they \nabsolutely need to win the global war on terror. I refer to it \noccasionally--I actually put it on my Web site on the front page, the \nZawahiri and Zarqawi letter which outlines what the intentions are of \nal-Qaida in this war on terror. The appropriate responsiveness of this \nbody in this Department of Defense authorization bill speaks very \nimportantly to the response that we need to give to these challenges. \nFrom cutting-edge technologies to the personnel protection systems, the \nbill keeps our military strong so that we absolutely will win this war \nagainst terror.\n  We made the clear-cut statement in this bill that America is not \ngoing to cut and run, as some would have us do; that we are going to \nsupport and continue to train the Iraqi forces until they are strong \nenough to fight on their own. Also, we expressed our absolute support \nfor this President and his policies through this bill.\n  The second issue, along with defending our national security, we are \nstrengthening America's retirement security. Ten days ago, people said \nthere is no way this pensions bill is going to get through the Senate. \nYet yesterday we passed it, and it spoke very loudly to the fact that \nthe defined pensions benefit system is a ticking timebomb, that over 44 \nmillion Americans who are legally covered by the American Government's \nguarantee are in jeopardy of losing their hard-earned retirement \nbenefits. This bill makes it clear that promises made by employers are \npromises to be kept to their employees. So we passed that bill \nyesterday, again a major step forward.\n  The third area, the vital function of Government. Yesterday, we \npassed the Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill. Along with \nfunding these Federal agencies, the CJS bill includes significant \nKatrina-related responses. As we all know, more than 350,000 families \nhave been made homeless by the Katrina disaster. A number of us have \nparticipated over the course of this past week in a Habitat for \nHumanity bill project at the Capitol. It reminded me how important it \nis to marry the nonprofit sector, with the nongovernmental \norganizations, with what we on this floor have done in response to \nKatrina and the natural disasters that have struck both this country \nbut indeed around the world. That CJS appropriations bill, in part, \nreflects the public response in that it provides Federal housing \nassistance for up to $600 per family per month for up to 6 months to \nhelp get those families back on their feet.\n  This body continues and will continue with its commitment to assist \nthis renewal and recovery from one of, if not the greatest, natural \ndisasters this country has ever seen.\n  Looking a little more globally, another bill that was passed last \nnight that reflects America's compassion for neighbors around the world \nwas a bill that means a lot to me personally. It is a bipartisan bill \nin this body called the Water for the Poor Act. This bill addresses the \nissue that 1.2 billion people in this world do not have access to what \nwe have sitting on our desk as we are here speaking--clean water. Mr. \nPresident, 1.2 billion people do not have access to water they can look \nat and say it does not have bacteria or viruses in it that will make me \nill.\n\n  The lack of clean water kills more kids under the age of 6 than any \ndisease in the world today, although most people don't pay a lot of \nattention to it, so this body passed a bill last night that addresses \nthat, the Water for the Poor Act. We had bipartisan legislation on the \nfloor of the Senate sponsored by myself and the Democratic leader upon \nwhich this bill is based. It establishes for the first time as a part \nof our foreign policy the development of water interests as we consider \nforeign development aid, this whole provision of safe, clean, renewable \nwater for poor countries. It recognizes that unsafe water in developing \ncountries kills a child every 15 seconds. Every 15 seconds a child dies \nbecause of lack of access to that clean water. It contributes to \npoverty, it contributes to unstable governments, and thus the \nimportance of having clean water be a part of our foreign policy, \nforeign development assistance to these countries.\n  In combination with the $200 million recently enacted for safe water \nin developing countries, this is a critical first step in beginning to \nsolve what is a seemingly insurmountable problem but is a solvable \nproblem. It looks at compassion, it looks at protection, it looks at \naccountability, all of which must be injected in our foreign policy \nwhen it comes to foreign aid.\n  One last issue. In terms of progress made over the last 40 hours, the \nBanking Committee reported Tuesday the nomination of Ben Bernanke to \nsucceed Alan Greenspan as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. I \nam pleased the committee has acted on Mr. Bernanke's nomination and \nthat he has pledged to maintain the Federal Reserve's statutory \nindependence while\n\n[[Page S13069]]\n\nalso maintaining stable, progrowth monetary policies.\n  Chairman Greenspan's 18 years of service will not officially end \nuntil the end of January. Therefore, the full Senate will confirm Mr. \nBernanke as one of its first actions beginning the second session of \nthe 109th Congress.\n  I have run through those five--I said four but five--legislative \nsuccesses that do demonstrate this body continues to move along, \nresponding to the needs and appropriate desires of the American people. \nAt the beginning of the year we set big goals and every day on this \nfloor we are working hard to meet them, and again we are being \nsuccessful meeting each one of these benchmarks.\n  Yes, we have had Katrina, we have had Rita, we have had the natural \ndisasters--the tsunami in Pakistan, we have consistently supported our \ntroops overseas, and in addition we are addressing the issues that, \ndomestically, are on the minds of the American people. I look forward \nto completing our work this week. It is one of the reasons I outlined a \nfew minutes ago the things we have to do before we leave for our \nThanksgiving recess. When we do return to our States, there will be a \nlot we can point back to, responding to the needs of the American \npeople, and we will be absolutely comfortable in looking them in the \neye and saying, yes, we are delivering meaningful solutions to your, \nthe American people's, everyday challenges. Together we are moving \nAmerica forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Chair advise the Senate with regard to the \nallocation of time at this point?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair is advised there is 30 minutes \non each side. The first half of the half hour is under the control of \nthe minority leader or his designee.\n  I am corrected. It is 30 minutes, with the first 15 minutes under the \ncontrol of the minority leader.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would it be appropriate, then, for the Senator from \nVirginia to seek time at this point for about 8 minutes?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is under the control of the minority \nfor the first 15 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/17/senate-section/article/S13069-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13069-S13070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EPA ANALYSIS OF CLEAN AIR LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I will take some time this morning to talk \nabout why we need new clean air legislation. It has been some 15 years \nsince Congress passed the last revisions to the Clean Air Act. No one \ndisputes the fact that we have made significant environmental progress \nsince that time, but our work is not over. Powerplants continue to blow \npollution that causes smog and other air problems in our cities and our \ncommunities. Unless we require powerplants everywhere to reduce the \namount of pollution they emit, we will continue to be faced with poor \nair quality and its dangerous side effects.\n  The idea of reducing pollution from powerplants is not new. We have \nbeen discussing it for years. In fact, when President Bush first ran \nfor the White House, he promised, in 2000, to make new clean air \nlegislation one of his top environmental priorities. Since I came to \nthe Senate in 2001, we have seen a number of proposals on how to \nproceed. Senator Jeffords offered his Clean Power Act. The President \noffered his Clear Skies Act. I, along with Senators Chafee, Gregg, and \nAlexander, offered a proposal that we call the Clean Air Planning Act.\n  I have always believed that our proposal, the third proposal, is the \nright one. While I agree with the principles laid out in the bill by \nSenator Jeffords, I fear it will be too costly and its goals \ntechnologically unachievable. By contrast, the President's plan is too \nweak and would do nothing to reduce our emissions of carbon dioxide, \nwhich we believe contributes to global warming.\n  What we crafted in response to these two proposals was a middle-\nground approach, one that achieved the objectives of the Jeffords bill \nwithout relying on the command and control philosophies of the past. It \nis an approach that reduces pollution further and faster than the \nPresident has visualized, while giving utilities the flexibilities they \nneed and the incentives they need to get the job done right.\n  Since we first introduced that bill some 3 years ago, I have tried to \nget the EPA to conduct an objective scientific analysis of it and how \nit compares with other proposals. We were repeatedly denied. Earlier \nthis year, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee tried to \npush through the President's Clear Skies bill. I again asked for an \nanalysis of our proposal and the other proposals, and we were denied. \nThe administration told me I had all the information I needed and there \nwas no reason to further debate it. I told them without that \ninformation we could not negotiate. On March 8, Clear Skies was voted \non in our committee and it failed on a 9-to-9 vote.\n  Soon after the failure to pass out Clear Skies, President Bush \nnominated Stephen Johnson to be the new head of EPA. Stephen Johnson \nhad impeccable credentials stemming from his long, distinguished career \nwithin the agency. In essence, Mr. Johnson represented the best person \nfor the job. But when he came before our committee to have his \nnomination approved, I voted against him. I think I was the only one. \nThen I placed a hold on his nomination, something I have never done in \nmy 5 years in the Senate. I don't have a problem with Stephen Johnson; \nI had a problem with the way the administration was politicizing EPA \nand keeping the agency from doing its job in providing the information \nthat I and others were requesting.\n  I believe we need this information in order to enable us to craft the \nbest possible clean air bill. I didn't think it was too much to ask \nthat we have a detailed, up-to-date modeling on how our bills would \naffect the economy, the health of our public, and our environment. My \nhold was eventually overridden, I think by two votes. But to my \nsurprise, my pleasant surprise, once Stephen Johnson became \nadministrator, he offered to model the economic, the health, and the \nenvironmental impact of the various clean air proposals.\n  I say right now on the floor that I very much appreciate Stephen \nJohnson's willingness to grant my request. It says a lot about what \nkind of man he is, and that he is willing to break through the logjam \nin trying to meet our years-long request.\n  Last month, on October 27, Stephen Johnson and some of his senior \nleadership from EPA delivered the analysis they have done. It is my \nhope their analysis from EPA will take the debate that has been going \non for a number of years to the next level.\n  After reviewing the details of the analysis, it clearly shows, \nperhaps ironically, that we can do better than the President's Clear \nSkies plan. In fact, it shows we can get much better environmental and \nhealth benefits than Clear Skies at only a slightly higher cost.\n  On the issue of climate change, the analysis shows we can regulate \ncarbon dioxide cheaply and without worrying that we will hurt coal \nproduction or drive up natural gas prices. Let me explain, using a few \ncharts from the EPA analysis.\n  The first chart, ``Projected Emissions From Electric Generating \nUnits''--there are four of them. The first we will look at is sulfur \ndioxide emissions from electric generators. We have three proposals we \ncan actually see. This yellow-golden line is a proposal called the \nClean Power Act offered by Senator Jeffords. This line here is actually \nseveral lines that overlap, but it is Clear Skies and current law, the \nPresident's proposal. The green line here is the Clean Air Planning Act \nthat Senators Chafee, Alexander, Gregg, and I had offered. This is \n2005. This is where we are right now.\n\n  If the legislation were adopted, you see a spike in sulfur dioxide \nemission from the Jeffords proposal. Then it drops down lower than the \nothers.\n  What you see here with sulfur dioxide emissions--the President's \nproposal is the same as current law.\n  What you see here for the bipartisan proposal the other three \nRepublicans and I offered is something that gets us deeper cuts in \nsulfur dioxide emissions, far deeper than the proposal of the \nadministration, and far deeper than that of current law, and eventually \nsomewhere in between where the Jeffords bill is and where the \nPresident's proposal is.\n\n[[Page S13070]]\n\n  Coming over here, looking at emissions of mercury from electric \ngenerators, we find the greatest cuts, the deepest cuts, come in 2010. \nThey come from the Jeffords proposal, not surprisingly. The \nadministration's proposals are right here--not much different from \ncurrent law. The proposal that the three Republican Senators--Chafee, \nAlexander, Gregg--and myself offered is somewhere in between. Actually \nour cuts are a little deeper than in the Jeffords proposal between now \nand 2010, and his mercury cuts are a bit further than ours in the \nsubsequent years.\n  Right here, the third box here, let's look at nitrogen oxide \nemissions. Again, the deepest cuts are from the Jeffords proposal. The \nPresident's Clear Skies proposal--they are all sort of lumped together, \nand our bipartisan proposal does a little bit better with nitrogen \noxide emissions. I think it is kind of interesting, for the nitrogen \noxide emissions we are not that far apart. There is a considerable \ndifference between us and the administration on sulfur dioxide and \nmercury, but we are pretty close together on nitrogen oxide.\n  Here are CO2 emissions. The yellow line, the Jeffords \nproposals: some reductions between now and 2010, pretty level in the \noutyears. My proposal doesn't go as far, but it holds the \nCO2 emissions pretty level until the end of the next decade. \nUnder the President's proposal, under Clear Skies and current law, \nCO2 levels continue to rise and emissions continue to rise.\n  The next chart we are going to look at actually lets us see what the \nprice is of reducing CO2 emissions. This for me was maybe \nthe biggest surprise of all.\n  In order to reduce emissions of CO2 by a ton starting in \n2010, under the Jeffords proposal it is $16 a ton--pretty expensive. By \n2020, to get a ton of CO2 reduction out of the Jeffords \nClean Power Act--$27 a ton. But look at this. The proposal that \nSenators Chafee, Alexander, Gregg, and I offered, our proposal--one ton \nof CO2 reduction in 2010 costs $1. It is $1 per ton in 2015. \nIt is $2 per ton in 2020.\n  Given that low cost, my question to my colleagues and the \nadministration is, What are we waiting for? Let's get started.\n  We have a third proposal, a third chart here. The third chart \nactually looks at what we could get for our money, for our efforts on \nreducing areas of nonattainment for particulates, the microscopic stuff \nthat gets in our lungs and causes all kinds of breathing disorders. Now \nwe are looking at nondesignated areas that exist. There are about 40 of \nthem around the country that are nonattainment for small particulate \nmatter. Under the Carper proposal and under the Jeffords proposal, we \nreduce that almost by three-fourths, down to about 10 in each of those. \nThe administration goes down about half. We continue to show \nconsiderably fewer nonattainment areas for particulate matter by 2020 \nunder the Jeffords proposal, which is the lowest, and our proposal, \nwhich is next to the lowest.\n  The second chart shows nonattainment areas for ozone. There are a lot \nof nonattainment areas right now--about 126. If you come up to 2010, \nthere is a dramatic reduction. We go down to about 20. Frankly, the \nachievements are across the board. Each of the proposals is about the \nsame with respect to reducing ozone.\n  This chart lets us look at annual monetary health benefits of \nreducing fine particles and ozone. We find in 2010 that my proposal has \nquantifiable--according to the EPA--health benefits of about anywhere \nfrom $110 billion per year to almost $130 billion. That is almost twice \nwhat we get under the Clear Skies proposal and under current law; not \nquite as much as is achieved under the Jeffords proposal. We find in \neach of the outyears--2015 and 2020--we also have considerably better \nhealth benefits that we can demonstrate, in the view of the EPA, \nbetween 2010 and 2020.\n  Let me wrap it up by saying that we can do better for our \nenvironment, we can do better for our health, and, frankly, I think we \ncan do at least as well for our economy by taking this middle-ground \napproach that Senators Alexander, Gregg, Chafee, and I have outlined.\n  In terms of health consequences alone, under our proposal, 10,000 \nfewer people will suffer from chronic bronchitis in 2010. Think about \nthat--10,000 fewer people throughout this country in 1 year will suffer \nfrom chronic bronchitis. In 2010, we will see some 14,000 fewer \nhospital admissions and emergency room visits. In 2010, there will be \nabout 160,000 people who will no longer have asthma attacks in this \ncountry. And in 2010, companies will have over 1 million fewer lost \nworkdays. These benefits are real. They will have a dramatic impact on \nthe quality of people's lives, and they will have a dramatic impact on \nworker productivity as well.\n  Since 2001, both Republicans and Democrats have been arguing over \nmultipollutant legislation. Now with an apple-to-apple comparison of \nvarious proposals from EPA, I think we can have a process with not just \nmeaningful legislation but that which will get us off the dime and get \nus to work on improving the quality of our health and doing it in a way \nthat doesn't break the bank for consumers or the utility companies.\n  Over the coming months, I will continue to work with my colleagues, \nthe administration, the utility industry, and environmental groups to \ndevelop legislation that has strong bipartisan support.\n  Early next year, we will reintroduce a new and I think improved Clean \nAir Planning Act, and soon after that I hope to sit down with my \nfriend, Senator Voinovich, and others to develop a bipartisan \ncompromise we can take through the committee and bring to the floor, \nhopefully, for action.\n  There are five principles we should stick to if we want to get a \nclean air bill.\n  Climate change must be addressed. As we have seen from EPA, it can be \naddressed for $1 a ton in reduction of CO2.\n  We should start to improve the environment of people's health as \nquickly as possible. We can do that.\n  We should provide industry with the regulatory certainty they need \nand which they have been asking for--and some flexibility, too.\n  We should protect our economy.\n  We should pass stronger protections than those which we already have \non the books.\n  I want to get legislation done. I came here to get things done, and I \nknow my colleagues did, as well. I believe that together we can develop \na proposal that will help us achieve just that. Again, we can do \nbetter. We shouldn't let politics get in the way of doing the right \nthing.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Madam President, the Committee on Armed Services has been \nworking very conscientiously, as we should--and, indeed, all Senators \nshould--on the question of the IEDs in Iraq and in Afghanistan.\n  Yesterday, our committee invited over from the War College 10 young \nofficers, each of them having commanded a battalion of U.S. Army, U.S. \nMarines, and, in some instances, some Navy as the Navy is taking a very \nsignificant role in the ground operations in Iraq.\n  I have had the privilege of being associated with men and women of \nthe U.S. military for many years, but I never saw 10 finer individuals. \nI sat in awe of how they, in a very confident and calm and professional \nmanner, recounted their experiences over the last 18 months--different \nperiods of time, ranging from 6 to 12 months--when they had command of \nthe most magnificent troops, the most magnificent, dedicated military \nwe have had in the contemporary history of America.\n  We owe those troops a high debt of gratitude. No matter what our \npolitical affiliation is, no matter what our philosophical approach is, \nwe owe them and their families a tremendous debt of gratitude. I think \nthat was expressed by this body when 98 to 0 we passed the\n\n[[Page S13071]]\n\nannual Armed Forces authorization bill. There was not one single \ndissenting voice. I went back and searched the Record. Indeed, during \nthe Vietnam period when I was in the Pentagon, there was always a cadre \nthat would vote against it. But I think it was a recognition in this \nChamber--and I salute each Member of the Senate who voted for that bill \nand expressed on behalf of the men and women of the Armed Forces our \ngratitude.\n  But much more remains to be done. In the judgment of this Senator--I \nam just speaking for myself--I believe the next 4 to 6 months is \nabsolutely the most critical period of this conflict in Iraq. How and \nwhy we got into that conflict is debated. It has been taking place, but \nI urge colleagues to look forward to the future to see how we can best \nsupport our forces as each one of the volunteers fulfills the orders of \nthe Commander in Chief and carries out the mission.\n  During the course of the deliberation of our bill, the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut, a member of the Armed Services Committee, Mr. \nLieberman, gave an eloquent speech regarding that classic statement at \nthe conclusion of World War II by Arthur Vandenberg: ``Politics should \nbe checked at the water's edge.''\n  I say to my colleagues with great respect for all, now is the time. \nThe next 60, 90, 120, 180 days is most critical. I urge us to put aside \nour political differences, put aside our philosophical differences, and \nlook forward and seize the opportunity to support the Iraqis in their \nforthcoming elections on the 15th of December and the formation of that \ngovernment in the ensuing 30 days thereafter.\n  We should be very strong in our efforts to impress upon this new \ngovernment the urgency of time and the need to show a greater measure \nof strength and determination than ever before by the various \ntransitional governments that have preceded this government. Now is the \ntime for the Iraqi people and their new government to show \ndetermination, quadruple their efforts in forming their new ministries, \nstanding them up so they can assume the full burden of that measure of \ndemocracy and freedom that they elect to have among themselves, and to \nrapidly try to bring this insurgency to a conclusion.\n  The ground situation as it develops in the ensuing months dictates \nany thoughts of how and when our forces can be deemed to have completed \ntheir mission and begin the return home.\n  Just days ago, this Chamber rejected an attempt again to set a \ntimetable. We set no timetable. We are there in this critical period of \nthe next 6 months to support the Iraqi people, to support this new \ngovernment, but in return they must give us a full measure of support \nand equal effort to achieve these goals.\n  If I may return to the subject of the IEDs which was a principal part \nof our discussion yesterday, I will be consulting with Members, but I \nbelieve the Department of Defense has to redouble its efforts to deal \nwith this difficult situation of the IEDs. Each of these officers \nrecounted the number of casualties they experienced in their units. \nThis great Nation shows the magnificent compassion for the families of \nnot only those who lost their lives but lost their limbs, and we are \ndeeply indebted to them. We owe them no less than our full measure of \nsupport here at home.\n  Let us check politics at the water's edge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/17/senate-section/article/S13071-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13071-S13072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRE-WAR INTELLIGENCE\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I am deeply disturbed by what I believe \nis an attempt to write a revisionist history of our involvement in Iraq \nand our pre-war intelligence.\n  Since 1981, I have served as the Chairman or Ranking Member of the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee. As one who has watched over the \nDefense Department's Appropriations, I was impressed with President \nClinton's position on Iraq. The President and his top advisers--Vice \nPresident Gore, Secretary of State Albright, National Security Adviser \nSandy Berger, and others--consistently made the case we should take \nseriously the threat Iraq and its weapons, program posed.\n  I have come to the floor twice in the past to submit President \nClinton's February 1998 Pentagon speech into the Congressional Record. \nBefore giving his speech, President Clinton was briefed by the generals \nwho command all of our forces. Their briefing convinced President \nClinton that he might have to take military action against Saddam \nHussein, and he told the generals to be ready.\n  Those of us in Congress never doubted President Clinton's sincerity \nor truthfulness regarding this issue. In 1998, he said:\n\n       If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our \n     purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat \n     posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program.\n\n  Vice President Al Gore echoed this concern. He said:\n\n       Saddam's ability to produce and deliver weapons of mass \n     destruction poses a grave threat . . . to the security of the \n     world.\n\n  Secretary of State Madeline Albright told us:\n\n       Iraq is a long way from here, but what happens there \n     matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of \n     a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical, or biological \n     weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security \n     threat we face.\n\n  And National Security Adviser Sandy Berger warned:\n\n       He (Saddam Hussein) will use those weapons of mass \n     destruction again, as he has 10 times since 1983.\n\n  Many Members of the Senate agreed the threat was real and imminent. \nIn 2002, Senator Kennedy said:\n\n       We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking \n     and developing weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  Senator Rockefeller warned:\n\n       Saddam's existing biological and chemical weapons \n     capabilities pose real threats to America, today, tomorrow.\n\n  And Senator Kerry said:\n\n       These weapons pose an unacceptable threat.\n\n  In October 2002, the Senate overwhelmingly supported giving President \nBush the authority to use force in Iraq. We authorized the use of force \nin a vote of 77 to 23. The facts before us indicated Saddam Hussein \nposed a grave threat.\n  Let me be clear: At the time, the facts were undisputed and we were \nall provided the same information. These were the facts as we \nunderstood them. Saddam Hussein had used weapons of mass destruction \nagainst the Iranians, his own people and possibly some of our men and \nwomen in uniform during the first gulf war.\n  In 1998, the weapons inspectors were forced out of Iraq. When the \ninspectors left, the regime was capable of resuming bacterial warfare \nagent production within weeks. Iraq had not accounted for hundreds of \ntons of chemical precursors and tens of thousands of unfilled munitions \ncanisters. Iraq had not accounted for at least 15,000 artillery rockets \npreviously used for delivery of nerve agents or 500 artillery shells \nfilled with mustard gas.\n  Saddam Hussein had been ordered by the U.N. to disarm 16 times, and \n16 times he refused to comply. He engaged in a series of deceitful \ntactics designed to prevent U.N. inspectors from completing their \ninspections.\n  Our intelligence agencies gathered further evidence of his \nactivities. This information was classified to protect our sources and \nmethods. I received those intelligence briefings. I believe I received \nthe same information as President Clinton. These intelligence reports \nwere deeply disturbing, and phase I of the Intelligence Committee's \ninvestigations found this information was not coerced or influenced in \nany way. It was our intelligence agency's best assessment of what was \ngoing on in Iraq at the time. Had the President received those \nbriefings and failed to act, he would have been negligent in his duty \nto keep Americans safe. Those in the Senate who voted for the \nresolution believed this, which is why we authorized the use of force.\n  I am now disturbed by the way some are twisting this history to suit \ntheir own political agendas. Why is anyone calling the people of this \nadministration liars when the speaker shared their position? In many \ncases, those who accuse the administration of deception previously had \nmade the case even more strongly than President Bush.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee spent 2 years putting together a \nbipartisan report on our prewar intelligence.\n\n[[Page S13072]]\n\nTheir report found there were no attempts to influence analysts or no \nevidence that administration officials attempted to coerce, influence, \nor pressure an analyst to change his or her judgment--not once.\n  Every member of the Intelligence Committee, Republican and Democrat, \napproved that report. The Silverman-Robb report and six other major \nstudies found there is no basis for the claim that the administration \nlied to get us to go to war.\n  The search for weapons of mass destruction will not be completed on \nour timetable. Look at this picture: The Iraqis buried entire planes in \nthe desert. We have two photographs of planes being unearthed, full \nplanes buried beneath the sand. When we pulled them out, they were \nstill operable.\n  Our troops found 30 of these planes buried in the sands of the Al-\nTaqqadum airfield west of Baghdad--30 planes. That is one-tenth of \ntheir entire combat Air Force. If Saddam Hussein's troops had buried \none-tenth of their combat aircraft in the desert, who is to say there \nwere no weapons of mass destruction similarly buried? Just because they \nwere not found does not mean they were never there. The Nation of Iraq \nis the size of California. The materials needed to make weapons of mass \ndestruction could fit in a container the size of a family bathtub. \nWeapons of mass destruction are no bigger than a family bathtub.\n  We now stand at a critical moment in history. I believe we must \nreflect on events leading to the war, but this process is only useful \nif it is honest and accurate. Those who are trying to rewrite history, \nrevisionist history of these events are simply advancing their own \npolitical agendas. They are not advancing the important work due now in \nthe region--and do so on a bipartisan basis.\n  I agree with the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, the chairman of \nthe Committee on Armed Services. A flexible timetable for troop \nwithdrawal could jeopardize our men and women in uniform and their \nmission. The only way we can lose in Iraq is if we defeat ourselves, if \nwe refuse to stay the course. The path to progress is slow and steady. \nIt has milestones, but it does not have timelines. We must remain \nbehind our troops.\n  Over 200 years ago, our Founding Fathers began the great American \nexperiment. They set out to create a government defined by its \ncommitment to liberty and freedom. Iraq is one of this century's \nproving grounds for those ideals. Our men and women in uniform, all \nvolunteers, are helping the people of Iraq and Afghanistan build their \nemerging democracies. Their sacrifices ensure, in the words of Abraham \nLincoln, ``that government of the people, by the people, and for the \npeople shall not perish from this Earth.''\n  Distorting our prewar intelligence will not help them complete their \nmission. We must support the important work they are doing in Iraq, not \nsend mixed messages. The men and women in uniform were asked to go to \nIraq to help Iraq become a democracy dedicated to freedom. They are \ndoing that. I will continue to support those and stay the course and \nsupport Iraq's efforts to stand up their own forces so they can defend \nthat freedom.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/17/senate-section/article/S13072-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this morning we intend to continue two \nmajor amendments from this side of the aisle. The amendment of Senator \nConrad from North Dakota proposes a fiscally responsible substitute; \nthe amendment of the Senator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell, is \nregarding energy price gouging. These are both very important \namendments and an important debate. I ask consent the pending \namendments be temporarily laid aside so Senator Conrad may offer an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2602\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide tax \nbenefits for areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma and \n     to extend certain expiring provisions, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, first I thank the ranking member on the \nSenate Committee on Finance, Senator Baucus, for his leadership and for \nthe extraordinary amount of work he does to make the work of the \nCommittee on Finance as responsible as it can be.\n  There are many provisions in the underlying bill that has come out of \nthe Committee on Finance that I support. I think they are broadly \nsupported extensions of expiring tax provisions that ought to be \nextended.\n  I salute the chairman of the Committee on Finance, Senator Grassley, \nfor the good job he has done in putting together this package. While I \nagree with many of the specific provisions, I have one profound area of \ndisagreement. That profound area of disagreement is that this package \nis not paid for. The result, if we pass this package, will be to deepen \nthe deficit, to add to the debt, when we already have record deficits \nand we already have runaway debt.\n  My colleagues are going to have to answer the question, Why shouldn't \nwe pay for these tax provisions? Why shouldn't we cover the cost? Why \nshouldn't we prevent the deficit from being expanded? Why shouldn't we \nprevent the debt from being deepened?\n  That is the question posed by my amendment. It takes many of the \nprovisions in the Committee on Finance bill, the expiring tax \nprovisions, and extends them for 1 year. It pays for them fully.\n  It is very important to remember the history. How did we get in the \nposition we are in today? My colleagues will remember this very famous \nchart that the administration and the Congressional Budget Office \npresented back in 2001. This part of the chart I call the fan chart \nshowed the range of possible outcomes if we didn't change any budget \npolicies. This range of possible outcomes from a best case scenario; to \na median scenario, the midpoint between the range of possible outcomes \nis the prediction line adopted; to the worst case scenario. These were \nthe projections given to us if we just did nothing.\n  My colleagues on the other side said: No, this is too conservative, \nthis range of possible outcomes. They said: Don't you understand, if we \nhave tax cuts we will get more revenue so we will be above the midpoint \nof the range. We might be even above the best case scenario. The \nproblem with that theory is that it did not work out in reality.\n  Here is what happened in reality: This red line is far below the \nworst case scenario outlined by the Congressional Budget Office in \n2001. I have caught the chairman's attention. He will remember the \nchart very well from 2001, what the Congressional Budget Office said \nwas the range of possible outcomes. The Congressional Budget Office \nadopted this midrange of the estimates as their projection.\n  Many of my colleagues on the other side told me, when I said we \nshouldn't be betting on a 10-year forecast: Kent, you are way too \nconservative. Don't you understand if we cut taxes we will get more \nrevenue. We will be above the midpoint of the range of possible \noutcomes.\n  Now we can go back and we can check what has actually happened. That \nis this red line. It is below the worst case possible outcome. Far \nbelow it.\n  So this notion that the tax cuts were going to generate more revenue \nand were going to prevent massive deficits proved to be wrong. It is \nvery simple.\n\n[[Page S13073]]\n\nThis is not theory. This is not ideology. This is reality. This is what \nreally happened.\n  We can look at it in a different way. This chart looks back to 1980, \nthe relationship between spending and revenue of the United States \nexpressed as a share of gross domestic product. Why do we do it that \nway? Why do we do it as a share of gross domestic product? Because \nevery economist says that is the appropriate way to compare spending \nover time and revenue over time because it takes out the effects of \ninflation and growth, so we are comparing apples to apples.\n\n  Here is what the line shows: Spending in the 1980s was between 21 and \n23.5 percent of gross domestic production. During the 1990s, \ninterestingly enough, during the Democrat administration, the spending \ncame down as a share of gross domestic production each and every year, \nthe 8 years of the Clinton administration. So at the end of that time \nwe were below 19 percent of gross domestic production on spending. \nSince that time, spending has gone up to approaching 20 percent of \ngross domestic production now.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to blame Democrats \nfor spending. But Democrats have not been in charge during this period. \nDuring this period, Republicans have controlled the White House, the \nSenate, the House. They are responsible for every dime of this \nincrease.\n  Let's look at the revenue side. When President Bush came in, \nrevenue--as he correctly stated--was at a very high level historically, \nabout 20.6 percent of gross domestic production. It was substantially \nabove where it was in the 1980s and 1990s.\n  But look what has happened since. Revenue has collapsed. Last year it \nwas the lowest it has been as a share of gross domestic production \nsince 1959. Some of my friends on the other side want to concentrate on \nthis uptick. And it is true, revenue has increased over the last year. \nBut it is still way below where it has been historically and way below \nwhere it was in 2001. The result is the increased spending, the reduced \nrevenue--by the way, about half the reduction in revenue is from tax \ncuts--the combination of increased spending and reduced revenue has \nopened up a chasm. That is why we have massive deficits and why we are \ngoing to have massive deficits going forward--and, I might add, at the \nworst possible time.\n  Why is it the worst possible time? Because the baby boomers are going \nto start to retire in 2008. Right here the baby boomers are going to \nstart to retire. That is going to change everything in a dramatic way.\n  The President assured us when we embarked on this course that there \nwould not be deficits. Then, the next year, he told us the deficits \nwould be small and short term. Then, the next year, he told us they \nwould be small by historical standards. Now he says he is going to cut \nthem in half over the next 5 years.\n\n  Let's compare rhetoric to reality. Here is what has happened. In \n2001, the first year he was in office, inheriting surpluses from the \nClinton administration, we had a $128 billion surplus. The next year, \nwe were back in deficit. The next year, 2003, we had the biggest \ndeficit ever, only to be exceeded, in 2004, by an even larger deficit. \nAnd this year, again, we have the third largest deficit in our history \nbut somewhat of an improvement.\n  Let me say to my colleagues, this modest improvement is largely \nillusory because it focuses just on the deficit. I say to my \ncolleagues, what we ought to be thinking about, what is really far more \nimportant to the fiscal future of the country, is not the growth of \ndeficits but the growth of the debt. Why do I say that? Because if you \nlook at what happened to the increase in the debt last year, you see \nthat it increased far more than the deficit figure that is quoted in \nthe news media.\n  Why is that? Well, the biggest reason is because under the \nPresident's plan, $173 billion of Social Security money was taken to \npay for other things. That all gets added to the debt. It all has to be \npaid back. But it is not included in the deficit calculation. Very \nfrankly, these deficit calculations are increasingly irrelevant to \nunderstanding the true fiscal condition of the country.\n  Now, last year, instead of the debt increasing by what was the \nadvertised deficit of $319 billion, the debt of the country actually \nincreased by $551 billion. I find that this is largely not understood. \nWhen I do presentations, most people think, in kind of a commonsense \nway, that the debt must increase by the amount of the deficit. But that \nis not the case. The fundamental reason it is not the case is because \nunder the President's plan money is being taken from every trust fund \nin sight to cover the spending, and it all gets added to the debt, but \nit is not included in the deficit calculation. So last year, the debt \nof the country increased by $551 billion.\n  This is so important to understand historically. I see the news \nmedia, very frequently, say: Well, as a share of GDP the deficit is not \nas big as the deficits were in the 1980s. That is true. But it is \ntotally misleading. Why? Because back in the 1980s, there was virtually \nno Social Security surplus to be used to pay for other things. In fact, \nuntil 1984, there was no Social Security surplus--none. Then, in the \n1980s, the Social Security surpluses were very modest. But look what \nhas happened over time. The Social Security surpluses have exploded, \nmasking the true size of what is being added to the debt of the \ncountry--masking the true size of the deficits is probably a better way \nto say it.\n  Last year, the amount of Social Security funds that were taken to pay \nfor other things reached $173 billion, and not a dime of it got counted \nin the deficit calculation. It all got added to the debt. It is all \ngoing to have to be paid back, but you don't read about it anywhere in \nthe news media. They don't talk about how much the debt increased.\n  This is a shell game of enormous proportion that is going on here. I \nsay to my colleagues, if any private sector entity tried to do what we \nare doing here, they would be headed for a Federal facility. But it \nwould not be the Congress of the United States, it would not be the \nWhite House, they would be headed to Federal prison because any private \nsector entity that tried to take the retirement funds of its employees \nand use them to pay for current expenses, they would be guilty of \nFederal violations of law. They would be guilty of fraud. You cannot \ntake the retirement funds of your employees and use it to pay current \nexpenses. That is exactly what we are doing here, every year.\n  Under the President's plan, over the next 10 years, at the very time \nhe says Social Security is short of money for the long term, his budget \nplan and the budget plans that passed here in the Congress of the \nUnited States, are going to take $2.5 trillion from Social Security and \nuse it to pay the operating expenses of the Federal Government.\n  Is anybody paying attention? Is anybody paying attention to what is \ngoing on here? Over the next 10 years, $2.5 trillion of Social Security \nmoney is going to be taken to pay for other things. We are headed for a \ntrain wreck. The President says: Don't worry. We are going to cut the \ndeficit in half over the next 5 years.\n  Our problem is not a 5-year problem. In fact, that is the sweet spot \nof the budget cycle. That is the sweet spot because that is before the \nbaby boomers have retired. In addition, the only way the President gets \nto his claim of reducing the deficit, over 5 years, in half is he just \nleaves out things. He left out war costs past September 30 of this \nyear. That is $300 billion, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice. He left out the cost of fixing the alternative minimum tax. \nThat costs $700 billion to fix. There is not a dime of it in his \nbudget.\n  When you add back the things he left out, here is the picture we see \nemerging, and this is just the deficit calculation. The debt \ncalculation, as I have described previously, is far worse. We are going \ninto a circumstance in which the next 5 years--these are the good \ntimes; it is before baby boomers retire--we are headed for an \nextraordinarily serious set of circumstances if the budget plan of the \nPresident is maintained. Why? Because many of the proposals he has \nexplode in cost right beyond the 5-year budget window. For example, the \ncost of his tax cuts absolutely explode right beyond the 5-year budget \nwindow. So does the cost of dealing with the alternative minimum tax. \nIt explodes beyond the 5-year budget window.\n\n[[Page S13074]]\n\n  We have had a lot of talk on the floor of the Senate about this being \na deficit reduction package. No, it is not. This is not a deficit \nreduction package, this reconciliation package. This reconciliation \npackage has three parts: spending changes that save $35 billion over 5 \nyears, these additional tax cuts that cost $60 billion over 5 years--so \nyou put the two together, that adds to the deficit; it does not reduce \nthe deficit--and the third chapter is the chapter they do not want you \nto read in this book because the third chapter is to increase the debt \nof the country by $781 billion. It is all in one fell swoop.\n\n  As we look ahead to the 5-year budget that has been adopted by our \ncolleagues--not with my support; I voted against it--but this is what \nis going to happen to the debt of the country over the next 5 years \nunder this plan. By the way, these are not my numbers. These are their \nnumbers. These are the numbers in their budget documents about what \nhappens to the debt--not the deficits, the debt.\n  It is something the news media--it is interesting, the news galleries \nare absolutely empty. Oh, no, there is one lone soul there--one lone \nsoul. The news media does not want to report on this. Why don't they \nwant to report on it? Because it is a little bit complicated. You \nactually have to read. You actually have to do a little studying. It is \nnot like covering the latest scandal. They love to cover scandal \nbecause that is easy to write about. Budget stories and what is \nhappening to the fiscal condition of the country, that is much more \ndifficult because you actually have to get your numbers right.\n  No one is paying attention. I have not seen a single national story \non the growth of the debt. They are writing about the deficits because \nthat is what they have written about for 20 years. They don't get the \nwhole thing has changed dramatically since the 1980s because of how the \npolicy of our Government has changed to raiding the Social Security \ntrust funds for every dollar that is in them for the next 10 years.\n  But do you know what? It does not matter they do not write the story. \nIt does not matter because the reality is coming in on us, and it is \ncoming in on us much sooner than people understand because what really \naffects the strength of America, the fiscal strength of America, is the \ndebt that is being built up, and the budget that has passed both Houses \nof Congress is going to increase the debt. It started at $7.9 trillion \nthis year. It is going to go up to $8.6 trillion, then to $9.2 \ntrillion, then to $9.9 trillion, then to $10.6 trillion, then to $11.3 \ntrillion over the 5 years of this budget.\n  Again, these are not my numbers. These are not my numbers. These are \nthe numbers in their own budget documents about their prediction about \nwhat will happen to the debt with the budget that has been adopted.\n  The debt is exploding before the baby boomers retire. What are the \nimplications? Well, here is one of them. Foreign holdings of our debt \nhave doubled in the last 5 years. It took 42 Presidents, pictured here, \n224 years to run up $1 trillion of external debt. This President has \nexceeded them all. He was able to double foreign holdings of our debt \nin just 5 years. It took 42 Presidents 224 years to run up $1 trillion \nof external debt. This President has added more than $1 trillion of \nexternal debt in 5 years.\n  To whom do we owe the debt? Well, here is the latest scorecard. We \nowe Japan $687 billion. We owe China $252 billion. We owe the United \nKingdom $182 billion. And my favorite, the Caribbean banking centers, \nwe owe over $100 billion. We owe South Korea over $60 billion. I submit \nto my colleagues, that does not make America stronger. That makes \nAmerica weaker.\n  So now we turn to the legislation before us. One would expect that \nthe Congress would be about reducing the deficit, reducing the debt, in \nlight of what has happened. In light of the fact that the debt during \nthis Presidency has gone up $3 trillion already, in light of the fact \nthat under the 5-year budget before us, the debt is going to go up \nanother $3 trillion over the next 5 years, you would think we would be \nhere trying to reduce the explosion of debt. Surprise, surprise. No. \nThis reconciliation process, a fast-track process that was devised to \ncircumvent the rules of the Senate, was put in place to reduce \ndeficits. That is the whole purpose of reconciliation. But it has been \nhijacked, and now it is being used not to reduce deficits but to expand \nthem.\n  I tell you, I go home some nights and I pinch myself thinking I am \ncaught up in some surreal comedy. This has to be a comedy: The debt is \nexploding before the baby boomers retire, and in the Congress, the \nreconciliation process that was adopted to reduce deficits has been \nhijacked and is being used to increase deficits.\n  What is wrong with this picture? I submit what is wrong with this \npicture is, it is utterly and completely disconnected from reality. Now \nwe have before us a bill that is going to cut taxes over the next 5 \nyears by $60 billion. It is going to make the deficit worse by $60 \nbillion.\n  This is what Chairman Greenspan has said about the notion of cutting \ntaxes by borrowing. Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan opposes deficit-\nfinanced tax cuts. He said:\n\n       [W]e should not be cutting taxes by borrowing.\n\n  He is right. That is what we are doing. We are borrowing every dime \nof this, borrowing it from Japan, China, Caribbean banking centers.\n  Here is the effect of the reconciliation package, $35 billion of \nspending savings over 5 years, completely and totally wiped out by $60 \nbillion of tax cuts not paid for. The net result is to increase the \ndeficit, to increase the debt by $25 billion, but that is right in line \nwith the fiscal policies that have been adopted by this President and \nby this Republican majority, because this is their record.\n  This is where they took over. The debt limit had not been increased \nfor 5 years in this country. In 2002, in one year, they increased it by \n$450 billion. In 2003, they increased it by $984 billion. In 2004, they \nincreased it by $800 billion. Now, with this reconciliation proposal, \nthey want to increase the debt by $781 billion. Add it all up, and this \nPresident will have increased the debt in these 5 years by $3 trillion. \nOver the next 5 years, according to their own estimates, they are going \nto increase the debt another $3 trillion. That is real money.\n  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve has said this:\n\n       All I'm saying is that my general view is I like to see the \n     tax burden as low as possible.\n\n  Don't we all. I would like nothing better than to have my tax burden \nreduced.\n\n       And in that context, I would like to see tax cuts \n     continued. But, as I indicated earlier, that has got to be, \n     in my judgment, in the context of a PAYGO resolution.\n\n  What is pay-go? Pay-go says you can have more tax cuts, but you have \nto pay for them. You can have more spending, but you have to pay for \nit. Because if you don't, you add to the debt and deficit burden.\n  That brings me to the amendment that I send to the desk at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2602.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, what does this amendment do? It provides \nfor the extension of the expiring tax provisions that expire this year \nto be effective next year. It extends all of them. It does not extend \nprovisions that expire next year for 2007 or 2008 or 2009. It is \ncompletely paid for over the 10 years. It provides for hurricane \ndisaster relief identical to what Chairman Grassley has included in his \nprovision. It provides for alternative minimum tax relief, but in an \neven better way than what is in the chairman's mark. Because while the \nchairman's mark says it is a hold-harmless provision, in fact, 600,000 \nmore American taxpayers will pay the alternative minimum tax than paid \nit this year. We will go from 3 million people paying the alternative \nminimum tax to 3.6 million.\n  Remember, the alternative minimum tax, the old millionaire's tax, has \nnow become a middle-class tax trap. My\n\n[[Page S13075]]\n\namendment is a real hold harmless on alternative minimum tax. There \nwill be no increase in the number of Americans paying the alternative \nminimum tax--none. Instead of a 600,000 increase of American taxpayers \npaying the AMT, we will only have the same number paying next year as \nthis year.\n  In addition, we extend the R tax credit, the State sales tax \ndeduction, the college tuition deduction, the welfare-to-work and work \nopportunity tax credits, the teacher classroom expenses deduction, the \nleasehold improvement and restaurant depreciation, and all other \ntraditional tax extenders that expire this year to be effective next \nyear. We pay for those provisions. Instead of putting it on the charge \ncard, instead of running up the debt, adding to the deficit, shoving it \noff on our kids, we pay for it.\n  How do we do it? First, we use the same offsets that are in the \nchairman's package with the exception of the charitable revenue raisers \nbecause we don't have the charitable package here. They include the \nprovisions that he has to close the tax gap by shutting down abusive \ntax shelters. I applaud the chairman for having those in his mark. He \nis exactly right to have them there. We adopt those same provisions.\n\n  In addition, we end the loophole for oil companies that lets them \navoid taxes on their foreign operations. That is $10 billion. We end \nthe tax benefit for leasing foreign subway and sewer systems. That \nsaves $5 billion.\n  I want to explain this one to my colleagues. Here is what is going \non. This is one of the biggest scams ever cooked up by accounting \nfirms. Most accounting firms don't engage in this kind of activity, but \nthere are a few who do. Here is what they are doing. They are buying \nforeign subway and sewer systems in U.S. shell operations, depreciating \ntheir assets for U.S. tax purposes, and leasing the subway and the \nsewer systems back to the foreign cities. I know this sounds \nunbelievable, but that is what is going on. This is a scam.\n  Some of my colleagues say: Senator, you are increasing taxes in order \nto pay for this tax cut package. I suppose you could say that. But is \nthis a tax break anybody thinks should be in place? Do you think we \nshould allow companies to buy foreign subway and sewer systems, \ndepreciate them on their books, reduce their U.S. taxes, and then lease \nthem back to those European cities? Does anybody believe that is not \nabuse?\n  We also require tax withholding on Government payments to contractors \nsuch as Halliburton. Why shouldn't they have withholding, just as \nworking Americans have withholding on their tax obligations? That saves \n$7 billion.\n  We renew the Superfund tax so that polluting companies pay for \ncleaning up toxic waste sites. That tax is 9.7 cents a barrel. Oil \nright now is going for close to $60 a barrel. It seems entirely \nreasonable to me that we ask those who have contributed to these sites \nthat need to be cleaned up to pay for it, 9.7 cents a barrel.\n  We close other tax loopholes as well. That is how we pay for this \npackage. Why would we not pay for this package? Why should we not \nprevent the deficit and debt from being increased?\n  Some of my colleagues argued in the Finance Committee: Senator, you \nare raising taxes to pay for the tax cut. Here is what the chairman \nsaid:\n\n       We've found $180 billion over the last few years in things \n     that are examples of loophole closings and abusive tax \n     shelters. And that's what they are, people . . . that are \n     avoiding taxes--\n\n  I would amend that to companies as well.\n\n     --now that ought to pay taxes without changing the rate of \n     taxation.\n\n  The chairman had it exactly right. We now know the tax gap in this \ncountry, the difference between what is owed and what is actually being \npaid, is $350 billion a year. Let's close down these scams. Let's close \ndown these loopholes. Let's close down these abuses and use a portion \nof it to pay for extending these very worthy tax provisions that are in \nthis package. That is what my amendment is about.\n  For those who say they care about fiscal responsibility, for those \nwho say they are concerned about the explosion of deficits and debt, \nhere is a chance to prove it. Here is a chance to vote for this \namendment that will extend the tax provisions that are expiring, those \nthat are expiring this year for next year's taxes, and to pay for it by \nclosing abusive tax shelters.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I thought Senator Kyl wanted some \ntime. What I would like to do, if it is OK with the other side, is give \nSenator Kyl some time off of our time and then right after him, Senator \nThomas, because Senator Thomas has been waiting for a long time to \nspeak. I ask unanimous consent to make that the speaking order. These \nfolks are talking about maybe 20 minutes apiece or less.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object--and it is not my intention \nto object--I would like to inquire as to the parliamentary situation. \nHow much time is left on my amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 7 minutes on his \namendment, which leaves him 53 minutes. The first 28 minutes was \ncharged to the bill so that the amendment was not pending at that time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So I have 53 minutes remaining on my side, and they have \nan hour left on their side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I inquire of the Senator from California, why does she \nseek recognition and how much time does she require?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have two amendments. I will not require more than \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is the Senator seeking time off the bill or she would \nhave her own amendment time? I would not object to the request of the \nchairman to have speaking time. We would then intend to lay my \namendment aside.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, we would be willing to do that. We are looking at \nsome votes around noon. Yours would be one of those. We don't have \nunanimous consent on that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will defer to the manager of the bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are moving along on the amendment \noffered by the Senator from North Dakota. I got clearance from the \nchairman of the committee to ask unanimous consent that there be 40 \nminutes of debate remaining on the Conrad amendment equally divided, 20 \nminutes in favor of those who are speaking against the amendment and \nthen 20 minutes to be controlled by the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. And also that there would be no second-degree amendments \nand the vote would then occur immediately following the 40 minutes in \nrelation to the Conrad amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield 10 minutes to Senator Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair. I thank the chairman.\n  This is a choice between the product of the Finance Committee and the \namendment offered by the Senator from North Dakota. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to support the product of the committee and to defeat the \nConrad amendment.\n  Let's first focus on this issue of deficit. The deficit reduction \nthat has occurred as a result of the President's tax policies supported \nby the Republican Members of Congress has been nothing short of \nincredible.\n  This is a choice between a continuation of a policy which provides \neconomic growth for our country and more money for our families, more \ninvestment for our businesses, and therefore more jobs for Americans. \nLook at some of these statistics in terms of the gross domestic product \ngrowth in our country. Whether you embraced the lower rates at the \ntime, I think everybody has to acknowledge that the rates\n\n[[Page S13076]]\n\nwe put into effect in 2003 have had a dramatic effect.\n  Consider: The economy grew at a 3.8-percent annual rate in the third \nquarter. That is the 10th straight quarter the GDP grew at a rate above \n3 percent. We remain the fastest growing industrialized country in the \nworld. That is the longest such period of growth in our history since \nWorld War II.\n  Business investment: In the nine quarters before the 2003 tax rates \nwere put into effect, business investment fell. We passed the tax \nprovisions to cut taxes on capital gains, for example, and we reversed \nthat. In fact, business investment has now increased at an annual rate \nof 6.9 percent. That means jobs to our economy and more wealth for \nAmerican families.\n  In terms of deficit reduction, specifically, we are not undertaxed. \nCongress is spending too much. That is what is creating the deficit. \nNevertheless, as a share of our GDP, the 2005 deficit was 2.6 percent, \ndown from a 3.6-percent share in 2004. In fact, before Hurricane \nKatrina we were well on the way toward achieving the President's \nobjective of cutting the deficit in half in the next 2 years. In fiscal \nyear 2005, taxpayers sent Washington $274 billion more in revenue than \nthe year before, and $100 billion more than we predicted back in \nJanuary.\n  How could we be so far off? This economy is so strong, it is growing \nso rapidly that even at the lower tax rates we are producing more \nrevenue to the Federal Treasury. This is not a path from which we \nshould deviate. We should continue this path and not adopt the \nprinciple of the substitute amendment offered by the Senator from North \nDakota. What his amendment presumes is something very strange in \neconomics, and that is that somehow we have reached a magic Minerva, an \nequilibrium where the Federal Government is taking a tax in the right \namount from American citizens never to be changed one iota, \nnotwithstanding the fact we will continue to spend more and more and \nmore, and we will have to have the taxes to pay for that spending or go \ndeeper in debt.\n  The pay-go amendment that is the centerpiece of the amendment \nproposed as a practical matter does not affect the most significant \naspects of our continued spending, namely the mandatory increases in \nour mandatory spending, our so-called entitlements--Medicare, Medicaid, \nSocial Security, that which represents about two-thirds of the \nspending. As a result, the big-ticket items are not restrained in any \nway. All that is restrained is the ability to promote the continuation \nof our current tax rates. If we don't continue these tax rates, if we \ndon't take action, for example, this year to extend the capital gains \nand dividends tax rates for another 2 years, we are going to find in a \ncouple years the American taxpayers are going to be faced with a huge \ntax increase, and that is because without further action those tax \nrates will go up by 25 percent in 2 years. That is not right.\n  Now, some of our colleagues say, well, these tax rates only help the \nwealthy in our country. Well, is that so? From a column that was \nauthored by Larry Kudlow, a noted economist: The investor class in \nAmerica ``continues to grow by leaps and bounds . . . The number of \nfamilies owning stocks has risen to 56.9 million from 54.1 million, \nmeaning nearly 60 percent of U.S. households are invested in equities \ntoday.'' We ``have become a society of equity investors.''\n  Zogby polling shows that nearly all Americans--93 percent--earning \n$75,000 a year or more own stocks. They can't all be rich. And how \nabout those earning up to $75,000 a year? In this group, more than \nhalf, or 56 percent, own shares. Of those earning below $50,000 a \nyear--a group that in the aggregate pays very little taxes overall--30 \npercent own stocks.\n  So the continuation of the 15-percent rate on dividends is a matter \nthat affects a very large swath of Americans. As a matter of fact, 23 \npercent of all filers spread evenly across income categories reported \ndividend income in 2003 and of that group, 30 percent, 30.6 percent had \nan adjusted gross income under $30,000. Rich people? I don't think so.\n  How about capital gains? Seventeen percent of all filers spread \nequally across income categories reported capital gains in 2003, and of \nthat group 30.1 percent had adjusted gross income of under $30,000. The \nrich? I don't think so.\n  How about some of the other provisions in the bill from the \ncommittee? The savers credit, only 4 percent of filers benefited from \nthat in 2004.\n  The above-the-line-deduction for college tuition costs, only 2.7 \npercent of filers claimed that deduction in 2003.\n  AMT, only 6 percent of filers are affected by that.\n  Now, why are all of these things in the committee mark? Because they \nstill represent important policy and we continue to support all of \nthose things.\n  With AMT, the number of filers is going to double so we have to do \nsomething about that. But the bottom line is when you are comparing \nthat to capital gains and dividends, far more Americans are affected by \ncapital gains and dividends and they are not just the wealthy. I read \nthe statistics for $30,000 and under.\n  The other flaw in the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota is \nthat the whole question of what ``tax cuts cost'' is upside down. The \nSenator from North Dakota raises that question with respect to revenues \nto the Federal Government. How much does it cost the Federal Government \nto have a tax cut? Think about it. That is a strange way to put it. How \nmuch does it cost the Federal Government to cut your taxes?\n  I will put that question the other way around. How much does it cost \nyou when we have a tax increase? Because that is exactly what will \nhappen in 2 years if we don't extend the current tax rates. We should \nbe asking what it costs American families, American taxpayers, and the \nAmerican economy, American businesses. What is it going to cost them if \nwe take more of their hard-earned money and bring it back to Washington \nfor us in our wisdom to figure out how to spend? That is the question \nwe should be asking.\n  What is the productive part of our economy? Does the Government \ncreate jobs?\n  Other than these very hard-working clerks here and the other jobs in \nthe Federal Government, we don't create jobs. The private sector \ncreates jobs. It costs money to pay employees. That is why employers \ntry to make money, so they can hire more people, more people will have \njobs, their families will be better off. We all understand how the \nprivate market works. It requires capital, it requires profits, it \nrequires the Government to get out of the way and not take so much of \nits money, frankly, and that is why the real question should be with \nregard to this so-called pay-go, not how much it is going to cost the \nFederal Government, but how much a tax increase which will result from \nthe policies that are being proposed on the other side of the aisle, \nhow much that tax increase is going to cost hard-working Americans. \nThat is the real question we should be asking.\n  We need to support the proposal that is before us on the floor today, \na proposal which in large measure makes American taxpayers better off \nand increases the revenues to the Treasury of the Government because \nthe tax policies we have had in place since 2003 are working, both to \nhelp stimulate investment in the private sector and create more jobs, \nand because they are low enough that they create economic activity that \ncan be taxed, providing more revenue to the Federal Treasury. We should \nreject the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota because it \ndoesn't pursue that same policy goal.\n  The only caveat to this, of course, is that the capital gains and \ndividends tax rates I have been talking about are not included in the \nproposal on the floor or in the proposal of the Senator from North \nDakota. But I can assure my colleagues it will be part of the \nconference report. There is no way we are going to consider a \nconference report that doesn't continue these current tax policies. To \nnot do so, as I said, would be to begin the biggest tax increase in the \nhistory of this country, and we are not going to do that at a time when \nwe need to keep the economy robustly growing as it has been.\n  I say to my colleagues, the tax proposals of President Bush have been \nworking. Our economy is producing a tremendous number of new jobs, \nrevenue growth for the private sector as well as for the Government \nsector. Why would we want to turn from that?\n  With respect to paying for it, let's remember who bears the cost.\n\n[[Page S13077]]\n\n  There is no free lunch at the end of the day. The taxpayers are going \nto bear the cost. As a result, the real question we should be asking is \nnot how much these policies cost the Government, but how much they cost \nthe taxpayers.\n  I urge the Senate to vote against the amendment of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota and support the chairman's mark.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time did the Senator from Arizona \nconsume?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to respond.\n  The Senator from Arizona started with a statement that is truly \nbreathtaking. The Senator from Arizona said that deficit reduction \ncreated by the Bush administration policies was, I think he used the \nword ``extraordinary.'' Yeah, it is extraordinary all right. Here is \nwhat has happened to the debt under these policies.\n  When the President came in, there had been no increase in the debt \nlimit of the United States for 5 years. After 1 year of the President's \npolicies, the debt limit was increased $450 billion. The next year, \nthey increased the debt $984 billion. The next year, they increased the \ndebt $800 billion. In this reconciliation package, they are going to \nincrease the debt limit $781 billion. The Senator from Arizona is on \nthe floor saying they have done something to reduce the deficit? Come \non. These are the biggest deficits, the biggest increase in the debt in \nthe history of America, and it doesn't end with what they have already \ndone.\n  Here is what they are going to do. These are not my calculations. \nThese are the numbers that are in their own budget document. They are \ngoing to increase the debt another $600 billion next year, another $600 \nbillion the next year, another $700 billion the next year, another $700 \nmillion the next year, and another $700 billion the next year. They \nalready increased the debt $3 trillion, and under this budget plan, \nover the next 5 years they are going to increase it another $3 \ntrillion, and he is out here talking about deficit reduction? Come on. \nThere is no deficit reduction here.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, I won't yield. The Senator had his chance. I am going \nto respond, and then I will be happy to engage in debate.\n  Mr. KYL. Since the Senator referred to me by name, I would like the \nopportunity to ask a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I did not refer to the Senator by name. I referred to \n``the Senator from Arizona.'' The Senator from Arizona came out here \nand said there has been extraordinary deficit reduction. There is no \ndeficit reduction. There is record explosion of debt, that is what is \ngoing on.\n  The Senator said that deficit, as a share of GDP, is not so bad. That \nis only because he leaves out something. And the something he leaves \nout is all the money that is being taken from Social Security and used \nto pay for other items because back in the eighties there was no Social \nSecurity surplus, or virtually none. Last year, the Social Security \nfunds that were being used to try to mask the true size of what is \ngoing on was $173 billion. You add that back in, and the increase in \ndebt of this country was 4.5 percent of GDP.\n  In the European Union, you can't be a member if you run deficits \nabove 3.0 percent of GDP. But the addition to debt in this country last \nyear was 4.6 percent of GDP when you add back all the money that is \nbeing taken from trust funds and used to pay for other items.\n  Here is what he doesn't want to talk about. Here is the explosion of \nSocial Security money being taken to pay for other things. Look back in \nthe eighties, there was virtually no Social Security surplus. In fact, \nin 1983, there was none. Then there was a couple hundred million \ndollars a year. Now it is approaching $200 billion a year, and they \nwant to forget about it, they don't want to count it?\n  I tell you what is going on here is so utterly disconnected from \nreality. This chart shows the spending line since the eighties and the \nrevenue line. In the nineties, we brought spending down each and every \nyear as a share of GDP. Now we have had a big tick upwards. The Senator \nfrom Arizona said he wonders how we reached some nirvana of balance \nbetween spending and revenue. There is no balance, that is the point. \nThat is what is wrong. We see the spending line and the revenue line. \nLook at the gap.\n  Our friends on the other side want to complain about the spending. \nGuess what. They are responsible for every dime of it. This happened on \ntheir watch. They control the House, they control the Senate, they \ncontrol the White House. They are responsible for every dime of the \nincrease in spending.\n  Here is what has happened to the revenue. It has collapsed. The \nresult is an enormous gap, and he says he wonders how we reached some \nnirvana of balance between spending and revenue. There is no balance. \nThat is the point.\n  Then our colleague talked about how wonderful the economic \nperformance has been. No, it hasn't. Here is the record on job \ncreation, comparing the average of the last nine recessions since World \nWar II. Here is what happened over the period of time--this is in \nnumber of months on the bottom. This is a jobless recovery. This red \nline is the average of what has happened after the last nine \nrecessions. By this stage, 55 months after the trough, typically 7 \nmillion jobs have been created in the private sector, more than have \nbeen created in this recovery.\n  So we are running 7 million private sector jobs behind the average of \nthe last nine recoveries since World War II. This is great economic \nperformance? It is the worst employment performance we have had of any \nof the nine recessions since World War II.\n\n  It is not just job growth, it is also GDP growth. GDP growth lags \nbehind the typical recovery by 27 percent over the same period of time.\n  The Senator talked about business investment. Let's look at business \ninvestment. Let's look at the last nine recessions. At this stage, we \nare running 53 percent less business investment than in the nine \nprevious recoveries from recessions. And he touts this economic record? \nMr. President, this is not a record of which to be proud.\n  The Senator also talked about the dividend tax cut, and he talked \nabout capital gains. They are not in the underlying amendment of the \nchairman of the committee. They are not in the Finance Committee's \nmark. So he is comparing apples to something else.\n  My amendment says we have to go back to the disciplines we have used \nin the past to restore fiscal discipline. What are they? Pay-go is one \nof the major budget disciplines, and it simply says: If you are going \nto have more tax cuts, fine, you have to pay for them. If you have more \nspending, fine, you have to pay for it. That is one of the key things \nwe must do to get this Nation back on track.\n  This notion that we keep borrowing the money, keep spending the \nmoney, keep more and more tax cuts, don't worry if anything adds up is \nleading us deeper and deeper into debt. When are we going to stop this?\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11\\1/2\\ minutes left.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask if the Chair will notify me when I have used 1 more \nminute.\n  Mr. President, let me say to my colleagues, I am beginning to wonder \nwhat are we thinking around here? What are we thinking of, Republicans \nand Democrats? When are we going to turn the corner? When are we going \nto say enough is enough? When are we going to say adding $3 trillion of \ndebt in the last 5 years and headed for the next 5 years adding another \n$3 trillion, in effect, doubling the debt of our country in 10 years--\nthat is what we are doing. The result is foreign holdings of our debt \nhave doubled in 5 years. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, this is \nnot sustainable.\n  On the Republican side, they say we should just cut the spending. OK, \ndo it, cut it. If you don't want to tax anymore, cut the spending to \nmatch the taxes you are willing to levy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used an additional minute.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for another 30 seconds.\n  My Republican friends said they are fiscally responsible. When are \nthey\n\n[[Page S13078]]\n\ngoing to demonstrate it? If you are only willing to tax at 17 percent \nof GDP, then cut the spending 17 percent of GDP. If they think, well, \nbecause of the war and because of the need for homeland security, we \nneed to spend more than 17 percent of GDP, which is what they are doing \nin their budgets--they are not spending 17 percent of GDP, they are \nspending 19 percent of GDP, in fact they are going to 20 percent of \nGDP, then tax at 20 percent of GDP so you pay your bills. Do one of the \ntwo. But don't just keep putting it on the charge card.\n  I say to my Democratic colleagues the same thing. We cannot be for \nmore spending than we are for levying the taxes to raise it. What is \ngoing on in this town is absolutely and totally irresponsible, and it \nis going to put us in a very weakened position as a country. We have \nincreased foreign holdings of our debt 100 percent in 5 years. It took \n224 years to run up a trillion dollars of external debt. This President \nhas doubled it in 5 years. That does not strengthen America.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield whatever time he might consume \nof my remaining time to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. I appreciate the \nopportunity to deal with this issue that is before us. By the way, I am \nnot speaking on the Conrad amendment, but I am, as a matter of fact, \nspeaking on the Dorgan amendment in general time. I have to say to my \nfriend from North Dakota that I certainly agree with the idea that we \nhave gone out of control in terms of our spending. I don't agree with \nthe idea that we have to raise taxes to offset it. What we ought to be \nlooking at is reducing the size of Government.\n  Quite frankly, I would like to see some activity on that side of the \naisle, as well as this side, to take a look at some of the programs we \nhave and see if they still need to continue to exist. With regard to \nthe idea that the growth of the Federal Government is out of control, \nwe have gotten into a feeling that every time there is a need in the \ncountry for anything the Federal Government ought to do it and \nestablish a new program.\n  I happen to have a bill called the sunset bill which I think we ought \nto take a look at. We ought to take a look at programs that have been \nin existence for 10 years and see if they are as important now as they \nwere when they were created. If not, let's change them.\n  In any event, I want to talk in opposition to the Dorgan amendment, \nwhich is the windfall profits tax amendment, which has to do with the \nbill before us. What we are talking about in this tax bill is the \neconomy. We are talking about growth. Notwithstanding what has been \nsaid, we have had growth, 3.5 percent growth in GDP in the last \nquarter. That is above average in the last 10 years. We do have growth. \nThat is what it is all about.\n  We also ought to recognize when we are able to leave people with more \nmoney in their hands to spend, that is a good thing. If you can reduce \ntaxes so people have money to invest, that is a good thing. That is \nwhat creates the economy and economic growth. That is what it is all \nabout, the economy.\n  The other overriding issue before us, although I don't think it is a \nspecific issue here, is one of the main factors of the economy, and \nthat is energy. Without energy, we don't have an economy. So we are \ntalking a lot recently, and should be, about energy--where we are going \nto get energy, where it is going to come from, how we are going to \ninvest in new sources of energy. That has been one of the key issues \nfor the last year. We finally got an energy policy. Unfortunately, what \nwe are talking about now, particularly in this windfall profits \namendment, is something totally adverse to the philosophy that we have \ndeveloped to create new energy sources.\n  The windfall profits tax amendment which has been offered is not only \nbad policy but it sends the wrong message to American companies and to \nentrepreneurs.\n  Supporters of this tax have tried to demonize the whole concept of \nmaking a profit. Companies are in business to make a profit. They make \nprofits and create jobs, which is what we are talking about all the \ntime. If they did not make a profit they would not be in business, and \nwe would not have jobs.\n  The Senator was talking about the number of jobs. Why does one think \nthere are jobs? Because there are profitable companies. That is what we \nneed to be talking about. Supporters of this windfall tax, however, \nwant people to believe that the oil industry somehow managed to reap \nundeserved profits, resulting in one of the highest profit margins in \nAmerica.\n  Well, they have profits. Who would not have profits when there has \nbeen that kind of increase in the energy business? It is not the case \nthat they are unusually high profit margins. The profits for the oil \ncompanies measured against other factors of the economy, frankly, are \nquite modest. I have a chart that shows a number of the industries \nwhich are much higher. These are the earnings of major industries in \nthe second quarter, net income on sales in 2005. It shows cents per \ndollar of sales in the various businesses, banks, pharmaceuticals, \nsoftware, semiconductors, diversified financials, household and \npersonal products, consumer services, insurance, telecommunications, \nfood, beverage and tobacco, real estate, health care, material, all \nU.S. industries, 7.9, and then next, oil and gas, 7.6 percent.\n  The third quarter moves them above this to about 8 percent, but look \nat these businesses that are much above that. They keep talking about \nhow they have had these unusually high and perhaps even illegal \nprofits.\n  Those who want to argue about this chart because it shows second \nquarter profits, and they are higher in the third quarter, it has \nchanged somewhat, but whatever it is it will be about 8.1 percent for \nthe oil industry.\n  I wonder if supporters of this windfall profits tax would suggest \nthat it be on all of these other businesses that are higher in their \nearnings than the oil and gas industry. I understand one of the \nsponsors of the amendment comes from a State where there are lots of \ninsurance companies, and despite a profit of over 10 percent, I do not \nsee him rushing to the floor to put a windfall tax on insurance.\n  We have had this news media focus on the energy industry and so it \nhas become this kind of thing, but I think we have to keep in mind the \nfuture. I certainly hope as we go about our business we think not only \nabout today but about 10 years from now: What are we going to do with \nenergy? There has been nothing of more concern to us than energy.\n  The facts speak for themselves. The Congress tried to take this \napproach in the early 1980s and it did not work. I understand they are \nsaying this is not like the other windfall, but indeed it is. It takes \nprofits they say are excessive, which are not comparatively, to \ndistribute them back out to the public.\n  Is that what the business system is about? Is that what the private \nsector is about? I do not believe so.\n  The efforts that were made to do that in the past did not work. The \nnonpartisan Congressional Research Service has documented this policy \nas a failure in the past, and I can only conclude that it would be a \nfailure again in the future. The whole concept defies common sense.\n  Who is qualified to deem the profits as determined by the market are \ntoo high? The market will adjust for that if that is the case. I \ncertainly do not believe any Member of Congress has those \nqualifications.\n  I understand the politics of wanting to distribute money to everyone. \nThat is a great thing to be able to put on one's resume. But it does \nnot conceptually, from a policy standpoint, make sense. We live in a \nmarket economy, and it is the model that works. Of course, we need to \ncontinue to change our system. But we have the best system in the \nworld, and we need to make sure we continue it, unlike Members who have \ntried all of these manipulations and the nonmarket approach, which has \nnot worked.\n  The market economy means if one engages in a risk associated with \ninvestment they should reap the benefits from that. Not unlike other \nindustries, the oil and gas industry requires significant investment \nand risk. I live in the State of Wyoming which is one of the highest \nproducers of energy, and I\n\n[[Page S13079]]\n\ncan say there is a great deal of investment that has to go into the \nproduction of the energy that goes to New England and New York where \nthey do not have any production of their own. That is the way it should \nbe. Nevertheless, one cannot sit off some other place and say we want \nenergy but we do not want to have any investment in it. One cannot sit \nout on the west coast where there is no production, no refineries, and \nsay, well, we want energy but we do not want any investment in \ntransportation to get it there or in the development of it.\n  That is what we hear a great deal on the Senate floor. I think not \nonly has that been the case in the past, and it is the case today, \nquite frankly, it is going to be more the case as time goes on. We are \ngoing to have to look for new ways to develop energy. In Wyoming, we \nare going to have to go to oil shale, for example, which is expensive \nto develop. We are going to have to go to deep wells. We are going to \nhave to go to secondary recovery. We are going to have to go to \nalternative fuels. We are going to have to go to converting coal to \nother things. Those are expensive kinds of investments, and that is \nwhat it is all about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority's time on the amendment has \nexpired.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as we get to that amendment on windfall \nprofits, I hope we will take this into account.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Could I inquire as to the time on my amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And the majority?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority time is expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I go back to the point \nthat my colleague from Wyoming made about this relationship between \nspending and revenue. Here is the problem we have. Here is where we are \nin spending as a percentage of gross domestic product. We are at about \n20 percent, a little over. Here is where we are in revenue. We are just \nover 17 percent. It is this gap between spending and revenue that is \ncreating these massive deficits, and this is before the baby boomers \nretire. The question is, How do we close this gap?\n  We could do it one of three ways: We could cut the spending down to \nthe amount of revenue that we are willing to levy. That would mean a \n36-percent cut in every part of Federal spending if we were to hold \nharmless from the cuts Social Security, defense, and interest on the \ndebt. We would have to cut everything else--homeland security, aid to \nveterans, education, parks, FBI. All the rest would have to be cut 36 \npercent to cut the spending down to the revenue we currently have.\n  A second possibility would be to raise revenue up to the spending \nline. That would mean a very significant revenue increase if we were to \ndo it just with revenues. A third possibility is some combination of \nspending cuts and revenue increases.\n  One of the assumptions being made is that to increase revenue, taxes \nhave to be increased. The fact is, the revenue service tells us the tax \ngap, the difference between what is owed and what is being paid, is now \n$350 billion a year.\n  Before we talk about a tax increase on anyone, before we have any \nsuggestion of a tax increase, we ought to go after that tax gap and we \nought to do it aggressively. That is part of the amendment that I have \noffered. Frankly, it is a part of the chairman's mark because the \nchairman closes $30 billion of loopholes in his proposal.\n  I agree with those, but I say to the Senator from Iowa he does not go \nfar enough at closing loopholes. In my proposal, we go further. For \nexample, we end the tax benefit for leasing foreign subway and sewer \nsystems.\n  Why would we not do that? Why do we allow companies to go and buy the \nsewer and subway systems of foreign cities and depreciate them on their \nU.S. taxes, cutting their taxes in our country, and then lease back the \nsubway and sewer systems to foreign cities? What a scam. Why are we \nallowing that? Somebody calls that a tax increase? Is that really a tax \nincrease to say to companies that they cannot go buy the sewer system \nin a foreign country's city and depreciate it on their U.S. taxes? That \nis what is going on.\n  We also would require tax withholding on Government payments to \ncontractors like Halliburton. Just like all the rest of us who have \nwithholding on our taxes, why do they not have withholding on theirs? \nIt would save us a lot of money; renewing the Superfund tax, 9.7 cents \na barrel on $60-per-barrel oil to clean up these toxic sites.\n  One can call those tax increases; I call them closing loopholes. I \ncall them closing scams. We ought to do it and use the money to pay for \nextending these tax reductions that are included in my amendment; the \nextending of tax reductions that are reasonable, that are in this \npackage.\n  I hope my colleagues will think for a minute about what we are doing. \nDebt is growing out of control. Why are we taking steps to add to the \ndeficit, to add to the debt? Why not pay for something around here?\n  Let us start paying our bills. That is what pay-go is all about. It \nsays, if my colleagues want more tax cuts, they have to pay for them. \nIf they want more spending, they have to pay for it. That is an \nAmerican value, paying one's bills. We are not doing that. We are \nstacking debt on top of debt. We have added $3 trillion to the debt \nover the 5 years of this Presidency. Under this budget plan, we are \ngetting ready to add another $3 trillion of debt before the baby \nboomers retire. We can do better than that. America deserves better \nthan that. It certainly does not deserve us stacking debt on top of \ndebt.\n  I yield the floor and reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nafter the coming vote on the Conrad amendment, the next speakers and \namendments be in order as follows: First, Senator Domenici be \nrecognized to speak for 20 minutes; Senator Feinstein will be \nrecognized to offer two amendments on which there will be a total of 30 \nminutes equally divided on the two amendments; following that time, \nthat Senator Cantwell be recognized for the purpose of offering her \namendment with respect to energy price gouging, and there be 60 minutes \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the substitute \namendment.\n  Let me first explain that this substitute does not contain everything \nwe had hoped to offer. Some of the items that we cannot consider today, \nthough, are extremely important to American families.\n  They include the Lincoln-Snowe child tax credit fix. The Lincoln-\nSnowe provisions would ensure that the working poor can continue to \nreceive this valuable credit. Regrettably, the threshold climbs each \nyear. And the minimum wage remains stagnant.\n  So these families receive a smaller refundable child tax credit each \npassing year.\n  Another package we had hoped to include were a few incentives for \nmilitary families. These include a provision to ensure that families \nwith someone serving in combat can continue to receive the earned \nincome tax credit. With the heavy strain that the Iraq war continues to \nput on military families, Congress can surely do more for these \nfamilies.\n  The substitute today does not address a few items for the Gulf States \nI had hoped to include.\n  As I have said many times in the past few months, we must address the \nimmediate needs of the hundreds of thousands of people affected by the \nhurricanes that ravaged the Gulf States. We cannot forget that the \nrecovery in the gulf region is not over. It has hardly begun.\n  People have lost everything and need help to rebuild their lives. \nThat help has not arrived. We have more work to do in this Congress to \nmake sure displaced families have access to health care, unemployment \nbenefits while they search for work, childcare so they can get to work, \nand foster care services for needy kids.\n  It is irresponsible to leave these people behind and move on to \ncutting taxes before we have completed our job of providing real relief \nto those that have been hurt by the storms.\n\n[[Page S13080]]\n\n  But for procedural reasons, we are offering a different substitute. I \nbelieve that this substitute is a better approach than the bill before \nthe Senate today.\n  I want to highlight some principles that we pursued in this \nsubstitute. And what we are not doing here is as important as what we \nare.\n  Other than the disaster recovery incentives, we do not add to the \ndeficit. That is an important distinction between our substitute and \nthe bill before the Senate.\n  I know that the majority leadership hopes that spending \nreconciliation cuts will occur at some point. But even if Congress does \nenact those highly controversial cuts, the bill before us today would \nstill add to the deficit.\n  This is exactly what Alan Greenspan warned us against last week: \ndeficit-financed tax cuts.\n  How can we face constituents who will see their food stamps or child \nsupport services cut? How can we tell them that we had to make those \ncuts to pay for tax cuts?\n  How could we tell them that Congress cut their benefits for tax cuts \nthat will not even take effect until several years down the road?\n  Another thing that we do not do in this substitute is any extension \nof tax cuts that don't expire this year. The last 3 years have been the \n3 highest deficits in the Nation's history. At some point, we need to \ndo some belt-tightening.\n  In all fairness, I support many of these tax cuts. I have cosponsored \nand voted for many of them. But we simply need to prioritize this year. \nWe need to do what is urgent first.\n  The bill before us today does not include the capital gains and \ndividends tax cuts. But we know that it may well appear at some point \nduring this reconciliation process, especially now that the House tax-\nwriters have chosen capital gains and dividends tax cuts to the \nexclusion of AMT relief.\n  Some cite the $20 billion figure for the 2-year extension of capital \ngains and dividends cuts.\n  But we are really talking about a $50 billion cost over 10 years. And \nthat is the way that we usually score tax bills.\n  There are some good items in the bill before us today, but I think in \norder to be a great bill, we must achieve fiscal responsibility. Our \nsubstitute not only meets all the budget numbers, it does better. The \n2006 loss is below $11 billion, the 5-year loss is $20 billion, and the \n10-year figure actually cuts Federal deficit by $6 billion.\n  It comes down to timing, priorities, and fiscal responsibility. I \nurge my colleagues to support this substitute.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, are we now ready to dispose of the \nConrad amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to use my time at this point if that will \nhelp the managers.\n  Mr. President, the question before us is, What is our vision for the \nfuture? If this chart shows your vision of the fiscal future of the \ncountry, vote against my amendment. If you think the answer to our \nfiscal future is just to add more and more to the debt, then vote \nagainst me. If you believe it is time to get our fiscal house in order, \nat least to begin steps to get our fiscal house in order, vote with me. \nIf you believe the underlying budget makes sense, here is what the \nunderlying budget does. For the next 5 years it adds to the debt, going \nfrom just under $8 trillion to over $11 trillion. It is going to add \nover $3 trillion to the debt over the next 5 years.\n  If you think that is a mistake, then support the alternative that I \nam offering, which says: Yes, we will provide the hurricane disaster \nrelief; yes, we will provide extensions of the expiring provisions on \nalternative minimum tax--in fact, we will protect 600,000 more \ntaxpayers than the chairman's mark. And we will provide the R tax \ncredit, the State sales tax deduction, the college tuition deduction, \nthe Welfare-to-Work and Work Opportunity Tax Credits, the teacher \nclassroom expenses deduction, the leasehold improvement and restaurant \ndepreciation, and all other traditional tax extenders--but we will pay \nfor them.\n  How do we pay for them? We take the offsets that are in the \nchairman's mark that are loophole closers that shut down abusive tax \nshelters, and we add additional tax shelters and loophole closers--\nending a loophole for oil companies that lets them avoid taxes on \nforeign operations, ending the tax benefit for the leasing of foreign \nsubway and sewer systems--again, I say to my colleagues, why would we \never permit that?--require tax withholding on Government payments to \ncontractors like Halliburton, and renewing the Superfund tax so that \npolluting companies pay for cleaning up toxic waste.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. All time \nhas expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask my colleagues to support my amendment to pay for \nthe tax breaks we want to extend. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I raise a point of order the amendment \nis not germane to the underlying legislation.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive the applicable sections of \nthat act for purposes of the pending amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having \nvoted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected and the point of order \nis sustained. The amendment falls.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nMexico is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't believe I will use 20 minutes.\n  I am here this morning to ask a few questions and make a few \nobservations about the pending windfall profit tax amendment. I will \nfirst explain what I think the amendment is all about.\n  This imposes a windfall profit tax on all oil sold for more than $40 \na barrel. The tax would be 50 percent. Every year whatever tax is \ncollected would be divided up among all individual taxpayers as a \ncredit. The only way for a company to avoid the tax would be for it to \nspend all of its receipts above $40 a barrel on investments qualified \nby the Government. In other words, we know best. We know where they \nshould invest; qualified investment for things such as pipelines, new \ndrilling, refineries, as long as the drilling is in areas that are not \nalready proven oil and gas property.\n  I don't know what the intention is with reference to oil. Is it to \nproduce more oil or not? If it is, it seems to me an investment of oil \nof any type that comes out of the ground would be\n\n[[Page S13081]]\n\nsomething we should want, but by no means am I suggesting I want to add \nthis list because I believe the whole idea is wrongheaded.\n  I ask a few questions about what I have observed and what I noted is \npretty close to right. If Saudi Arabian oil is being sold at $55 a \nbarrel in Saudi Arabia, am I correct that any entity that sells that \noil in the United States would have to pay a tax of $12.50 per barrel, \neven if they sold that in the United States for the same price they \nbought it, to wit, $55 a barrel? Is that what we have in mind? That is, \nif Saudi Arabian oil sells at $55 a barrel, one of our American \ncompanies has to buy oil to create gasoline for us--if, in fact, they \nbuy it at $55--that exceeds the $40. So what if they sell it for $55? \nMy arithmetic says that is zero. There is no profit. There is no \nmarkup.\n  Under this amendment, they would still have to pay a tax of $12.50 a \nbarrel, selling it at cost. How could that do anything to encourage \nproduction or investment? It would encourage the opposite. As a matter \nof fact, it would seem to me it would discourage selling oil bought in \nthat manner in the United States--something we would not want. The \nmarket value in the world is $55, and they will lose money selling it \nin the United States. Pretty soon we would have a shortage in the \nUnited States. Who would want to sell it here?\n  In fact, if we look at it, to avoid taking a loss on the sale of that \nSaudi oil in the United States, any importer of that oil, according to \nmy arithmetic, would have to sell it at $70 just to cover the cost of \nthe tax. It seems to me, in that case, even though the cost of oil is \n$55 in Saudi Arabia, Senator Dorgan's amendment would deem $30 of that \nsale price to be a windfall profit. So the seller would owe $15 to the \nTreasury and would be left with just the $55 necessary to meet the \ncost.\n  That is absolutely counterproductive, the wrong thing to do and an \nunintended, but direct, consequence of this way to raise money and \nseemingly to send some kind of message to the oil companies about their \nprofits.\n  Another question in the scenario that I gave, isn't it true this \namendment would actually raise the cost of oil from $55 a barrel to $70 \na barrel, on pure economics? This amendment would tell the oil \ncompanies to sell oil higher than is happening today in order to break \neven because of the imposition of the tax. That would be very bad. \nWould it help the country? Who would it help? It hurts us. It hurts our \nconsumers instead of helping the problem attempted to be addressed; \nnamely, get the cost of oil down. It would cause the opposite.\n  It seems to me, in a general way, the amendment imposes a tax on oil \nthat would drive up the price of oil. It is not a tax on the companies. \nIt is a tax on oil. Does the Senator have any sort of analysis? I don't \nhave one. I wish I did. I wonder what the Congressional Budget Office \nor the Joint Tax Committee or the Energy Information Agency would show \nthis amendment would do in terms of the cost to our consumers? Such an \nanalysis, which we do not have time to do, would show that American \nconsumers would not have a decrease in the cost of gasoline. Rather, it \nwould go up. I wish we could have that study. I believe, and I think I \nhave a bit of credibility, the imposition of this windfall profit tax \nwould cause the price to our consumers to go up, not down.\n  It also means that oil companies have an option of selling their oil \nin the United States and paying a sizable tax in the United States. \nThey will probably sell it overseas to avoid paying the tax. If they \nhave an option to sell it here and paying a tax or selling it overseas, \nthey will take the option of selling it overseas. Why not? It is pure \nlogic. You lose money selling it in the United States.\n  Is the amendment accompanied by analysis that shows how much less oil \nwould be available in the United States if this amendment is passed? I \ntruly believe it will make less oil available. If less oil is \navailable, the price goes up, not down, for those items that come from \ncrude oil.\n  Does the proponent of the amendment have any kind of analysis as to \nwhat would happen to the prices if companies stop selling some portion \nof the current imports to the United States? That is a very interesting \nquestion. I believe what would happen is the opposite of what is \nintended. If this is intended to penalize the companies, rather than \nbeing a tax on oil, I assure you that if it is a tax on oil, the price \nwill go up, not down. It seems there is no argument about that. If the \nprice goes up because of the tax, does the gasoline coming from the \ncrude oil go down so our consumers get a break? Of course not. The \nprice goes up. So we do not get a break; we get the opposite. We get an \nincrease. And under the guise of a good bill to help American \nconsumers, we get one that clearly will scalp them. They will pay more, \nrather than less, and we will have some money to claim to our taxpayers \nthat we are giving them back because we are hurting big oil, which \nseems to be the intention of this amendment.\n  I also note this amendment allows the oil sellers to avoid a part of \nthe tax if they invest it in new oil wells drilled in areas of the \ncountry that are not proven up as gas properties. That is very \ninteresting. They cannot invest it in oilfields that are proven up that \nrequire money to drill. They cannot do that. It has to be new \noilfields. I ask if the proponent of the amendment would submit a list \nof unproven areas in the United States where the drilling of oil is \nsupported. Where are the fields for new production that are supported? \nFrankly, every field you try you cannot get it done because of some \nobjection or another. In fact, I ask the sponsor, more particularly, \nwould he submit to the Senate a list of unproven areas where he, the \ndistinguished Senator, supports drilling new fields? It would be all \nright if he gave a list that are supported not necessarily by the \nSenator but by any authentic group.\n  In its totality, let me summarize: This is not a tax on the oil \ncompanies. This is a tax on oil. It will not produce more oil to tax \noil. It will not produce lower costs to the consumer by taxing oil. It \nis very logical if you say: Here is a product for sale for $150. That \nis the established price. But now the municipality says: Let's have a \n15-percent sales tax or a 50-percent tax on the profits or whatever we \ndetermine. That makes the price of the product go up, not down. The \nsame will happen with oil. Tax the product, the price goes up. Tax the \ncompany on profits, unless they do something, the price goes up, not \ndown.\n  It would be impossible for the energy companies to invest the money \nin a timely manner in the manner prescribed. I cannot imagine $3 \nbillion or $4 billion being invested in 1 year in the items recommended \nby the Congress that knows best where companies should spend it. It \nseems to me they would have to pay the windfall. They could not do the \ninvesting.\n  There is much more to say. There is no question this will cost the \nconsumers more, not less. Gasoline will go up, not down. The supplies \nwill be less, not more. All of which we do not want. All of which I \nwould think the sponsor of the amendment would not want. It is an \nabsolute certainty that is what will happen.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

  fiscal years for which the estimate was made.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2609\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this amendment would strike a tax \nincentive from the books for the oil and gas companies that allows them \nto expense their exploration and development costs.\n  This tax credit is unnecessary, not because I say that it is, but \nbecause the oil companies have said they do not need it. The President \nof the United States has said the oil companies do not need it, and the \nJoint Committee on Taxation estimates this tax credit costs the Federal \nTreasury $2.4 billion over 5 years.\n  I wish to make clear that this amendment only repeals the credit for \nthe major integrated oil companies--ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, Chevron, and \nConocoPhillips. This tax credit allows major oil companies, such as the \nones I have just mentioned, to deduct 70 percent of their drilling \ncosts up front, then the next 30 percent over the course of 5 years. \nCosts that can be deducted include workers' wages, fuel costs, drilling \nequipment, materials, and supplies, et cetera.\n  Now, why should the oil and gas industry get special treatment? And \nwhy should they get tax breaks from the Federal Government when they \nare making record profits? In the third quarter of 2005 alone, the five \nbiggest companies earned a staggering combined total of more than $30 \nbillion.\n  ExxonMobil's profits skyrocketed another 75 percent in the third \nquarter to almost $10 billion. Over the first 9 months of 2005, \nExxonMobil made a profit of $25.42 billion.\n  BP made 34 percent more, or $6.46 billion, in the third quarter of \n2005. So far this year, BP has made $18.66 billion.\n  Shell's profits soared 68 percent to $9 billion in the third quarter \nof 2005, while making $20.94 billion over the first 9 months of the \nyear.\n\n[[Page S13083]]\n\n  Chevron's third-quarter profits were 12 percent higher, or $3.6 \nbillion. So far this year, Chevron made $10 billion.\n  ConocoPhillips saw an 89 percent increase or $3.8 billion in the \nthird quarter, while making a profit of $9.85 billion over the first 9 \nmonths of the year.\n  At the same time this is happening, the Federal budget deficit is the \nthird largest in history, totaling $319 billion, and the national debt \nhas surpassed the $8 trillion mark.\n  In April of this year, President Bush stated:\n\n       With oil at more than $50 a barrel, by the way, energy \n     companies do not need taxpayers'-funded incentives to explore \n     for oil and gas.\n\n  At the joint Senate hearing last week, at which the CEOs of \nExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, BP, and Shell testified, Senator \nWyden asked them if, given the fact that oil prices are above $55 per \nbarrel, they needed these Federal tax incentives. They all responded \n``No.'' In fact, Lee Raymond of ExxonMobil stated this: ``No and I \ndon't think our company has asked for any incentives for exploration.''\n  Now, I see Senator Wyden is in the Chamber, and since I have quoted \nhim, I would like to ask him if I have accurately reported what \nhappened at this Senate joint hearing with the oil executives.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Senator from California has accurately \nreported it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Let me ask this question. Did the Senator get the \nidea from all of the big oil companies that none of them wanted these \ntax incentives?\n  Mr. WYDEN. What is so staggering is, when these big oil companies are \ncharging record prices, making record profits, they are being given \nrecord tax subsidies that they show up and tell the American people \nthey do not want.\n  So I intend to speak on this after the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia is done. But she has an excellent amendment. I say to the \nSenator, you have characterized their testimony correctly.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Oregon.\n  In essence, Mr. President, this is the biggest handout to the biggest \ncorporations in America--as a matter of fact, in the world. We should \nnot be giving them a tax break so they can do their job--to drill for \noil--when they certainly do not need it.\n  Again, let me be clear: this is a tax credit for the major oil \ncompanies only. It should not surprise anyone to learn that these same \noil companies' effective tax rates were well below 35 percent. In 2001, \ntheir tax rate was 17.3 percent; in 2002, 5.6 percent; in 2003, 13.3 \npercent. This averages out to 13.3 percent over the 3-year period.\n  By contrast, 14 industries have higher effective tax rates. The \nhealth care industry is 22.3 percent; the financial industry, 19.7 \npercent; pharmaceuticals pay 21.6 percent; the chemical industry, 20.8 \npercent; the computer industry, 16 percent; tobacco and food \nindustries, 23.8 percent--and on and on and on, and yet the oil \ncompanies pay very little.\n  So not only are these energy tax incentives taking money out of the \nTreasury, they are also allowing oil companies to lower their effective \ntax rate so that less money actually flows from them into the Treasury. \nThat is unacceptable. They say they do not need it. The President says \nthey do not need it. And this would essentially correct that situation.\n  When this tax bill was considered, the Finance Committee recognized \nthis fact and repealed the amortization of geological and geophysical \nexpenditures for the major integrated oil companies. It also changed \nthe way oil companies with gross receipts over $1 billion can account \nfor their oil inventories. The amendment I offer today takes one more \nstep in taking away unnecessary tax breaks for the oil and gas \nindustry.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting \nthis amendment. I thank the cosponsors.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2610\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I would like to speak for a moment on the second \namendment, which I call the millionaire's amendment, which is offered \nto my colleagues by Senator Kerry and me.\n  I have never had a millionaire come to me and say: I need a tax \nbreak. I have had them come to me and say: Frankly, the $100,000 I get \na year is de minimis to me. It doesn't make a difference to me.\n  So I wonder, when we are cutting Medicaid, when we are cutting \nvirtually every domestic program we can cut, why millionaires get \n$100,000 in tax breaks a year. It does not make sense. They do not ask \nfor them. They do not need them. It does not really make a difference \nto them.\n  Our amendment directly targets the budget deficit. It says if the \nbudget is not in balance, tax rates for income, capital gains, and \ndividends will return to previous levels, and deduction limits, for \ntaxpayers earning more than $1 million. So those taxes would be \nreinstated only for people earning more than $1 million. According to \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation and the Tax Policy Center, this \namendment could increase revenues by more than $100 billion over 5 \nyears.\n  When I came to the Senate in 1992, the debt was $4 trillion. In the \n1990s, we put it down, and by 1998, we achieved the first budget \nsurplus in 29 years. By 2001, the 10-year projected surplus was $5.6 \ntrillion. Now, it has been said on this floor over and over again that \nprojected surplus has been turned into a major projected long-term \ndeficit. The Federal budget deficit will reach $515 billion this year \nwhen all trust funds are included. This means over half a trillion \ndollars will be added to our Nation's debt--a national debt that has \nalready exceeded the $8 trillion mark. Yet millionaires get a $100,000 \ntax break a year, which they have told me they don't need, it doesn't \nmake a difference. At the same time, this debt and deficit will fuel a \nrise in interest rates. There have already been a dozen hikes. It will \neventually slow down the economy, and it will certainly limit job \ncreation.\n  In order to cover the costs of our debt, this Senate cut $10 billion \nin health care spending for the poorest Americans. To make matters \nworse, the temporary relief for physicians in the spending bill is \nborne on the backs of Medicare beneficiaries in the form of higher Part \nB premiums. The spending cuts will directly increase, by $2.90, the \namount Medicare beneficiaries pay each month in premiums in 2007. That \nis a 33-percent increase in monthly premiums. While it is vital that \nCongress prevent future cuts in Medicare reimbursement to physicians, \nthe spending cuts amounted to a $1.4 billion tax on seniors. This is \nsimply unacceptable.\n\n  I do not think it is a bad idea to say that millionaires might be \nwilling to help people on Medicare. They might be willing to provide \nsome support for Medicaid so that the poorest Americans could receive \nhealth care.\n  So here is the bottom line: Realistically, there are very few \nmillionaires in my State. There are about 28,000--28,000 out of 37 \nmillion people. The number of people on Medicare and Medicaid affected \nby these cuts is in the millions. That is the difference. So if you \nrestore this tax for millionaires, it essentially covers the cuts on \nMedicare and Medicaid.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven and a half minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I understand that Senator Wyden would \nlike to use some of this time. I would be happy to allot him--how much \ntime does the Senator require?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I think 7 minutes would be fine.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask Senator Feinstein, would it be OK if I \nuse my leader time now?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. This doesn't take away from their time, Mr. President.\n  Thank you very much. I appreciate the courtesy. It is so nice of you \nto let me do this. I know everyone is waiting to offer their \namendments. This is leader time. It comes off of the bill.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. President, last night, on the heels of two very bloody days in \nIraq where 11 American soldiers have been killed, the President and the \nVice President shamelessly decided to play politics. It was another \ndeplorable political ploy from an administration that is growing more \nand more and more desperate and disconnected. The\n\n[[Page S13084]]\n\nAmerican people and our brave soldiers deserve better.\n  It seems the President and Vice President have decided to treat the \nwar as if it is a political campaign. Instead of giving our troops a \nplan for success or answering the serious questions of the American \npeople, they have decided to reignite the Rove-Cheney attack machine.\n  We are at war. We need a Commander in Chief, not a Campaigner in \nChief. We need leadership from the White House, not more White House-\nwashing of the very serious issues confronting us in Iraq.\n  This week, Senate Democrats and Republicans, right here in this \nSenate, voted overwhelmingly to send the President this message: It is \ntime to change course in Iraq.\n  Instead of heeding that call, the White House continues to dodge and \nto duck the questions of Americans and to smear their opponents. That \nis not leadership, and our troops and the American people deserve \nbetter.\n  Here is what Senator Chuck Hagel said. Now, who is Chuck Hagel? Chuck \nHagel is a decorated Vietnam war veteran, a man who, in Vietnam, saved \nthe life of his own brother. Of course, he is also a senior Republican \nmember of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Here is what he had to say about the administration's tactics. These \nare not my words. They are the words of the Senator from Nebraska:\n\n       Suggesting that to challenge or criticize policy is \n     undermining or hurting our troops is not democracy, nor what \n     this country has stood for, for over 200 years . . . To \n     question your government is not unpatriotic--to not question \n     your government is unpatriotic. America owes its men and \n     women in uniform a policy worthy of their sacrifices.\n\n  He is right. The deceiving, dividing, and distorting must end. Of \ncourse, this is the same move we have seen from Karl Rove and Dick \nCheney time and time again. Whenever their poll numbers sink, they go \nback on the attack. This time, though, the stakes are too high to let \nthem get away with it. There is more than poll numbers or votes at \nstake. The lives of our brave soldiers in Iraq depend on this President \ncoming clean and coming forward with a plan for Iraq.\n  President Bush, Vice President Cheney, and Karl Rove must stop the \norchestrated attack campaign they launched on Veterans Day. It is a \nweak, spineless display of politics at a time of war. It is easy to \nattack. The hard part is leading, coming clean with the American \npeople, and giving our troops a strategy for success.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Parliamentary inquiry: My understanding is that if I take \nabout 7 minutes or so to discuss the Feinstein-Wyden, and others, \namendment with respect to energy, that would still leave the Senator \nfrom California about 5 minutes to conclude for our side?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am happy to yield the balance of my time to the \nSenator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield my 3 minutes to the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. Chairman, I asked for some time. Do I have time, \nthen, following the Senator from Oregon?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Feinstein and I have \n10 additional minutes, Senator Thomas would be afforded the same \namount, so that the total amount for this provision would only be \nexpanded at a maximum amount of 20 minutes. I would take 5 minutes from \nour side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask my good friend to cut that down \nsignificantly. We are oversubscribed in time. It is a zero-sum game. \nExtra time you take means less time for other Senators later on. I urge \nyou to modify your request to a much lower number, please.\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator from Montana is gracious. Does the Senator \nfrom California need any additional time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am yielding my remaining 3 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, if I could have 3 additional minutes so I \ncould speak for a total of up to 6 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Let's make it 5 and 5.\n  Mr. WYDEN. That would be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2609\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, with the CEOs of the major oil companies \nadmitting that they do not need tax breaks, Democrats and Republicans \nin the Senate are signaling that it is a new day as far as energy \ntaxes. For the first time in 20 years, the Senate is on the brink of \ncutting back on a portion of the billions of dollars in tax breaks the \nmajor oil companies receive annually.\n  The long march toward reforming the energy provisions in our Tax Code \nbegan a couple of days ago, when the Senate Finance Committee accepted \nmy amendment that would limit a brand-new tax break in the 2005 Energy \nbill that would allow the oil companies to get faster write-offs for \ntheir exploration costs. That amendment was, in my view, a beginning at \nrolling back unnecessary tax breaks. Today, a bipartisan group, under \nthe leadership of Senator Feinstein and Senator Sununu, are building on \nthat.\n  It is preposterous for the Senate to keep voting out tax breaks for \nthe major oil companies when these executives go on national television \nand say they aren't needed. At a time when the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program doesn't have enough funds, at a time when Americans \nare hurting all across the country, I don't know how it is possible for \na Member of the Senate to stand up and say: We are going to continue to \ndispense tax favors that the oil industry says are not needed.\n  What I did in the Finance Committee, what Senator Feinstein is \nbuilding on today, is to say we are going to do a better job in the \nfuture of targeting scarce resources. In this case we are going to \nlimit the tax breaks to the small and independent producers. Even with \nthat, the fact is that over the past 2 years, oil companies have \nalready increased their drilling operations, as the price of oil has \nskyrocketed from $45 per barrel to over $70. The number of rigs in \noperation and the amount of drilling have both increased by a third \nsince 2003.\n\n  Special treatment of oil and gas costs in the Tax Code is exactly the \nkind of special interest tax break we ought to be working, on a \nbipartisan basis, to eliminate. By eliminating this and other special-\ninterest tax breaks, it will be possible to simplify the Code, help to \nlower tax rates, and, most specifically, let the energy markets work, \nlet capital flow to its highest and best use.\n  This is a pretty big day in the Senate. Literally for 20 years, the \nSenate has been pouring it on in terms of one tax break after another \nfor the major oil companies. If you look at the statutes, the statutes \nare not confining these tax breaks to the small independent producer. \nMy legislation in the Senate Finance Committee did just that. I heard \nthe pleas of a number of colleagues on the Finance Committee who said: \nBe careful about the small independent producers. I did that. We passed \nit in the Finance Committee.\n  Senator Feinstein and Senator Sununu have picked up on that theme. \nThis is not going to take anything away from the small independent \nproducers, but it is a big first step at reforming the Tax Code and \nkeeping taxpayers' hard-earned money, when major oil executives say \nthey don't need those dollars for tax breaks.\n  I hope the Senate will support the Feinstein-Sununu amendment, and \ntake the next step in this effort to reform the Tax Code.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, here we are again, faced with another \nopportunity to make it more difficult for us to meet our needs in \nenergy. Interestingly enough, people on the west coast who need the \nenergy more than anyone seem to be pushing for this.\n  There is a misunderstanding here as to what has been done. But these \ntax opportunities are particularly the cost of conducting oil and gas \nexploration and production, particularly offshore, the difficult ones, \nthe high-cost offshore drilling, the kinds of things we are going to \nhave to get into to continue to have it. We have about expanded all the \nregular drilling we can.\n\n[[Page S13085]]\n\nHere is an opportunity to do something unusual. By the way, I think \nthere has been a little misunderstanding on the question that was \nasked. The question that was asked, as I understand it, was on geology, \nG, which was in the bill. They said they didn't need that. This is \nnot G This is another issue.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THOMAS. No, I am not going to yield. Thank you.\n  This is a little different issue than we talked about before. If you \nwould ask these people, do they need it to do these kinds of drilling \non the intangibles, that is not geology, which is the one they were \ntalking about, the G issue that was in there.\n  Here again, we went through this in another amendment. We continue to \ndo the same thing. We have spent all this time trying to get an energy \nbill out there to try to encourage new ways to look at energy, trying \nto look at new opportunities for energy, all of which are very \nimportant. Quite frankly, living in a State where we do a lot of this, \nthe people who are willing and able to put the investment in these \nkinds of new approaches are not the independents. They are the larger \ncompanies. They are the integrated companies that are able to do this.\n  This continuing idea that somehow these people are too rich--I had my \nchart out here a little while ago, talking about the return on revenue \nand profits. They were down below the middle of all the other \nindustries. If we want to talk about taking away windfall profits and \ngiving it back to everyone, you are starting with the wrong industry. \nWe ought to be talking about the 10 or 12 industries that have a higher \nreturn on their sales than do the people in this business of producing \nthe fuel and the energy we need to keep our economy going.\n  If we want to look at having jobs, if we want to look at a growing \neconomy, it is very clear. The more we see of it, the more we see of \nhaving to get offshore oil, the more we see of having to do, which we \nshould, conservation and other things, the more important it is for us \nto have an opportunity to begin to continue to move into new sources of \nenergy, the ones that are more difficult.\n  This amendment is just another one to inhibit that, based on the idea \nthat the oil companies are getting too much of a profit. Again, take a \nlook at the facts. They are not, compared to others. The return has \nbeen a reasonable one, and I believe we ought to not adopt this kind of \nan amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2612\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Ms. Cantwell], for herself, \n     Mr. Bayh, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. \n     Carper, proposes an amendment numbered 2612.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To improve the Federal Trade Commission's ability to protect \n consumers from price-gouging during energy emergencies, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n       At the end of the bill, insert the following:\n\n             TITLE I--ENERGY EMERGENCY CONSUMER PROTECTION\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, my amendment is based on S. 1735 which \nhas been sponsored by about 29 of my colleagues. I certainly appreciate \nthe fact that this amendment is being cosponsored by Senators Bayh, \nSchumer, Boxer, Carper, and Lieberman. I thank my colleagues for paying \nattention to what I believe is a very important issue for us to address \nbefore we adjourn; that is, the issue of price gouging and the fact \nthat the Senate should say loud and clear that we think price gouging \nshould be a Federal crime. That is exactly what my amendment does. It \ncreates a new Federal statute to make sure that consumers are protected \nfrom price gouging.\n  How did we arrive at this point? While my colleagues, I am sure, \nwould like to adjourn and continue to think about the complications and \nchallenges, the American economy is being hurt by the high price of \ngasoline, as we saw this summer prior to Katrina. Certainly, we are \nanxious about the winter months and home heating oil and the costs that \nconsumers are going to pay when they get their bills in the next couple \nof months.\n  It is important to note that Americans will spend over $200 billion \nmore on energy this year than they did last year. That is hundreds of \nbillions of dollars coming directly out of family budgets and the \nbottom lines of businesses across the country. The airline industry is \nexpected to spend $30 billion more on fuel alone this year, which is \ntwice what they spent in 2003. In fact, if you look at what the airline \nindustry is expected to lose this year, it is about $9.5 billion. If \nyou look at the increase in the expense of fuel costs for the airline \nindustry, it is $9.2 billion.\n  For the airline industry, there is a high correlation between their \nactual loss and the amount they are paying in higher fuel costs. For \nthe trucking industry, where diesel fuel accounts for almost a quarter \nof their operating expenses, each penny increase in diesel fuel costs \nthe trucking industry $350 million a year. And what about our farmers \nwho are obviously on low profit margins--about 5 percent--and their \nchallenge? Well, they have had a combination of record diesel fuel \ncosts and price increases of fertilizer of more than 20 percent. So it \nmakes it very challenging for the American farmer to be competitive in \nthis kind of environment.\n  What about the Air Force? I know the Presiding Officer is interested \nin the Air Force. The Air Force energy budget is expected to increase \n50 percent this year, costing taxpayers another $400 million. Even the \nPostal Service is paying higher fuel prices, expecting to add another \n$300 million to the Postal Service transportation costs.\n  And what about the taxpayers? Well, they pay every week at the pump \nfor higher fuel costs and they want us to protect them. But I don't \nknow if they know that the taxpayers are even paying more for the \nPresident's travel. According to reports, the per-hour fuel cost for \nthe travel of Air Force One has increased from $3,974 to now $6,029.\n  The cost of energy integrated into our economy is costing us all more \nmoney and at a time when we are seeing oil companies reach record \nprofits and billions are being sent to countries such as Saudi Arabia, \nIran, and Venezuela. I guarantee you do not have our interests at \nheart.\n  I am offering an amendment today to say that price gouging is a \nFederal crime and we should pass this before we adjourn.\n  Why is it so important to pass new Federal legislation? First, there \nare 28 States in America, the District of Columbia included, Gulf \nStates such as Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, and Texas, \nthat currently have price-gouging statutes on the books. These States \nhave taken legal action to try to make sure that gas distributors or \nservice stations or oil companies are investigated when allegations of \nprice gouging have occurred, and certainly when you have a state of \nemergency as we have had after hurricanes. So these State statutes are \nthe very statutes we are saying ought to be in Federal law.\n  As to examples of how these have been prosecuted at the State level, \nretailers have been charged with unconscionable pricing attributed to \nan increase in unreasonable wholesale gasoline prices or because \ngasoline, oil, or fuel commodities in general are raised to what is an \nunconscionable price. We based this on what is a New York statute that \nhas been upheld in court. I think it is very important to note that the \nFederal court system has taken this term of unconscionable pricing and \nhas Federal case law related to it.\n  Why did we get to this point? We got to this point primarily because \ncurrent Federal law and the focus of the FTC has been whether there has \nbeen collusive pricing activities by these oil companies, collusive \nmeaning whether they got together and fixed the price.\n  That Federal statute gives very little room to investigate and \nexamine what I believe are key issues about supply and demand. We hear \na lot from the oil industry that this is about simple economics and \nsupply and demand.\n  I guarantee you we ought to be demanding more information about the \npossible manipulation of supply and why supply was exported out of the \nUnited States at a time when it was so needed for American consumers.\n  We need to pass a Federal price-gouging law to make sure that the \ncurrent law on the books does not leave us emptyhanded when coming to \npursue this issue and to make our point in protecting the American \nconsumers.\n  This last week we heard from attorneys general at a joint hearing of \nthe Senate Commerce Committee and the Senate Energy Committee talking \nabout this issue. One attorney general from New Jersey, Peter Harvey, \nwho has utilized his own statute on antiprice gouging, told us:\n\n       We need a Federal price gouging statute that applies \n     nationwide to the sale of essential goods and services.\n\n\n[[Page S13087]]\n\n\n  I am also pleased that the attorney general from New York--as I said, \nwe have based this statute on New York law--has also championed this \nlegislation in a letter of support that I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 State of New York\n\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                   New York, NY, November 8, 2005.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Stevens: thank you for your letter seeking \n     input on the issue of gasoline price gouging, and in \n     particular whether Congress should pass legislation \n     increasing the FTC's powers in this area.\n       In the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, my office \n     received numerous complaints about the escalation of the \n     price of motor fuel. In response, we launched an \n     investigation and demanded information from about 75 gas \n     stations around New York State that had been the subject of \n     complaints. In those cases where retailers appear to have \n     raised prices more than warranted based on their increased \n     costs, we have undertaken further analysis to determine \n     whether these stations have violated New York's price gouging \n     law (New York General Business Law Sec. 396-r). Our \n     investigation is ongoing, and we will vigorously pursue any \n     cases where we determine that illegal price gouging has \n     occurred.\n       As you undoubtedly are aware, a consumer's view of price \n     gouging usually is focused locally on rising prices at the \n     gas pump or the increase in heating costs over the previous \n     winter, and their complaints are directed at state and local \n     officials. Thus, retail manifestations of price gouging are \n     best suited to on-the-ground scrutiny that state and local \n     officials can provide.\n       However, the marketplaces for motor fuel and home heating \n     fuel are complex, and are international in scope. If a large \n     oil conglomerate abuses its market position during a real or \n     perceived crisis, the effect is likely to be felt in many (or \n     even all) states. Accordingly, there are levels in the chain \n     of distribution where federal assistance would be both \n     helpful and appropriate.\n       The FTC is particularly well suited to regulate price \n     gouging in the motor fuel market. As indicated in the FTC's \n     testimony to the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade and \n     Consumer Protection on September 22, 2005, FTC staff already \n     actively and routinely monitor prices at all levels of \n     gasoline distribution and, as stated in the testimony, ``[n]o \n     industry's performance is more deeply felt or carefully \n     scrutinized by the FTC.'' Currently, the FTC can act against \n     such companies if they unlawfully agree to fix prices, but \n     cannot act if unfair pricing practices occur simultaneously, \n     but without collusion.\n       Recently, it was widely reported that oil industry profits \n     soared during the third quarter of 2005, which includes the \n     weeks when the hurricanes affected the Gulf Coast. The net \n     income of Exxon Mobil rose 75% during that period, earning \n     $9.92 billion in profit, and the profits of Royal Dutch/Shell \n     increased by 68% during the third quarter. The Government \n     Accountability Office (GAO) concluded that retail prices rose \n     faster than the price of crude oil, and the magnitude of \n     these increases suggest that the disruption caused by \n     Hurricanes Katrina and Rita may have been exploited by the \n     major oil companies to levy price increases not directly \n     related to increased expenses.\n       For these reasons, I believe that expanded federal powers \n     in this area are warranted. In particular: the President \n     should be given the power to declare a temporary energy \n     emergency at times of threatened or actual disruption of \n     petroleum supplies, such as occurred during the recent \n     hurricanes; declaration of such an emergency should trigger a \n     prohibition against price gouging; there also should be a ban \n     on manipulative pricing practices in the petroleum markets, \n     similar to what Congress recently adopted for the electricity \n     and natural gas markets; and there should be significant \n     penalties to deter such conduct, and both the FTC and state \n     Attorneys General should be permitted to enforce these \n     violations.\n       I urge the Senate Commerce Committee to expeditiously \n     consider and pass the Energy Emergency Consumer Protection \n     Act of 2005 (S. 1735), which includes all of these provisions \n     as part of a comprehensive approach to the problem. The bill \n     was introduced on September 20, 2005 by Senator Cantwell, and \n     would provide law enforcement with vitally needed tools to \n     prevent price gouging, as well as allow greater federal \n     scrutiny of possible market manipulation practices.\n       Thank you once again for soliciting my input on this \n     important issue. It is essential that Congress, federal \n     regulators and state law enforcement officials work together \n     to prevent the types of abusive pricing practices that we \n     have recently witnessed. By doing so, we will be able to \n     protect motorists, homeowners, farmers and businesses across \n     the country.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                    Eliot Spitzer,\n                                                 Attorney General.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Attorney General Spitzer says:\n\n       Accordingly, there are levels in the chain of distribution \n     where Federal assistance would be both helpful and \n     appropriate . . .\n       Currently, the FTC can act against such companies if they \n     unlawfully agree to fix price, but cannot act if unfair \n     practices occur simultaneously but without collusion.\n\n  I think the Attorney General of New York has it right as to why we \nneed this Federal statute.\n  We also want to make sure we are recognizing in the next several \nmonths what further damage is going to happen to the economy if we do \nnot act, that is, if we leave here without getting a good Federal \nstatute on the books.\n  For example, in my home State a farmer from Lamont, WA, wrote to tell \nme that his fertilizer prices have gone up 75 percent since May and 100 \npercent since last year, and fuel costs have gone from $2 to $3.15. \nAnother eastern Washington farmer told me he is paying more for a \ngallon of fuel than he received for a bushel of grain. So these farmers \nare looking at this issue, and as Senator Roberts said the other day, \nthe agricultural industry is facing something like a category 5 fuel \nand fertilizer hurricane. We can't leave these farmers emptyhanded this \nwinter as we go away, without enacting a good, strong Federal statute.\n  Home heating oil is another issue in which consumers are going to \nfeel an impact. For an American family, it is believed that they will \npay an average of $306 or 41 percent more this winter than they did \nlast winter. So we certainly want to implement the Federal statute to \nprotect them during these winter months. I can tell you people are \nworried in my State. Unfortunately, our local jurisdictions are doing \ntheir best, but I think it shows what kind of anxiety Americans have \nabout being able to keep warm this winter.\n  In my State, in Whatcom County, after the Whatcom County Opportunity \nCouncil advertised last week they would take up the low-income energy \nassistance applications but would only take 200 walk-ins or the first \n400 phone-ins, they had over 200 people line up outside their doors, \nsome people standing outside all night long, just to receive assistance \nfrom this program, and the local phone service, Verizon, called to say \nthat the unusual volume of incoming calls trying to get energy \nassistance basically crashed the system for the entire area. I can tell \nyou consumers are anxious about these high fuel costs.\n  We are dealing in the Senate with airline bankruptcies and pensions. \nI can tell you the airline industry has been hardest hit by the \nincrease in fuel costs. As Southwest Airline CEO Steve Kelly told the \nSeattle Times recently:\n\n       We are now facing energy prices that no airlines can make \n     money at, at least with today's [ticket prices].\n\n  I want to make sure we do not have other pensions that are defaulted \non, other people losing their jobs or their life savings because we \nhave not enacted tough legislation saying that price gouging is a \nFederal crime.\n  The amendment I am offering today does a couple of things. First, it \ncreates a ban on price gouging during a national emergency declared by \nthe President of the United States. As I said earlier, the antiprice \ngouging standard is based on the successfully tested New York State \nstatute.\n  Second, it gives the FTC and AGs and, because it creates criminal \npenalties, the Department of Justice the authority to levy civil and \ncriminal penalties for proven price gouging of up to $3 million and 5 \nyears in jail. Additionally it puts in place a new ban on market \nmanipulation and falsifying information to the Federal Government about \nfuel prices, which is based on a provision of the Energy bill we passed \nhere this year related to electricity and natural gas, trying to stop \nthe market manipulation that happened in response to Enron and the \nmarket manipulation in the western energy crisis.\n  In addition, the bill gives additional remedies available to the FTC \nto levy fines up to $1 million for violation of market manipulation and \nfalse information.\n  I am very satisfied that this bill has the teeth in it that we need \nin a strong Federal statute to over the next several months give the \nFederal Government, attorneys general, and others the ability to \nprosecute market manipulation of energy prices.\n\n[[Page S13088]]\n\n  Why do I think this is so important? My colleagues have been on the \nfloor talking about the questions that were asked to oil company \nexecutives this week, the questions about whether they cared about tax \nincentives or tax breaks, whether they participated in energy meetings. \nMy questions were more about the supply of fuel here in the United \nStates and whether we have a greater understanding about the protection \nand possible manipulation of that fuel supply.\n  Now for my colleagues in the West who have been out on the floor, we \nhave reeled from an energy crisis on electricity, and my colleagues, \nSenators Wyden from Oregon and Feinstein from California, all had \neconomies that were very hurt by the manipulation of the electricity \nmarket. In fact, there are some cases in Federal courts now talking \nabout the manipulation of natural gas prices. So I guarantee you with \nfive refineries in the State of Washington, we are doing our part at \nrefining fuel, but we still have some of the highest gas prices in the \nNation and had those prior to Katrina, so my constituents want to know \nwhat are we going to do to make sure the prices are not manipulated.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from attorneys general across the country who are also \nsupporting my legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                November 17, 2005.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Daniel Inouye,\n     Co-Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n         Transportation, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Stevens and Co-Chairman Inouye: Even before \n     the devastation caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, \n     skyrocketing oil and gasoline prices were taxing American \n     families and burdening our nation's economy--with the notable \n     exception of the oil industry which continued to rack up \n     record profits. In fact, according to the Department of \n     Energy, Americans will spend over $200 billion more on energy \n     this year than they did last year, totaling over one trillion \n     dollars. These expenses seem directly proportional to the \n     extraordinary $33 billion in profits reported by the five \n     major oil companies for the third quarter of 2005. Exxon/\n     Mobil alone made an unconscionable $10 billion last quarter, \n     a 75 percent increase over last year. Moreover, the profit \n     that refiners are collecting from gasoline sales has \n     reportedly more than tripled from $7 per barrel in September \n     2004 to over $22 per barrel on September 27, 2005.\n       Given the extraordinary impact these energy costs have on \n     families, farmers, and businesses across America, we commend \n     your joint efforts with the Senate Energy and Natural \n     Resources Committee to hold a hearing last Wednesday to try, \n     as Senator Majority Leader Frist put it, to ``examine reasons \n     for high energy prices.'' Given our society's absolute \n     dependency on fossil fuels--whether to power our \n     transportation system, keep our families warm this winter, or \n     countless other uses--both American consumers and the economy \n     are extremely vulnerable to the whims of those with \n     sufficient market power to artificially constrain supply or \n     influence prices.\n       As the chief law enforcement officers of our respective \n     states, we are writing to urge you to pass federal \n     legislation that imposes a ban on energy price gouging. Any \n     bill must also provide new market transparency and market \n     manipulation authorities for the President and the Federal \n     Trade Commission to better protect consumers in the future.\n       To this end, we respectfully urge the Senate Commerce \n     Committee to expeditiously consider and pass Senate Bill \n     1735. While 28 states already have price gouging laws on the \n     books, the Energy Emergency Consumer Protection Act of 2005 \n     introduced by Senator Maria Cantwell on September 20, 2005 \n     and cosponsored by nearly a third of the U.S. Senate, in our \n     opinion would provide law enforcement with vitally needed \n     tools to prevent price gouging. S. 1735 would also finally \n     shine a bright light on the practices of oil companies and \n     refiners--a sector of the economy that historically has not \n     received close scrutiny from federal or state regulators. In \n     addition, we strongly support section five which empowers \n     States with the authority to pursue civil actions on behalf \n     of their residents for violations of price gouging \n     prohibitions.\n       We look forward to working with you on this critical issue \n     to the American public and our nation's economy. With ninety \n     percent of Americans believing price gouging is occurring at \n     the pumps, we have a responsibility to do everything we can \n     to ensure it is not taking place. We believe the Energy \n     Emergency Consumer Protection Act of 2005 can do that. Even \n     if we determine that there is no market manipulation going \n     on, then it would be a case of ``no harm, no foul.'' Passage \n     will help assure the public that government is providing the \n     oversight they demand.\n           Sincerely,\n         Eliot Spitzer, New York Attorney General; Lisa Madigan, \n           Illinois Attorney General; Bill Lockyer, California \n           Attorney General; J. Joseph Curran, Jr., Maryland \n           Attorney General; Tom Reilly, Massachusetts Attorney \n           General; Peggy Lautenschlager, Wisconsin Attorney \n           General; Patricia Madrid, New Mexico Attorney General; \n           Mike Beebe, Arkansas Attorney General; Richard \n           Blumenthal, Connecticut Attorney General.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I am also submitting this letter for the Record because \nI think the attorneys general who are chief law enforcement officers \nacross the country for their individual States said it well. If there \nis no market manipulation going on, then no harm, no foul. It does not \nmean this is an automatic incrimination; it simply means we have a good \nFederal statute in place. I certainly appreciate the support of those \nattorneys general who have signed this letter in support of this \nlegislation.\n  What we found in our hearings--and the attorney general of Arizona \nbrought this up--is over the last several years the oil industry has \nmoved to a new inventory prop called ``just-in-time inventory.'' Just-\nin-time inventory is a great idea for the oil industry because it \nactually saves them dollars because they don't have the same amount of \ninventory they used to. It used to be that oil companies had a 20 to \n30-day supply inventory. Now they only have about 3 to 5 days of \nsupply. You can imagine if you only have 3 to 5 days of supply versus \n30 days of supply, the price is going to be different.\n  Here is what Attorney General Terry Goddard said:\n\n       Just in time delivery almost leaves no cushion when \n     supplies are delayed.\n\n  He testified that:\n\n       The entire oil industry has moved to this just in time \n     delivery system vastly reducing the number of refineries \n     available on a nationwide basis and minimizing inventories at \n     stage site. The effect is a constant and precarious supply-\n     demand balance which is exceedingly beneficial to the \n     industry in lowering operating costs but harmful to consumers \n     so that supply is set at a fragile stage where price spikes \n     can occur.\n\n  I applaud the attorney general from Arizona for pointing out how \nimportant this inventory issue is and how it ought to be investigated. \nThe Energy Department itself had a similar analysis. It found in a 2003 \nstudy:\n\n       The reduction of spare capacity has helped drive up the \n     price at the pump and leaves the market vulnerable to \n     shortages caused by plant breakdown or other unpredictable \n     events.\n\n  So even the Department of Energy knows the supply issue is what can \ndrive price spikes. But what we want to know is whether oil companies \nare purposely exporting product. I asked a question at the hearing I \nthought was very important; that is, have oil companies ever exported \noil products to foreign countries for a cheaper profit than they would \nhave gotten if they would have kept the supply in the United States?\n  The reason I asked this question is because I wanted to know if they \nwere artificially trying to limit supply in the United States just to \ndrive up the price. One would think that is not something they would \ndo. They, obviously, want to sell in the United States. There is one \ncase in the West that we have been very sensitive to, according to the \nOregonian newspaper that has reviewed what had been secret reports and \ndocuments basically found that BP/Amoco systematically jacked up west \ncoast oil prices by exporting Alaskan crude oil to Asia for less than \nit could have sold it to U.S. refineries. So there is a specific \nexample where an oil company exported product for cheaper profits just \nto have less supply in the United States to drive up the overall \nmarket. That, I think, is exactly what my amendment is trying to get \nat.\n  According to the Department of Energy, between January and August of \nthis year, over 48 million barrels of refined product was exported out \nof the United States. As my friend, the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. \nKohl, points out, that is 24 times the amount that is stored in the \nNortheast heating oil reserve, a critical safety net in times of \nshortage.\n  One can imagine that my colleagues want answers to why they would \nexport\n\n[[Page S13089]]\n\n48 million barrels of refined product at a time when, if you would have \nkept it in a heating oil reserve for the Midwest, it might actually \nkeep prices down in the Midwest this winter.\n  As I said, I have already had enough of this as it relates to Enron. \nIn 2001 I sat in a lot of hearings in the Energy Committee and heard \nfrom a lot of different people testifying that the electricity market \nhad nothing to do with manipulation. It was all about the fact that \nsome environmental laws prevented us from building enough supply.\n  After 3\\1/2\\ years of investigation, we found out there was a lot of \nmanipulation going on that terms such as Fat Boy, Get Shorty, and \nRicochet were schemes perpetrated on the consumers of the western \nenergy market just to manipulate supply. So you can bet we want to know \nwhether supply is being manipulated in a similar fashion in oil markets \ntoday, and we want answers.\n  The only way to get answers is to put a new Federal statute on the \nbooks that says price gouging is a Federal crime and to give the \nFederal agencies the tools to prosecute that crime.\n  I feel very strongly that this body needs to act on this legislation \nbefore we adjourn. We need to get this to the President's desk and get \nit signed.\n  I know my colleagues are going to offer amendments about various tax \nproposals and tax incentives, whether the oil industry wants those or \ndoesn't. But I care about what is happening to the consumer, to the \nAmerican farmer who is really getting squeezed out of his family farm, \nto those flight attendants and pilots who are losing their pensions \nbecause we have seen a 293-percent increase in jet fuel costs over 5 \nyears, and to the small businesses in my State that can't exist on low \nprofit margins when they see a 50-percent increase in home heating and \nfuel costs. So I want to protect consumers, not just now, but if this \ncrisis happens again in the future, I want consumers to be protected.\n  I hope we can pass this legislation in a good bipartisan effort, that \nmy colleagues will support every effort right now to protect consumers \nas we head toward the winter months, and we act responsibly in giving \nFederal regulators the statutes they need to prosecute these crimes.\n  Mr. President, I also would like to add Senators Clinton and Salazar \nas cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume. This is for the purpose of addressing two amendments before \nthe Senate. I wish to make a short comment on the amendment that was \njust proposed by Senator Cantwell.\n  In regard to this amendment, what she terms the anti-gouging \namendment, obviously I can't help but say the intent of the amendment \nmight be good, but this is a tax relief bill that is before us. It is \nnot a crime bill before the Senate right now.\n  We just received a copy of the amendment. There are all kinds of \npolicy questions that need to be considered. So because of this and the \nfact that it is not germane to the bill, I will be raising a point of \norder at the appropriate time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2610\n\n  I also wish to make a comment on the amendment proposed about a half \nhour ago by Senator Feinstein. Before I go into the problems behind the \nFeinstein amendment, let me say that it is unfortunate that our Nation \nhas had to respond to so many unexpected crises over the past 4 years. \nMost recently, we have had to provide an enormous amount of hurricane \nrelief to families in many of our Southern States. Despite this fact, \nour economy is growing and continues to grow and, even considering the \nhurricanes, growing at a rate that nobody would have anticipated \nconsidering a possible ripple effect that presumably is not rippling as \nmuch as we thought through the economy because of that natural \ndisaster.\n  As far as Federal receipts are concerned, these are up $275 billion \nover the prior year, and Federal revenues are returning to their \naverage level of GDP. That average level, if you want a little leeway, \nis somewhere between 17 percent of GDP and 19 percent of GDP, and that \nis not just recently, that would be a 50-year average where all Federal \ntaxes coming into the Federal Treasury have fallen within that band. \nAlso, it has been our policy, at least in this administration, to do \ntax policy that falls within that band of 17 to 19 percent of gross \ndomestic product.\n  I would like to take a look at the tax increase that Senator \nFeinstein put on the table. It would increase the top rate by almost 5 \npercent for ordinary income.\n  The premise of Senator Feinstein's position seems to be that \ntaxpayers in the top brackets are solely Park Avenue millionaires, that \nsomehow these people are sitting around clipping coupons and drawing \nall the income from them. The facts show differently, so I would like \nto go to the facts that are put out by the nonpartisan people in the \nTreasury Department.\n  About 80 percent of the benefits of the top ordinary income tax rate \ngo to taxpayers with small business ownership. Those of us from the \nheartland know that the definition of small business is not determined \nby some gross revenue taxable income that is used as a basis and the \narguments for this amendment. It depends upon whether the business is \nlocally based. It depends on where the business finances its growth \nfrom its earnings.\n  The people who own these businesses are drawn from the community. \nThey go to the local church. They support the local little leagues. \nSmall business, as I see it, and as I know it coming from a Midwestern \nState, is a very stabilizing yet very dynamic social and economic force \nin their respective communities and tends to be the bulwark of the \nstrength of the American middle class.\n  Small business income is generally taxed at an individual rate. In \nmost cases, owners of small businesses put the income of the small \nbusiness on his or her tax return. As a practical matter, then, the \nindividual tax rate is the rate that is paid by these small businesses \nas opposed to the corporate rate.\n  The corporate tax rate, with some exceptions, in the case of some \nolder, smaller corporations, generally applies to big business. The \nrelationship between the top individual rate and the top corporate rate \nthen has a bearing on our policy toward small business and whether or \nnot we are going to give small business the incentives to grow and \ncreate jobs because these people create 70 percent of the new jobs in \nAmerica.\n  If the top individual marginal tax rate is higher than the top \ncorporate marginal rate tends to be--it is very obvious that you can \nquantify it--then we are sending a bad signal to small business.\n  Before 2001, the top marginal rate for small business was 39.6 \npercent, the rate that Senator Feinstein's amendment would return us \nto. The top corporate rate is 35 percent. When you look at the \ndifference, that is about a 15-percent difference between the top rate \nfor big corporations and the rate that is used for a small business \nthat is not incorporated.\n  So small business was paying then, before we made these changes in \n2001, about 15 percent more. It is what I call a 15-percent small \nbusiness tax penalty. When you tax labor, when you tax business--the \nold principle, you tax more and you get less of it, that was the law at \nthat time.\n  We recognized the detrimental impact that was having on the economy. \nSo we looked at the Federal tax policy bias against small business, and \nthen we had a bipartisan majority in this Senate, including Senator \nBaucus, the ranking Democrat, and one-fourth of the Democratic caucus \nat that particular time voted to gradually--because we couldn't do it \nall at once--gradually equalize the top marginal rate between big \ncorporate business and small unincorporated business, small \nunincorporated business paying the individual rate that was 15 percent \nhigher, a 15-percent small business tax penalty, something that common \nsense ought to dictate is totally unfair.\n  Since 2003, for the first time in many years, the top rate, 35 \npercent, has been the same for Fortune 500 companies incorporated, \nobviously, as for successful small businesses that file the individual \nreturn.\n  Senator Feinstein's amendment would take the first step to restore \nand perhaps even enhance the 15-percent penalty on small business.\n\n[[Page S13090]]\n\n  With all the appetite for taxing and spending around here, rest \nassured, small business will be facing even higher taxes.\n  Small business creates 70 to 80 percent of the jobs in this country. \nWhy, then, at this time would any Member of this body want to raise \ntaxes on people for their ingenuity and their willingness to take a \ngamble in creating a small business? Why would they want to do that to \npeople who create 80 percent of the new jobs in America?\n  So, without a doubt, anyone voting for Senator Feinstein's amendment \nis, in effect, saying they support raising taxes on these small \nbusiness people who create 70 to 80 percent of the new jobs in America.\n  That does not pass the commonsense test. In 2003, it is worth noting \nthat the business community told us reducing the top rate of taxation \nwas their tax policy priority. The small business community told us, \nwhen we were writing this legislation, that doing away with this 15-\npercent penalty, the small business tax penalty, was their top \npriority.\n  Now let's think about this. There seems to be a link between tax \nrelief, economic growth, and jobs. Taxes make a difference. They make a \ndifference whether we are going to have economic growth. Without \neconomic growth, there is no increase in jobs. We have seen evidence of \nthat linkage since 2003. Economic statistics prove that when tax relief \nkicked in, the economy has grown and more jobs have been created. That \nis the dynamic of the American free market economic system.\n  Public policy made by Congress makes a difference, and reducing taxes \non small business, or at least making sure there is not a penalty \nagainst small business vis-a-vis major corporations, have a great deal \nto do with whether the free market system works. So that tax policy has \nhelped the enhancement of our economy.\n  We are in the process of thinking about reversing that course. \nWhether it is intended or not, that is the impact of Senator \nFeinstein's amendment. Some would speculate that for the minority \nparty--and that is the Democratic Party--it is good politics for the \neconomy to go into the tank; raise taxes as the economy is coming back \nand economic growth will be stifled. If economic growth is stifled, \nthen jobs will disappear. If jobs disappear, then voters are more apt \nto throw out members of the President's party, members of the \nRepublican Party.\n  I am not that cynical. I do not believe some of the opposition would \nwant to put short-term political advantages over the economic well-\nbeing of their constituents, but obviously that is the impact of this \namendment. So it does make one wonder what everything is about as we \ndeal with these issues.\n  To sum up, a vote for the amendment by the Senator from California is \na vote that will increase taxes. It is a tax increase that comes during \neconomic recovery. I remind people of a quote from somebody who people \nlisten to more than anybody else on how the economy is going and they \nrespect what he says, Chairman Greenspan. He says that the reason we \nhave had these 2\\1/2\\ to 3 years of economic recovery is because of the \ntax policies that have been put in place in the recent couple of tax \nbills.\n  So we do not want a tax increase when we have a recovery. It is a tax \nincrease on the folks that create jobs in America, and that is our \nhard-working small business owners. For those reasons, I ask that we \nreject the Feinstein amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I believe that there is still time \nremaining so that Senator Cantwell has an opportunity to speak on her \namendment. In the meantime, I ask unanimous consent that the next \namendments in order following the Cantwell amendment be the following: \nan amendment by the Senator from Illinois on FEMA, 30 minutes equally \ndivided; the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, on poverty, 30 \nminutes equally divided; an amendment from the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, Mr. Reed, 20 minutes equally divided; and an amendment by the \nSenator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, on the practice of medicine--there \nis no time limit at the moment on that one--and that thereafter there \nbe 30 minutes equally divided on the Dorgan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I do not see the Senator from Washington on the floor to \nfinish with her amendment. I ask that her time be reserved so she can \noffer it at an appropriate time, and the same for the time in \nopposition. So we can now proceed with the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2605\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. I call up amendment No. 2605 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Obama], for himself and Mr. \n     Coburn, and Mr. Lautenberg proposes an amendment numbered \n     2605.\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: Expressing the sense of the Senate that the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency should immediately address issues relating to no-bid \n                              contracting)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON USE OF NO-BID CONTRACTING BY \n                   FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) on September 8, 2005, the Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency announced that it had awarded 4 contracts for \n     emergency housing relief following Hurricane Katrina to The \n     Shaw Group of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Fluor Corporation of \n     Aliso Viejo, California, Bechtel National of San Francisco, \n     California, and CH2M Hill of Denver, Colorado;\n       (2) these contracts were awarded with no competition from \n     other capable firms, and up to $100,000,000 in taxpayer funds \n     were authorized for each of these contracts;\n       (3) in the midst of concerns about abusive and \n     irresponsible spending of taxpayer funds, the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency pledged to re-bid these \n     noncompetitive contracts, with Acting Under Secretary of \n     Emergency Preparedness and Response, R. David Paulison, \n     stating before the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Government Affairs of the Senate that ``[a]ll of these no-bid \n     contracts, we are going to go back and re-bid'';\n       (4) the Federal Emergency Management Agency has yet to \n     reopen these 4 contracts to competitive bidding, and declared \n     on November 11, 2005, that these contracts would not be \n     reopened for bidding until February 2006;\n       (5) by February 2006, the majority of the contracts will \n     have been completed and the majority of taxpayer funds will \n     have been spent;\n       (6) large and politically-connected firms continue to \n     benefit from no-bid and limited-competition contracts, and \n     contracts are not being awarded to capable, local companies;\n       (7) according to an analysis in the Washington Post, \n     companies outside the States most affected by Hurricane \n     Katrina have received more than 90 percent of the Federal \n     contracts for recovery and reconstruction;\n       (8) the monitoring of Federal contracting practices remains \n     difficult, with a report by the San Jose Mercury News stating \n     ``The database of contracts is incomplete. Information \n     released by Federal agencies is spotty and sporadic. And \n     disclosure of many no-bid contracts isn't required by law''; \n     and\n       (9)(A) there is currently no Chief Financial Officer \n     charged with monitoring the flow of all funds to the affected \n     areas; and\n       (B) the task of financial management is spread across \n     disparate Federal departments and agencies with inadequate \n     oversight of taxpayer funds.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Federal Emergency Management Agency should--\n       (1) immediately rebid noncompetitive contracts entered into \n     following Hurricane Katrina, consistent with the commitment \n     of the Agency made on October 6, 2005, before millions of \n     taxpayer dollars are wasted on irresponsible and inefficient \n     spending;\n       (2)(A) immediately implement the planned competitive \n     contracting strategy of the Agency for recovery work in all \n     current and future reconstruction efforts; and\n       (B) in carrying out that strategy, should prioritize local \n     and small disadvantaged businesses in the contracting and \n     subcontracting process; and\n       (3) immediately after the awarding of a contract, publicly \n     disclose the amount and competitive or noncompetitive nature \n     of the contract.\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane \nKatrina, there was an enormous urgency, not only in Congress but all\n\n[[Page S13091]]\n\nacross the Nation, to respond to the needs of the people of the gulf \ncoast region. Although the sense of urgency appears to have subsided, \nunfortunately, somewhat in Congress, that sense of urgency remains all \ntoo real for the hundreds of thousands of Americans who are still \ndealing with the loss of jobs, the loss of family, and the loss of \nhomes that too many Hurricane Katrina survivors have suffered.\n  I am pleased the bill we are debating today includes tax relief for \nthose affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. I am fully \nsupportive of those provisions. I also believe that before we go home \nfor Thanksgiving to enjoy our homes and our families, we need to take \nsome meaningful action to help those who might not have as much to be \nthankful for.\n  Nearly 2 months after Hurricane Katrina devastated the people of the \ngulf coast, we are seeing that our Government is still leaving too many \nAmericans behind. Let me give some examples. This week, FEMA is telling \n150,000 evacuees who are currently in hotels that they have to be out \nof their hotels in 15 days. Imagine, someone has lost their home, and \nthey have 15 days to get out of the shelter they are currently in.\n  Yesterday, we heard a story on NPR that shelter residents in \nIberville, LA, will soon be transitioned to a tent city when the \nshelter closes. That's right--a tent city.\n  Thousands in Mississippi are currently living in two-person tents, \nwithout running water or adequate heat, because FEMA has not provided \nthe mobile homes they promised.\n  There are concerns that contractors participating in the gulf coast \nreconstruction are exploiting immigrant labor. There are stories from \nMississippi and Louisiana of immigrant laborers being lured to the gulf \nby promises of good pay, only to be stiffed their salaries and charged \nfor their temporary housing.\n  In addition to these stories--we are hearing enormous complaints--and \nI am getting them in Illinois, despite the fact that I do not represent \nthe region--that local companies are being shut out of the \nreconstruction bidding process.\n  According to the Washington Post, companies outside the States most \naffected by Katrina have received more than 90 percent of the Federal \ncontracts for recovery and reconstruction. Ninety percent of the \ncontracts have gone to companies that do not maintain a place of \nbusiness in the affected States. This is unacceptable.\n  The American taxpayers and this Congress provided $62 billion for the \nreconstruction effort precisely so that the people of the gulf coast \nregion, including some of the most vulnerable citizens of our society, \nwould be left behind no more. Yet right now we have no idea where that \nmoney is being spent, how that money is being spent, why it is not \nbeing spent on fixing the problems I mentioned and why FEMA is still \nsitting on nearly $40 billion that has not been spent at all.\n  Now think about that. The managers of this bill have been struggling \nwith the fiscal constraints we are trying to deal with and we have $40 \nbillion that is not spent and we do not know where the other $20 \nbillion has gone. There is absolutely no accountability to this process \nat all, no accountability to the taxpayers and no accountability to the \npeople who need this help the most.\n  I am a freshman in the minority party. I am accustomed sometimes to \nnot knowing what is going on around here, but this is, unfortunately, \none of those situations in which I do not get a sense that neither the \nmajority party nor the administration has a clear idea of how our money \nis being spent.\n  The Hurricane Katrina contracting process has been rife with problems \nfrom the very beginning. Rather than use the reconstruction process to \nhelp companies and workers in the regions most affected, we are seeing \nmany of the prime contracts going to the largest contractors in the \ncountry. These are the same contractors that received reconstruction \ncontracts in Iraq and with only a few exceptions they are not the folks \nwhose businesses were harmed by the ravages of the storm.\n  Small businesses are not being given a fair shake to bid on these \nprojects, and it is unclear how many contracts have been provided to \nsmall businesses. Meanwhile, minority contractors have been left almost \nentirely out of the contracting process. The Congressional Black Caucus \nhas proposed good legislation to address some of these problems and I \nhope the Senate will consider it, if it passes the House.\n  But let me be clear--this is not simply partisan complaining or \npolitical point scoring. At a hearing held on November 3, 2005, the \ninspector general of the Homeland Security Department, a Bush \nappointee, said about the reconstruction process: Obligations are being \nmade at a rate of $275 million a day in an unstable environment and in \nan expedited manner. When you mix it all together, it is a potentially \nperfect recipe for fraud, waste, and abuse.\n  The GAO's preliminary observations indicate that the Army Corps of \nEngineers' $39 million purchase of portable classrooms may have \nresulted in the Army Corps paying more than necessary. The GAO will \ncontinue to monitor the reconstruction contracts.\n  I am certain that we are going to keep on seeing these stories \nsurfacing almost daily about how taxpayer money is being wasted, while \nthe people who are supposed to be helped are not getting what they \nneed.\n  One of the most egregious examples of this potential waste, fraud, \nand abuse is in the Government's refusal to rebid $400 million worth of \nno-bid contracts that they already promised they would rebid. \nImmediately following Hurricane Katrina, FEMA awarded four $100 million \nno-bid contracts for reconstruction efforts. Acting FEMA Under \nSecretary Paulison made the following statement to the Senate Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee on October 6, 2005: I have \nbeen a public servant for a long time, and I have never been a fan of \nno-bid contracts. Sometimes you have to do them because of the \nexpediency of getting things done. I can assure you, we are going to \nlook at all of these contracts very carefully. All of those no-bid \ncontracts, we are going to go back and rebid.\n  That is what Under Secretary Paulison said before the Senate Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee a month ago.\n  These contracts have not been rebid. In fact, FEMA officials \ntestified on November 11, just a month after the statement by Under \nSecretary Paulison, that they would not rebid the contracts until \nFebruary. Here is the only problem: By February, the contracts will \nhave been completed.\n  Today, I am offering a sense-of-the-Senate amendment calling on FEMA \nto immediately rebid these contracts in a competitive fashion before \nnearly $400 million of taxpayer dollars are spent in an inefficient and \npotentially abusive manner.\n  I know this amendment only gets at one element of a multilayer \nproblem, but I firmly believe this body must take a stand to ensure \nthat these Federal agencies that have been entrusted with such a \nmonumental job and so many taxpayer dollars stick to their promises.\n  I am pleased my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Coburn, has joined \nme in offering this amendment.\n  Senator Coburn and I have also offered a bill that establishes a \nchief financial officer to oversee the use of Hurricane Katrina \nrecovery funds so that we do not have further problems of this sort. \nThat bill was voted out of the Senate Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee and is awaiting a vote. Unfortunately, \nthat bill so far has not seen the light of this floor, so I am forced \nto offer this amendment today to provide some accountability and \ntransparency into this contracting process.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. I appreciate the \ntime and the attention of Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus.\n  Before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent to call up a \npending amendment that has no number yet, submitted by myself and \nSenator Kerry, filed earlier today by Senator Kerry, which provides \nrelief from the marriage penalty and from the military service penalty \nfaced by many low-income taxpayers who receive the low-income tax \ncredit.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wonder if we can proceed with the second \namendment. It was my understanding the Senator had one amendment and\n\n[[Page S13092]]\n\nhad a time agreement on it. Other Senators have come up, asking for \nconsideration of their amendments. I do not want to inconvenience other \nSenators.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I was asked by the Senator from Massachusetts to read \nthat, just to get it into the queue.\n  At this stage I am not speaking on it, and I am not asking for any \nadditional action on it. I just wanted to get it in. If it is a \nproblem, I am willing to defer.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. All things considered, Mr. President, I think it proper \nnot to agree to the request at this point because the Senator from \nMassachusetts already spoke to us about an amendment of his, and that \nis in the queue.\n  In fairness to other Senators, I don't want to inconvenience other \nSenators.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Fair enough.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield such time as he might consume to \nthe Senator from South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator yielding time on the bill or on \nthe amendment?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. On the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield off the bill such time as the Senator from \nSouth Dakota might consume.\n\n\n                      Iraq And Prewar Intelligence\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman, the \nSenator from Iowa, for yielding time off the bill. The issue we are \ndebating obviously is one of great consequence, dealing with our budget \nand how we deal with the issue of the deficit and what we do to \ncontinue to keep the economy growing and creating jobs. That is what \nthis debate is about.\n  I do, however, want to speak in response to something that was said \nearlier on the floor, also off the bill at hand that we are discussing \ntoday, and that has to do with the whole situation in Iraq.\n  The Democrat leader was on the floor earlier, once again attacking \nthe President and the Vice President with respect to the issue of \nprewar intelligence. I think the American people deserve to know the \nfacts in this debate. They deserve to know the truth. More important, \nour troops need to know we stand with them, we support them in \ncompleting their mission in achieving victory in the war on terror.\n  What we have seen instead is the Democrat leader come down here and \naccuse the President, because he is standing up and telling the truth \nto the American people, accusing him of deceiving and misleading on \nprewar intelligence.\n  Where is the evidence? Where are the facts to support those \nstatements? The distinguished Democrat leader, as well as many \nDemocrats who are still serving in this Chamber, back in 2002 had the \nsame information, the same intelligence that the President of the \nUnited States had, the Vice President of the United States had, all our \nallies had, the United Nations had. Everybody came to the same \nessential conclusion, and that was that Iraq posed an imminent threat \nto the security of that region and the security of the United States, \nand we acted accordingly.\n  In this Chamber right here, 29 of the 50 Democrats at that time stood \nup and voted for a resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq. In \nthe House of Representatives, over 80 Democrats joined the Republican \nmajority in the House of Representatives in support of the resolution \nfor the use of force in Iraq.\n\n  What we are seeing now is an attempt to revise that history. You can \ntry. You can disagree with the policy. You can disagree with the \ndecisions that are being made by our commanders. But don't come to the \nfloor of the Senate and don't go out to the public and attack this \nadministration and this President for lying unless you have some \nevidence to demonstrate that.\n  There is no proof.\n  I believe the troops of this country, and our commanders who are \nvaliantly and bravely and courageously leading the effort in Iraq and \nin Afghanistan to win the war on terror, are fighting to make this \ncountry more safe and secure and to make sure that country has a \ndemocracy. And all we focus on is the negative.\n  What about the positive things that are happening in Iraq? The fact \nis, today Iraq's GDP has more than quadrupled from 2003, Iraq's debt \nhas been cut by more than a third from 2003, inflation and unemployment \nrates are down from last year while incomes have risen, Iraq's security \npersonnel have doubled since last year, over 1,800 reconstruction \nprojects have been finished, including schools and health facilities, \nthe number of telephone subscribers has more than doubled since last \nyear, and the number of independent television stations has doubled \nsince last year.\n  We are making progress. It is hard work. The people who know that the \nbest are the people on the ground in Iraq, the young men and women in \nuniform who are doing freedom's work.\n  I had the opportunity last week to go up to Walter Reed Army Hospital \nto visit with some of the casualties of that war, people who have lost \nlimbs, amputees. I have to tell you it is inspiring, absolutely \ninspirational to see the courage and the determination and the spirit \nof these young people who have worn the uniform of the United States \nand have fought for something they believe in. They deserve to have \nelected leaders in this country, people in this Chamber, the Senate, \nand the House who are willing to at least acknowledge the good work \nthey are doing and the progress we are making toward winning the war on \nterror, toward creating a democracy and standing up a government in \nIraq, toward raising an army, a security force that can defend the \nIraqi people.\n  What we do not need is demagoguery and people coming on the floor of \nthe Senate and elected leaders getting up and making statements \nattacking the integrity and the credibility and the truthfulness of the \nPresident of the United States, our Commander in Chief, absent any \nevidence to support their claims. Furthermore, those are the ones who \non this very floor have made statements in the past supporting our \neffort and concluding, based upon the intelligence that they received--\njust like the intelligence the President and the Vice President and all \nour allies and the United Nations received--that Iraq posed an imminent \nthreat to the United States and to that region of the world. What we \nare seeing here is the worst of politics, and that is not the conduct \nwe ought to have in the Senate or the discourse that we ought to be \nputting before the American people. The American people deserve the \ntruth, and the American troops deserve our support.\n  I yield.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent agreement \nthat I think has been accepted. I ask unanimous consent that at 3:30 \ntoday the Senate proceed to votes in relation to the following \namendments in the order sequenced below; further, that they not be \nsubject to second-degree amendments prior to the votes and that there \nbe 2 minutes equally divided between the votes: Dorgan No. 2587; \nFeinstein No. 2609; Feinstein No. 2610; Cantwell No. 2612; provided \nfurther that at 3 today, there be 30 minutes equally divided for debate \nbetween the chairman and Senator Dorgan; provided further that \nfollowing those votes, Senator Coburn be recognized in order to offer \nhis amendment; further, that all votes after the first be limited to 10 \nminutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2588\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for himself \n     and Ms. Landrieu, proposes an amendment numbered 2588.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S13093]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Wednesday, November 16, \n2005, under ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think we have a time limit of 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty minutes evenly divided.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask the Chair to let me know when there is 2 minutes \nleft.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment is a very simple \namendment. It recognizes that we have had a dramatic increase in child \npoverty in recent years. I think the most dramatic recent exposure to \nthat was Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, when the veil was taken off the \nUnited States of America and we saw so many of those families who were \nunable to leave New Orleans and leave the areas along the gulf because \nthey were too poor and they suffered so many consequences that we are \nreminded about the growth of poverty among children in recent years.\n  This amendment does a very simple thing. It says for every joint tax \nreturn where the income is more than $1 million, there will be a 1-\npercent surcharge on that income. It will go into a dedicated fund. \nThere will be a board appointed by the Members of Congress, and they \nwill make recommendations to the President about how those resources \nwill be expended.\n  The best estimate now is that we could have close to $3 billion to $4 \nbillion raised in the first year. It will rise over the next 5 to 7 \nyears up to $5 billion. This is dedicated to reduce the poverty of \nchildren in this country.\n  This chart shows what happened in the period of 2000 to 2004--13 \nmillion children are living in poverty. There has been a growth of 1.4 \nmillion children since 2000.\n  We know that in the United States at the present time one in six \nchildren lives in poverty. This isn't just general, across the country; \nit is reflected with different groups having a higher percentage. We \nfind, for example, that children are much more likely to live in \npoverty than adults or the elderly.\n  If we look at who is living in poverty in the United States: seniors, \n9.8 percent; adults 18 to 65, 11.3 percent; and for children, it is the \nhighest at 17.8 percent. If you look at who is affected by this to the \ngreatest extent, the national average being 17.8 percent, the highest \nis minority children. The national average is 17.8 percent. If you are \nlooking at Latinos, it is 28 percent. If you are looking at African \nAmericans, it is 33 percent.\n  Let us look at this chart where the United States has one of the \nhighest child poverty rate in the industrialized world. This red line \nis the indicator of where the United States is in relationship to \nItaly, the United Kingdom, Germany, Scandinavia, Japan, Sweden, the \nNetherlands--all the way down the line. This chart is an indication of \nwhere we have the highest poverty rates generally, and the highest \nchild poverty rates.\n  It should not be an enormous surprise that individuals have the \nhighest child poverty rate down in New Orleans and along that gulf \narea. Those are the areas which have the highest percentage rate. They \nwere high before and now breathtakingly high.\n  If we look across the country, this chart shows children living in \npoverty in every State. The States in blue have the highest \nconcentration of poverty.\n  This is a real reflection of our national priorities. Are we as a \ncountry going to be indignant? Are we going to be sufficiently \nconcerned or outraged about this that we are prepared to do something?\n  I must say that in the most recent Appropriations Committee \nconference report, we find that we have basically failed to deal with \nthese issues, both from an educational point of view and a health point \nof view. We see reductions in terms of the Head Start Program, title I \nprograms, and programs that help and assist disabled children. We are \nfinding reductions as well in other health programs.\n\n  This is a way for us to be able to say that in the situation we are \ntalking about, those at the highest end of the economic ladder, those \nindividuals who have more than $1 million are going to pay a tax. Say \nthey are going to pay a tax of $100,000; that is a 1-percent addition. \nThis is just 1 percent. This is $101,000.\n  With that kind of increase on those who are the most privileged \nindividuals in our country, the wealthiest individuals, they ought to \nbe as concerned as all Americans are by this staggering situation of \nchild poverty in this country.\n  We are not going in the right direction, as these charts indicate. We \nare going in the wrong direction. If someone gets up and says, \n``Senator, we are going in the right direction, why do we need this'', \nevery economic indicator shows these facts and these statistics are \ngetting worse and worse every single year. They are not going to be \naltered or changed by what we are doing here in these budget \nconsiderations. Investment in these children in and of itself isn't \ngoing to be the complete answer, but, nonetheless, providing the help \nand assistance in a very targeted way to try to deal with child \npoverty, it seems to me, is an important reflection about what we ought \nto be about here in the Senate.\n  I certainly think it has a higher priority than many of the other \npriorities that are included in this legislation, which is going to \nprovide some very generous tax reduction for some of the most \nprivileged people in our country and in our society. That is basically \nthe issue.\n  Finally, this is a basically moral issue. There is no great nation \nthat can ignore this challenge. It is a defining issue in terms of what \nthis country is about. It is a defining issue about what the values are \nfor us as a people in this Nation.\n  I think so many of the great Judeo-Christian religions and other \nreligions talk about the importance of feeding the hungry and clothing \nthe poor and seeing to the needs of the least of those among us. This \namendment is a targeted amendment and provides just that kind of help \nand assistance which is so important for this country.\n  I hope the Senate will accept what I call the Child Poverty \nElimination Fund--as I mentioned, with a board to oversee the fund and \ndesign the Child Poverty Elimination Plan. It is a downpayment, a \nrealistic first step toward achieving the goal of lifting children out \nof poverty.\n  In the 1960s, President Johnson talked about the ``War on Poverty'' \nthat we are still fighting, but we are fighting and falling further and \nfurther behind. Clearly, we have made progress over the past four \ndecades, through Medicaid, Head Start, food stamps, and other measures \nwe have enacted. The poverty rate for all Americans reached a low of 11 \npercent in 1973, compared to 19 percent in later years.\n  We continued that battle through the Reagan administration with the \nenactment of LIHEAP in 1981 and welfare reform in 1996. But, sadly, in \nthe most recent years, we have been falling farther and farther behind.\n  I am not going to take the time, because I don't have it here, to \ntalk about the growth of hunger in this country in recent years, and \nparticularly the problem of growth of hunger among children.\n  A 5-year-old named Connor from Massachusetts is one example of what \nis happening to the vulnerable people in our society. Some days, Connor \npretends to be a ``Power Ranger'' fighting intergalactic evils, and \nother days he is fighting hunger, pretending to be a superhero, taking \na lot of energy. And sometimes Connor doesn't feel like playing. That \nis when his hunger pangs become his worst enemy.\n  It is shameless that in the richest and most powerful nation on \nEarth, nearly one in five children goes to bed hungry every night.\n  Now because of Hurricane Katrina, the silent slavery of poverty is \nnot so silent anymore. The devastation caused by the storm suddenly \nfocused the Nation's attention on the immense hardships low-income \nAmericans face each day. We saw the desperate plight of innocent \nchildren who were born poor and forced to bear the impossible burden of \npoverty.\n  In fact, the child poverty rate, as I mentioned, in the States hit \nhardest by Hurricane Katrina was all above the national average. In \nLouisiana, 29 percent of children live in poverty, 30 percent of \nchildren in Mississippi live in poverty, and 23 percent in Alabama.\n  Hurricane Katrina highlighted the struggle of the poor, but every \nState in\n\n[[Page S13094]]\n\nthis country is home to children and families who live in poverty. \nChildren in the United States are more likely to live in poverty than \nany other age group. This particular amendment indicates what our \npriorities are.\n\n  Poverty is an education issue because poor children often lack the \nbasic nutrition vital to healthy brain development. They have \ndifficulty focusing their attention and concentrating in school. As a \nresult, they often drop out. Some end up in trouble with the law, even \nin prison.\n  Poverty is a civil rights issue because minorities are \ndisproportionately poor: 33 percent of African-American children, 28 \npercent of Latino children live in poverty, triple the rate of white \nchildren. How can we possibly keep turning our back on these children? \nWe should all feel a greater, not a lesser, responsibility to them. \nWhere is our compassionate conservatism?\n  Do they understand when Jesus said ``suffer the little children to \ncome unto me,'' he didn't mean ``let the little children suffer.'' \nDon't they believe that children are included when he said:\n\n       Inasmuch as you have done it unto the least of these, my \n     brother, you have done it unto me.\n\n  We know how to lift children out of poverty in this wealthy land of \nours. All it requires is the will to do it and the leadership to make \nit happen.\n  The words of Nobel Laureate Gabriela Mistral never rang more true:\n\n       We are guilty of many errors and many faults, but our worse \n     crime is abandoning the children, neglecting the fountain of \n     life. Many of the things we need can wait. The child cannot. \n     Right now is the time his bones are being formed, his blood \n     is being made, and his senses are being developed. To him we \n     cannot answer ``Tomorrow.'' His name is ``Today.''\n\n  It is time for Congress to bring true hope, honest opportunity, \ngenuine fairness to children mired in poverty in communities in all \nparts of our country. This amendment will put us back on the right \ntrack. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent I be yielded 5 minutes off \nthe bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to speak today on an amendment \nthat has been offered on this bill that I very much hope the Senate \nwill not agree to.\n  The Dorgan amendment, which has been offered, would institute a \nwindfall profits tax on the major oil and gas companies. There is the \nbelief among many in this country that oil industry profits are \nexcessive compared to profits of other companies that do business in \nour country. I do not believe that is the case.\n  In the second quarter of 2005, the oil industry earned 7.7 cents for \nevery dollar of sales. The average profit for all U.S. industry in the \nsecond quarter was 7.9 cents for every dollar of sales. Thirteen U.S. \nindustries earned higher profits in the second quarter than the oil and \nnatural gas industry: banking, software and services, consumer \nservices, and real estate.\n  The rate of return on oil sales for the third quarter of 2005 is \nslightly higher, at 8.1 cents for every dollar of sales. However, the \ndamage to the oil industry caused by the hurricanes will eat into the \nbottom line in future quarters. British Petroleum has estimated it will \ntake a $700 million hit to the company's energy production and \ninfrastructure from Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates capital losses from Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita in the energy producing industries will range from $18 \nto $31 billion.\n  Reinvestment in infrastructure, both production and refining, is a \ncritical issue. My good colleague from North Dakota and I would agree \non that point. While I am sure his proposal is well intended, the \nimpact would be contrary to the goals we all seek to achieve. His \nproposal takes a short-term approach to what is a long-term investment \nissue. Investments in infrastructure in the oil industry are over long-\nterm windows.\n  What we must do is encourage the oil companies to take their profits \nand reinvest them back into exploration, production, and refineries. \nThe oil companies seek to invest in refineries, but no one is investing \nin new refineries in America. In fact, there has been no new refinery \nbuilt in America in over 20 years.\n  If we are going to have a bigger supply and bring the price of \ngasoline at the pump down, we must have more oil refineries and more \nproduction. We also need conservation. We also need renewable sources \nof energy. We need new sources of energy. We all agree on that.\n  This amendment seeks to single out oil companies, dub them \n``excessively profitable,'' take their profit and give it to the \nGovernment to spend as it would, rather than letting the oil companies \nkeep it and invest it in the infrastructure, production, and refinery \ncapacity. That is what will get to the issue we are all trying to \naddress; that is, bringing the price of oil down so the price at the \npump will be lower.\n  Senator Schumer has discussed another potential amendment that hits \nat the big oil companies. I realize that is a political thing for him \nto do right now. We are not here to do the political hit and run. We \nare here to do the right thing for our country. We are here to try to \nbuild more reserves, more production capacity, and more refinery \ncapacity to bring the price of gasoline down at the pump and to bring \nthe price of energy down for the farmer who is trying to use natural \ngas. The price is rising such that our small farmers are in a tough \nposition. What Senator Schumer has discussed doing is instituting a \ndouble tax on any income made by a company overseas.\n\n  We are severely restricting the ability for an oil and gas company to \ndrill in America today. You basically cannot drill off the East Coast \nor the West Coast, nor Florida. We can drill in the Gulf of Mexico, but \nit is very expensive and requires deep drilling. We hope we will be \nable to open ANWR--but right now we are very limited. We need to have a \nsupply in our country, with American jobs and more production coming \nback to America. More and more production is going overseas.\n  I end by saying, the double taxation of one industry is unfair. If we \nhave an oil company and a computer chip company doing business in Italy \nand they pay taxes in Italy, the computer chip company would get a \ncredit for that tax paid when it files in America, but the oil company \nwould not, thereby paying tax twice. Is that the way to have more oil \ncoming into our country and to drive the price down at the pump? I \ndon't think so. It is counterproductive.\n  I hope the Senate will do the right thing. It may not be the \npolitical thing, but it is the right thing if we are going to reach our \ngoal, which is to bring down the cost of natural gas and gasoline at \nthe pump for the consumers and the small business people of our \ncountry, keeping our economy strong and keeping jobs in America. The \nway to do this is not to single out the oil companies. We must invest \nin infrastructure, more production, and additional refineries. If we \nwill help them with a regulatory system that does not penalize them and \ndelay construction for 10 or 15 years, we can bring the price of oil \ndown. It will be to the benefit of everyone in our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Dorgan amendment and any \npotential Schumer amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. So as not to interrupt the flow, the chairman would like \nto speak on the Senator's amendment first, if that is all right.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. All right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself such time as I might consume off of our \nside of the Kennedy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am pleased to be able to report to Senator Kennedy \nthat we do not need a board to tell us how to end poverty.\n  I quote Washington Post columnist William Raspberry, writing in a \nrecent op-ed piece:\n\n       Fatherless families are America's single largest source of \n     poverty. The Annie E. Casey Foundation, ``Kids Count,'' once \n     reported that Americans who failed to complete high school, \n     to get married and to reach age 20 before having their first \n     child were nearly 10 times as likely to live in poverty as \n     those who did these three things.\n\n  The Brookings Institution, obviously a liberal think tank, published \nan analysis of a variety of factors that could\n\n[[Page S13095]]\n\nreduce poverty. The authors from Brookings concluded that the \ncombination of education, full-time work, and marriage could reduce \npoverty rates from 13 percent to 17 percent.\n  The bipartisan welfare reform bill reported out of the Senate \nCommittee on Finance would make substantial progress in helping \nfamilies make progress in areas that we know would reduce poverty. We \ncould not get an agreement with the other side to get this legislation \ndiscussed on the floor. We got it out of the committee in a bipartisan \nway. It deals with the issues of education, work, and marriage.\n  Following upon the views of the Brookings Institute and the views of \nthe Annie E. Casey Foundation, rather than engage in politically \nmotivated efforts, we should work together to implement these serious \npolicies of education, of work, and of marriage. Together, by \nimplementing these policies, and we know these policies work, we will \ntake one giant step toward reducing poverty.\n  I don't think Senator Kennedy's amendment is necessary. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask if the minority would yield 5 minutes?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I listened to my friend from Iowa. This \nis the fact: We have one of the highest child poverty rates in the \nindustrial world. I am not saying this afternoon how to do it. The \nSenator from Iowa can have good ideas. The Senator from Tennessee can \nhave good ideas. The fact of the matter is, we are not doing it now.\n  There is significant and dramatic growth of child poverty in the \nUnited States. I am saying let's do something about it. Give us the \nopportunity to do it this afternoon. That is the point I make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, under a unanimous consent agreement we \nentered into earlier, we are now waiting for Senator Reed of Rhode \nIsland to offer his amendment, and also Senator Coburn to offer his \namendment. And under the agreement, thereafter, there is time remaining \non the Dorgan amendment. But while we are waiting for Senator Reed and/\nor Senator Coburn, or anyone else, to come to the floor, I will say a \nfew words about the alternative minimum tax.\n  The bill before us today does extend the alternative minimum tax \nexemption level and provides for an increase in inflation. That is the \ngood news. But it is not all good news because there will still be \nabout 600,000 additional Americans paying higher taxes next year under \nthe alternative minimum tax, sometimes called the stealth tax.\n  Why is that? That is because the so-called hold-harmless provision in \nthe legislation before us today, or the patch, as some have called it, \ndoes not hold everyone harmless. For example, for the year 2005, there \nare 3.6 million American taxpayers paying the alternative minimum tax. \nUnder the bill before us today, there will be 4.2 million taxpayers \npaying that tax in 2006. That is an increase of 600,000 taxpayers, and \nit is an increase I hope we can avoid.\n  The alternative minimum tax, to refresh recollections, was originally \nenacted in 1969. Why did Congress do that? Congress discovered in that \nyear there were about 155 very wealthy taxpayers making over $200,000 a \nyear but who paid no taxes. Congress felt: Well, gee, that is not \nright; people earning over $200,000 a year at least should pay some \ntaxes. So Congress passed the alternative minimum tax. What was once a \nclass tax, unfortunately, has now been morphed into a mass tax.\n  To refresh your recollection, whenever individuals calculate their \nincome taxes, they calculate their income taxes and then they have to \ngo through a separate, parallel calculation under what is called the \nalternative minimum tax. Under that separate, parallel calculation, \nthere are certain provisions that cannot be deducted, and that includes \nthe standard deduction or the personal exemptions, and some others. \nThen you look at the bottom line of the two calculations, and if one is \nhigher than the other--it does not make any difference which one it \nis--you pay that higher tax.\n  Because these provisions were not indexed to inflation, over time \nmore and more people are finding they have to pay this stealth tax, \nthis alternative minimum tax. Frankly, if it is not changed by the end \nof this decade, that tax will ensnare about 30 million Americans, a \nmajority of who will have adjusted gross incomes below $100,000.\n  The Internal Revenue Service National Taxpayer Advocate has \nidentified this alternative minimum tax as the most serious problem \nfacing individual taxpayers. By the end of the decade, the majority of \nfilers with incomes between $75,000 and $100,000 will be paying this \nadditional tax; that is, the majority of Americans with incomes between \n$75,000 and $100,000 will be paying this, unless it is fixed.\n  In addition, virtually all married couples in that income group--\n$75,000 to $100,000--with two children will be paying the AMT by the \nend of the decade.\n  Now, I have filed legislation to repeal the AMT altogether. I am \njoined in that effort by the chairman, Senator Grassley, and 20 other \nSenators who have the same view as me. I think we should do it. It is \nclear, though, that repeal is very expensive. But it is the right thing \nto do, and we should do our level best to try to find a way to work \ntoward total repeal, and try to find the revenue to pay for it.\n  In the meantime, though, we should do all we can to make sure this \nstealth tax does not hit one more family next year.\n  As you may know, Mr. President, the House companion bill on this same \nsubject, tax reconciliation, which is working its way over here, does \nnot in any way address this AMT issue. But it does contain provisions \nto extend the capital gains and dividends cuts for 2 more years. Under \ncurrent law, which we enacted in 2003, deductions will stay in effect \nat least until the end of 2008. Nevertheless, the House in their bill \nmade the decision to extend that capital gains and dividends cut for 2 \nmore years past 2008. But they did not include the alternative minimum \ntax. That is wrong.\n  Senator Grassley and I have discussed this. We want to make a change. \nAt the appropriate time I think we will make a change to the underlying \nbill so not one more American pays this stealth tax compared to current \nlaw. As I mentioned, under the bill currently before us, about 600,000 \nmore Americans will pay it. We feel that is wrong. It is a mistake. We \nshouldn't do that. We will find a way, as the chairman and I have \nfound, to make sure not one more American has to pay this additional \ntax.\n  Otherwise, I might say that under the House-passed version of tax \nreconciliation, 17 million families will see a tax increase next year. \nUnder the House bill, working its way over here to conference, 17 \nmillion families will see a tax increase next year thanks to the \nalternative minimum tax.\n  In fact, CRS has found that if the House proposal prevails, next year \na family with three children, making $63,000 a year, will also be hit \nby this additional stealth tax, the AMT. I believe, and I know the \nchairman believes, and many of us in the Senate believe, this family-\nunfriendly AMT should not be allowed to creep deeper and deeper into \nthe middle class each year. At the appropriate time, we are going to \nmake that change, that adjustment, because it is the right thing to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume off the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation I have had \nwith Senator Baucus in working out some differences on this bill, which \nhe has enunciated very well. I look forward to, hopefully, getting done \nwhat he said before we get this bill through the Senate tomorrow.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business, and the time will be off of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                The FDA\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today is the anniversary of the hearing \non the worldwide withdrawal of Vioxx, the blockbuster drug that became \na\n\n[[Page S13096]]\n\nblockbuster disaster. As chairman of the Committee on Finance, I called \nfor this hearing a year ago. The Vioxx hearing turned the spotlight on \na troubled agency in denial. The type of problems exposed during the \nhearings have proven to be not isolated but systemic.\n  Over the past year, my committee staff has investigated allegations \ncoming from within and outside the Food and Drug Administration. Brave \nwhistleblowers, such as Drs. Andrew Mosholder, David Graham, and \nothers, have come forward to expose the too cozy relationship between \nthe agency and the drug industry. I can tell you today that problems \nexist not only within the Center for Drugs but extend to the centers \nfor devices, biologics, and even into veterinary medicine.\n  I am concerned--and every other Member of this Senate should also be \nconcerned--about this agency's cozy relationship with industry. To \nfurther illustrate this problem, I am sending today a letter to another \ndrug company that appears too cozy with the Food and Drug \nAdministration. Last year, 2 days after the Vioxx hearing, the drug \ncompany Wyeth met with former Commissioner Crawford. Why did Wyeth's \nCEO want to talk with the commissioner? Because Wyeth recently had to \nremove one of its most profitable veterinary drugs from the market.\n  So what did Wyeth do? They launched an investigation of a Food and \nDrug Administration employee, Dr. Victoria Hampshire. It was Dr. \nHampshire who concluded that Wyeth's drug was killing hundreds of dogs. \nI have in my hand what Wyeth presented to former Commissioner Crawford. \nEvery page of this document has on it things that are referred to as \nconfidential. It is a 29-page PowerPoint with 10 pages of backup \nmaterial. It is dated November 19, 2004. Besides being marked \nconfidential, it says:\n\n       ProHeart 6 Apparent Conflict of Interest.\n\n  In summary this PowerPoint alleges that Dr. Hampshire had a personal \nand financial conflict of interest. Dr. Hampshire approached my \ncommittee staff because she was scared and felt unfairly targeted by \nthe Wyeth Company and also by her agency. Why? Because she was simply \ndoing her job to check to see if drugs were as effective and safe as \nthey were said to be.\n  Last week, the Food and Drug Administration briefed my committee \ninvestigators on this matter. It turns out that Wyeth succeeded in \nhaving Dr. Hampshire removed from reviewing its drugs. Dr. Hampshire's \nhard work and dedication to science and drug safety placed a bull's eye \non her back and destroyed her reputation and career--I should say \ntemporarily destroyed her reputation. When you hear the end of this, \nshe got commendation. Without her knowledge, the Food and Drug \nAdministration also launched a criminal investigation against her.\n  This sordid story is still unraveling. I can say that no action was \ntaken against Dr. Hampshire, and after the investigation closed, the \nFood and Drug Administration rewarded Dr. Hampshire for her work on the \nWyeth drug, which remains off the market. Unfortunately for Dr. \nHampshire, Wyeth's efforts to discredit her did not end when the FDA \ncleared her. At least one Wyeth sales representative attempted to \ndiscredit Dr. Hampshire in the veterinary community. Fortunately for \nDr. Hampshire, the salesperson's comments about Wyeth's investigation \nof her and her alleged conflicts of interest were made to a former \ncolleague of Dr. Hampshire. My letter to Wyeth today seeks information \nand documents related to Wyeth's investigation of Dr. Hampshire and the \nsalesperson's comments.\n  So a year later, we are still uncovering the cozy relationship \nbetween the agency and the drug industry.\n  In this case, a company had the guts to go to supposedly an unbiased \nregulating agency and tried to get somebody fired, removed, and even a \ncriminal investigation against them, do everything to discredit them. \nThat sort of culture and environment should not exist in any regulatory \nagency with the economic sectors that they are regulating.\n\n  Dr. Hampshire's sad story is further proof that the Food and Drug \nAdministration needs a permanent commissioner who can restore order and \nrespect for independence. The Food and Drug Administration cannot serve \nthe American people and the interests of the drug industry at the same \ntime.\n  A year ago, Dr. Graham created a firestorm when he said at the Vioxx \nhearing:\n\n       I can tell you right now, there are at least five drugs on \n     the market today that I think need to be looked at quite \n     seriously to see whether or not they belong there. . . .\n\n  Dr. Graham identified those five drugs: Accutane, Bextra, Crestor, \nMeridia, and Serevent, when asked by my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Bingaman of New Mexico. Some roundly criticized Dr. Graham's \ntestimony as inflammatory a year ago. Today it is noteworthy that the \nagency has taken regulatory action or action is pending on four out of \nthe five drugs named by Dr. Graham.\n  Less than a week after the hearing, the Food and Drug Administration \nannounced it was strengthening its plan to reduce the risk of birth \ndefects associated with Accutane. Then in August the agency issued a \npublic health advisory to help make sure females do not become pregnant \nwhile taking this medicine and to release more information about \ndepression and suicidal thoughts associated with that drug. A month \nafter the hearing, December of last year, the Food and Drug \nAdministration issued a public health advisory for Bextra. The agency \nannounced it changed Bextra's label to provide consumers with upgraded \nwarnings about possible heart and blood clotting problems. Ultimately, \nthe agency asked Pfizer to voluntarily remove Bextra from the market in \nApril of this year.\n  Less than 4 months after Dr. Graham's testimony, Crestor was subject \nto a public health advisory as part of the agency's effort to notify \nthe public of potentially significant emerging safety data. Crestor's \nlabel was changed to highlight important information on the safe use of \nCrestor. Eight months after the hearing, the Food and Drug \nAdministration convened an advisory committee meeting related to the \nsafety of Serevent and other asthma drugs. The advisory committee \nrecommended strengthening the labels for Serevent as well, but the \nagency has yet to act. Only one drug, Meridia, has not been the subject \nof any action by FDA.\n  American consumers are the beneficiaries of these actions. I don't \nknow if the agency would have acted without Dr. Graham's testimony \nbefore my committee a year ago. But I know from experience that \nsunlight is the best disinfectant. The scrutiny of the last 12 months \nis just the kind of medicine that the Food and Drug Administration \nneeds. Things have not turned around overnight. Reforming this agency \nis a long-haul task.\n  For those of us in Congress committed to oversight, reform, and \nimprovement, the Vioxx investigation and hearings, as well as other \ninvestigations, prompted me to cosponsor two Food and Drug \nAdministration reform bills this year. Senator Dodd of Connecticut and \nI introduced a bipartisan bill, the Fair Access to Clinical Trials Act, \nin February and the Food and Drug Administration Safety Act of 2005 in \nApril of this year. These bills represent part of a sustained effort to \nrestore public confidence in the Federal Government's food and drug \nsafety agency. A number of you have cosponsored these bills with \nSenator Dodd and me. I urge everyone else who hasn't to consider them \nagain.\n  Enactment of these bills will be a meaningful step towards greater \naccountability and transparency for the Food and Drug Administration. \nAnd if enacted, they would provide the agency with some much needed \nauthority to ensure the safety and efficacy of drugs.\n  One big opportunity that absolutely cannot be missed right now is the \nappointment of a new full-time commissioner who is committed to reform. \nThis leader must recognize the problems of a culture that has become \ntoo cozy with the industry.\n  Then that leader must be tough enough to make necessary changes \nhappen.\n  The FDA has to do a top-notch job on ensuring the safety of the \nproducts it regulates.\n  And where the FDA lacks the tools and resources to do so, Congress \nhas to step in and help.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent----\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. You mean we have used up all the time on our bill? I \ntook time off of my bill.\n\n[[Page S13097]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time between now and 3:30 is equally \ndivided between the chairman and the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Then I will forget my last three sentences.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Rhode \nIsland be recognized to offer his amendment and speak for 10 minutes, \nand the time thereafter until 3:30 be equally divided on the Dorgan \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, my \nunderstanding is that we have 15 minutes equally divided on the Dorgan-\nDodd amendment, and that was to start at 3 o'clock. My recommendation \nwould be that if there is 10 minutes now allocated during that period \nwe simply move the vote to 3:40 so that we will have the 15 minutes \nequally divided--30 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I amend my request to accommodate the \nrequest of the Senator from North Dakota. The Senator from Rhode Island \ncan offer his amendment, and when he is finished, there will be a half \nhour on the Dorgan amendment. He gets 15, and the other side gets 15, \nand the vote will now occur at 3:40.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Parliamentary inquiry: What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Kennedy amendment is pending. The Senator \nis authorized to set it aside for his amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2626\n\n  Mr. REED. The Kennedy amendment being set aside, I would send an \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2626.\n\n  Mr. REED.

I offer this amendment along with Senator Kennedy, Senator \nSchumer, Senator Kohl, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Kerry, Senator \nCarper, Senator Leahy, Senator Lieberman, Senator Dayton, and Senator \nStabenow.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is about LIHEAP, the Low Income Heating \nAssistance Program. Each of us, at this point, is very familiar with \nthe struggle that is taking place today--and if you were outside early \nthis morning, you understand temperatures are falling--that many \nfamilies are having to heat their homes for this winter. According to \nEIA's Short-Term Energy Outlook released last week, energy costs for \nthe average family using\n\n[[Page S13098]]\n\nheating oil are estimated to hit $1,500 this winter, an increase of \n$325 over last year's heating season. Natural gas prices could hit \n$1,000, an increase of $300. For a family using propane, prices are \nprojected to hit $1,300, an increase of $230.\n  Despite these sharp increases in fuel costs, we sadly continue to \nfund LIHEAP, the one program that can provide sufficient help, at the \nsame level as last year, which in reality means an actual cut in the \nlevel of assistance we can provide low-income consumers this winter's \nheating season.\n  The responsible thing for Congress to do is to fully fund LIHEAP at \nthe full $5.1 billion authorized in the Energy Policy Act enacted \nearlier this year. Indeed, we have tried to do that--not once but three \ntimes--in the past few weeks. Senator Collins and I, along with some 30 \nof our colleagues, have offered amendments to the Defense bill, the \nTransportation-Treasury-HUD bill, and the Labor-HHS bill to fully fund \nLIHEAP. We have reached across the aisle and across the country to \nprovide more assistance for the LIHEAP program, and in each instance a \nmajority of this body has gone on record to support full funding.\n  Today, I come to the floor to offer another amendment to fully fund \nthe LIHEAP program. This time I seek to offset that increase with a \ntemporary 1-year windfall profits tax on large oil companies. This tax \nwould be on the excess profits large integrated oil companies have \nearned as fuel prices reached record heights over the past year.\n  My amendment draws from Senator Schumer's legislation to define \nwindfall profits. My amendment creates a temporary levy on the excess \nprofits of U.S. oil companies and foreign companies that do substantial \nbusiness in the United States. I would like to thank Senators Dorgan \nand Dodd for proposing the windfall profits tax, and Senator Schumer \nfor his modification to this proposal.\n  The temporary levy applies to major integrated oil companies which \nhave an average daily world-wide production of crude oil of at least \n500,000 barrels for the taxable year. Under our revenue mechanism \ncompanies will calculate the average of annual profits for the years \n2002 to 2004, subtracting the highest year, and then adding 10 percent. \nThe resulting number is the reasonably inflated average profit for \ncalculating the amount of windfall profits. Any profits earned from \nU.S. operations in 2005 that exceed this reasonably inflated average \nprofit are deemed a ``windfall profit'' and is taxed at the rate \nnecessary to raise the required $2.92 billion needed to fully fund \nLIHEAP.\n  This is a temporary 1-year measure. The tax rate is set simply to \nfund the authorized level of LIHEAP. In America no family should be \nforced to choose between heating their home and putting food on the \ntable for their children. No senior citizen should have to decide \nbetween buying fuel or buying pharmaceuticals. But, unfortunately, this \nsadly is the case and this winter it will be the case in too many \nsituations. The heat-or-eat dilemma is not just rhetoric. The RAND \nCorporation conducted a study and found that low-income households \nreduced food expenditures by roughly the same amount as increases in \nfuel expenditures. In some respects this is a tidal wave not of rising \nwater like Katrina but of rising energy prices.\n  We have all gone out and had the opportunity to visit with \nconstituents and get a firsthand glimpse of the struggle they are faced \nwith. I visited a few weeks ago with Mr. Aram Ohanian, an 88-year-old \nveteran of the U.S. Army in World War II, living on a $779-a-month \nSocial Security check, and money is so tight that sometimes he has to \neat with his children or go to a local soup kitchen, and he also has to \nget assistance from a food bank. These price increases to Mr. Ohanian \nwill be very difficult. He received assistance last year with respect \nto LIHEAP funding, but that assistance will be relatively less this \nyear because of rising prices and maybe because the demand will be much \nmore.\n  Last month, the Social Security Administration announced that cost-\nof-living adjustments for 2006 on average is about $65. That $65 \nincrease to Mr. Ohanian is not going to take up the slack in terms of \nthese tremendous fuel prices.\n  Now, this amendment would increase LIHEAP funding by $2.92 billion. \nIn fact, even if we did this, there would still be a significant number \nof Americans who qualify for the program but will not get help. But at \nleast we are taking a step toward fully authorizing this very important \nprogram.\n  I hope we can, in fact, support this effort. Some have objected not \nbecause the LIHEAP program does need money but because there was no \noffset. Today there is an offset. This windfall profits tax will pay \nfor the additional cost of LIHEAP, and I can't think of anything more \nappropriate than asking fuel companies, oil companies to take some of \ntheir very extraordinary profits and put them back so that poor people \ncan buy their products. I think that is fair. I think it is just. I \nthink it makes a lot of sense.\n  I asked them voluntarily, sent a letter to all the oil executives \nsaying: Would you pledge 10 percent of your profits to the local \ncommunity agencies that provide support? I have heard but from one \ncompany, CITGO, who talked about their plan to give bulk fuel. Everyone \nelse has said nothing. They are going on as if American families are \nnot in desperate situations because of the price of heating oil.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues, in fact, are able to support \nthis method which fully pays for the increase to LIHEAP which so many \nof us agree is absolutely necessary.\n  I yield back the Senator from Montana any time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield a second, I ask \nunanimous consent that after the Coburn amendment is debated or set \naside, Senator Santorum be recognized to speak for 15 minutes, Mr. Byrd \nbe recognized to speak for 30 minutes, and Senator Feingold be \nrecognized to offer his amendment on pay-go with 30 minutes of debate \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, may I ask--the understanding at this moment \nis Senator Dorgan and myself are recognized for how much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes on each side--15 minutes for \nthe Senators from Connecticut and North Dakota and 15 minutes on the \nother side.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me thank, again, my colleague from North \nDakota for offering this amendment. I am pleased to be the lead \ncosponsor of it.\n  This was brought up a number of weeks ago. This isn't something the \nSenator from North Dakota conjured up in the last several days. It is \none he suggested back a number of weeks ago when the first skyrocketing \nprices occurred and the information emerged about these incredible, \nhistoric profits.\n  Just to put it in perspective in these few minutes, we have remaining \nbefore we vote on this amendment, in the space of 12 weeks--12 weeks--\nthe five largest integrated oil companies secured profits approaching \n$33 billion.\n  Now, again, let me state the obvious, or hopefully what is the \nobvious. The Senator from North Dakota and I have no difficulty \nwhatsoever with the idea that businesses, including energy companies, \nmake a legitimate and decent profit because of their investments and \ntheir work. But from time to time we have seen in our Nation's history \nprofiteering where excessive profits are made at the expense of what \nneeds to be done for the good of the country. In this case, to develop \nadditional energy resources.\n  What we are suggesting with this amendment is that with windfall \nprofits that exceed $40 a barrel, we offer the integrated companies an \nalternative. One: take the windfall profits and invest them back in the \ndevelopment of existing or alternative energy sources; or two: give \nrebates to consumers in this country who are paying these incredibly \nhigher prices in gasoline and home heating oil. Don't just go out and \nbuy your own stock or engage in merger acquisitions at a time when we \nneed to be less dependent on politically fragile parts of the world \nsuch as we are today.\n  We know over and over again, that the companies are bragging in their \nown annual reports about record profits. In 2004, one major oil \ncompany, in\n\n[[Page S13099]]\n\nits annual report, stated that it had recorded 48 percent higher \nprofits because of the higher prices of oil and gasoline. And at the \nsame time they announced to the world in that annual report that they \nactually reduced their production by 3 percent. We know that refining \ncapacity is near 100 percent. We also know that many of these same \nintegrated companies virtually eliminated 176 refineries in the last 25 \nyears. It is not because of environmental problems or people objecting \nto existing refineries. They decided themselves to reduce their \nrefining capacity.\n  Again, you don't need to have a Ph.D. in economics to understand a \ncompany is profiteering to such a degree that it hurts our country. We \nought to be doing a better job than that.\n  With this amendment, we are asking this industry to either reinvest \nthese excessive profits into increasing the availability of supply in \nour country or provide the rebates for individuals who could use the \nhelp. It is not just taking the money and putting it in the general \nfund and saying, We will decide what to do with it later.\n  I heard my colleague from Rhode Island making an impassioned plea for \nthe LIHEAP program, and I agree with him. I have watched him offer this \namendment on several occasions over the last few years. This body has \nseen fit to turn down those amendments over and over. So we are not \ngoing to get much help there.\n  The suggestion is, why not ask this industry that is recording nearly \n$33 billion of profits in 12 weeks to do a little something to help the \nfolks in Connecticut, Minnesota, or North Dakota who are going to be \npaying very high home heating prices. In fact, in my State, the \nestimated cost in that area alone would be about $325 more this year \nper household, not to mention, the continued high gasoline prices. \nWhile gasoline prices are coming down somewhat, they are still about 32 \ncents higher than last year.\n  Again, I think the industry owes it. We saw during another time in \nour Nation's history, World War II, that another Senator in this body, \nHarry Truman, demanded a stop to the profiteering that was occurring in \nthis country.\n  We are not denying anybody a right to make a legitimate profit, but \nwhen those profits put our Nation at risk, when they cause people who \ndeserve better to pay exorbitant prices to stay warm and to use the \nautomobiles they need, then we ought to be standing up as a collective \nbody saying: You have to stop that. There is no justification for it. \nRemember, these prices began to climb before August 29. It wasn't \nKatrina. These prices began to climb during the spring and summer \nmonths. Katrina has caused some problems, no question about it, but to \nuse Katrina as the excuse for these skyrocketing prices is not based on \nfact at all. We are urging our colleagues to join us in this effort. \nThis would be a major source of relief for people across the country. \nAlternatively, the industry could do the right thing and invest those \nwindfall profits in new energy sources and refineries instead of \nmerging and buying back their own stock. Half of the profits last year \nwere spent on buying back stock, not in new exploration. The amendment \nserves as an incentive. That is what the Dorgan amendment does.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the amendment. We urge our \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from \nConnecticut for his support on this amendment.\n  I want to spend a little time responding to some of the opponents who \nhave completely mischaracterized the amendment, which is everyone's \nright on the floor of the Senate. It is important for everyone to hear \nthe facts.\n  We did hear last evening a colleague say he was sick of populism, \njust sick of populism. When the little guy gets hurt, and the little \nguy is getting rich at the same time, populism means you stand up for \nthe little guy. And I would say, get used to it. If you are sick of it, \nget used to it, because this Senate floor is where you stand for people \nwho don't have the capability to stand for themselves.\n  In this case, what is happening in our country is unfair, just \nunfair. The oil giants, larger because of mergers, are recording record \nprofits, the highest in the history. Here are what the profits look \nlike, unbelievable profits, the highest in the history of corporate \nAmerica, and the consumers experience all the pain. They wonder, as \nthey see the headlines, ``Big Oil's Burden of Too Much Cash,'' ``High \nEnergy Prices Lift Profits at ConocoPhillips by 89 Percent.'' I could \ngo on and on. ExxonMobil, $9.9 billion in the third quarter. I could go \non.\n  The consumers wonder, as they fill their tanks, about these \nheadlines. They wonder about these headlines as they try to heat their \nhome this winter and pay 40, 50, 60 percent more to do it. They wonder \nout on the farm someplace about these headlines when they try to figure \nout, How am I going to be able to buy a tank of fuel?\n  This proposal is very simple. This proposal says that for oil over \n$40 a barrel price, we would impose a windfall profits tax, except that \nno company would pay it if all their profits are being invested into \nthe ground to search for more energy or above ground to build more \nrefineries. If that is what they are doing with profits, this doesn't \naffect them. They don't have to worry.\n\n  We have had all kinds of folks coming out to the floor with talking \npoints. If I was the oil industry, I wouldn't like what we are doing \neither. I understand that. It is perfectly logic. The talking points \nsay if this amendment is passed, we are going to see less production of \noil and gas. That is total rubbish, complete nonsense. In fact, the \nmost significant incentive for the increased production of oil and gas \nin this country would be the prospect of having to pay a 50-percent \nexcise tax on profits if you don't use them for that purpose.\n  We say: If you do use them to expand supply of energy and therefore \nreduce price, you are exempt. Don't worry about this. Let me show what \nBusinessWeek says:\n\n       Why Isn't Big Oil Drilling More? Rather than developing new \n     fields, oil giants have preferred to buy rivals--drilling for \n     oil on Wall Street.\n\n  If you are buying back stock, drilling for oil on Wall Street, or if \nyou are not using the money to expand the supply of energy, then you \nrisk being hit with a windfall profits tax, the entire purpose of which \nwould be to provide rebates to consumers, not to bring money into the \nFederal Treasury, but instead to provide a recapture and provide \nrebates to consumers. It is painfully simple.\n  Again, I say, as my colleague from Connecticut has, I think profits \nare fine. It is what makes our businesses work. But these are profits \nthe likes of which we have never seen. Last year, the average price of \noil was $40 a barrel, and the industry had the highest profits in \nhistory. This is unfair in this country, and we need to do something \nabout it.\n  I have quoted before Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys, but what he \nsaid in that song in the thirties certainly does apply to this:\n\n       The little bee sucks the blossom, but the big bee gets the \n     honey.\n       The little guy picks the cotton and the big guy gets the \n     money.\n\n  And so it goes. At this point, using energy is not a luxury. Using \nenergy for every American is a necessity. The question is, should the \noil giants, made larger by blockbuster mergers, be showing record \nprofits and then using the money to drill for oil on Wall Street, hoard \ncash or buy back their stock at the same time average Americans are \ntrying to figure out how on Earth do I pay this fuel bill? Our \namendment tries to solve that.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I reserve my time. If there are speakers on the other \nside, I prefer they use their time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we are back on the amendment again. This \nmorning we went through this, but I think it is worthwhile going \nthrough it again to talk about the difficulty of trying to do something \nwith a windfall profits tax.\n  We have done this before, and I know my colleagues put some \nexemptions in\n\n[[Page S13100]]\n\nthere. The fact is, they are still taking windfall profits, something \nwe tried before and doesn't work. Distribution doesn't work. We have \nbeen through that. This is something that is not consistent with the \nmarketplace functioning. I don't know how many times we have to go \nthrough this, but I suppose it is an issue that is certainly worth \ntalking about.\n  I think, as I said this morning, there are several issues involved in \nthis bill. One of them is the economy, and the economy is to develop \njobs, to have organizations that make profits that create jobs and \nbuild the economy, and we need to do that.\n  The second issue, of course, and the most important perhaps for many \nof us, is energy--to have energy. We can see the energy bills are going \ndown. We are moving beyond that crisis, down to where it was before. \nBut the long-term issue still remains, and that is the one that is \nimportant to talk about. That is why we spent 2 or 3 years with an \nenergy policy, a policy that recognizes that what we have been doing in \nthe past, the kinds of sources we have had in the past are not going to \nalways be there. We have to have an opportunity to move forward.\n  This idea of saying, We will not charge you if you go ahead and \ninvest--there is going to be investment. There has always been \ninvestment. I come from a State where energy is being put out there. A \nlot of you don't. You don't understand what it costs to do some of \nthese things. It is going to cost even more as we go to deeper wells, \nas we go to oil shale, as we go to secondary recovery. But the idea \nthat is being used by my friend over here is that the energy companies \nare making too much money.\n  Take a look at this chart. This chart shows earnings of major \nindustries during the second quarter of 2005. And then it is adjusted \nto the third quarter of 2005, where we are now. Take a little look \nhere. What is the highest one? Banks. Maybe we ought to have a little \nwindfall profits tax on banks, do you think, and put that money out? \nWhy don't you try that one. Here is pharmaceuticals. My gosh, 18-\npercent return. That would be great. Then you can hand out a bunch of \nfree drugs. I think that would work into your philosophy. Software \nservices, semiconductors, diversified financials, household personal \nproducts, consumer services, insurance, communications, food and \nbeverage, real estate, health care, materials, U.S. industry average, \n7.9. Oh, my goodness, here is oil and natural gas, 7.6, below the \nnational average. And this whole thing is predicated on these people \nmaking too much money. I don't understand that. That has been adjusted. \nNow they are right above that, 8. Look where they are. What is unusual \nabout that?\n\n  These are big dollars, that is true, but the return on investment is \nnot extraordinary. There has been more activity there, so obviously \nthere are more dollars.\n  I wish my colleagues would come with me and talk about what we \nanticipate happening, what we are going to do about changing some of \nthe energy that is going into other kinds of products so that we can \nhave it for the future. Do you think that is going to cost a lot of \nmoney? Of course it is. Do you think they want to have to justify what \ntheir investment is with the Federal Government? I don't think so.\n  If there is anything around here we need to be doing, it is getting \nthe Federal Government out of some of these kinds of private sector \ninvestments instead of getting into it more and more.\n  What the Senator is suggesting is, if I am an energy company, I have \nto go to an agency and find out whether what I am doing justifies me \nnot having a withholding tax. Those are not the kinds of things we need \nto do.\n  We continue to hear more and more about let's get the Federal \nGovernment involved in making these kinds of decisions. These aren't \nthe kind of decisions that need to be made. That is the marketplace, \nand that is what the marketplace is about. We can see it changing \nalmost daily, and it should, there is no question about that.\n  Again, this whole discussion that has gone on today and yesterday \nmakes me wonder why we messed around trying to get an energy policy \nthat gives us some direction in the future, that gives us some idea of \nhow we should be investing in the future, with new kinds of energy and \ndoing it without getting the approval of a Federal Government agency or \nsomebody in the Congress to decide whether that investment is a sound \ninvestment. That is what the marketplace is for. We are making real \nprogress in doing that.\n  I think this idea--and I know the idea is basically how we are going \nto get some money out to everyone, which is not a brand-new idea. My \nfriends on the other side are big on that one, and I understand it, but \nthis is not the way to do that. This is not the way to take windfall \nprofits, and if so, let's start up here at the top of the chart. Let's \nstart up here. If we are going to play that game, why, that is probably \nthe way we ought to go.\n  I will stop here and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes. That was about \nas good a presentation supporting windfall profits as could be made. \nThese charts of an 89-percent increase, the highest profits in the \nhistory of corporations, and so on, it is a pretty hard case to make on \nthe floor of the Senate that these profits don't exist or this industry \nsomehow isn't very profitable.\n  My colleague talks about the long run. The problem is you don't heat \nyour home in the long run, you heat your home tonight. And if you are \nstuck with a 50-percent increase to heat your home tonight, you don't \nworry about the long run; you have to figure out how you do it now.\n  My constituents and his, when they order a load of fuel to be \ndelivered to their farm and ranch, they are not going to pay for that \nin the long run; they are going to pay for it now.\n  My point is this: This notion of the marketplace functioning--I would \nlove to have a debate about the marketplace. This is so far from the \nfree marketplace, it is unbelievable. There is no free market here. You \nhave OPEC ministers sitting around a table deciding supply and price. \nThere are the biggest oil companies, much bigger because of mergers, \nthat have more raw muscle in the marketplace, and then there are the \nfutures markets which, instead of providing liquidity, have become \ngrand casinos of speculation. Now we call it the marketplace. Too bad \nfor the consumers.\n  Somebody ought to probably stand on the side of the consumers--that \nis the point of all of this--to say that this is not fair. This \nmarketplace does not work for everybody. It works to provide the \nbiggest profits in history for the oil companies.\n  My colleague says: Well, they are just doing a really good job. Yes, \nthey are. BusinessWeek itself says what they are doing is drilling for \noil on Wall Street, not drilling for oil underground.\n  Our point is simple: No major oil companies will pay this windfall \nprofits tax if they are doing the right thing. And if they are not, we \nwill recapture it and send rebates to consumers. If my colleagues are \nagainst that, vote against the amendment, and I understand it.\n  I reserve our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will just pick up and then let my friend \nfrom Wyoming conclude this debate. Again, I commend him on trying to \nmake as strong a case as he could.\n  There is a fundamental difference here. We are talking about not just \nany other commodity or service; we are talking about things that are \nessential for people to survive. We are about to enter the winter \nseason. We have been feeling it in the Nation's Capitol the last 24 \nhours; the temperature has dropped to 40 degrees. I suspect our Indian \nsummer is over. Across the northern tier States and western States \nalike, people on fixed incomes do not have any choice on whether to \nheat their homes and take care of their families. So unlike other \nsectors of the economy where there are some choices involved, when it \ncomes to this commodity, oil, America depends upon it for people to \nremain safe, healthy, and sound.\n  Many people across the country, certainly in western States more than \neastern states, have no other alternative in terms of how they get to \ntheir jobs or their schools or those\n\n[[Page S13101]]\n\nplaces they must be. It is the automobile. That is what they have to \nrely on. Mass transit systems do not exist everywhere. So this is not \njust some random commodity or service we are talking about. That is the \nfirst point.\n  No. 2, the point was made earlier by my colleague from North Dakota, \nthat we are talking about the large, integrated oil companies. I showed \nthe list yesterday. We now talk about ExxonMobil; it used to be Exxon \nand Mobil. It used to be Conoco and Phillips; now it is ConocoPhillips. \nAt some point we may have one or two companies left. When OPEC sits \ndown, that is hardly free enterprise or a free market system. These \nprices are being established by a handful of people basically deciding \nwhat we will pay as consumers.\n  One tries to find some economic justification for it and some people \nare saying it was Katrina. Again, I admit Katrina has caused \ndisruption, but these prices moved long before Katrina occurred. There \nis no economic justification that I can find. In fact, the industry \nitself admits that they showed record profits while they reduced \nproduction.\n  Their own annual reports indicate what they are doing with the \nprofits. They are out there buying back their own stock. They are \nengaging in mergers.\n  We are saying, Look, you owe some responsibility to increase \nproduction or help us develop some alternatives. We just gave you \nmassive tax breaks in the Energy bill. Alternatively, provide some \nrelief to the businesses, the farmers, the consumers who are going to \nbe paying these higher prices. This provides an alternative, an \nincentive. We provided an incentive with the Energy bill by providing \ntax breaks for the industry. They get the tax break if they will do \ncertain things.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. We urge the adoption of this amendment. These are essential \nneeds. There is no choice for consumers today. This is a proper role \nfor Government, to go in and demand this kind of accountability.\n  We yield back the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Do I have some time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes 46 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, it is interesting, the proper role for \nGovernment--I guess that is a choice we make. Certainly we have a \ndifferent point of view about the role of Government, not only on this \nbut on many things.\n  We talk about how important oil and gas is. It certainly is \nimportant. What about food and beverage--is this important? No, that is \njust something that we play with. What about insurance--is that \nimportant? Of course, all of these things are important. Somehow we \nwant to pick out one commodity and do something with it. We keep \ntalking about these profits. Again, let me say that the profits in \nthese companies are not as equal as these. So the idea that they are \noverly profitable--they are not.\n  I am not sure that the Senator is familiar with the costs of energy \nproduction. We are talking now about doing offshore things. It costs \nmillions of dollars to drill a well. These are not small-dollar kinds \nof things.\n  Again, I say one should not have to subject themselves to the \noversight of a Government agency to decide whether they can use the \nmoney they earn to invest in their own business. That just does not \nmake much sense.\n  We talk about reducing the costs. Well, everybody wants to reduce the \ncosts. Take a look at the gas pump over the last 6 months. It has been \nreduced from about $3 a gallon to now below $2, so we are making some \nprogress.\n  He talks about OPEC setting the price. Why do my colleagues think \nthat is? Because we are so dependent on importing energy. Our job ought \nto be to allow ourselves to have these investments in domestic energy, \nalternative energy, and do some things to avoid what has been done \nthere.\n  So I understand my friends over there who have a different point of \nview, but it is quite a different point of view. It is quite a \ndifferent point of view than we have had in this bill. It is quite a \ndifferent point of view than we have had in the Energy bill. It is \nquite a different point of view in the ideas we have had to create a \nstronger economy and more jobs. So I certainly urge people to vote \nagainst this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to Senator \nDorgan's windfall profits tax amendment. This amendment seeks to punish \noil companies with a punitive tax on profits when oil prices go above \n$40 per barrel. This amendment is shortsighted and extremely bad fiscal \npolicy.\n  First, this bill already includes a $4.923 billion tax penalty on \nlarge integrated oil companies. The Dorgan amendment would simply add \non to the penalty currently in this bill. The belief persists that the \noil companies' profits are ``extreme'' or ``excessive.'' However, this \nbelief is unfounded. Yes, most oil companies did have record-setting \nprofits during the 3rd quarter. But history has clearly shown that the \noil industry is ``boom or bust.'' One needs look no further than my \nhome State of Kansas. During the 1970s and 1980s, the economy in Kansas \nwas tied directly to the oil and natural gas industry. As their profits \nspiked or fell, our economy would do the same. I say this to prove that \nI have firsthand knowledge of how volatile the oil industry is. We need \nnot tax a single industry simply because it had a good quarter. Even a \nrecord-setting quarter is not reason to add a windfall tax. This is bad \npolicy and sets a negative precedent. This clearly puts a disincentive \nin the marketplace for American companies, in all sectors of our \neconomy, to not perform their best. This is not the signal we want to \nbe sending in a competitive, global economy.\n  Building upon the fact that the oil industry has many fluctuations, a \nwindfall tax on profits would reduce needed private investments in \nenergy infrastructure. If the industry is not allowed to benefit during \nperiods of high prices because of a tax on profits, there will be \nprecious little incentive to invest in domestic production. These \ninvestments lead to more production, which in turn lead to lower \nprices. A windfall profit tax would disrupt the normal cyclical \nmovement of the energy industry.\n  Finally, a windfall profits tax would harm the numerous individuals \nwho have invested in the energy industry through pension plans and \nmutual funds because this new tax would reduce capital gains and \ndividends payments.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is clear this amendment would do much \nmore harm than good. It is shortsighted, market distorting, and sets a \nbad precedent for every industry in our economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Connecticut is out of time.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the Dorgan \namendment is not germane to the underlying legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant Journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 35, nays 64, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 331 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--35\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Clinton\n\n[[Page S13102]]\n\n\n     Conrad\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--64\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Roberts\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Corzine\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). On this vote, the yeas are 35, \nthe nays are 64.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2609\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes equally divided in \nrelation to the Feinstein amendment No. 2609.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I present this amendment on behalf of \nSenators Sununu, Gregg, Wyden, Cantwell, Feingold, Burr, McCain, Kerry, \nCollins, Clinton, Schumer, Snowe, and myself.\n  In April of this year, the President of the United States stated \nthis:\n\n       With oil at more than $50 a barrel, energy companies do not \n     need taxpayer-funded incentives to explore for oil and gas.\n\n  Before a joint Senate hearing last week, the big companies--\nExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, BP, and Shell--said they do not \nneed these tax incentives. Each CEO said they did not need it.\n  This amendment removes those tax incentives. I think the time has \ncome to do that.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I offer my strong support for Senator \nFeinstein's amendment to change section 263(C) of the Tax Code, and I \nthank her for her work on it. The provision that her amendment targets \nallows large, integrated oil companies to expense, instead of \ncapitalize, intangible drilling and development costs, such as fuel \ncosts, workers' wages, and drilling equipment. This is a complicated \nway of saying that U.S. taxpayer dollars have been subsidizing the \nregular costs of integrated oil companies doing business, something \nthat doesn't make sense.\n  Repealing this provision of the Tax Code could result in upwards of \n$2 billion more dollars in the Treasury over the next 5 years. Two \nbillion dollars instead of simply transferring this significant amount \nof money to companies we all know are currently experiencing record \nprofits, these funds could support a variety of important programs or \ncould be used to reduce our skyrocketing deficit so that our children \ndon't inherit our fiscal mess. Integrated oil companies are some of the \nlargest corporations in the world--they simply don't need this tax \nbreak.\n  This amendment makes common sense and I encourage my colleagues to \nvote in favor of it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, the Senator is offering an \namendment which purports to respond to what some executives had to say \nabout whether they needed or wanted the tax provisions in the Tax \nPolicy Act we passed. These provisions--the principal ones--are 50 \nyears old. They are not part of the energy package. They have been \nthere for 50 years, upon which the energy companies rely when they \ndrill expensive holes and invest expensive amounts. It has to do with \nthe amortization of costs. Some of it is intangible, meaning it is not \na product because part of the cost is intangible. Part of the cost that \ngoes into producing these is seismic information and the like. That is \nwhy it is called that. But these were not adopted in the energy \npackage. They have been part of the production of energy in the United \nStates for eons. We want more production, and we come along and take \nthose away.\n  It seems to me this is the wrong time, and it is not germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the \nFeinstein amendment is not germane to the underlying bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for the purposes of the pending amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this question, the yeas are 48, the nays \nare 51. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having \nvoted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2610\n\n  There are now 2 minutes equally divided prior to a vote on the \nFeinstein amendment No. 2610.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, we have all seen the HHS bill go down \nin the Senate. There is a message in this. That is that the people of \nAmerica are only going to accept so many cuts in health care, in \nMedicaid, in Medicare, in transportation, and other vital areas.\n  This amendment directly targets our budget deficit. If the budget is \nnot in balance, tax rates for income, capital gains, and dividends will \nreturn to previous levels and deductions for taxpayers earning more \nthan an adjusted gross income of $1 million a year.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Tax Policy \nCenter, this amendment could increase revenues by more than $100 \nbillion over 5 years. It is a strong step, a first step in helping the \nbudget deficit and also saying to people in this country that \nmillionaires are prepared to forego tax cuts to benefit the very poor \nof our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am against the Feinstein amendment. It is a typical \nDemocratic response to a budget: Raise taxes. They happen to think that \nAmericans are crying, ``We are\n\n[[Page S13103]]\n\nundertaxed.'' I don't hear that from my constituents. I bet they don't \nhear it in California either.\n  If those taxpayers she is talking about were only coupon-clipping, \nPark Avenue millionaires or somebody from Rodeo Drive, a resident of \nBeverly Hills, I would not be concerned. But we are talking about \ntaxing small business people 80 percent by the Treasury Department. The \npeople that fall into this category whom she wants to tax are the small \nbusiness people that create 70 to 80 percent of the jobs in America. \nThere is no reason, when we finally have the individual tax rate at 35, \nthe same as the corporate tax rate, to treat small business the same as \nwe treat corporations--not have a bias in the tax bill. We shouldn't go \nback to that bias.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I raise a point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2612\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes evenly divided prior \nto a vote in relation to the Cantwell amendment No. 2612.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. My amendment makes price gouging a Federal crime. It \ndoes two things. It implements what is in 28 different States the law \nto make sure consumers are protected from price gouging, and it gives \nthe FTC, the Department of Justice, and State attorneys general the \nability to look at market manipulation as a Federal crime when energy \nmarkets are manipulated. I urge my colleagues to support, at a time \nwhen we are going home to high heating oil prices, something that will \nprotect consumers by giving new tools to the Federal statute.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Cantwell \nanti-price gouging amendment to S. 2020, the tax reconciliation bill. \nThis amendment is identical to Senator Cantwell's Energy Emergency \nConsumer Protection Act of 2005, a bill that I co-sponsored with 29 \ncolleagues. This amendment will, for the first time, give our Federal \nGovernment the needed tools to prosecute those unscrupulous individuals \nand companies that seek to take advantage of emergencies and disasters \nby price gouging consumers in the sale of gasoline and other petroleum \nproducts.\n  We have all seen the suffering caused to consumers when gas prices \nspike in the wake of disruptions in supply caused by natural disasters. \nWhile gas prices have come down from their record levels of over $ 3.00 \nper gallon in many places in the last few weeks, they are still too \nhigh. And the experience of this past September teaches us that the \ndanger to consumers resulting from tight supplies and high demand \nremains acute. We cannot allow consumers to remain vulnerable to price \ngouging and market manipulation the next time our essential energy \nsupplies face disruption.\n  Recent experience shows us beyond doubt the need for this amendment. \nAllegations of price gouging and drastic price spikes were \nunfortunately commonplace in the immediate days following the Hurricane \nKatrina disaster--including, for example, gas being sold at $6.00 per \ngallon in the Atlanta area. It appeared that the human suffering caused \nby loss of life, housing, and employment, was compounded by some \nunscrupulous individuals and businesses who took advantage of the \nemergency by gouging consumers. Yet, under current law, the Federal \nGovernment had virtually no ability to prosecute such price gouging. \nThis amendment will correct this critical deficiency.\n  This amendment contains several important provisions. First, it gives \nthe President the authority to declare an energy emergency during times \nof disruptions in the supply or distribution of gasoline or petroleum \nproducts. Second, the amendment, for the first time, declares illegal \nunder Federal law selling gasoline or petroleum products at a price \nunconscionably high or when circumstances indicate that the seller is \ntaking unfair advantage to increase prices unreasonably in times of \nenergy emergency. Those who violate this law face civil penalties of up \nto $3,000,000 per day and criminal penalties, including jail terms of \nup to 5 years for individuals, as well. The amendment also forbids \nmarket manipulation in connection with the sale of gasoline and \npetroleum products and empowers the experts at the Federal Trade \nCommission to write regulations setting forth specific conduct \nconstitution market manipulation. Additionally, our amendment gives \nStates attorneys general the power to enforce these provisions as well.\n  These measures are an urgently needed deterrent to prevent all those \nwould seek to profit from disasters such as Hurricane Katrina by price \ngouging consumers in the price of gasoline or other essential energy \nsupplies. Our amendment will protect consumers--both those who were the \nvictims of Hurricane Katrina and those who may be victimized in the \nfuture--who suffer every day at the gas pumps from the real and growing \neconomic pain caused by high gas and energy prices. As ranking member \non the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee, I believe that this measure is \nnecessary to prevent unscrupulous companies from ever again using a \nnatural or manmade disaster to justify uncompetitive gas price hikes. \nAll of us can agree that profiteering and price gouging in the price of \nan essential commodity like gasoline is simply unacceptable. Such \nconduct violates every principle of free and fair competition. We must \ngive the Federal Government the necessary tools to prevent such \nmisconduct, and prosecute those who do so.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Cantwell amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the committee held a hearing on this and \nsome of the items we are pursuing,\n\n[[Page S13104]]\n\nsome of the concepts, might be involved with this amendment. But this \nis not germane to this bill, nor the place for the Senate to consider \nthis action. The FTC may need some jurisdiction here, but the \njurisdiction that would follow with the Cantwell amendment is much too \nbroad. Twenty-seven States have this authority now. The question is \nwhether we should at some time give the FTC jurisdiction over multiple \nState problems. This is no way to go about it. It is not germane to the \nbill. I raise a point of order that the amendment is not germane to the \nunderlying bill.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of the act for consideration of the pending amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But \nI would object to limiting it formally, and I will do everything I can \nto finish it in an hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

CLARIFICATION OF TREATMENT OF OUTSIDE INCOME AND \n                   EXPENSES IN THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) In General.--For purposes of rule XXXVI and paragraph \n     5(b)(3) of rule XXXVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     compensation or outside earned income for any calendar year \n     shall be reduced by actual and necessary expenses incurred by \n     a Member of the Senate in connection with the practice of \n     medicine. A Member of the Senate shall include information \n     with respect to such expenses with any report in which such \n     compensation or income is required to be included.\n       (b) Payment or Reimbursement.--If expenses described in \n     subsection (a) are--\n       (1) paid or reimbursed by another person, the amount of any \n     such payment shall not be counted as compensation or outside \n     earned income; and\n       (2) not paid or reimbursed, the amount of compensation or \n     outside earned income shall be determined by subtracting the \n     actual and necessary expenses incurred by the Member from any \n     payment received for the activity.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this is the amendment dealing with the \nresolution of the Senator from Oklahoma, and I just want to clarify \nthat because it will be referred to as the Coburn amendment. I want to \nmake sure everybody understands that is what we are talking about.\n  Before I get into my remarks, I would like to yield, as a convenience \nto him, the first 2 minutes to Senator Hatch, or for additional time if \nhe needs it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by our \ncolleagues from Mississippi and Oklahoma, the Coburn amendment.\n  First of all, let me say I am sorry this amendment is even necessary.\n  It is obvious to everybody that Dr. Coburn, Senator Coburn, is an \nintelligent and dedicated medical doctor whose respect and love for \nhelping people is legendary.\n  It is equally obvious that Dr. Coburn is an accomplished legislator \nwhose contributions to the work of this body are important. No one can \nraise an issue about Dr. Coburn's work ethic, his loyalty to the \nSenate, to Oklahoma, or his constituents, and I say this as someone who \nhas agreed with him on many occasions and as someone who has clashed \nswords with him on occasions.\n  There is no question in my mind the Government in general and the \nSenate in particular benefit from informed legislators. To preclude, \nDr. Coburn--a recognized medical expert--from practicing medicine \nwithout any profit motive whatsoever is nonsensical.\n  There are a lot of people who depend on him and need his services; at \nthe same time, he needs to keep up his clinical skills so that he can \ncontinue to practice medicine whenever he decides to leave the Senate. \nAnd he will not be able to maintain his surgical skills or his hospital \nprivileges if he doesn't have this privilege.\n  In fact, it is a simple precept of government life that policymakers \nshould develop some expertise in the issues they are deliberating.\n  To compare him to attorneys--who very often have a profit motive--is \nthe wrong comparison, I think.\n  We all know Dr. Coburn to be a fine man who has a great deal of \naffection for his patients. I believe he deserves\n\n[[Page S13105]]\n\nthe opportunity to continue to help his patients, continue his medical \nprivileges, and be able to pay for any liability insurance that he may \nneed. He will not make a penny from his efforts, but he will be able to \nup his skills, which I think is a benefit on all levels.\n  What better way for a doctor to develop that expertise than to \ncontinue the practice of medicine, helping real, live people with real, \nlive problems in the real-world hospital or clinic setting?\n  I happen to know a little about this, even though I am a lawyer by \ntraining.\n  As my colleagues are aware, I have taken a great interest in health \nissues since coming to the Congress.\n  It has been my practice to solicit actively medical professionals to \nhelp advise me on health legislative matters.\n  I have been fortunate, for many years, to have been aided in my \nworking representing Utahns, by the assistance of very capable Robert \nWood Johnson Foundation health policy fellows.\n  These fellows, doctors, nurses, dentists, and health professionals, \nwork each year in congressional offices on both sides of the aisle, and \nI think all of my colleagues who are fortunate enough to work with RWJ \nFellows feel their work as been enriched by the presence of these very \ncapable men and women.\n  I think back on those who have worked in my office, and I am so proud \nof what we accomplished together--David Sundwall, M.D., now the head of \nthe Utah Health Department, Phil Marion, M.D., Michael Ashburn, M.D., \nLarry Kerr, PhD, Marlon Priest, M.D., David Russell, DDS, Mark Carlson, \nM.D., Kira Bacal, M.D.--they are all superstars.\n  Several years ago, before my current health policy director, Pattie \nDeLoatche, joined my staff, I talked to a previous fellow, Dr. Priest, \nabout joining us in the Senate.\n  I hoped to woo him away from the University of Alabama.\n  Marlon had been an outstanding addition to my office, as an astute \nemergency room physician who thrived on the give and take of the \nSenate. His work on many issues, particularly anti-tobacco efforts and \nradiation compensation, stands out.\n  Marlon would have been a fantastic Hill staffer. And we would have \nbenefitted greatly by his presence.\n  But, you know what? He said to me, ``Senator, as attractive as this \noffer is, I am almost 50 years old. If I come to the Senate, I can't \npractice medicine. I will lose my license. And when you leave office, I \nwill no longer have a medical career. I just can't take that chance.''\n  That was our loss.\n  Similarly, it is our loss if Dr. Coburn cannot practice medicine \nwhile he is a Senator. It is the loss of this body, which can benefit \nso much by his expertise, and it is the loss of Oklahoma, the Nation, \nand indeed the world, if he cannot practice medicine.\n  Some have suggested, in error I believe, that medical doctors should \nbe treated no differently than other professions, such as lawyers.\n  There is a big difference between those two professions.\n  I can serve here as a lawyer, and I do not lose my license.\n  That is not true for a doctor.\n  With all due respect to my colleagues on the Ethics Committee, and \ntheir staff, the ruling by the Ethics Committee is a bureaucratic \nresponse to a non-problem.\n  Dr. Coburn is not asking to make a profit here.\n  He has sworn to the committee and to this body that a reasonable \nreinterpretation of the Senate rules should allow him to practice \nmedicine on a not-for-profit basis.\n  There is no conflict there.\n  But even more, I find it so commendable that Dr. Coburn has pledged \nto his constituents that he will be a citizen legislator, a central \npart of his Senate campaign.\n  If Dr. Coburn wants to honor and restore the long-standing tradition \nin this body of serving as citizen legislators, then so be it. More \npower to him.\n  And as I noted in the case of my former staffer, a doctor cannot \nbecome a Senate employee and retain his or her licensure.\n  So as a consequence, for all practical purposes, dedicated medical \nprofessionals, be they Dr. Frist, Dr. Coburn, Dr. Priest, or any other \ndoctor, dentist, nurse or other health care worker, cannot give their \nexpertise to the Senate on any extended basis.\n  What we are asking for here is not a conflict of interest by any \nmeans.\n  There would be no profit motive, indeed no profit. So what is the \nconflict?\n  Indeed, as Dr. Coburn has noted, no pregnant woman will choose him \nhoping to sway his vote.\n  I think it is also safe to conclude with Dr. Coburn's notation that \nno PhRMA representatives will line up for a physical at the Oklahoma \nSenator's office.\n  Mr. President, I think that any objective analysis of the facts would \nyield one conclusion: the Senate and the American people benefit by \nhaving doctors serve here.\n  We should be turning cartwheels that we have such talented \nindividuals as Dr. Frist and Dr. Coburn who want to share their \nexpertise with the Senate and our country.\n  The rules should encourage their working here, not discourage it.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree.\n  All I can say is this.\n  This is a good man.\n  He is in it for the right reasons.\n  This amendment will ensure he keeps his medical privileges active.\n  He is not going to make any profit from it, but he will be able to \npay for his medical liability insurance.\n  Most of all, he will be able to help unfortunate people, patients who \nbelieve in him, patients this good doctor helps so selflessly. I think \neverybody in the Senate should feel happy they have enabled our \ncolleague to continue a vital, valuable medical practice without any \nhint of ethical compromise. That is what this amendment is intended to \ndo, and I urge that it be adopted.\n  I hope our colleagues will give some consideration to this issue and \nallow this man the privilege of doing this. I will be very disappointed \nif we don't.\n  I thank my dear friend from Mississippi for granting me this time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, again, I know we will need to alternate back \nand forth. As a courtesy to a colleague, I yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi for filing his resolution and for yielding me a few minutes \nto talk about the merits. I support the resolution. I believe it would \nenhance the Senate to have Senator Coburn continue his medical practice \non a basis where he does not seek a profit, where he covers his \nexpenses, and where he continues to perform very important medical \nservices for many people who are his patients now and who may become \nhis patients.\n  When the issue arises as to whether it interferes with Senator \nCoburn's duties and responsibilities in the Senate, I believe I am in a \nposition to answer that question, categorically, based upon what he has \ndone for a year in the Senate, where I have had very close contact with \nhim on the Judiciary Committee.\n  He is prompt in attendance. We have grave difficulties maintaining a \nquorum but not because of Senator Coburn. He lends an expertise which \nis absent. We had hearings today on the asbestos reform bill, and \nSenator Coburn was cross-examining the medical witnesses in a way that \nregular Senators, plain Senators, even though they have some experience \nin questioning witnesses, can't do. I said to Senator Coburn, after the \nhearing concluded, that he might be in the wrong profession; he ought \nto be practicing cross-examination. He thought that was related to \nbeing a lawyer. He didn't like that suggestion very much, but it was \nmade only in jest.\n  He knows things as a result of his medical profession that the rest \nof us do not know. We have a great many professionals in this body but \nnot medical professionals. There is no conflict of interest, as the \nSenator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, commented about lawyers and a profit \nmotive and there might be some connection between representing clients \nin matters to come before the Senate. That is not the situation with \nSenator Coburn.\n  There is no conflict of interest. In fact, there is a substantial \nconfluence of interest. That may be a new phrase. If I could attract \nSenator Coburn's attention, I said there is a confluence of\n\n[[Page S13106]]\n\ninterest with his work as a doctor and with his work as a Senator.\n  While I agree with the limitations generally, I think they do not \napply to Senator/Dr. Coburn's situation. I believe the resolution ought \nto be adopted.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Mississippi. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume so \nI can get into some of the specifics of the resolution.\n  The resolution simply provides that a Senator who is a physician can \ncontinue to practice in his profession while serving in the Senate. \nHowever, there is an important caveat included in this resolution. A \nSenator who continues to practice medicine may not receive fees and \nother payments for medical services that exceed the actual and \nnecessary expenses incurred by the Senator in connection with his \nmedical practice. In other words, the Senator cannot make a profit from \nhis practice.\n  I have discussed this issue with a lot of our colleagues. There are \nthose who are concerned that once we open this door, we will open it \nmore and more and there will be more and more exceptions to the rule. \nThat is not my intent here. That is a debate for another day, and maybe \nwe should have it, in my opinion. This is narrowly crafted legislation \nthat would allow for Senator Coburn to continue his practice.\n  I think he should have that opportunity. I think it is fair to him, \nand I think it is needed in his community. In talking with him, it is \nnot that he is an obstetrician/gynecologist, he is a general \npractitioner. He treats people who come to him for all kinds of \nproblems. We have a need for more, not less, doctors.\n  Also, there is a unique difference we have to remember. As lawyers, I \nguess as long as you keep your bar membership up, when we leave here, \noh, yes, we are still lawyers because we got a law degree 40 years ago. \nBut as a doctor, if you don't keep up your practice, you can't go back \nand say, Oh great, I will take care of your gynecological needs or \ndeliver a baby. They need to keep their skills honed.\n  Some people say he can practice, he just can't have any income to \ncover his expenses. Based on the Senate salary, he would not be able to \npay for the expenses, primarily because of the exorbitant amount of \nmoney now that is involved in medical malpractice.\n  I note that allowing a physician to continue practicing medicine to \nthe extent of covering actual costs is consistent with an approach that \nwas taken by the House of Representatives. I think it is a very \ncritical point. We are going to have more of a disallowance over here \nthan even the House. This matter was worked through a very lengthy \nprocess in the House, and they came to the conclusion they needed to \nhave this exception.\n  Moreover, the definition of compensation contained in the resolution \nis identical to the definition used in the U.S. Office of Government \nEthics.\n  The resolution applies only to physicians who practice as sole \npractitioners and only when the Senate is not in session. So there is \nnot going to be a conflict with his responsibilities. Knowing this \nSenator from Oklahoma, as we all do already, he would never do that. He \nwouldn't fly home and start delivering babies when we were having \nvotes.\n\n  It also limits it to a sole-practitioner role. The resolution retains \nthe current Senate rule that prohibits a Senator from affiliating with \na firm. In addition, the current rule that prohibits a Senator's name \nfrom being used by any affiliated firm or company is retained.\n  Physicians need to continue to practice in order to maintain their \nskills, as I noted. Because we have not been able to get medical \nmalpractice insurance reform, it costs hundreds of thousands of \ndollars, in many cases, to stay in practice. We all hear from our \ndoctors about how difficult that is getting to be. I think it is \nprobably even more difficult if you are an OB/GYN to pay the fees that \nare involved for providing this medical service.\n  Should a Senator who is a physician have to be recertified to \npractice when he leaves the Senate because he has been unable to \nmaintain his practice because of Senate rules? I don't believe he \nshould have that additional responsibility. We are putting an \nadditional burden on physicians who would serve in the Senate. We need \nmore diversity here, not less, even though we have had doctors \nthroughout history serve in the Senate. Most of them--in fact, I guess \nall of them until very recent history--continued to practice medicine. \nIt was never a problem. I am sure the Senator from Oklahoma is going to \ngive us a history of doctors and physicians in the Senate and what they \ndid. I am sure he is going to give us the history of lawyers who \ncontinued to practice, great Members of the Congress and Senate who \nwent on to become President.\n  I think we are setting up a situation that is indefensible. It is not \njust about this Senator. I want to make the point, too, about why we \nare doing it this way. I don't want to take away the responsibilities \nof the Ethics Committee to interpret the rules. I hoped this would be \nworked out. We have a time problem now. At some point soon, the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma is going to have to decide what to do: Is he going to \ncompletely shut down his practice or what is he going to do? There are \ncertain limits on how long he has to close out his practice.\n  I would like the Rules Committee to have acted on this issue, but \nthere is the issue of getting the matter through the Rules Committee \nand then getting it scheduled for time on the floor. We are doing it \nthis way because it is the only way it could be done. I think the \nSenator at least deserves to have his case considered.\n  The current Senate rules do not completely bar outside profit by \nSenators, I should note. Many Senators now are writing books, and they \nare able to keep the royalties. There is an ethics exception, I \nbelieve, for teaching classes, and that is earned income. Yet that \nexception is made. Of course, if you are a Senator and you marry a \nperson with money or if you inherit money, that is fine. But if you \nhave an ability, a talent that you can offer, a service that you can \nprovide, even if you do it not for profit, no, you can't do that.\n  I am very concerned about what we are doing to ourselves. I practiced \nlaw. I looked at staying affiliated with a law firm. I think I could \nhave practiced estate law without running afoul of the ethics rules, \nbut you could not do that.\n  This is a narrow exception that I think is the fair way to allow this \nSenator to continue his practice without conflicting with the ethics \nrules or with his duties. This is a profession we need more of, I \nrepeat.\n  I hope my colleagues will seriously consider this modest exception to \nthe rules of the Senate. This is a Senator who wants to continue \nserving the medical needs of his constituents without earning a profit. \nThat is pretty magnanimous, it seems to me. I think we should do this. \nI think what we are doing to this Senator and the people he serves is \nwrong. At least he will have a vote, and I hope that maybe sometime \nlater we will consider this whole issue in a broader sense. But for \nnow, we should make this narrow exception, as the House of \nRepresentatives did in the past.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Do we want to alternate. How much time does the Senator desire? I \nyield 5 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I stand here in two \ncapacities: speaking as a Senator trying to find a compromise that \nwould be good for the institution and as a friend of Tom Coburn.\n  If I had any doubt about the effect this would have on the \ninstitution, I would not rise in support of my friend, because we all \nknow why we are here. We are here to make the country stronger and the \nSenate better. Having Tom Coburn here as a physician I think makes the \ncountry stronger and better.\n  It is not about him making money. All of us know Senator Coburn and \nwhat he does in Oklahoma. He is not practicing medicine to make money. \nHe is practicing medicine to stay in touch with his constituents, to \nprovide a vital service to rural Oklahoma, and to try to pay the bills. \nHe is doing it for all the right reasons.\n  You can, as Senator Lott said, have outside income. This is not about \noutside income. This is about trying to maintain the skills that are \nvery much in demand in Oklahoma and a relationship that I think will be \nbeneficial to the people he serves and the Senate as a whole.\n  The bottom line is, it worked in the House. They had the same debate \nin\n\n[[Page S13107]]\n\nthe House. They had a compromise where Senator Coburn could practice \nmedicine not for a profit but for the privilege of serving his \nconstituents in two ways: as a Representative and a doctor. It worked \nvery well. It was a win-win. It can be a win-win for the Senate. \nPhysicians who served in the Senate in the past have been allowed to \npractice.\n  Perception is important. We don't want to do anything in the Senate \non our watch that would give a perception that the body is not at its \nhighest level. And reality is important too. I think the reality of \nallowing Dr. Coburn to continue to practice in the Senate, such as he \ndid in the House, is extremely beneficial to real people who need a \ngood doctor who is competent at delivering medical care and who has a \ngreat heart for serving people. Those individuals need the Senate to \nunderstand they are affected, and whatever perception problems anybody \nis worried about, it did not hurt the House at all, and it is not going \nto hurt the Senate.\n  The reality is there are people counting on Dr. Coburn, and it would \nbe a shame for them to be denied medical care from a very good man.\n  From the Senate's point of view, I think it would be good for us to \nhave a commonsense view of what our role in society is, that we are not \na body that should be totally disconnected from everyday life. If you \ncan have a Member of the body serving in a very vital capacity that \nimproves everyday life, then we ought to let that happen. It would be a \nwin-win for the Senate, and it would be a win-win for the people of \nOklahoma.\n  I am here to say that Tom Coburn is not only a great Senator, he is a \ngreat doctor, and he practices medicine for all the right reasons. Any \nperception problem should not stand between him and the ability to \ndeliver a vital service. We are not reduced as a body by him taking \ncare of people in Oklahoma. I think we are enhanced.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I believe I manage the time in opposition \non this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Accordingly, I yield 20 minutes to the chairman of the \nEthics Committee, Senator Voinovich.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, first I would like to say I have a \ngreat deal of respect for Senator Coburn. I think he is acting from \nhonorable motives. I would remind Senators that our colleague, Senator \nFrist, is a doctor and is not asking for dispensation from the rule. He \ncontinues to practice without compensation on occasion.\n  I have been hopeful that working in a truly bipartisan manner with \nthe Ethics Committee, which I chair, the Rules Committee, our \nbipartisan leadership, and Senator Coburn, that we could come to an \nagreement which would address Senator Coburn's concerns.\n  While I would like to be able to detail the long history of the \nEthics Committee's work to find an accommodation with Senator Coburn to \neffectively address his concerns, in an effort to maintain the \nprivileged nature of the communications between the committee and the \nSenator, I must speak only in generalities.\n  Let me assure my colleagues that we have done everything that the \nSenate rules will allow us to do to help Senator Coburn in this matter. \nI can assure you that Senator Johnson and I have spent a great deal of \ntime, and the staff of the Ethics Committee as well, trying to \naccommodate Senator Coburn. Ultimately, we found ourselves in a \nsituation where we were asked to reinterpret what the Senate rules \nmeant or to endorse a change of those rules for Senator Coburn. As I \nwill soon detail, the specific language and legislative history of \nSenate Rules XXXVI and XXXVII and Federal law prevent us from \nreinterpreting the rules. With regard to changing the rules themselves, \nwe did not believe the Ethics Committee should be involved in the sole \njurisdiction of the Rules Committee.\n  As my colleagues know, the Rules Committee establishes the rules of \nthe Senate. The Ethics Committee is charged with enforcing those rules. \nThis matter should not be on the Senate floor. It should be before the \nRules Committee of the Senate.\n  Despite these realities and all the work to accommodate Senator \nCoburn over the past year, here we are considering a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution to clarify Senate Rule XXXVII in an effort to put \npressure on the Senate Ethics Committee to reinterpret what \n``compensation'' means. Unfortunately, this resolution has not been \napproved or considered by the Rules Committee. There have been no \nhearings on this matter in the Rules Committee. Nevertheless, here we \nare.\n  First, allow me to lay out the Senate rules which guided the Ethics \nCommittee's determination on the Coburn matter.\n  Senate Rule XXXVII prohibits Senators from, No. 1, affiliating with a \nfirm, partnership, association, or corporation for the purpose of \nproviding professional services for compensation; 2, permitting his or \nher name to be used by a firm, partnership, association, or corporation \nwhich provides professional services for compensation; and 3, \npracticing a profession for compensation to any extent during regular \noffice hours of the employing Senate office.\n  The Senate Ethics Manual, the meat the committee provides the Senate \nfor the bones of the Senate's rules, indicates on page 71 that Rule \nXXXVII ``prohibits the paid practice of fiduciary professions,'' which \nincludes the medical profession. On page 72, the manual indicates that \nthe rule applies to ``payment for professional services.'' This is \nimportant because it goes to the heart of why the committee determined \nthat Senator Coburn's proposal to allow him to receive reimbursement \nfor expense in lieu of compensation should not be approved.\n  Senator Coburn has publicly stated that the purpose behind his effort \ntoday is to allow him to receive reimbursement to cover the medical \nmalpractice costs associated with providing medical care. He believes \nthat in order to maintain his medical skills and licenses and in order \nto be a ``citizen legislator,'' he should be allowed to receive this \ncompensation.\n  Again, to be absolutely clear, as chairman of the Ethics Committee, \nmy job is to provide Senators guidance to help them comply with our \nrules. Our rules clearly state that payment of any kind for any purpose \nfor fiduciary work is prohibited. Rule XXXVII prohibits exactly what \nSenator Coburn is asking for today.\n  The Senate looked at this exact specific situation in 1977. Senator \nThurmond, with whom a good number of us had the opportunity to serve--\nand this is 1977--served as cochair with Senator Gaylord Nelson of the \nSpecial Committee on Official Conduct. This committee was charged with \ndeveloping the original Senate Code of Conduct upon which many of our \ncurrent Senate ethics rules are based. Senator Thurmond said on the \nSenate floor in 1977:\n\n       If [doctors] value their duties and they want to keep up, \n     they can visit hospitals and go out and participate, so long \n     as they do not do it for compensation.\n\n  Additionally, the Nelson committee report formed the basis for what \nis now Rule XXXVI and addresses the possibility of outside earned \nincome. Specifically, the report states:\n\n       During its deliberation on this Rule, the Committee was \n     aware of clear and unmistakable practical facts of political \n     life. For example, most Americans regard service in the \n     Senate as a full-time job.\n\n  And I can say that was 1977. This is 2005. I can say that I think it \nis more of a full-time job today than it was back in 1977.\n\n       Senators work long hours devoting a substantial amount of \n     not only their own time, but also time that they could be \n     with their families, attending to Senate business on behalf \n     of their constituents.\n\n  Consistent with these duties is the notion that since service in the \nSenate is a full-time job, considerable skepticism is often raised in \nthe minds of the public whenever outside earned income is received by a \nSenator because of personal services outside regular Senate duties.\n  Now, this is to be differentiated from other outside income like \nfarming because the personal services or fiduciary relationship is \nfundamentally different. A Senator engaged in farming is not put in the \nsituation where he or\n\n[[Page S13108]]\n\nshe would have to choose between tending to their fields or serving a \nconstituent. A doctor, who is in a fiduciary relationship, could face a \nsituation where he had to choose between constituents and providing \nmedical treatment for a patient. Writing a book is not a \nfiduciary relationship and would not interfere with a Senator's \nbusiness because he can pick it up and lay it down.\n\n  Not only do our own rules and history prevent the arrangement that \nSenator Coburn is asking for, but Federal law does as well. The Ethics \nReform Act of 1989, enshrined as paragraph 5(b) of Rule XXXVII, \nexplicitly prohibits Senators from entering into professional fiduciary \nrelationships. The rule, again based on the Ethics Reform Act, \nprohibits:\n\n       (1) receive compensation for affiliating with or being \n     employed by a firm, partnership, association, corporation, or \n     other entity which provides professional services involving a \n     fiduciary relationship.\n       (2) permit that Member's, officer's, or employee's name to \n     be used by any such firm, partnership, association, \n     corporation, or other entity.\n       (3) receive compensation for practicing a profession which \n     involves a fiduciary relationship.\n\n  There may be an argument made to the Senate today that the \n``compensation'' that Rules XXXVI and XXXVII and Ethics Reform Act \nrefer to is profit. We may hear that the resolution we are considering \nencourages the Ethics Committee to define compensation as money \nreceived for costs or that compensation should only apply to for-profit \nenterprises or that ``breaking even'' is not compensation. Well, allow \nme to share some facts for the Senate to consider on what \n``compensation'' means.\n  Section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code finds that gross income \nincludes ``compensation for services including fees, commissions, \nfringe benefits and similar items.''\n  The U.S. Court of Claims held in 1968 ``that the statutory definition \nof gross income is broad enough to include as compensation any economic \nor financial benefit from any source, conferred in any form on any \nemployee, unless specifically exempted by statute.''\n  Nowhere in the Internal Revenue Code or in our case law will one find \n``compensation'' defined as ``breaking even.''\n  Let me raise some other facts. The Federal Acquisition Regulation \ndefines compensation as ``all remuneration paid or accrued for services \nrendered by the employees to the contractor during the period of the \ncontract performance.''\n  Again, in contracts with the Federal Government, breaking even is not \nan option.\n  Finally, allow me to offer one more piece of information for my \ncolleagues to consider when the ``actual and necessary expense'' \nargument is made on behalf of this resolution. The Code of Federal \nRegulations, 5 CFR section 2636.303(b), states:\n\n       Outside earned income and compensation both mean wages, \n     salaries, honoraria, commission, professional fees and other \n     forms of compensation for services other than salary benefits \n     and allowances paid by the United States Government.\n\n  Again, the idea of defining compensation as profit is not considered \nin our Federal Code.\n  Finally, allow me to offer some thoughts on what changing the \ncommittee's interpretation of rules XXXVI and XXXVII, the Ethics Reform \nAct, the Internal Revenue Code, findings of the U.S. Court of Claims, \nand our Federal Code would mean.\n  Enforcement of this rule change will be impossible. The Ethics \nCommittee would need to hire a small army of auditors and accountants \nto effectively evaluate what expenses were actual and necessary as the \nresolution would allow. These accountants would need to have some \nspecific, specialized knowledge in the medical field to evaluate if the \nexpenses Senator Coburn had were ``actual and necessary.'' Frankly, the \ncommittee is not equipped to handle this responsibility. Moreover, I do \nnot believe that the committee should be asked to take this on.\n  The rule change would inevitably lead to violations. I can hardly \nenvision a scenario in which every procedure Dr. Coburn is involved \nwith is billed exactly at the actual and necessary expenses. While Dr. \nCoburn does have a degree in accounting, I believe that should he be \npermitted to practice medicine, his focus should be on his patients, \nnot on his accounts receivable. If his rates were to exceed or fall \nshort of his actual or necessary expenses, he would be in violation and \nsubject to an Ethics Committee violation. No one wants that.\n  The rule change would lead to other calls for changes from our \ncolleagues that are fraught with even more dangers. Why should we not \nprovide the same arrangement to our two colleagues who are \nveterinarians? Do they not need to continue their practices to maintain \ntheir skills and licenses? Is this not their chosen profession and one \nthat they may want to return to eventually? How long will it be before \none of the many excellent lawyers amongst us will ask to practice but \nonly receive actual and necessary expenses? If we decide today to allow \na colleague to pursue their profession and receive compensation to \ncover their expenses, how will the committee say no to other requests \nlike this? This is the slippery slope and one that I believe we \nmust carefully avoid.\n\n  Again, I am sorry this matter has come to the floor of the Senate. I \nbelieve Senator Coburn means well in his efforts today. He wants to \ncontinue his services as a doctor to help people. I applaud that \naltruistic commitment to public service. Rather than debating the \npossibility of reinterpreting our rules, we should be talking about a \nreal, practical solution that would allow Senator Coburn to continue \nserving people and to maintain his medical skills and licenses.\n  The committee has long indicated to Senators that they could provide \nmedical services to patients on a volunteer basis where no compensation \nis received, as the Senate majority leader does, and we are very \nfamiliar with it.\n  The committee has indicated to Senators, consistent with Senator \nThurmond's comments in 1977, that they can pursue a volunteer \nrelationship with a VA hospital in their home States or in Washington \nat Walter Reed or at the Bethesda Medical Center where no compensation \nis provided. I understand they have arrangements to cover the \nmalpractice insurance of doctors who operate there, so that malpractice \nproblem would not occur.\n  Unfortunately, instead of congratulating Senator Coburn for finding a \nsolution that will allow him to continue practicing, we are debating a \nSenate resolution to instruct the Senate Ethics Committee to ignore \nRules XXXVI and XXXVII, the Ethics Reform Act, and definitions of \ncompensation that are in Federal statute. We cannot do that.\n  With that, I urge my colleagues to reject this effort, and I raise a \npoint of order that the Coburn amendment is not germane to the \nunderlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order must be made at the \nconclusion of all debate.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I would ask the Chair to remind me of \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I lend my strong support for the amendment \noffered by Senator Lott. It is measured, it is common sense, and it \nwill help to allow Members of the Senate in the medical profession to \nfunction on a not-for-profit basis--I emphasize again, not-for-profit \nbasis.\n  Dr. Coburn is not fabulously wealthy. He needs to be able to break \neven. If one Member of the Senate is very wealthy and can afford to \ncarry out medical duties without adequate compensation for it, that is \nfine.\n  He is not seeking permission to shirk his Senate responsibilities in \nany way. I also appreciate the fact that he does not want to walk away \nfrom the medical profession. We need people with hands-on health care \nexperience. One of the greatest challenges we face in the coming years \nis health care costs and health care issues. Would it not be wonderful \nto have a person who has daily hands-on experience with these health \ncare issues, which is $40 trillion in unfunded liability in the case of \nMedicare?\n  He is not turning Senate rules on their head. Somebody is going to \nhave to explain to me how we can have a\n\n[[Page S13109]]\n\nblind trust and make money from a blind trust, but we cannot make money \nfrom a break-even standpoint in the practice of medicine.\n  It is bizarre. It is bizarre.\n  He has demonstrated he is more than a full-time legislator. He has \noffered dozens of amendments on bills in his first year in office, not \nmaking every Member of the Senate happy when he is doing so. No one can \nquestion his tenacity, his work ethic. As chairman of the Senate \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Federal \nFinancial Management, Senator Coburn has already held 20 oversight \nhearings.\n  I believe Senator Coburn can walk and chew gum. I believe he can \npractice medicine when he is back with his constituents in Oklahoma and \nserve that State even more admirably, serving them in more capabilities \nthan one. I wish I had the capabilities the doctor from Oklahoma has.\n  I hope there is an overwhelming vote in favor of the Lott motion.\n  I appreciate the courtesy of my colleagues.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask to address the body for 5 minutes \non this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today as vice chair of the Ethics \nCommittee to discuss the resolution being considered by the Senate. I \nsay at the outset that I have great respect for my colleague, Senator \nCoburn. The resolution before us seeks to provide a special carve-out \nfor the practice of medicine, and medicine only, from the current \nSenate rules limiting outside compensation and income.\n  The Senate rules that govern this issue and their interpretation do \nnot come at the whim of the Senate Rules or Senate Ethics Committees, \nbut from a longstanding determination and precedent of this body. In \nfact, this has been a part of the Senate rules since 1977, when the \noriginal Senate Code of Conduct was adopted.\n  The committee that was established to develop the Senate Code of \nConduct was known as the Nelson Committee, after its chairman, Senator \nGaylord Nelson, and specifically addressed the restrictions on Senators \npracticing fiduciary professions in its report by saying:\n\n       This provision reflects the committee's belief that the \n     practice of a profession usually requires substantial amounts \n     of personal involvement and time, and may also present \n     conflicts of interest or in some cases the appearance of such \n     conflicts.\n\n  During the Senate debate in 1977 on these rules, Senator Strom \nThurmond delivered a strong statement on the purpose and the intent \nbehind including the prohibition on Members of the Senate from \ncontinuing to practice and being compensated for outside professional \nwork. He said:\n\n       The job of a U.S. Senator is a full-time job, and if one is \n     able to find time to render professional services for \n     compensation, I seriously question his ability to render the \n     commensurate service necessary to be a full-time Senator.\n\n  At that time, the Nelson Committee and the Senate recognized the \npitfalls of allowing Members to receive income or compensation for \noutside professional work. Those pitfalls still exist today.\n  First, the proposal before the Senate would create a net profit \nstandard in conjunction with medical professionals accepting outside \ncompensation. It is my understanding this would allow physicians to \naccept payments for services from such sources as individuals, \ninsurance companies, or even Medicare and Medicaid, up to the point at \nwhich all of their expenses have been covered.\n  A major concern I have about this proposal is it does not contain any \ndirection as to how compliance with this net profit standard would be \nmonitored to ensure that the instant all expenses were covered, the \ncompensation would be ended. Without a clear ability to monitor \ncompliance, the potential for violations, abuse of the system, or even \nmistakes that would affect the credibility of this Senate is very high.\n  I question whether the Ethics Committee has, or in fact whether it \nshould have, the resources that would be required to properly analyze \nthe complex accounting needed to ensure compliance with this net profit \nstandard.\n  Furthermore, at this time I simply do not believe the Senate should \nvote in favor of any proposal that would loosen our ethical boundaries \nand increase the opportunities for ethical violations.\n  The resolution also does not provide any limitations on the outside \npractice of medicine. It appears that under this resolution, a Senator \ncould spend a majority, if not all, of his or her time practicing \nmedicine, to the detriment of the Senate, and without any recourse for \nthe Senate.\n  As stated before, the Senate has determined our responsibilities are \nfull-time. If the proposal before us is adopted, it will set up a \nconflict between constituents and a Senator's outside medical \nresponsibilities for which he or she is being compensated.\n  The question has been raised about whether this carve-out ought to \napply only to the medical profession. The fact is there are other \nprofessionals in this body of great skill--lawyers, engineers, business \npeople, people of other professions. The fact is each and every one of \nthem could practice their professions outside their service in the \nSenate, and without that practice, their skills, indeed, do erode as \nwell. There are lawyers here whose membership in the bar is retained \nbut whose skills certainly do erode over time. That is true of every \nprofession. There is no profession, I believe, that is immune from or \nmore prone to profit motives, and I do not think that any profession \ncan be singled out in that regard.\n  I am not completely insensitive to the motivations behind the \nresolution, but I remind my colleagues that there is nothing in the \nSenate Rules that forbids a physician in the Senate from practicing \nmedicine, as the Senate leader, Senator Frist, oftentimes does. The \nargument here is not that doctors who serve in the Senate should never \nbe allowed to practice medicine. The rules allow doctors serving in the \nSenate to practice medicine for free. The argument is that no Senator \nshould practice a profession of any kind and receive outside \ncompensation, no matter what the expenses of that particular profession \nmight be.\n\n  If there is going to be a change, then the proper place for that \nchange is through the Rules Committee and the ordinary process where \nhearings can be held and thoughtful deliberation can be had, and the \nparliamentary rules of this body would apply. It would be a mistake and \nan unfortunate precedent for this body to permit an end run around the \nRules Committee in order to avoid the supermajority vote that \nordinarily would be required to change the rules during the middle of a \ncongressional session.\n  I do not believe we should take a step today to weaken the Senate \nrules, and I encourage my colleagues to oppose this resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, a vote for this amendment is a vote to \nrestore the original purpose of an ethics rule. It was a rule developed \nto keep special interests from unduly influencing Members of the Senate \nby forbidding us from receiving outside income while serving here, on \neither side of the Congress. But, as the Government often does, we seem \nto have forgotten the original purpose of this rule and are now \nfocusing on a technical interpretation. We are asking for some common \nsense.\n  The patients of a doctor delivering babies, many times a poor \nMedicaid mother, are not going to influence the votes of Members of the \nSenate. Senator Lott has mentioned a number of exceptions that already \noccur. The House, acting on the same rule, decided to allow Dr. Coburn \nto continue to deliver babies because of the benefit to this \ninstitution as well as the benefit to his patients.\n  Senator Lott mentioned other exceptions we already make for each \nother. We can receive millions from a book. But even more important, \nevery Member of this Senate receives compensation every time we travel \nto speak to a group in different parts of this country. It is \ncompensation only to cover expenses, but it is still compensation. And \nmany Members of this Senate are still involved with businesses and take \npassive income and help to make some management decisions. It is \ncompensation, but it is not direct compensation.\n\n[[Page S13110]]\n\n  Senator Coburn's situation is very similar. He is providing an \nimportant service, often to poor mothers, and he does not want to make \na profit, only to cover his expenses. My appeal to my colleagues \ntonight is to remember the purpose of these ethics rules.\n  These women are not going to influence votes. The only time he spends \nis when we are not in session here.\n  Let's straighten out one other thing, if we could. This amendment is \nnot to help Dr. Coburn. It is about allowing him to help others, which \nis what he is doing on the weekends. He is not making any profit from \ndoing this. He is serving others as he has done for years. But it is \nalso about helping us, as an institution, to keep contact with people \nin the real world and the problems they have--on his own time.\n  I encourage my fellow colleagues to remember the purpose, to use some \ncommon sense, and to allow Dr. Coburn to continue to serve his \nconstituents in ways that many of us are often doing in different ways.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nDodd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me begin by saying these are the sorts \nof uncomfortable moments in the Senate when we start to deal with each \nother on a personal level. I have been in this body for 24 years and I \ntake no comfort in engaging in this kind of discussion. But as the \nranking Democrat on the Rules Committee, serving with my friend and \ncolleague from Mississippi, Trent Lott, as the chairman of the \ncommittee, I felt it was important to at least express to my colleagues \nhere the position this Senator has as a member of that committee and as \na former chairman of the Rules Committee.\n  Very simply stated, as a matter of process--putting aside for a \nsecond the arguments on behalf of our colleague from Oklahoma and his \nnoble determination and desire to continue the profession in which he \nhas been engaged for years--there is a means by which we go through \nchanges in the rules in this body. We have established that process for \norderly reasons. What is being suggested here by this amendment is a \nchange in the rules of the Senate, and there is a committee established \nby this body to consider such proposals.\n  There is nothing in the rules of the Senate which prohibits any \nMember of this body from engaging in the practice of a profession, \nexcept as constrained by Rules XXXVI and XXXVII. As the Senator from \nOhio has pointed out, what is being suggested here is that a member be \nallowed to earn some level of compensation in order to defray certain \nexpenses. That would require a modification of Rule XXXVI and/or \nXXXVII.\n  There is a way of doing that and the way is, you come to the Rules \nCommittee, you have a hearing, you listen to witnesses. A person can \nmake a suggestion to modify the rules. We do that all the time. If the \nRules Committee decides in its wisdom it believes the rules ought to be \nmodified or changed, then we recommend that change to this body as a \nwhole and we move forward and accommodate a request such as the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma is making. But to bypass all of that process, even if you \nbelieve strongly that what the Senator from Oklahoma is suggesting he \nought to be allowed to do, we ought to be following the process here. \nYou would be setting a precedent, even if you agree with my colleague \nfrom Oklahoma and what he suggests here.\n  There is a way by which you do things here. When you begin to \nsidestep and short circuit the process, then you put the entire process \nin jeopardy. I begin by stating that to my colleagues. Even if you feel \nstrongly--and I say I know many of my colleagues do, and I have \nlistened to the remarks over the last several minutes in support of \nSenator Coburn's request--there is a process which we should go through \nto achieve that end. I urge the body, if for no other reason than that, \nto support the motion that will be made by the Senator from Ohio.\n  Then if the Senator desires to go forward with this, I certainly \nwould be willing--I say this to my colleagues here; my colleague from \nMississippi is not here--but if he wants to have a hearing on this \nmatter, I will attend the hearing. I will attend all the hearings on it \nand listen to witnesses come forward and then consider the proposed \nchange in the rules. If that is what we want to do, we ought to do that \nprocess. But I am uneasy about bypassing that process.\n  As I said earlier, there is nothing in the Senate Rules that \nprecludes a Member of this body from practicing a profession while in \npublic service. But that practice is limited by Rules XXXVI and XXXVII \nand limitations on compensation earned in a fiduciary relationship. The \nhistory of these provisions shows that they are designed to ensure the \nmembership in a profession does not so impose on the responsibilities \nof a Senator as to effectively render the Member a part-time public \nservant.\n  Again, there are circumstances which could be pointed out which I am \nsure would cause us to consider some changes in all this, but there is \na process to go through. When the Founding Fathers envisioned citizen \nlegislators some more than 200 years ago, they did not envision the \nkind of world we live in today and a Congress, today, that meets not \nonly year round but often throughout the day, well into the night. \nWitness this evening. We are likely going to be here until 10 or 11 \no'clock tonight debating these amendments on the reconciliation bill. \nWe may be here tomorrow and Saturday and Sunday.\n  Certainly, the Founding Fathers had times when that occurred but not \nwith the regularity that we engage in these practices. My colleague, \nthe chairman of the Rules Committee, whom I have referenced already, \nsuggests that Senator Coburn will not fly home and deliver babies when \nthere are votes.\n  I can personally bear witness to this--I am sure my colleague from \nOklahoma will verify this--that babies don't normally set their time \nfor delivery based on the Senate schedule. I can say as the father of \ntwo new recent arrivals that they decided to arrive not during the \nSenate schedule; they had their own schedule for arrival. Even though \nwe may try to accommodate our colleagues in these areas, it doesn't \nnormally occur on any sort of predictable pattern. It is not elective \nsurgery, in most cases.\n  Moreover, while I am sympathetic to the concerns that physicians \nshould maintain their skills. In fact, I relish the fact that we have \nSenator Coburn here as a physician, along with Senator Frist and the \ntwo Members before our body who are veterinarians, who add, I think, to \nthe discussion and debate. It adds a dimension to our deliberations. \nBut again, we have four Members of this body who practice medicine--two \nwho practice the human variety and two who practice the animal variety. \nI respect them immensely and enjoy speaking to them about their \nprofession. But if we begin this process, what argument is there in \nresponse to my colleagues here who practice veterinary medicine? Should \nthey no be able to seek to cover their costs? What about those who like \nto maintain their skill level as attorneys, engineers, or otherwise?\n  We decided to put some parameters around this. Again, there is a \nprocess we can go through if we decide that we want to change it. It is \nnot in any way to try to impugn the reputation or the contribution of \nMembers. But to suggest that in this 21st century, we ought to begin to \nstart compromising these rules in order to accommodate Members who wish \nto go back and practice their profession and to receive compensation, \nwhich is a critical element here, on their own time I think would be a \nstep in the wrong direction. We have come some distance over the years.\n  In the previous century, there were Members of this body who would go \ndown on the first floor and try cases before the Supreme Court and then \ncome back up here to vote on the very bills that might have changed the \nlaw.\n  There was a wonderful Senator from New York, Chauncey Depew. He was \nthe president of the New York Central Railroad while a Member of this \nbody and never had a second thought about voting on railroad matters \naffecting the compensation of the company he was running. But, of \ncourse, the world has changed. I believe we are far better\n\n[[Page S13111]]\n\noff today because we moved away from that kind of practice in the past.\n  I am not suggesting that my colleague from Oklahoma is suggesting \nanything like the behavior that we saw in previous centuries. But, \nnonetheless, we have established some parameters. Again, that is the \nreason we have a process here by which we make modifications.\n  The provisions in the rules are not biblical, they are not etched in \nmarble or granite. They can be changed. But I suggest that if we are \ngoing to change them, we ought to go through the normal process of \ndoing that. Taking up what is essentially a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution on the tax reconciliation bill is not the way to go.\n  Again, I say to my friend, we don't know each other terribly well. We \nhaven't engaged in much business together, and I don't want the Senator \nto perceive what I am saying as disrespectful of his intent--I am not \ncomfortable with these debates. My colleagues have known me over the \npast quarter of a century, and they know I try to stay away from these \nmatters. It does begin to reflect or suggest somehow our feelings about \none another. I don't want anything I have said here to suggest any \nnegative feelings about my colleague because we disagree in the way at \nwhich we have arrived at this debate. This is really not an Ethics \nCommittee matter. It is a Rules Committee matter, and that is where it \nbelongs. We ought to consider it there and some of the questions and \nimplications raised in this debate and then come forward. It may be \nthat a majority of the Rules Committee will say the rule ought to be \nmodified or changed. If that is the wisdom, then we come to the body, \nand have an informed debate. But we ought to be careful about trying to \nshort circuit that process.\n  I am going to support the motion by the Senator from Ohio. I urge my \ncolleagues to do so--not in any way to impugn the motives of the \nSenator from Oklahoma but to protect the process of the Senate.\n  With all due respect, that is a much larger question, it seems to me, \nthan the ambition or desires of any one Member of this body. We bear \nresponsibility to be good caretakers of this institution and to see to \nit that we preserve and protect the way in which we conduct ourselves. \nIf we wish to change the means by which we do that, there is a process \nwe should follow in doing so. Again, to bypass that process by bringing \nit directly to the floor I believe does potential damage to this \ninstitution that none of us should want to be party to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nNevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, will you notify me when I have used 2 \nminutes? I will try to keep this within 2 minutes. I wish to make a \ncouple of points.\n  I am a licensed veterinarian and am still currently licensed. When I \nwas first elected to the Senate, when we were going through the ethics \nroutine very similar to what they have in the House of Representatives, \nI still owned an animal hospital when I was in the House of \nRepresentatives. I never really gave it much thought because I heard \nyou can own a small business. That is what it was--a small business. \nBut as I was listening to the ethics briefings when I was elected to \nthe Senate, I said: I don't think I can own my animal hospital. I don't \nthink I can be partners anymore in the animal hospital.\n  What I liked about owning my animal hospital was that I thought it \nkept me in touch with the real world; that we passed the Congressional \nAccountability Act because Congress was so out of touch with the laws \nthat we passed up here for the real world. We were so out of touch, we \nsaid at least we should live under the same laws in our offices as they \nlive out in the real world. I thought my veterinary practice allowed me \nto stay in touch with the real world much better.\n  But I went to the Senate Ethics Committee and asked them about it, \nand they said, sure enough, you are going to have to sell the animal \nhospital. That wasn't something that I counted on when I was elected.\n  I spoke to Don Nickles when it was all done, and he said he thought \nit was a disservice and that I should have fought it at the time, that \nI should have fought for a rule change back then.\n  I apologize to Dr. Coburn for not fighting for a rule change back \nthen. I don't think Dr. Coburn wants to go as far as he actually should \nbe able to go or I should have been able to go. All he wants to do is \nbreak even because of the high cost of medical malpractice today and to \nbe able to make enough money to be able to pay his premiums and stay in \ntouch with his patients and practice medicine. Health care costs in \nthis country are skyrocketing, and we need people who understand the \npractice of medicine and our health care system in the United States.\n  I wholeheartedly support the Senator from Oklahoma in his efforts to \ndo this. This is not the same as practicing law where you have somebody \ncome down and lay down a retainer of $100,000 or $200,000 with the look \nof corruption that we may be trying to avoid. The practice of \nveterinary medicine isn't like that, and the practice of human medicine \nis not like that. This is somebody who will be a much better Senator if \nwe allow him to practice; somebody who is going to be a better doctor. \nHe is not going to be here forever, and we want him to keep his skills \nup because when he goes back to the practice of full-time medicine, he \nwill still stay solvent.\n  As we go forward in the debate, I hope people keep this in mind: \nLet's us put some common sense back in here. He is one of most ethical \npeople I have ever met in my life, and to allow him to practice will \nmake this institution a better institution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I may want to ask for a couple more minutes.\n  First of all, let me state to the junior Senator from Oklahoma that I \nwas not aware of this debate coming up. However, I don't have to \npractice for a debate; it comes from the heart.\n  Let me also say to one of my best friends in the Senate, Senator \nVoinovich, that he is doing his job. We may come to a different \nconclusion on this particular issue, but I know he is in a real \nsituation. You have shared that with several of us.\n  Let me suggest to you, Mr. President, that there is something sadly \nlacking in this debate; that is, in the State of Oklahoma. There are \nonly two of us in the Chamber from Oklahoma. We know what Oklahomans \nwant. It is kind of interesting because Senator Coburn and I have kind \nof the same philosophy--we want to keep it the same place. We have \ndifferent styles when we talk about trying to reduce the size of \ngovernment. He talks about projects, and I talk about reducing \nappropriations. We both want to get to the same place. He has been an \nadvocate and has talked about term limitation. I believe that everyone, \nif they don't want to go along with term limitations, ought to have to \ngo out like I did and serve in the real world for 30 years, get beat up \nby the bureaucracy, and then you can come here and speak from the heart \nas a citizen back home.\n  But when you look at our State of Oklahoma--and I read this section \nout of the U.S. Constitution, article I, section 4, which says the \ntime, places, and manner of holding elections for the U.S. Senate \npreside in each State. That is what it says. That is what the Founding \nFathers said--that we should make that determination from our own \nStates. So here we are from the State of Oklahoma. We made the \ndecision. And I have to say this: I know what people in Oklahoma want.\n  One other thing Senator Coburn and I have in common is we go back \nevery weekend. He may deliver a few babies while he is back there. But \nI would suggest to you, ask the question. A lot of people stay here in \nWashington all the time. Would you rather have your U.S. Senator \nstaying in Washington and playing golf all weekend or going back to the \nState from which he came? We made a decision to go back.\n  I have to say also that I have a bigger dog in this fight than most \npeople think. I had the honor of going out many years ago and \nrecruiting this\n\n[[Page S13112]]\n\nbright young doctor to run for the U.S. House of Representatives. And \nhe did. He came in and agreed to do that. He got an exception to allow \nhim to work hard and still keep up his practice. He did that very \nsuccessfully.\n  I have to say this: When the Senator from Connecticut referred to a \npart-time Senator, which we hear now and then, let me tell you that \nthere is no part-time Senator in Senator Coburn. I know this because we \ngo back every weekend. I go around the State. I know what people want. \nThe State of Oklahoma is not a Republican State or a Democrat State, it \nis a swing State. For him to come along and get in the race late--he \ngot in the race so late for the U.S. Senate that I was already \nsupporting another Republican. But when he got in and worked hard and \nwent out, he won by 12 points. It wasn't a squeaker it was a landslide. \nAnd he was outspent by the other side.\n  This is what we think in Oklahoma about Tom Coburn.\n  You can talk all you want to about the rules in the Senate, but I can \ntell you right now that the Constitution is right when they say in \narticle I, section 4, that the times, places, and manner of holding \nelections for the State for the office of Senator is within the State.\n  I am here on behalf the State of Oklahoma, unlike anyone else who has \nspoken saying this is the right thing to do to carve out this \nexception, if you want to call it that, for Senator Coburn, he is a \nhard-working Senator, and he is doing what we in Oklahoma want him to \ndo.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \nSenator from Oklahoma, Dr. Coburn.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will consume what time I may and then \nask for the remaining time when I finish.\n  The first thing I would like to say is I hold no ill will toward \nanybody who opposed me on this whatsoever. The Members here understand \nwhat their role is, and I understand what mine is. But I also \nunderstand that one of the things our country needs is citizen-based \nlegislators. That is what I was in the House.\n  During my time in the House of Representatives, nobody ever accused \nme of being anything other than the most hard-working there. I \ndelivered 400 babies in 6 years while I was in the House. I never \nmissed a vote during those times. I might have missed votes associated \nwith the airlines or committee meetings, but I never missed a vote. I \ncampaigned on the fact that I was going to be term limited. I am a \nterm-limited Senator. The most I will be here is 12 years, and maybe \nnot more than 6.\n  But the point is: Why would I want to practice medicine? I want to \npractice medicine so I can be involved in what real people experience \nevery day in this country. We don't get to see that enough. We don't \nget to see that at townhall meetings when we give speeches. But I will \ntell you that sitting in the middle of a patient's room when there is \nconflict in a family or death and dying or a new complication \nassociated with an old disease and lives get impacted, I get to measure \nand I get to see what none of you get to see--what we do and how it \naffects people.\n  I want to practice medicine to be the best Senator I can be. I want \nto maintain my skills so I can go back and deliver babies. There is \nnothing better in the world than delivering a baby. It is a \nreaffirmation of why we are all here. It is a reaffirmation of life.\n  I will tell you that we need to think long and hard about our ethics \nrules. We have shot ourselves in the foot. Every Member in the Senate \nis ethical and wants the same thing for our country as I do--a bright \nand golden future, security and opportunity for our kids. But our \nethics rules lack common sense.\n\n  I will address one particular statement. This word is all about \ncompensation. Arbitrarily, the decision was made by the Ethics \nCommittee to define ``compensation'' as any compensation. I will read \nwhat 5 CFR 26236-303(b)6 of the U.S. Government Office of Ethics for \nthe rest of the Government says.\n\n       Compensation in this aspect is net compensation.\n\n  This could have very well been solved by the Ethics Committee in a \nbroad and consistent and commonsense interpretation of the word \n``compensation,'' but they chose not to do that. I don't know why. I am \ndisappointed and hurt.\n  I was not allowed to come before the Ethics Committee. I was not \nallowed to present my case. I was not allowed to discuss with any \nEthics member my issue, to explain the basis of why I wanted to do it, \nand where I thought their interpretation was wrong. I had to secure \nlegal counsel to have any communication with the Ethics Committee. I \nwas notified by the Ethics Committee before I was ever sworn in that \nthey had made this decision even though they lacked or asked for no \ninput from me on my situation.\n  If that is the pattern under which we operate the Ethics Committee, \nwe have real problems. I don't blame that on the chairman of the Ethics \nCommittee or the ranking member. It is a problem we see in lots of \nother areas of Government, that staff tend to drive things. People who \ndo not have the ultimate responsibility take the ultimate \nresponsibility.\n  What I want to do is very simple: I want to be a great Senator. I \nwant to contribute. I know I can contribute in ways that I would not be \nable to contribute by being a doctor and continuing the practice.\n  The question of Senator Frist: Senator Frist has a wonderful \narrangement. It is not available to me. He has a limited number of days \nthat he has a malpractice firm, insurance firm, that will insure him. \nThat is not available in the practice of obstetrics in Oklahoma. It is \nnot available to me, period. If I could do that, I would practice just \nas Senator Frist. But I don't have that available to me, so I have \nexpenses four to five times what Senator Frist would pay for the same \ntype of insurance. Could I secure that, I would be happy to do it.\n  The other thing we ought to talk about is the history of the Senate. \nWe had reference to the rule change in 1977. There were no doctors in \nthe Senate then. Senator Strom Thurmond's words, in adding physicians, \nwas because he was trying to kill it. He was not trying to put \nphysicians on there--and it backfired on him. That was his own rules. \nIf you read his history of what happened in 1977, his attempt was to \nexclude many of us by adding doctors in the hopes that the Senate would \nturn that around.\n  Some history on the Senate: There have been 37 doctors who have been \nin the Senate. Senator Frist and myself are the last two. Every doctor \nwho was a practicing doctor who came to the Senate prior to Dr. Frist \npracticed, received payment and acted in an ethical fashion while they \nwere here.\n  It is not about money. It is about the ability to practice. I know \nnot all Senators share my zeal for citizen-based legislators. There is \na real difference. To the people of Oklahoma, when I campaigned, I made \nthree promises to them: One, I would guarantee I would not be here for \na long time; No. 2, I would continue to practice; and No. 3 is that I \nwould work hard to solve the problems of the country before I tried to \nsolve the problems of Oklahoma.\n  I put the priorities out there. Oklahomans believe in that. Not \nnecessarily all the editorial writers, not the talking heads, but the \npeople who voted for me, every one of them knew I planned on continuing \nto practice medicine.\n  It is also important to look at the confluence of the rules we have, \nthe rules that say I could own a business and not directly direct it \nbut indirectly direct it and have no limitation on my income whatever. \nI can farm, own a farm, collect government subsidies, with no limit \nwhatever. I can write books. I can write music. I can counsel. I can \nadvise. There is no limitation on us, except if you are a professional \nthat has a fiduciary responsibility.\n  The question ought to be what was behind the meaning of the rules. Do \nyou think the intention was not to have a doctor practice medicine? \nThat wasn't their intention. The fact that the malpractice crisis has \ncreated such a situation where you cannot practice for under $100,000 a \nyear in terms of your expenses and overhead associated with that was \nnever thought about in 1977.\n  I understand there is going to be a motion, a point of order raised \nagainst this. I understand that. That is a high bar for any Member to \nchange anything around here with 60 votes. I understand the feelings \nand the reasoning\n\n[[Page S13113]]\n\nbehind the Ethics Committee on why they want to do that. And I \nunderstand their motivation and their thinking. But I make one point to \nmy Senate colleagues: There has not been one subcommittee that has had \nmore subcommittee hearings than I have. As a matter of fact, there is \nnot one subcommittee that has had half as many subcommittee hearings as \nI have. I have missed one vote in the entire year. I practice medicine \non Saturdays, on the weekends, and from 6 to 9 a.m. on Mondays. I catch \nmy flight, and I am here for votes. My practicing of medicine does not \ninterfere with my Senate duties. It enhances my Senate duties.\n  If we don't change our rules, I will live with whatever the Senate \nsays. I will figure out a way to practice medicine in some way that \naccords me to try to keep my skill and try to do that within the \nethical guidelines of the Senate. But I believe we are discouraging \nanybody else who is a physician to run for the Senate, No. 1. No. 2, we \ndiscourage other professionals to run for the Senate. And it would be \nmy hope that you would think about the long-term consequences of what \nwe are doing. This does no damage to the Senate. In fact, it will \nenhance the Senate.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, is there time on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield whatever time the Senator would appreciate \nhaving.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I haven't known Senator Coburn very long. I \ndidn't know him when he served in the House. During his tenure in the \nSenate I found him to be a most gracious person. I like him.\n  I had the good fortune of having served for many years on the Ethics \nCommittee. I am sure there may have been a person or two in the past \nwho served longer than I have, I just don't know, though, who they \nwere. One of the most important responsibilities I have, and I think \nSenator Frist has, is putting people on the Ethics Committee. There are \nsix Senators on the Ethics Committee, three Democrats and three \nRepublicans. It ia a very difficult job. The ethics code is large and \nvoluminous. They have an outstanding staff.\n  Senator Voinovich and Senator Johnson are the two leaders of that \ncommittee and work with the other four members. Having been there, I \nwant everyone here to know they spend hours and hours each week of \ntheir time. What do they do? They protect us. They handle complaints \nthat come from the public. They handle complaints that come from other \nsources. Their job is very difficult.\n  In the past few weeks--certainly, I will not disclose any names; I \ncould not do that, it would be unethical to do so--they have resolved \nsome very big cases in the Ethics Committee.\n  These six Senators deserve our support. If we are going to overrule \nthe Ethics Committee, we might just as well get rid of the Ethics \nCommittee. That would be a terrible disaster for this institution.\n  When I first came here from the House of Representatives I had a law \npractice at home. I went home and had the ability to practice law. I \ndon't think that was good for the institution.\n  We now make far more than our constituents make. We make $165,000 a \nyear, or thereabouts. That is a lot of money. It is a full-time job to \nbe a Member of the Senate, to be a Member of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I know Senator Coburn is a nice man. I know he has a big heart. But \nhe is going to have to, I believe, use that big heart and the medical \nskills he has in keeping with the rules of the Senate and not, in \neffect, thwart what the Ethics Committee has told us must happen.\n  If this passes, it would tremendously undermine the work the Ethics \nCommittee does. And speaking from experience, it is a very difficult, \nand quite frankly, a thankless job. The only thing you get from that is \nthe knowledge that you are doing the right thing for the institution. \nIt takes a tremendous amount of time. I repeat: Senators Johnson and \nVoinovich, every week we are back here, spend not a few minutes but \nhours of their time. No one knows what they do because it is secret. It \nis confidential.\n  No matter how we feel about Senator Coburn, no matter what a \ngracious, nice, thoughtful, caring man he is, it would not be good for \nthe Senate to follow what has been recommended in the form of this \namendment that is now before this Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I take whatever time I might consume.\n  The real difference for my colleagues to know is the definition of \nthe word ``compensation.'' The same lawyer that is on the Senate Ethics \nCommittee today worked for the Senate Ethics Committee in the House \nwhen the determination was made for the practice of medicine that \ncompensation was net compensation.\n  There is no damage done to the House or the institution of the House. \nAs a matter of fact, because that rule was changed, there are now, I \nbelieve, 11 doctors in the House. I reject the idea that this would do \ndamage to the Ethics Committee. This is a simple definition. It is one \nthat the Ethics Committee could have chosen to use but chose not to. I \ndon't know the motivation behind that. I know they could have solved \nthe problem, and we wouldn't be where we are today.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2647\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside, and I send an amendment to the desk that has \nbeen cleared by both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] for himself and Mr. \n     Baucus proposes an amendment numbered 2647.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, this is an amendment sponsored by \nSenator Baucus and me. It remedies two matters in the bill. The most \nimportant one makes the amendment hold harmless, a pure hold-harmless \namendment. The amendment also clarifies that Government contractors \nwill receive the research and development credit. This amendment is \nfully offset.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is very important. It helps \ntremendously to improve some provisions in the underlying bill so no \none else has to pay AMT; and, second, R provisions, enhanced R and \ncontractors are not excluded. I support this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2647) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2633\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think we are ready to wrap up debate on \nthe pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I will clarify again for my colleagues \nthe fact that the Ethics Committee genuinely tried to accommodate the \nconcerns of the Senator from Oklahoma. We, as I say, worked hard to do \nit. But the fact is, the rule is clear on its face, and we are being \nasked to reinterpret what the Senate rules mean or to endorse a change \nin those rules for Senator Coburn.\n  I think the specific language and legislative history of the rules \nand the Federal law prevent us from reinterpreting the rules. I \nbelieve, as I mentioned when I started my remarks earlier, this matter \nshould not be here being debated on the floor of the Senate but, \nrather, as Senator Dodd suggested, Senator Coburn should go before the \nRules Committee. And if Senator Ensign is unhappy that he cannot \npractice veterinary medicine, perhaps he should go before the Rules \nCommittee and have a hearing and discuss this matter, and do it \naccording to the procedures of the Senate.\n  If this were to pass today, I think it would set a very dangerous \nprecedent that would encourage people--rather than going through the \nprocess of the rules and procedures we have here in the Senate, it \nwould cause them to come to the floor. I do not think that is good for \nthe institution. I ask my colleagues to not support this resolution.\n  Mr. President, at this time I raise a point of order that the Coburn \namendment is not germane to the underlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is time remaining on the amendment.\n  Mr. COBURN. I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, a little bit out of order here, but under \nthe previous order, Senator Santorum and Senator Byrd were to speak \nafter the disposition of the pending amendment. At this point I have \nlearned Senator Santorum and Senator Byrd wish to speak at a later \npoint.\n  I ask consent that the pending amendments be laid aside so Senator \nFeingold may offer his amendment, that is, after the disposition of \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back the remainder of \nhis time on the Coburn amendment?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the manager of the bill will yield, \nprocedurally, do we have any other amendments pending that votes need \nto----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time must be yielded back on the pending \namendment, the Coburn amendment.\n  Mr. REID. If, in fact, the time were yielded back, what would be the \nfirst vote in sequence?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A sequence has not been established.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time have we locked in under the \nunanimous consent agreement that is now before the Senate as to time \nthat has been allocated? Senator Feingold has 30 minutes; is that \nright?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Santorum has 15 minutes; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Is there any other time allocated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Byrd for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding Senator Byrd has indicated he will \nnot be giving his remarks.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, that leaves not a lot of time for others who \nwant to come and debate their amendments. So if anyone wants to come \nand debate their amendments, I am not sure if Senator Feingold will use \nall of his time or if Senator Santorum will use all of his time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Senator Sununu wants a couple minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Sununu wants a couple minutes.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, if I may make a point through the Chair to \nthe minority leader, I would seek 2 minutes to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Not now.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the first vote \nto occur in this long stack of amendments be in relation to the Coburn \namendment, and that the two managers will determine the sequence of \nvotes following that vote, and that Senator Bingaman be given 5 \nminutes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent to be added \nto that list for 2 minutes to offer an amendment at the end of that \nlist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is after Senator Feingold's amendment? \nAfter that?\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. OK, fine.\n  Mr. REID. I accept the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I might also say that means as to the list \nof Senators who come to me and say they want to speak on their \namendments, I have said to them they could, but there will be a short \nperiod in which to speak, and they will have to come down here and \nspeak some time before 7:30, if they want any time to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time has expired on the \nCoburn amendment.\n  Is there a point of order made?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. A point of order was made.\n  Mr. COBURN. And a motion to waive, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, was the unanimous consent request approved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Did the Senator indicate a time for the first \nvote?\n  Mr. REID. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The first vote would be at 7:30.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 7:30. And all votes, the managers agree, \nshould be 10-minute votes?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. After the first vote.\n  Mr. REID. After the first vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S13115]]\n\n  Mr. REID. And that we use the standard rule around here with 2 \nminutes equally divided on each amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all pending \namendments be set aside so that the Senator from Wisconsin can offer \nhis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. So the unanimous consent request was approved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was approved.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2650\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, Mr. \n     Conrad, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Obama, and Mr. Salazar, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2650.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To fully reinstate the pay-as-you-go requirement through \n                                 2010)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PAY-AS-YOU-GO POINT OF ORDER IN THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Point of Order.--\n       (1) In general.--It shall not be in order in the Senate to \n     consider any direct spending or revenue legislation that \n     would increase the on-budget deficit or cause an on-budget \n     deficit for any 1 of the 3 applicable time periods as \n     measured in paragraphs (5) and (6).\n       (2) Applicable time periods.--For purposes of this \n     subsection, the term ``applicable time period'' means any 1 \n     of the 3 following periods:\n       (A) The first year covered by the most recently adopted \n     concurrent resolution on the budget.\n       (B) The period of the first 5 fiscal years covered by the \n     most recently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget.\n       (C) The period of the 5 fiscal years following the first 5 \n     fiscal years covered in the most recently adopted concurrent \n     resolution on the budget.\n       (3) Direct-spending legislation.--For purposes of this \n     subsection and except as provided in paragraph (4), the term \n     ``direct-spending legislation'' means any bill, joint \n     resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that \n     affects direct spending as that term is defined by, and \n     interpreted for purposes of, the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n       (4) Exclusion.--For purposes of this subsection, the terms \n     ``direct-spending legislation'' and ``revenue legislation'' \n     do not include--\n       (A) any concurrent resolution on the budget; or\n       (B) any provision of legislation that affects the full \n     funding of, and continuation of, the deposit insurance \n     guarantee commitment in effect on the date of enactment of \n     the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990.\n       (5) Baseline.--Estimates prepared pursuant to this section \n     shall--\n       (A) use the baseline surplus or deficit used for the most \n     recently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget; and\n       (B) be calculated under the requirements of subsections (b) \n     through (d) of section 257 of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 for fiscal years beyond \n     those covered by that concurrent resolution on the budget.\n       (6) Prior surplus.--If direct spending or revenue \n     legislation increases the on-budget deficit or causes an on-\n     budget deficit when taken individually, it must also increase \n     the on-budget deficit or cause an on-budget deficit when \n     taken together with all direct spending and revenue \n     legislation enacted since the beginning of the calendar year \n     not accounted for in the baseline under paragraph (5)(A), \n     except that direct spending or revenue effects resulting in \n     net deficit reduction enacted pursuant to reconciliation \n     instructions since the beginning of that same calendar year \n     shall not be available.\n       (b) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended in the \n     Senate only by the affirmative vote of \\3/5\\ of the Members, \n     duly chosen and sworn.\n       (c) Appeals.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of \n     the Chair relating to any provision of this section shall be \n     limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the appellant and the manager of the bill or \n     joint resolution, as the case may be. An affirmative vote of \n     \\3/5\\ of the Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, \n     shall be required to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the \n     Chair on a point of order raised under this section.\n       (d) Determination of Budget Levels.--For purposes of this \n     section, the levels of new budget authority, outlays, and \n     revenues for a fiscal year shall be determined on the basis \n     of estimates made by the Committee on the Budget of the \n     Senate.\n       (e) Sunset.--This section shall expire on September 30, \n     2010.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring an old friend back \nto this body--the pay-go rule. I am even more pleased to say this is \nnot some new pay-go, but rather good old-fashioned ``Classic'' pay-go. \nThis is the pay-go we used to have in the Senate--a rule that said you \nhad to pay for what you wanted. If you want to increase entitlement \nspending, you have to pay for it. If you want to increase tax \nexpenditures or cut tax rates, then you have to pay for it.\n  In offering this amendment, I am pleased to be joined by the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island, Mr. Chafee, the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Obama, \nand in particular I am pleased to, of course, have the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, Mr. Conrad, as a cosponsor.\n  As I said during the debate over the first part of the reconciliation \nscheme that was included in the budget resolution, there is no Senator \nmore dedicated to a fiscally responsible Federal budget and to \nrestoring sound budget rules than Senator Conrad. He is an acknowledged \nexpert on the budget and the rules that govern its consideration, but \nas I also said during that debate, you do not have to be a Kent Conrad \nto understand the pay-go rule.\n  It is a straightforward, commonsense requirement that whenever \nCongress wants to increase spending through entitlements or wants to \nreduce revenues from the Tax Code, then we have to pay for it or find \n60 votes to make an exception to the rule.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, as you well know--and I thank you for \nyour help on this amendment--that rule was an effective restraint on \nthe fiscal appetites of Congress and the White House, and it was \ncritical to our ability to actually balance the Federal books. We \nbalanced the Federal books during the 1990s using the pay-go rule.\n  Of course, when this body stopped following that rule, the bottom \ndropped out from under the budget. We went from a projected 10-year \nunified budget surplus of $5 trillion to massive projected deficits and \nbackbreaking debt.\n  I marvel at how rapidly this institution loses its fiscal bearings. \nIn 1992, thanks in great part to the remarkable campaign of Ross Perot, \nthe budget deficit became the No. 1 domestic priority of the Nation. I \nran on that issue in my 1992 campaign for the Senate. Perhaps a little \nnaively, I offered a plan to balance the budget with over 82 specific \nproposals to cut wasteful programs in just about every area of \nGovernment.\n  As optimistic as I was, I was surprised at how passionately many in \nthe Senate actually embraced that cause. And because of a tough deficit \nreduction package in 1993 and a more modest package in 1997, we put the \nbudget on track to be balanced. We actually balanced the Federal budget \nwithout using the Social Security surpluses. We actually started paying \ndown the Federal debt, most of which had been run up during the 1980s.\n  Central to our ability to get on the right fiscal track was this pay-\ngo rule. But all that work, all those tough decisions were squandered \nin the blink of a budgetary eye. The Federal budget is now in \ndisastrous shape. Worse, we are on a track for even darker times. As Al \nJolson famously said, ``You ain't seen nothin' yet.''\n  As the Senator from North Dakota has tirelessly said: We are in the \nsweet spot right now. That means the retirement of my generation, the \nbaby boom generation, is around the corner. And with it, we will \nwitness enormous new demands on the budget. If we can't get our act \ntogether now, there is little hope that we can face those demands \nresponsibly.\n  We have to stop running deficits. Running deficits caused the \nGovernment to use the surpluses of the Social Security trust fund for \nother Government purposes rather than to pay down the debt and help our \nNation prepare for the coming retirement of the baby boom generation. \nAs Senator Conrad has noted, it isn't just the annual budget deficits \nthat are the problem, it is our debt as well. Every dollar that we add \nto the Federal debt is another dollar that we are forcing our children \nto pay back in higher taxes for fewer Government benefits.\n\n[[Page S13116]]\n\n  As I have noted before during previous pay-go debates, when the \nGovernment in this generation, in our generation, chooses to spend on \ncurrent consumption and to accumulate debt for our children's \ngeneration to pay, it does nothing less than rob our children of their \nown choices. We make our choices to spend on our wants, but we saddle \nthem with debts that they must pay from their tax dollars and their \nhard work. That is not right.\n  That is why this amendment is so critical. We absolutely must \nreinstate the pay-go rule. We need a strong budget process. We need to \nexert fiscal discipline. When the pay-go rule was in effect, that tough \nfiscal discipline actually governed the budget process. Under the \ncurrent approach, it is the other way around. The annual budget \nresolution actually determines how much fiscal discipline we are \nwilling to impose on ourselves. That simply has not worked, and it \nwon't work. When Congress decides that it would be nice to create a new \nentitlement or enact new tax cuts and then adjust its budget rules to \npermit those policies, we are inviting a disastrous result. That is \nexactly what has happened.\n  This amendment is simple and straightforward. It would simply return \nus to the rule under which Congress operated for the decade of the \n1990s. It was instrumental in balancing the Federal budget. Many of us \nlived under that rule, and we know how effective it was.\n  A real pay-go rule by itself would not eliminate annual budget \ndeficits and balance the budget, but we will never get there without a \nreal pay-go rule.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, time-tested \namendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2651\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Sununu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2651.\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To repeal State and local taxation exemptions applicable to \n  the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan \n                         Mortgage Corporation)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. REPEAL OF STATE AND LOCAL TAX EXEMPTION FOR FANNIE \n                   MAE AND FREDDIE MAC.\n\n       (a) Fannie Mae.--Section 309(c) of the Federal National \n     Mortgage Association Charter Act (12 U.S.C. 1723a(c)) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(c) [Repealed.]''.\n       (b) Freddie Mac.--Section 303(e) of the Federal Home Loan \n     Mortgage Corporation Act (12 U.S.C. 1452(e)) is amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(e) [Repealed.]''.\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I offer an amendment today that deals with \nwhat I consider to be a tax loophole that is in the Code that fully \nexempts private, for-profit corporations, owned by shareholders that \nhave had very high levels of profit in recent years, from paying any \nState or local taxes. The entities I am talking about are the \nGovernment-sponsored entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These are \nchartered by the Federal Government. We give them a number of benefits. \nThey help with the secondary mortgage market and have been very \nsuccessful in that mission. But they are in fact private, for-profit \ncorporations with very large profits, and they do not need to be exempt \nfrom paying State and local taxes. In fact, I think if they are really \ncommitted to the local communities and the homeowners they serve across \nthe country, they ought to be happy to pay State and local taxes.\n  We have heard a lot of debate over the last several hours about Big \nOil. We have even had some amendments that take away tax benefits from \noil companies. Some of those amendments I have supported. There have \nbeen other amendments that actually impose special taxes on oil \ncompanies. Given the concern people seem to have with high levels of \nprofits at oil firms in recent months, I think people should embrace \nthe idea of getting rid of this tax loophole, imposing the same kind of \nlegitimate State and local taxes on the GSEs as we see anywhere else.\n  It might be one thing if the levels of profit at these entities had \nbeen plowed back into the community. But that isn't the case. The \nlion's share of these profits have gone to shareholders or in some \ncases to exorbitant executive pay--$5 million for some of the \nexecutives at these corporations, $10 million a year in one case. \nClearly, these profits are being used to put back into homeownership. \nThese are companies that can afford to pay State and local taxes. They \nought to pay State and local taxes.\n  I certainly encourage my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, I rise to offer this amendment which will \nhelp balance the oil markets and help families balance their budgets \nthis winter by pulling some of the money out of the gas pumps and \nputting it back in people's pockets. It would do so by instituting a \nwindfall profit levy on the oil companies and transferring those \nproceeds back to where they came from, the consumer.\n  I am going to not use all the rhetoric. We have talked about a \nwindfall levy before. But this one is considerably different than the \none that was offered before in a number of ways. I would like to \noutline those ways.\n  First, the revenues go directly to the individual's pockets. It does \nnot go through the Government. It does not go through any agency. It \nsimply adds a tax credit of $100 for every person. That means the money \ngoes to everyone. Big families will get more than small families, and \nit will certainly help taxpayers at the lower end.\n  The temporary levy we are talking about is also different. The \nprevious one just taxed oil when it was above $40 a barrel. My worry \nabout that is that it could raise the price at the pump. What we are \ndoing is using a method that puts this levy on profits. It means that \nthat happens after the companies have brought in their cash and, \ntherefore, is quite different than an amendment that just goes on to \ntaxes.\n  Let me describe the amendment. We create a temporary levy on the \nexcess profits of U.S. oil companies and foreign companies that do \nsubstantial business in the United States, in order to provide every \ntaxpayer with a nonrefundable tax credit of $100 for 2005 for every \nperson in their household. The temporary levy applies to major \nintegrated oil companies, plus any refiners or producers with more than \n$100 million in sales. The revenue mechanism is an actual tax on \nwindfall profits in 2005 that exceed a 3-year historic average. It will \nbe very easy for the companies to calculate this based on the numbers \nthey have previously reported on their tax returns. So no one can argue \nit is administratively difficult.\n  The proposal is intended to be a complement to the other windfall \nproposals. It is different. For those who argue against the other \nproposals on grounds that such levees will increase production costs \nand thereby fuel costs, this amendment addresses those concerns because \nit is an actual tax on profits, not production. In other words, those \nwho say they object to windfall profit levees on these grounds will \nhave to show their real colors. Those who don't want to force the oil \ncompanies to give up anything under any circumstances will, of course, \nnot vote for this amendment. But for those who have come to the floor \nto argue against other proposals simply because they say they will \nincrease production costs, this amendment would not. You should vote \nfor it.\n  As I mentioned, the revenue goes to provide every U.S. taxpayer with \na nonrefundable tax credit of $100. The amendment is designed to be \nrevenue neutral. The excess profit tax rate will be adjusted, as \nnecessary, to ensure there will be no net budget impact that violates \nthe reconciliation instructions.\n  Bottom line: different than the other proposal; money goes directly \nto the taxpayer; money is levied on profits so it doesn't raise costs \nor interfere with production because it is after the line.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I see Senator Santorum. Under previous \norder, he has the right to speak for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I first want to start out by thanking \nthe chairman for all the hard work he has put in on this package. The \nwork we have done together has been at times a challenging process, but \nI certainly appreciate working together, particularly on a section of \nthe bill which I will talk about more in detail and that has not been \ntalked about on the floor, and that is the section of the bill dealing \nwith charitable giving, part of an effort that I have been working on, \nand many have been working on, to try to help those in need in our \nsociety by helping those important mediating institutions of our \nsociety who are out there every day on the frontlines serving the needs \nof those who, in many cases, are left behind by society.\n  I am pleased overall that we are going to be able to pass this \npackage, hopefully soon, that will stop tax increases from going into \neffect. I call this bill the ``Tax Increase Prevention Act'' because \nbut for this bill, hundreds of thousands of taxpayers in my State alone \nand millions across America would have their taxes go up starting in \nJanuary of next year.\n  In Pennsylvania, almost 350,000 families would see their taxes go up, \nsome dramatically, because of the alternative minimum tax.\n  Mr. President, 268,000 taxpayers will benefit from the low-income \nsavers credit, which would go away but for this bill; 150,000 families \nand students would continue to be able to deduct college tuition, \nanother important provision in this bill, and 142,000 teachers in \nPennsylvania will be able to deduct expenses that they have in the \nclassroom helping their students.\n  One of the most important things about this tax bill is that it will \nin fact provide more certainty for Americans in providing a Tax Code \nand will continue the policies that have created the economic growth \nand the vitality that this economy has had after some of the tough \nblows that were dealt in the early part of this century.\n  But the focus I wanted to talk about on this bill tonight are some \nthings that I have been working on along in particular on the other \nside of the aisle with Senator Joe Lieberman. It has been a long road \nfor us on what is called the CARE Act, Charitable Aid and Recovery \nEmpowerment Act. It is an important piece of legislation that does a \nlot to incentivize people across America to give.\n  There are several provisions in the bill I want to highlight that are \nvitally important in encouraging charitable giving. If we look at that \nin America, what we see is not necessarily a rosy story. Yes, we have \nseen increases in giving around events such as Katrina and the events \nof 9/11, but what we have seen after the publicity and after all the \nattention attracted by those disasters and those horrific instances, \nactually charitable giving pretty much flat over the past 25 years.\n\n[[Page S13118]]\n\n  About 25 or 30 years ago we gave almost 2.5 percent of GDP in \ncharitable giving--2.5 percent we were generous enough to give to \ncharitable organizations to help those in need in our society. Today, \nwe are at around 1 percent. That is something that, candidly, I think \nwe need to work on. There are a lot of reasons why that may happen. \nSome of it may be we have seen an increase in Government over the last \n25 or 30 years and, as a result, we have seen some squeezing out of \nsome of the charitable organizations that existed in the past. But the \nbottom line is that America is strong when our civic and community \norganizations are strong, and they can only be strong if they have the \nresources to be out there in the community to meet the needs that are \nso prevalent.\n  We have done a couple things in this bill that are important. One \nthat I am very proud of is that we have taken the opportunity, for the \nfirst time in a long time in the Tax Code, to give nonitemizers the \nopportunity to deduct charitable contributions. Heretofore, if you were \none of the two-thirds of Americans who filled out a tax form, using the \nshort form, and you could give 10 percent of your income--and in fact \nmany in our society do tithe, give 10 percent of their income--but if \nyou are a low-income person and you do not have any other reason to \ntake other than the standard deduction, you would be denied the \nopportunity to take those deductions and get some support for your \nsupporting of charitable organizations.\n  Under this bill, you will now be able to have an opportunity, on the \nfront of the 1040 form, to deduct your charitable contributions similar \nto those who itemize the deduction.\n  That is an important incentive because there is a floor on this. For \na couple filing jointly, you would have to contribute $420, and that \nmight be changed. We are working on an amendment to maybe lower that \nfloor a little bit. But it will be around $400 before you can claim a \ndeduction on your tax form.\n  So the charities we have talked to, everybody from the United Way to \nthe Salvation Army and others, they are very excited because they do \nbelieve this will incentivize more generous giving instead of giving \nthe deduction for giving that would otherwise have occurred without \nthis incentive. So we think it incentivizes more generous giving both \nfor those who do not itemize, as well as, if we also put a floor on \nitemizers, we will incentivize itemizers to give more and be more \ngenerous through this.\n  A couple other aspects we have worked on. One is an IRA rollover \nprovision. We have literally billions of dollars stored up in IRAs with \nsome people who candidly have done well enough that they don't need the \nIRAs to maintain the quality of life they have. But that money is \nlocked up for folks who want to contribute that IRA to charitable \norganizations. It has been estimated that literally $2 to $3 billion of \ncharitable contributions could occur if we stop what is current law, \nwhich is the penalties and interest that would be charged to those who \nwould donate their IRAs to philanthropic organizations. So we remove \npenalties and interest which I think will unlock literally billions of \ndollars in money for, particularly in this case, educational \ninstitutions, which I think would do more than others to receive these \nkinds of funds.\n  We have a food donation provision. According to America's Second \nHarvest, this provision which focuses on farmers and ranchers and \nrestaurateurs, this provision, I am told by America's Second Harvest, \nwill encourage up to $2 billion over the next 10 years in donations of \nfood and will feed 878 million people with meals. This is a very \nimportant provision as we try to attack hunger in America.\n  We have a provision that the Senator from Montana has been involved \nin with respect to book donations, which is important to again help \neducational institutions, libraries, and others.\n  So there are a variety of different provisions in this bill which are \nessential for us who want to see our fellow man reach into their \npockets and to reach out their hands to help those in need in our \nsociety but need more wherewithal to do so.\n  This package of bills we have put together in this legislation will \nhelp charities do just that.\n  Now, on the other side of the coin, as many of the charities have \nbeen following this debate, there was a concern, candidly, about some \n``charitable reforms'' that have been the subject of a lot of \nconversation in the philanthropic world that I have been working on \nwith the chairman, to try to address some of the abuses that the \nFinance Committee, through several hearings that the chairman has had, \nthat have been documented about some charitable organizations using \nmoney for, in some cases, personal gain or for transferring money to \nmembers of their family. Some of these concerns are legitimate, but one \nof the things that I was adamant about is that we did not want to have \na series of reforms in place that were going to jeopardize the vast \nmajority of nonprofit organizations that do incredibly good work, most \nof them volunteers, most of them with very little staff, certainly very \nlittle paid staff, and are the heart and soul of so many communities \nacross America. So it has been a balancing act for the Chairman and \nmyself as we have worked through this. We didn't quite get it right, in \nmy opinion, in the committee mark, although the chairman went a long \nway in scaling back some of the more ambitious changes that he had \nproposed, but we have worked together, and from the mark to the \namendment that will be offered by the chairman later, I think we have \naccomplished about 90 percent of the concerns and certainly the major \nconcerns that not only I have had but those charitable organizations, \nparticularly the small charitable organizations that are concerned \nabout, if you will, more of a Sarbanes-Oxley approach to dealing with \nsome charitable organizations that would have made it almost impossible \nfor these charities to continue to function, particularly in smalltown \nAmerica.\n\n  We have now been able to come up with compromises that I think will, \nat least according to all of the feedback we have been getting--and I \nwant to congratulate Melanie Looney in my office. She has done an \noutstanding job in making sure that the interests of the mom-and-pop \ncharities, if you will, across America have been represented here and \nthat we are not doing anything while, on the one hand, giving \nincentives for people to contribute to charitable organizations and, on \nthe other hand, shutting these charitable organizations down because \nthey can't survive under the burden of new regulations they would be \nplaced under.\n  I think we have done a great job in balancing those interests. There \nare still a couple of things we would like to adjust, but there is \nalways conference and the ability to work together with the House to \nget that done.\n  I thank the chairman. We have been discussing this and working on \nthis and, in some respects, battling on this for quite some time, but I \nbelieve now that we have reached the point where we have some \nresponsible and proper reforms that the vast majority of the charitable \nworld embraces and understands they need to increase the \nprofessionalization in a lot of respects. That has been accomplished as \na result of the reforms that we have put forward today. I look forward \nto working with the Chairman and ranking member and members of the Ways \nand Means Committee to get a bill that all in the charitable community \ncan embrace that is responsible in improving governance, as well as a \ngreat incentive for these organizations to go out and meet the needs \nthat are so pressing our communities across America.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member for \nhis time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment temporarily be laid aside so I can offer an amendment on \nbehalf of the Democratic leader, Senator Reid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am offering an amendment to \ntry to help our senior citizens from the state of confusion that many \nof them are now experiencing since the prescription drug benefit \nstarted 2 days ago and being signed up. If other Senators are hearing \nfrom their senior citizens as I am--and I met with a group on Monday in \nWest Palm Beach--they will find that many of them are confused, \nbewildered, and in some cases even frightened because they are afraid \nof making a choice and then making a mistake, and under the current \nlaw--and we need to clean up some of this current law anyway--they \ncould not rectify that mistake for a whole year. And now in trying to \nmake an intelligent decision on something that is as important to a \nsenior citizen as prescription drugs, they are being confronted with a \nmultiplicity of plans.\n  I had one senior in West Palm Beach tell me they were actually \nlooking at 103 plans. In other parts of the State, you are looking at \n18 companies offering 43 stand-alone prescription plans and, in \naddition, another 37 companies will offer a total of 257 different \nMedicare Advantage prescription drug plans. And each of these has \ndiffering premiums, cost-sharing requirements, different drugs, and \npharmacy access.\n  What about the senior citizen who has one or two pharmacies in their \nsmall community and then they have to worry about finding the plan that \nfits with that pharmacy? Or what about the senior citizen who has a \nprescription and depends on it, goes and finds the plan that covers \nthat prescription and then what happens if the doctor in the course of \nthe year changes that prescription and then that prescription is not \ncontained on that particular plan's formula?\n  Sorting through these plans is complicated and time-consuming, and \nthat is what has led our seniors to be confused, in some cases \nbewildered, and, very sadly in cases that I saw, even frightened.\n  We can rectify that with this amendment. All it does is give them \nmore time instead of the deadline coming down like an ax in the night \nnext May. It extends that deadline for 6 months, and it allows them, if \nthey make a choice within the course of that year, 2006, the first year \nthat the prescription drug law takes effect for Medicare, if they make \na mistake, to rectify it. And if they make a choice to go with the \nMedicare prescription drug benefit and then realize they want to go \nback with their former employer's prescription drug plan, they have \nthat option.\n  That is the essence of this amendment. Mr. President, I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, I call up for consideration amendment \nNo. 2642.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment I am offering is to \ncreate a tax credit for small businesses so they can provide health \ninsurance for their employees. This is a terrible need, an enormous \nneed in my own State of New Mexico.\n  I am defining small businesses as businesses with 50 or fewer \nemployees. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, only 43 percent \nof small businesses defined in this way offer health insurance to their \nemployees. This chart sets out the range that applies to each State, \nand you can see that many States have this very same problem.\n  In my home State of New Mexico, roughly 38 percent of workers who \nwork for small businesses have access to employer-provided health \ninsurance. In a State such as New Mexico where a majority of the \nbusinesses have fewer than 50 employees, the lack of employer-provided \ninsurance is reflected in the overall number of uninsured New Mexicans. \nYet according to the Kaiser Foundation, 80 percent of the uninsured in \nour country come from a family in which at least one person is working.\n  This amendment creates a tax credit that ranges from 30 percent to 50 \npercent of the cost of qualified health insurance expenses with smaller \nemployers getting the largest credit. In order to keep the costs down, \nI have provided that this credit will be effective in the 2006 tax \nyear. We will have to take additional action to extend it beyond that.\n  What we have learned over the years is that employer-provided \nbenefits are the most efficient and effective means to deliver health \ncare coverage and retirement benefits.\n  This amendment is totally offset by requiring Government contractors \nto withhold a very small amount of the taxes they will ultimately have \nto pay.\n  This is a very meritorious amendment. It is totally offset and paid \nfor. I urge my colleagues to support it, and the small businesses in \ntheir States will be very appreciative of that support.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside so that the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, \nmay offer an amendment. I ask him, too, to limit his remarks to 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2623\n\n   (Purpose: To reduce the tax on patriotic employers, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2623.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2623.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, our Tax Code does two things. It raises \nrevenue, but it also tries to encourage good behavior and discourage \nbad behavior. What this amendment does is reward good behavior on the \npart of American businesses. It is my belief that if a business does \nthe right thing for its employees and for this country, it should have \na tax benefit, and that is why we are designating patriotic employers.\n  Who are these employers? They are employers who maintain or increase \nthe number of full-time workers in America relative to the number of \nfull-time workers outside of America. They maintain their corporate \nheadquarters in America if the company has ever been headquartered \nhere. They pay decent wages to their employees, a livable wage of at \nleast $7.75 an hour. They provide a retirement plan for their \nemployees, either a defined benefit or defined contribution that \nmatches at least 5 percent of their worker contributions for every \nemployer. They pay at least 60 percent of workers' health care \npremiums, and when their workers are members of the Guard and Reserve \nand activated to serve overseas, they make up the difference in salary \nso their families can have peace of mind financially while their \nsoldiers are off fighting.\n  I believe the companies who do this deserve a benefit. They deserve a \nreward. If you are not providing for your employees a decent wage, if \nyou are sending all your jobs overseas, if you don't have a retirement \nplan, and you don't provide health insurance, why in the world should \nwe reward that?\n  Let's pick those good, patriotic American companies and give them \nthis tax credit, which is fully offset by this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside so that the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Nelson, \nmay offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask the Senator if he can limit his \nremarks to 3 minutes, too.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2625\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from \nMontana for this opportunity. I call up my amendment No. 2625, which is \nat the desk, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Nelson], for himself, and \n     Mr. DeWine, proposes an amendment numbered 2625.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DISABILITY PREFERENCE PROGRAM FOR TAX COLLECTION \n                   CONTRACTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall not \n     enter into any qualified tax collection contract after April \n     1, 2006, until the Secretary implements a disability \n     preference program that meets the requirements of subsection \n     (b).\n       (b) Disability Preference Program Requirements.--\n       (1) In general.--A disability preference program meets the \n     requirements of this subsection if such program requires that \n     not less than 10 percent of the accounts of each dollar value \n     category are awarded to persons described in paragraph (2).\n       (2) Person described.--For purposes of paragraph (1), a \n     person is described in this paragraph if--\n       (A) as of the date any qualified tax collection contract is \n     awarded--\n       (i) such person employs not less than 50 severely disabled \n     individuals within the United States; or\n       (ii) not less than 30 percent of the employees of such \n     person within the United States are severely disabled \n     individuals;\n       (B) such person agrees as a condition of the qualified tax \n     collection contract that not more than 90 days after the date \n     such contract is awarded, not less than 35 percent of the \n     employees of such person employed in connection with \n     providing services under such contract shall--\n       (i) be hired after the date such contract is awarded; and\n       (ii) be severely disabled individuals; and\n       (C) such person is otherwise qualified to perform the \n     services required.\n\n[[Page S13121]]\n\n       (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n       (1) Qualified tax collection contract.--The term \n     ``qualified tax collection contract'' shall have the meaning \n     given such term under section 6306(b) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986.\n       (2) Dollar value category.--The term ``dollar value \n     category'' means the dollar ranges of accounts for collection \n     as determined and assigned by the Secretary under section \n     6306(b)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with \n     respect to a qualified tax collection contract.\n       (3) Severely disabled individual.--The term ``severely \n     disabled individual'' means--\n       (A) a veteran of the United States armed forces with a \n     disability of 50 percent or greater--\n       (i) determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be \n     service-connected; or\n       (ii) deemed by law to be service-connected; or\n       (B) any individual who is a disabled beneficiary (as \n     defined in section 1148(k)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1320b-19(k)(2))) or who would be considered to be such \n     a disabled beneficiary but for having income or resources in \n     excess of the income or resources eligibility limits \n     established under title XVI of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1381 et seq.), respectively.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Collins be added as an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I call up my amendment at the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  In October 2004, Congress enacted the American Jobs Creation Act of \n2004, Public Law 108-357, providing for outsourcing by the Internal \nRevenue Service, IRS, of collection of unpaid and past due Federal \nincome taxes. The bidding process for the initial contracts is \ncurrently underway. Eventually, after full implementation of the \nprogram, it is estimated that these contracts will create up to 4,000 \nwell paying private-sector jobs.\n  The amendment that Senator DeWine and I are offering today would \nestablish a preference under the debt collection contracting program \nfor contractors who meet certain threshold criteria relating to \nemployment of disabled veterans and other severely disabled persons. \nThe amendment further requires that at least a specified percentage of \nthe individuals employed by the contractor to provide debt collection \nservices under the contract with the IRS qualify as disabled veterans \nor severely disabled persons.\n  If Federal employees conducted the same tax collection activities, \ncurrent law would give preferences to disabled veterans in filling \nthose Federal jobs. In addition, if other persons with severe \ndisabilities were employed by the Federal Government in those jobs, \nthose disabled persons would benefit from the Federal Government's long \nhistory of nondiscrimination and policies of promoting job \nopportunities for the disabled.\n  Despite multiple Federal programs, benefits offered thorough a \nvariety of agencies, and various tax incentives, unemployment rates for \npersons with disabilities, PWDs, are extremely high. The 2000 Census \nestimated that there were 31 million working-age Americans with \ndisabilities, with an unemployment rate of 70-80 percent. Today, there \nare 2.6 million veterans receiving service-connected benefits, \nincluding disability benefits with an additional 340,000-plus \napplications pending by other veterans.\n  By enacting legislation to allow the IRS to outsource debt \ncollection, Congress certainly did not intend to curtail the national \ncommitment to creating meaningful job opportunities for disabled \nveterans and other severely disabled persons. Indeed, the contracts \nwhich the IRS will soon execute with private-sector debt collection \ncompanies provide a unique opportunity for the Federal government to \nstimulate creation of well-paying jobs for disabled veterans and other \npersons with severe disabilities.\n  To realize this opportunity, however, Congress must act to assure \nthat existing Federal employment preferences for disabled veterans and \nFederal policies promoting opportunities for other severely disabled \npersons are carried forward as a part of the IRS's contracting \ncriteria. My amendment, that I am happy to be offering with Senator \nDeWine, achieves this goal.\n  Our amendment would establish a preference for companies that \ncurrently employ a minimum of 50 disabled veterans or persons with \nsevere disabilities, who also must be capable of fulfilling the task. \nOnce the IRS award is made, the debt collection contractor would be \nrequired to ensure that 35 percent of the workforce fulfilling the \ncontract be new hires that are persons or veterans with disabilities.\n  Under this amendment, a minimum of 140 full-time equivalent jobs, \nalso known as FTE jobs, would be created for PWDs at third-party debt \ncollection agencies contracted to collect certain past dues income \ntaxes. An FTE job is equivalent to one (1) 40-hour job or two (2) 20-hr \nweekly employees or four (4) 10-hour per week employees. These jobs are \noften part-time; 140 FTEs could translate into close to 300 part-time \npositions for disabled individuals.\n  This amendment would not only help to alleviate the current \nunemployment rate of PWDs, it would also generate substantial savings. \nThese jobs pay anywhere from $19,000 annually up to $40,000 annually \nand can include health and 401(k) benefits. Even at the low end, this \nincome level is too high to qualify for supplemental security income-\ndisability insurance benefits. Thus, individuals in these programs who \ntake these jobs will no longer require government benefit subsidies \nfrom SSI or DI, even if otherwise qualified. Over a 5-year period, the \nSSI/DI savings are estimated to be $69-$75 million.\n  To qualify under this amendment, a company must hire 50 PWDs. If 10 \ncompanies do this, the net result is employment of 500 PWDs who \ncurrently do not have jobs. If 20 companies participate, 1,000 PWDs \nwould be gainfully employed. The savings realized with 1,000 PWDs no \nlonger needing SSI/DI benefits could be as high as $344 million.\n  The IRS debt collection program is already established. The \nprovisions in this amendment offer the added benefit of more jobs for \ndisabled veterans and the reduction of Federal benefit program costs.\n  We owe it to our service men and women to improve their futures in \nany way we can. We have the opportunity to not only show our support \nfor our disabled veterans, but to also show the severely disabled that \nwe believe in them and in their abilities.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to support this amendment, to support our \nveterans, and to support the severely disabled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2650\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining on my \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 8 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I note how pleased I am that the Senator from Colorado, \nMr. Salazar, is a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Illinois who is also a \ncosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \namendment offered by Senator Feingold. I am pleased to be a cosponsor \nof the amendment.\n  In recent years, the philosophy in Washington has been that you can \nspend without consequence or sacrifice. That we can fight a war in Iraq \nand a war on terror, protect our homeland, provide our citizens with \nMedicare and Social Security, and maintain our domestic priorities, all \nwhile cutting taxes for the wealthy and funding every local project \nthere is.\n  If you are wondering how Congress pays for all this, it doesn't. \nInstead, billions of dollars are borrowed from other countries and put \non a credit card for our children to pay off. Yet, when it comes time \nto pay these bills, no one can seem to agree on any tax cuts to defer \nor any programs to cut.\n  Every family knows that it is one thing to use a credit card; it is \nanother thing to keep spending money you don't have. You have to pay as \nyou go, which is a rule most Americans live by.\n  Washington once did too, until the White House and my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle abandoned it to push through the \nPresident's tax breaks.\n  This attempt to pass $60 billion in tax breaks despite record \nbreaking\n\n[[Page S13122]]\n\ndeficits is just the latest example of the fiscal irresponsibility in \nthis city.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Feingold is about restoring \nresponsible budgeting. Previously, PAYGO rules applied equally to \nincreases in mandatory spending and tax cuts.\n  Unfortunately, the rules were changed, and now the requirements of \nbudget discipline apply to only half of the budget--the spending part.\n  The problem is, that there is no such thing as half a budget. Budget \ndiscipline requires enforcing control over both sides of the ledger.\n  The original PAYGO rules were abandoned to provide for a series of \nunfunded tax breaks. In order to pay for these tax breaks, the \nGovernment had to borrow money from countries like Japan and China.\n  And we borrowed from the Social Security Trust Fund. In the process, \nour national debt shot up to $8 trillion, and it is still rising. Last \nyear, for example, our national commitments exceeded our national \nresources by more than $550 billion.\n  Americans deserve better financial leadership.\n  Washington could learn a lot from the American people about fiscal \nresponsibility. The people I talk to in Illinois are not fooled by \nwhat's going on. They know what is happening with higher deficits and \nreduced levels of Government service.\n  They understand that, in this life, you get what you pay for and if \nyou don't pay for it today, it will cost you more tomorrow.\n  The people I have met with know that if you need to spend more money \non something, you also need to make more money, and if your income \nfalls, your spending must fall, too. This is the essence of the PAYGO \nrules we are trying to reinstate today. Changes in spending must be \noffset by changes in revenue, and vice versa.\n  The people I talk to understand that when you have massive costs \ncoming down the road, you need to prepare for them. There is no excuse \nfor ignoring the financial consequences of foreseeable expenses--\nwhether it is the rising costs of health care, the retirement of the \nbaby boom generation, or the growing inequality of wealth in our \nsociety.\n  So when you are already deep in debt--as the Federal Government is \nnow--and you are facing a mountain of debt in the future, it is just \nnot the right time to be giving out $60 billion in tax cuts, even if \nmany of these cuts have merit.\n  And if you are intent on giving out these tax cuts, let's find a way \nto pay for them.\n  And that is why it is so important that we reinstate PAYGO in a way \nthat meaningfully enforces the budget discipline that both sides of the \naisle need in order to honestly tackle our short-term and long-term \nfiscal challenges.\n  It is time for some adult supervision to return to the budgeting \nprocess. PAYGO provides a necessary tool at a necessary time.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Illinois. I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be in order at this time to ask for the yeas and nays \non my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I call up the Grassley amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will please report the Grassley \namendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2654.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n             (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate)\n\n       At the end of title IV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) As many as 44,000,000 Americans are estimated to lack \n     health insurance during the course of the year, many of whom \n     are uninsured for a short period of time while a smaller \n     number face longer periods without coverage.\n       (2) Rising health care costs contribute to the problem of \n     the uninsured and make it more difficult to find a simple \n     solution to make health care affordable.\n       (3) There is not a one-size fits all solution to address \n     health care coverage issues.\n       (4) Businesses have competing needs for their resources, \n     including investments to ensure their competitiveness and \n     providing health care coverage for their employees and \n     dependents.\n       (5) Lower tax rates on dividends and capital gains saved \n     24,000,000 families an average of nearly $950 on their 2004 \n     taxes, including about 7,000,000 seniors who saved, on \n     average, $1,230 each.\n       (6) These pro-growth tax cuts have spurred economic \n     development and job creation and have been partly responsible \n     for an increase in tax receipts.\n       (7) Of the more than 30,000,000 tax returns that included \n     dividend income, those with adjusted gross income of less \n     than $75,000 accounted for 64 percent, or over 19,000,000 of \n     such returns.\n       (8) Of the nearly 23,000,000 tax returns that included \n     capital gains, 62 percent of these returns, or about \n     14,000,000, had less than $75,000 in adjusted gross income.\n       (9) Allowing taxes to increase will make it harder for \n     employers and individuals to afford health care insurance, \n     leading to more individuals without health insurance.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Senate should--\n       (1) prevent an increase in taxes on millions of Americans \n     by not allowing the tax policy enacted in 2003 to expire; and\n       (2) extend tax policies that have proven to enhance \n     economic growth, create jobs, and improve business' and \n     individuals' ability to afford health insurance coverage; and\n       (3) address the multiple aspects of our Nation's health \n     care crisis, including the need to make health care more \n     affordable, to expand coverage, and to strengthen the health \n     care safety net by--\n       (A) promoting the use of health care technology, which will \n     help reduce medical errors that contribute to higher costs \n     and promote greater efficiency in care delivery;\n       (B) providing new financial assistance and tax credits to \n     make health insurance more affordable;\n       (C) creating financial incentives for young adults to \n     purchase lifetime, portable health insurance;\n       (D) expanding health insurance coverage options for low-\n     income entrepreneurs and self-employed individuals;\n       (E) increasing access to specialty care within the health \n     care safety net by providing a tax deduction to physician \n     specialists who provide care for patients referred from \n     health care safety net providers;\n       (F) reducing regulatory burdens on health care safety net \n     providers that lead to higher administrative costs and a \n     diversion of funds that could be spent on patient care; and\n       (G) improving outreach efforts to maximize participation of \n     eligible beneficiaries in Federal health care safety net \n     programs.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is an alternative to the Durbin \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution. The Durbin amendment in essence says \ncertain taxes should be extended and that money ought to be used to \nprovide health care and insurance for children.\n  We agree that more needs to be done to help uninsured people. But we \nbelieve that the pretax policy in place is such a good tax policy--for \ninstance, Chairman Greenspan saying that the tax policy has been good \nfor the recovery and the extended growth, bringing in $274 billion this \nyear over last year. We think we need to do all the things--expanding \nthe economy and everything else--because it is through an expanding \neconomy that middle-income people advance themselves; that we have an \nopportunity then for more people through more income to be able to buy \nhealth insurance. We have to do all those things. We can't change tax \npolicy and count that as doing it.\n  I urge this as an alternative to Senator Durbin's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I greatly respect my colleague from Iowa. \nThe Grassley amendment is a clear explanation of why we have never done \nanything to expand health care. Do you know why? Because the Grassley \namendment says we can have it all. We can give $20 billion in tax cuts \nto the wealthiest people in America and we can provide health care for \nchildren. It doesn't add up, just like this budget doesn't add up. What \nwe have to understand is this. I give you a choice: Take away the tax \nbreaks, half of which go to people who make over $1 million a year, \ntake the money and insure all the children in America. That is my \namendment.\n  Senator Grassley's amendment doesn't provide any resources or any \nfunds to insure the children. What it says is if we give enough money \nto the wealthiest people in America, surely out of the charity of their \nhearts they will take care of the kids. We know better. There are more \nand more uninsured every single year.\n  I urge you to defeat the Grassley amendment and consider voting for \nthe Durbin amendment.\n  I raise a point of order that the amendment violates the Byrd rule, \nsection 313(b)(1)(a) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I move to waive the budget point of \norder and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

It is my understanding under the unanimous consent \nrequest that my amendment is next in line.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Do I need to call up the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, life and the Senate are about choices. \nHere are your choices with this amendment. You can give a capital gains \nand dividends tax cut that goes primarily to the wealthiest Americans. \nIn fact, 75 percent of the capital gains tax cuts goes to people making \nover $200,000 a year; 1.5 million taxpayers will benefit from that new \ntax cut, people who are doing pretty well in life. Or you can take the \nsame amount of money and provide health insurance for 9 million \nuninsured children in America. The cost? The same thing: $10 billion \neach year.\n  There is the choice--give tax cuts to the wealthiest people in \nAmerica or provide health insurance for 9 million kids who don't have \nit, children of families who go to work every single day and don't have \nhealth insurance. The choice is pretty clear. A lot of people talk \nabout moral values and family values. Maybe the choice in this \namendment gets down to those questions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am going to give the Senator from Illinois an \nopportunity to come down out of the grandstand and play on the same \nplaying field I do, and the Senator will have an opportunity to take \ncare of all those people.\n  The Senator had an opportunity 2 weeks ago on the Deficit Reduction \nAct. All the things we had in there for the people who do not have \nhealth care the Senator had an opportunity to vote for and didn't.\n  Just to name a few of these: We had the Family Opportunity Act that \nwould have helped 500,000 severely disabled children. The Senator voted \nagainst that. We had a vote against a bill in regard to the children's \nhealth insurance shortfall. The Senator voted against that. The Senator \nvoted against an outreach and enrollment to get eligible children \nhealth care coverage for which they are entitled. If the Senator were \nserious about helping low-income people, the Senator would have voted \nfor that because we took care of a lot of the children the Senator is \ntalking about.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask that Senators address each other in the third person, \nnot in the second person.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is correct; if \nSenators would address each other through the Chair and in the third \nperson.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I raise a point of order that the amendment is not \ngermane to the underlying bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, do I have time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to waive the applicable budget provisions for \nconsideration of the amendment. I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nmotion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, amendment No. 2605 deals with Hurricane \nKatrina contracting. This sense-of-the-Senate amendment I offer with \nSenators Coburn, Lautenberg, Ensign, and Johnson is a simple effort to \nenforce some accountability and transparency into the contracting \nprocess.\n  FEMA needs to reopen its no-bid contracts. FEMA representatives \ntestified before Senate committees they would do so. They have now \nbacked away from that. That is unacceptable.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is adopted.\n  The amendment (No. 2605) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2588\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on the amendment from the \nSenator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, with 2 minutes evenly divided.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment but an \namendment of enormous importance and consequence for the children of \nthis Nation.\n  If you look at this chart that shows virtually all the industrial \nnations of\n\n[[Page S13125]]\n\nthe world, we have the highest instance of child poverty of all \nindustrial nations in the world.\n  This amendment I offer adds a 1-percent surtax on millionaires who \npay their contributions in terms of the Internal Revenue Service. It is \njust a 1-percent add-on. It pays into a fund to fight child poverty, a \ndesignated fund that will eventually be decided by the leadership and \nby the President of the United States.\n  This is a moral issue. It is a children's issue. It is a value issue. \nAnd this is something that can make an enormous difference to the \nchildren of this country.\n  Here in the richest country in the world, we allow children to \nsuffer, without money, without a home, without food.\n  No great nation can ignore this challenge. The images of Katrina \nproved that. We can lift children out of poverty, all it requires is \nthe will to do it and the leadership to make it happen.\n  In the powerful word of the gospel, ``To whom much is given, much is \nrequired.'' I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there is substantial research that shows \nthe way to make progress in eliminating poverty is to encourage healthy \nmarriages, responsible fathership, full-time work, and education.\n  The poverty rate for married couple families is 5.5 percent. The \noverall poverty rate is 12.7 percent. The poverty rate for single-\nfamily households, if there is no husband, is 28 percent.\n  So it is quite obvious, poverty reduction should not be a partisan \nissue. We know what we need to do to reduce poverty. So we need to roll \nup our sleeves, work together, strengthen marriage, strengthen \nfatherhood, promote education, and get people full-time work. That is \nthe way to end poverty. Statistics prove it.\n  I make the point that the pending amendment is not germane to the \nmeasure now before the Senate, and I raise a point of order against it \nunder section 305 of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will please call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before we have the next rollcall on the \nReed amendment, I have been asked by many Members if we could do what \nworked so successfully for Senator Specter on his bill by enforcing the \n10-minute rule. The leader has asked me to say that is what we are \ngoing to do. So we will have regular order after the 10-minute rollcall \nvote, so people should stay around close to make sure they get their \nvote recorded.\n\n  We are going to enforce the Specter rule. If you don't like it, blame \nSpecter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes equally----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. I don't know how many amendments we have but lots of them \ntonight. I am sure they are all very meritorious. I have an amendment \ndealing with renewables. I am going to allow a voice vote on that. I \nthink others might want to follow that example. I think with rare \nexception we kind of know how they are going to turn out anyway. You \neither win or lose. The vote outcome is the same whether it is by a \nrollcall or voice vote. So I am going to have a voice vote on my \nrenewable energy amendment. I hope others would follow suit on some of \ntheirs.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2626\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes equally divided on the Reed \nof Rhode Island amendment.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  My amendment would fully fund the LIHEAP program, providing a 1-year \ntemporary windfall profits tax on large oil companies. Previously, a \nmajority of this body has voted to fully fund LIHEAP. We have not had \nan offset. This would be an offset. The mechanism I propose would be \nbased upon Senator Schumer's proposal. It does not have the problems \nthat were identified by Senator Domenici with respect to the Dorgan and \nDodd proposal.\n  My amendment will tax these companies at an equitable rate. It will \nraise $2.92 billion. It will fully fund LIHEAP, and it will provide \nrelief to families throughout this country who literally struggle, who \neither choose to heat or to eat. I think we can do much better to help \nour families. There has been majority support of this bill. I hope we \nhave sufficient support that we can actually provide the resources to \nprovide help to struggling families this winter.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I retain any time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I support the LIHEAP program. Most everybody in this \nbody supports the LIHEAP program. I have had an opportunity to vote for \nthat even in recent days. But we have to make sure we do it in the \nright way. I have even tried to get oil companies to contribute to the \nlow-income fuel fund. But here we have the Senator resurrecting the old \nnonworkable windfall profits tax. As Senator Domenici said in previous \ndebate, this is one way of raising the price of gasoline and other \nfuels.\n  I ask you to oppose this amendment, and I would raise the point that \nthe amendment is not germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Budget Act, I \nmove to waive the applicable sections of the act with regard to the \npending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning).

There are 2 minutes equally divided on the \nFeingold amendment. Who yields time? The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank my cosponsors, Senators Conrad, \nChafee, Obama, and Salazar. This is a good old-fashioned, classic pay-\ngo amendment. This is the rule under which we used to operate.\n  It is very simple. Under this pay-go amendment, you pay for what you \nwant. If you want to increase entitlement spending, you have to pay for \nit. If you want to cut taxes, you have to pay for it. With the help of \nthis budget rule, we actually balanced the Federal books, and we did so \nwithout using the Social Security surplus.\n  Without this rule, we have been driven back into the deficit ditch. \nWe have begun to pile up record amounts of debt that our children and \ngrandchildren will have to pay.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this time-tested, commonsense rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I raise the point, first of all, that we \nvoted on a like amendment a couple of weeks ago. But I want to say why \nthe amendment is defective, as I would have said then. It would require \nus to raise taxes to extend expiring tax cuts, but it would allow \nentitlement spending to continue to grow without any offset. This then \ncreates a double standard between current tax law and current spending \nlaw.\n  The amendment also is not germane, and so I raise a point of order.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for the consideration of the pending amendment. I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S13127]]\n\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2651\n\n  There will now be 2 minutes equally divided prior to a vote on the \nSununu amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, my amendment is quite straightforward. It \ndeals with a very large tax loophole that allows Government-sponsored \nentities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to avoid paying any State or \nlocal taxes whatsoever. It is a huge exemption for companies that are \nprivate, for-profit corporations, with their own shareholders. These \ncompanies have far higher profits and return on equity than so-called \nbig oil that we have heard all of this criticism about for the last \nseveral hours.\n  There is no reason they cannot pay State and local taxes like any \nother private, for-profit company, contribute back to those States, \ncities, and towns in a legitimate, straightforward way through the Tax \nCode. I think this is appropriate. There is no reason we should have \nsuch an enormous loophole for companies that earn millions of dollars, \nenough to pay their top executives not $2 million a year or $6 million \na year or $8 million a year but in some cases $10 million a year that \ntheir chief executives have been paid over the last 3 to 5 years.\n  That certainly is the kind of money that makes it legitimate for them \nto be paying State and local taxes like any other for-profit company.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  (Several Senators addressed the Chair).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this amendment only singles out two \ncompanies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have an important mission: \nhomeownership in our States, moving out regional imbalances in the \nmortgage supply, integrating regional mortgage markets. If this \namendment is passed, here is what happens: The housing markets are \nhurt. At a time when we are worried about our housing markets, we are \nworried about a housing bubble that may burst, we are worried about so \nmany parts of the housing market, to pull the rug out from under Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac, which have done an incredible job, would make no \nsense whatsoever.\n  All the other corporations are not talked about here, just Fannie and \nFreddie. Therefore, I think this amendment deserves to be defeated.\n  Mr. President, the pending amendment is not germane. Therefore, I \nraise a point of order pursuant to sections 305(b)(2) and 310(e) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is well taken. The \namendment falls.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2652\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I would like to call up my amendment \nnumbered 2652, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln], for herself, Ms. \n     Snowe, Mr. Obama and Mr. Rockefeller, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2652.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To modify the income threshold used to calculate the \n              refundable portion of the child tax credit)\n\n       At the end of title IV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. $10,000 INCOME THRESHOLD USED TO CALCULATE \n                   REFUNDABLE PORTION OF CHILD TAX CREDIT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 24(d) (relating to portion of \n     credit refundable) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``as exceeds'' and all that follows through \n     ``, or'' in paragraph (1)(B)(i) and inserting ``as exceeds \n     $10,000, or'', and\n       (2) by striking paragraph (3).\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2004.\n       (c) Application of Sunset to This Section.--Each amendment \n     made by this section shall be subject to title IX of the \n     Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 to \n     the same extent and in the same manner as the provision of \n     such Act to which such amendment relates.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, \nthe gulf breezes blew back the curtains and America and the world very \nclearly saw the face of poverty in the United States. We and the rest \nof the world saw a situation where many of our poorest families, our \nAmerican families, were left to fend for themselves--many not even able \nto afford a bus ticket out of town to evacuate.\n  We find ourselves today reconciling our priorities, something that \nhard-working American families do every day. They reconcile their \nbudgets, they reconcile their priorities, to decide what is essential \nto that family and what is a luxury.\n  I do not believe we can have this discussion today without bringing \nup what I find, in our Nation, to be one of our greatest priorities and \nby far one of our greatest blessings, and that is our children. I \nbelieve we have an opportunity right now to help lift those families in \nLouisiana and, indeed, across this entire Nation. In 2001 and again in \n2003, Senator Snowe and I worked together to make sure that working \nfamilies of many low-income children were included in the child tax \ncredit.\n  Unfortunately, a recent report, highlighted in the New York Times, \nshows that almost one-third of children do not qualify for that child \ntax credit because they are in families earning too low an income. When \nyou break that finding down by race, it is even more disheartening. \nAbout half of all African-American children and half of all Latino \nchildren are left out of the full tax credit, child tax credit, because \ntheir family's earnings are too low to qualify.\n  We are talking about working families. To qualify for this tax \ncredit, you have to be working and you have to have children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used her 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank my colleagues for listening. I understand, due \nto the refundable nature of this credit, it is not germane to the \nreconciliation bill, and as a result, I will not ask for a vote, but I \ndo ask our colleagues to\n\n[[Page S13128]]\n\nremember what our priorities are tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under previous order, the amendment is \nwithdrawn.\n  There is now 2 minutes equally divided prior to a vote on the Schumer \namendment.\n  The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2635\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this amendment creates a temporary levy \non the excess profits of U.S. oil companies and it does it in a \ndifferent way. It takes that money and provides a nonrefundable tax \ncredit of $100 in 2005 for every person in the household. The revenue \nmechanism in my amendment is an actual tax on windfall profits that \nexceed a 3-year historic average. That makes it easy for companies to \ncalculate. Unlike the other windfall profits tax amendments that have \ncome forward, this one will not increase production costs and fuel \ncosts for American consumers. That is because it is levied on profits, \nnot production; not on profits when oil is above $40 a barrel but only \nwhen the band of profits exceeds a set level.\n  This was the same mechanism that Senator Reed used for LIHEAP, and it \ndid get a good number of votes--50. The revenue of the amendment goes \nback to the U.S. taxpayer, not to any program, not to the Government, \nwith a nonrefundable credit of $100 for every person in their \nhousehold, and that is for 2005 only. It is revenue neutral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment. This is an \nincrease in the price of gasoline. Also, I don't know how many times we \nhave to vote on a windfall profits tax. This is at least the third or \nfourth time.\n  Although there is a tax credit that the tax funds, I want everybody \nto know there is no guarantee that the tax will not be passed on to \nconsumers with these higher prices at the pump as well as home heating.\n  This amendment raises revenue. The bill before us raises revenue from \noil already taxed. This new tax is not well designed and should be \ndefeated.\n  I raise a point of order that the amendment is not germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I move to waive the relevant portions of the Budget Act \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant Journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Mississippi (Mr. Lott).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 33, nays 65, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 341 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--33\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Clinton\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--65\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Roberts\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Corzine\n     Lott\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 33, the nays are \n65. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2653, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes equally divided prior to \nthe motion on the Reid amendment.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is a bipartisan amendment. It is very \nsimple, direct, and to the point. We need more electricity that does \nnot rely on increasingly expensive natural gas.\n  The quickest way to get more electricity without using more natural \ngas is through the increased use of renewables with greater efficiency.\n  Unfortunately, the deadlines for the renewable energy and efficiency \ntax incentives that we now have in law cut off much too soon to be \nreally effective. So this amendment extends those deadlines through \n2010 to match the current tax incentives for conventional and fossil \nenergy projects.\n  I urge Members to support this amendment. It is fair, it is paid for, \nand it will make a quick and significant dent in the Nation's \nenormously expensive natural gas consumption.\n  Nevadans and all Americans rely heavily on natural gas for \nelectricity and heating. This Congress needs to take action to address \nthe insanely high prices of natural gas as soon as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Kerry, Snowe, Salazar, \nLautenberg, Bayh, Bingaman, Jeffords, and Feinstein be added as \ncosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I happen to be the original author of \nsection 45, renewable fuels.\n  I have extended this provision already through 2008. The amendment \nwill undermine the reconciliation bill by going beyond our 5-year \nbudget window, and the amendment is no longer paid for.\n  So, regrettably, I oppose this specific amendment. But as the author \nof section 45, you can be assured that when it is necessary to extend \nit, we will. I ask you to vote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2653), as modified, was rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2601\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes equally divided on \nthe Nelson of Florida amendment.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, all of you have heard from your \nsenior citizens. With the implementation of the prescription drug bill, \nour seniors have so many plans to choose from that they are confused--\nand, in some cases, they are bewildered; in some cases, they are \nfrightened about making the wrong choice by the deadline and then not \nhaving the opportunity to correct it for 1 year.\n  This amendment would extend the deadline from May to December. I hope \nfor the sake of our seniors that you will vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this amendment is simply not necessary. \nThe first enrollment period began--can you believe it--just 2 days ago, \nand somebody says, You know, it is not long enough. It is going to last \nfor 6 months--until May 15.\n  There are lots of resources available. As one example, States have \ncounselors available to assist beneficiaries under the State Health \nInsurance Program.\n  That is the whole point of that program--to help beneficiaries \nunderstand the Medicare benefits in the legislation.\n  The bottom line is that it is no picnic to sort through the fine \nprint of health insurance. It even may rank among the most unpopular \nand complicated responsibilities of American adulthood--like \ndeciphering your income tax.\n  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services developed a nationwide \nnetwork of other community-based organizations that can provide \nbeneficiaries one-on-one assistance. The prescription drug plans base \ntheir proposal to serve Medicare beneficiaries on the enrollment period \nspecified in the law. The amendment would affect those proposals and \ncould lead to higher costs for both beneficiaries and the government.\n\n[[Page S13129]]\n\n  I, for one, am tired of people on the other side seeming to have a \nlack of confidence in our American senior citizens who are often well \ninformed about the choices they can make and make good decisions.\n  This amendment is not needed, and I raise a point of order on \ngermaneness.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, how much time do I have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen seconds.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, so much of what the Senator \nfrom Iowa has said simply has not been the case--hundreds of plans that \nseniors are having to choose between.\n  I move to waive the relevant parts of the Budget Act, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Mississippi (Mr. Lott).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

On this question, the yeas are 51, the nays \nare 47. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having \nvoted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained. The amendment falls.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there are four votes remaining. It is my \nunderstanding they will all be voiced. However, other Senators have \nsaid they have amendments they want to offer, as well. It is \nappropriate we begin to cut off the number of amendments we consider \ntonight. Four Senators contacted me: Senator Boxer, Senator Dayton, \nSenator Kerry, and Senator Landrieu. The time has come to limit the \nnumber of amendments we have tonight. We have done a pretty good job \naccommodating Senators.\n  I ask unanimous consent after the three remaining amendments--\nSenators Bingaman, Durbin, and Nelson--are taken up, and I am told will \nall be voiced, that following those amendments only the amendments then \nbe in order are amendments offered by Senator Boxer, Senator Dayton, \nSenator Kerry, and Senator Landrieu, and that those be the only \namendments remaining to be considered to the bill tonight and to the \nbill at all.\n  I amend that by saying it is my understanding that Senator Landrieu \nhas two, but they will be voiced and not require a recorded vote, and \nthere will be a managers' amendment that will be in order to the bill. \nSenator Harkin would like to be added to the list with one \namendment. So, therefore, it will be: Boxer, Dayton, Kerry, Landrieu, \nLandrieu--again, Landrieu's will be voiced--and Harkin. I am hopeful \nsome of these others will also be voiced when we get to them.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, in the \nrequest, please note I have two amendments.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Senator Dayton has two amendments.\n  Mr. DAYTON. May I ask, do the managers intend to have final passage \ntonight?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is our intention.\n  Mr. DAYTON. All right. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2642\n\n  There is 2 minutes equally divided prior to a vote on the Bingaman \namendment.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order. We are making \na lot of progress tonight, and we will make even greater progress if \nthe Senate stays in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Kerry, and Senator Snowe. This is an amendment that \nwill create a tax credit for small businesses, to encourage them to \noffer employees health insurance. By ``small businesses,'' I have \ndefined that in the amendment as employers with 50 or fewer employees.\n  In my State, one of the biggest problems I hear that small employers \ncomplain about is their inability to cover the high cost of health \ncare. This is a nonrefundable tax credit for the purchase of health \ninsurance by the employer. The tax credit would range from 30 percent \nto 50 percent of the cost of a qualified health insurance expense, with \nsmaller employers getting the largest credit.\n  This is absolutely essential if we are going to expand health care \ncoverage in the country. It is fully offset. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment and add it to this legislation before we \ncomplete final passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I know this amendment is well-intended \nbecause if there is anything I hear from my constituents, particularly \nsmall business people, it is the problems with health insurance. But it \nis not going to work with this legislation because it is going to make \nthe reconciliation process out of order.\n  So I ask the Members to oppose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2642) was rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2623\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 minutes evenly divided prior \nto a vote on the Durbin amendment.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this amendment provides a fully offset tax \ncredit to the very best companies in America. We call them patriotic \nemployers. They are employers who invest in creating jobs in the United \nStates, not overseas. They are employers who pay a decent wage, at \nleast $7.75 an hour. They are employers who provide a retirement plan, \neither defined benefit or defined contribution, matching at least 5 \npercent of workers' contributions. They are employers who pay health \ninsurance, up to 60 percent of the workers' health care premiums. And \nthey are employers who make up the difference when their employees, who \nare in the Guard and Reserve, go off to serve their country.\n  These are the very best employers in America. We should reward them \nwith a 1-percent tax credit, fully offset. Stand up for the best \nemployers in America. Support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this amendment is also well intended. It \nis not germane. I am not going to raise a point of germaneness. I raise \nthe point that it does not fit in with the reconciliation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2623) was rejected.\n\n[[Page S13130]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Craig-\nRockefeller amendment also be added to the list of amendments still in \norder. And that will be it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator restate the request.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Craig-\nRockefeller amendment be added to the list of amendments still in order \ntonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in conjunction with the Craig amendment, \nI had an amendment I was going to offer as a substitute. So I want the \nGrassley amendment on there as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2625\n\n  There will now be 2 minutes equally divided prior to a vote on the \nNelson amendment.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2625.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, it has already been offered \nand is ready.\n  Mr. President, the Treasury Department has the capacity by law to \noutsource contracts to collect unpaid tax debts. As it currently \nstands, as they contract with employers, many of the benefits that have \nexisted in the past for the hiring of disabled workers, disabled \nveterans, would not carry forth in these contract situations as they do \nfor employment in the Federal Government.\n  This amendment will enable the Treasury Department, in awarding \ncontracts, to give a preference to those companies that hire and engage \ndisabled workers and disabled veterans. There is no tax money involved \nin this. There is no tax credit. They just have a preference if they \nhire disabled workers. These disabled workers will come off the Social \nSecurity SSI benefits and the disability DI benefits. They will become \ntaxpaying citizens.\n  I think this is a great amendment. I hope my colleagues will accept \nit.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, 15 million persons with disabilities are \nunemployed and actively seeking employment. There simply has been no \nmeasurable change in the unemployment situation for persons with \ndisabilities since the American's with Disabilities Act. That is \nunacceptable. It is wrong. It is something we have to change. We can do \nbetter, and we have to do better.\n  Senator Nelson from Nebraska and I have an amendment that will do \njust that. Our amendment would establish a preference under the debt \ncollection contracting program for contractors who hire people with \ndisabilities and disabled veterans.\n  This amendment would require that at least a specified percentage of \nthe individuals employed by the contractor to provide debt collection \nservices qualify as people with disabilities or disabled veterans.\n  A provision of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 authorized the \nInternal Revenue Service to contract with private collection agencies \nto collect certain past due income taxes. If the same tax collection \nactivities were still conducted by Federal employees, current law would \ngive employment preferences to disabled veterans in filling those \nFederal jobs. In addition, if other persons with disabilities were \nemployed by the Federal Government in those jobs, they would benefit \nfrom the Federal Government's long history of promoting job \nopportunities for people with disabilities.\n  By enacting legislation to privatize debt collection and improve the \nIRS' tax collection efforts, Congress certainly did not intend to \ncurtail the Government's commitment to creating meaningful job \nopportunities for people with disabilities and disabled veterans. So I \nurge my fellow Senators to support this amendment. Again, there are 15 \nmillion persons with disabilities who are unemployed and actively \nseeking employment. We have an opportunity now to help put them back to \nwork.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, there are 15 million people with \ndisabilities who are unemployed in this country. This amendment will \nhelp in a small way to deal with that problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2625) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2634\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2634 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2634.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the amendment I \nam offering with Senator Kerry to make two simple yet critical \nimprovements to the earned income credit and to reduce the Federal \ndeficit. Our amendment provides relief from the marriage penalty and \nfrom the military service penalty faced by many low-income taxpayers.\n  The EITC is one of the most effective programs to lift working \nAmericans out of poverty. It rewards work, reduces tax burdens, and \nsupplement wages that help a family to be self-sufficient.\n  It is an idea that Republicans and Democrats can agree on because it \nworks. Study after study has demonstrated that the EITC increases \nemployment among single mothers and reduces reliance on cash welfare \nassistance. The EITC lifts millions of children and families out of \npoverty each year. Census data show that in 2003, the poverty rate \namong children would have been nearly 25 percent higher without the \nEITC.\n  Established by the Ford administration in 1975 and celebrated by \nRonald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, this is a program \nthat has long enjoyed bipartisan support. President Reagan \ncharacterized the EITC as one of the best ``pro-family'' and ``anti-\npoverty'' programs.\n  Unfortunately, as currently structured, the EITC has a marriage \npenalty. Working parents receive less tax relief if they marry than if \nthey stay single. If we want to reduce poverty and improve the life \nchances of poor children, the last thing we should do is penalize \nmarriage. Children with married parents generally have much lower rates \nof poverty and better educational outcomes. Fixing the marriage penalty \nis a matter of common sense.\n  It is also something that this body agreed on in the 2001 tax bill. \nUnfortunately, unlike the marriage penalty relief for middle-income \ntaxpayers, which was accelerated in 2003, full relief for the low-\nincome marriage penalty was delayed until 2008.\n  Our amendment provides full marriage penalty relief in 2006 rather \nthan requiring married taxpayers to endure further delay.\n  Of all the tax breaks that Congress considers important, this should \nbe among the first deserving action. It is relatively inexpensive. It \nwill have the strongest economic stimulus effect. It will improve the \nfairness of the Tax Code.\n\n[[Page S13132]]\n\n  The second fix proposed by this amendment is to ensure that the \nfamilies of our men and women in combat are not deprived of their tax \nbenefits. In the midst of war, are we really going to tell our troops \nthat their combat pay doesn't count as earned income for purposes of \ncalculating tax credits?\n  That is hard to image. Our amendment extends the tax protection for \ncombat pay through 2007. Our troops not only earn their combat pay, but \nthey have also earned our respect. They deserve our commitment of \nsupport.\n  The combined cost of these important fixes is about 2 percent of the \ncost of the tax reconciliation package and provides relief to our most \nneedy taxpayers. Nevertheless, it is important that even this tax cut \nbe deficit neutral. Congress has to make choices and set priorities and \ncannot get away with new spending or tax cuts that are not paid for. \nAmerican families expect this country to pay for its priorities.\n  To pay for relief from the marriage penalty and relief from the \nmilitary service penalty, this amendment closes a tax loophole related \nto foreign entities by changing sale-in and lease-out provisions. This \nsensible change raises more than the cost of the important EITC fixes.\n  Unlike the tax package as a whole, this amendment does not worsen the \ndeficit, and it does not shift the burden from those in our society \nfortunate to have the most to those who have the least.\n  Our amendment is fair. It is fiscally responsible. It is an example \nof the sort of tax policy adjustments that we ought to be focused on in \nreconciliation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support fiscally responsible relief of the \nmarriage penalty and military service penalty for low-income families, \nand I ask you to support this amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this amendment does not raise taxes. It \ndoes not require a new offset. What it does is provide for our combat \ntroops who currently have the ability to take combat pay and make it \ncount against the earned income tax credit. Believe it or not, there \nare troops who need that and use that. It expires at the end of this \nyear. What this amendment does is continue it into 2007 through the end \nof 2007. Secondly, it does something else. It provides a more rapid \nrelief of the marriage penalty which is now charged to people who get \nthe earned income tax credit.\n  Now, this was already passed under the 2001 tax legislation but will \nnot go into effect until 2008. This is paid for by an offset we have \nalready passed, and there is sufficient money in that offset to \naccelerate the marriage penalty reduction so that we reward parents \nwith kids who work and we take away the marriage penalty and help our \ntroops at the same time.\n  I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the substance of the legislation is \ndifficult to argue with, but this is an outlay, and you can't have \noutlays in this particular reconciliation bill. So I raise the point of \norder.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections thereof for purposes of this amendment.\n  We already have the yeas and nays.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays with respect to the motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Mississippi (Mr. Lott).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, this amendment would provide a Federal tax \ncredit to farmers for 30 percent of their 2005 energy costs up to \n$3,000 per farmer. Qualified energy costs are those for fuels, \nutilities, fertilizers, heating and drying used in farming businesses \nof taxpayers during calendar year 2005.\n  As my colleagues know, farmers have been especially hard hit by \nsoaring energy prices. In addition to skyrocketing energy costs, many \nfarmers have been hit with higher transportation costs. In the \naftermath of Hurricane Katrina, American farmers desperately need \nrelief.\n  The estimated $3 billion cost of this measure is more than offset by \nclosing the tax loophole that gives a foreign oil and gas income tax \ncredit for oil companies that provides $4.1 billion over 5 years.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is one of those amendments we have \ndealt with four or five times. It is a tax on consumers by raising the \nprice of gasoline. It may be used for a good purpose, but it affects \nthe germaneness. I raise a point of order on germaneness. I ask my \ncolleagues to vote against the amendment.\n  Mr. DAYTON.

Mr. President, this amendment does three things. One, it \nstops next year's scheduled phaseout of the so-called PEP and Pease \nprovisions, a phaseout that would cost the\n\n[[Page S13134]]\n\nTreasury $29 billion in the first 5 years and explodes to $146 billion \nin 10 years after that. Over half of this money goes to people making \nover $1 million a year.\n  What I would do with that is reduce the deficit by $146 billion over \nthat decade and, secondly, to increase the additional child care \ncredit, making over 600,000 working families eligible and raising the \namount that over 6 million families get for the additional child care \ncredit. These are people who are making around the minimum wage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is another way of cutting back on \nthe mortgage deduction, the charitable deduction, and the State and \nlocal tax deduction. When these provisions of phaseout of deductions \nwere put in years ago, it was subterfuge for raising the marginal tax \nrate without raising the marginal tax rate.\n  From Iowa, we are very transparent. If one wants to raise the \nmarginal tax rate, raise the marginal tax rate but do not do it by \nsubterfuge. Besides, this amendment is not germane. I raise a point of \ngermaneness.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Pursuant to section 904 of the Budget Act, I move to \nwaive the point of order and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

VALUATION OF EMPLOYEE PERSONAL USE OF \n                   NONCOMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT.\n\n       (a) In General.--For purposes of Federal income tax \n     inclusion, the value of any employee personal use of \n     noncommercial aircraft shall equal the excess (if any) of--\n       (1) greater of--\n       (A) the fair market value of such use, or\n       (B) the actual cost of such use (including all fixed and \n     variable costs), over\n       (2) any amount paid by or on behalf of such employee for \n     such use.\n       (b) Effective Date.--Subsection (a) shall apply to use \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, this amendment raises money. It does so by \nending tax avoidance by high-paid corporate executives through their \npersonal use of company airplanes. A recent Wall Street Journal article \ndescribed the exorbitant uses of corporate jets for personal \nrecreation, largely untaxed, that costs company shareholders and other \ntaxpayers millions of dollars per year. One CEO made eight weekend \nroundtrips from his Pittsburgh office to his $5 million home in Naples, \nFL, where he played golf at his exclusive private club. If the \ndirectors and shareholders of that company want to provide that \npersonal luxury perk to an executive already paid $4 million a year, I \nguess that is their business. But these executives should pay taxes on \nwhat are clearly personal benefits, and they should pay taxes on the \nactual values of those benefits, not on some artificially low fictional \ncost.\n  Working men and women have to value their benefits properly for tax \npurposes or they get penalized if they do not. Certainly, the \nwealthiest people in America should also have to value their luxury \nperks properly. My amendment would raise $95 million over 10 years, \naccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation, and will also reduce a \ntruly outrageous and self-indulgent practice.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays. I will accept a voice vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent we accept this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING DOHA ROUND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) are \n     currently engaged in a round of trade negotiations known as \n     the Doha Development Agenda (Doha Round).\n       (2) The Doha Round includes negotiations aimed at \n     clarifying and improving disciplines under the Agreement on \n     Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on \n     Tariffs and Trade 1994 (Antidumping Agreement) and the \n     Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (Subsidies \n     Agreement).\n       (3) The WTO Ministerial Declaration adopted on November 14, \n     2001 (WTO Paper No. WT/MIN(01)/DEC/1) specifically provides \n     that the Doha Round negotiations are to preserve the ``basic \n     concepts, principles and effectiveness'' of the Antidumping \n     Agreement and the Subsidies Agreement.\n       (4) In section 2102(b)(14)(A) of the Bipartisan Trade \n     Promotion Authority Act of 2002, the Congress mandated that \n     the principal negotiating objective of the United States with \n     respect to trade remedy laws was to ``preserve the ability of \n     the United States to enforce rigorously its trade laws . . . \n     and avoid agreements that lessen the effectiveness of \n     domestic and international disciplines on unfair trade, \n     especially dumping and subsidies''.\n       (5) The countries that have been the most persistent and \n     egregious violators of international fair trade rules are \n     engaged in an aggressive effort to significantly weaken the \n     disciplines provided in the Antidumping Agreement and the \n     Subsidies Agreement and undermine the ability of the United \n     States to effectively enforce its trade remedy laws.\n       (6) Chronic violators of fair trade disciplines have put \n     forward proposals that would substantially weaken United \n     States trade remedy laws and practices, including mandating \n     that unfair trade orders terminate after a set number of \n     years even if unfair trade and injury are likely to recur, \n     mandating that trade remedy duties reflect less than the full \n     margin of dumping or subsidization, mandating higher de \n     minimis levels of unfair trade, making cumulation of the \n     effects of imports from multiple countries more difficult in \n     unfair trade investigations, outlawing the critical practice \n     of ``zeroing'' in antidumping investigations, mandating the \n     weighing of causes, and mandating other provisions that make \n     it more difficult to prove injury.\n       (7) United States trade remedy laws have already been \n     significantly weakened by numerous unjust and activist WTO \n     dispute settlement decisions which have created new \n     obligations to which the United States never agreed.\n       (8) Trade remedy laws remain a critical resource for \n     American manufacturers, agricultural producers, and \n     aquacultural producers in responding to closed foreign \n     markets, subsidized imports, and other forms of unfair trade, \n     particularly in the context of the challenges currently faced \n     by these vital sectors of the United States economy.\n       (9) The United States had a current account trade deficit \n     of approximately $668,000,000,000 in 2004, including a trade \n     deficit of almost $162,000,000,000 with China alone, as well \n     as a trade deficit of $40,000,000,000 in advanced technology.\n       (10) United States manufacturers have lost over 3,000,000 \n     jobs since June 2000, and United States manufacturing \n     employment is currently at its lowest level since 1950.\n       (11) Many industries critical to United States national \n     security are at severe risk from unfair foreign competition.\n       (12) The Congress strongly believes that the proposals put \n     forward by countries seeking to undermine trade remedy \n     disciplines in the Doha Round would result in serious harm to \n     the United States economy, including significant job losses \n     and trade disadvantages.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should not be a signatory to any \n     agreement or protocol with respect to the Doha Development \n     Round of the World Trade Organization negotiations, or any \n     other bilateral or multilateral trade negotiations, that--\n       (A) adopts any proposal to lessen the effectiveness of \n     domestic and international disciplines on unfair trade or \n     safeguard provisions, including proposals--\n       (i) mandating that unfair trade orders terminate after a \n     set number of years even if unfair trade and injury are \n     likely to recur;\n       (ii) mandating that trade remedy duties reflect less than \n     the full margin of dumping or subsidization;\n       (iii) mandating higher de minimis levels of unfair trade;\n       (iv) making cumulation of the effects of imports from \n     multiple countries more difficult in unfair trade \n     investigations;\n       (v) outlawing the critical practice of ``zeroing'' in \n     antidumping investigations; or\n       (vi) mandating the weighing of causes or other provisions \n     making it more difficult to prove injury in unfair trade \n     cases; and\n       (B) would lessen in any manner the ability of the United \n     States to enforce rigorously its trade laws, including the \n     antidumping, countervailing duty, and safeguard laws;\n       (2) the United States trade laws and international rules \n     appropriately serve the public interest by offsetting \n     injurious unfair trade, and that further ``balancing \n     modifications'' or other similar provisions are unnecessary \n     and would add to the complexity and difficulty of achieving \n     relief against injurious unfair trade practices; and\n       (3) the United States should ensure that any new agreement \n     relating to international disciplines on unfair trade or \n     safeguard provisions fully rectifies and corrects decisions \n     by WTO dispute settlement panels or the Appellate Body that \n     have unjustifiably and negatively impacted, or threaten to \n     negatively impact, United States law or practice, including a \n     law or practice with respect to foreign dumping or \n     subsidization.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n[[Page S13136]]\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join Senator \nRockefeller and myself tonight in speaking clearly to our negotiators \nas they head for the Doha Round in Hong Kong in December.\n  Congress has made it clear time and time again that U.S. negotiators \ncannot bring back a trade agreement from the Doha that weakens U.S. \nantidumping and countervailing duty and safeguard laws that this \nCongress has put in place. These laws are widely recognized as critical \ntools to U.S. manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, and workers who \nsometimes are forced to fight for their rights to compete in fair \nenvironments.\n  As we open up the world's trade, let us make sure that we have in \nplace the tools necessary to keep it fair and balanced, and not \nnegotiated away by our negotiations.\n  It is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution with that instruction in mind.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, for months we have seen escalating \npetroleum and natural gas prices, magnified by the effects of three \nhurricanes. Now with the onset of winter, home heating oil prices are \npredicted to increase 44 percent in Maine, while natural gas is \npredicted to be 41 percent higher nationwide. My colleagues and I have \ncalled for LIHEAP funding increases for months on each spending bill. \nThis amendment here may be our last chance this year to keep our \nseniors and disadvantaged from choosing between eating and heating. No \nAmerican should face this choice.\n  My amendment would add $2.92 billion in LIHEAP funding, bringing it \nup to the fully authorized level. It is fully offset. The offset \naddresses a longstanding problem: government contractors aren't paying \ntaxes. It requires government agencies to withhold income tax for the \nemployees of government contractors at a rate of 1.75 percent when they \npurchase goods and services from government contractors.\n  There should be no mistake--this is an emergency and a crisis we know \nis coming, and it would be an abrogation of our responsibility to stand \nby and allow it to occur. It does not take a crystal ball to predict \nthe dire consequences when home heating oil in Maine is $2.45 per \ngallon, up 38 cents from a year ago, and kerosene prices average $2.75 \na gallon, 51 cents higher than this time last year and it's not even \nwinter yet.\n  This is a necessity of life--so much so that 73 percent of households \nin a recent survey reported they would cut back on, and even go \nwithout, other necessities such as food, prescription drugs, and \nmortgage and rent payments. The facts are that LIHEAP is projected to \nhelp 5 million households nationwide this winter.\n  On November 4, a representative of the Senior Companion Program \ncalled my Bangor Office to say that they already had to admit an \nelderly client into the hospital due to hypothermia, because she \ncouldn't afford enough heating oil. And, it is only the beginning of \nNovember. This simply should not be allowed to happen again.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this amendment would express the sense of \nthe Senate that any increases in revenues to the Treasury as a result \nof this act, above the amounts specified in the reconciliation \ninstructions, shall be dedicated to the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, also known as LIHEAP, up to the fully authorized \namount.\n  Just a few months ago, the President signed into law the Energy \nPolicy Act of 2005. This law, which passed the Senate overwhelmingly, \nauthorizes $5.1 billion for the LIHEAP program for Fiscal Year 2006. \nUnfortunately, even though Chairman Specter worked very hard to \nincrease funding in the Labor-HHS bill, that bill only provides $2.2 \nbillion in LIHEAP funding but $2.2 billion is not nearly enough. The \namendment I am offering today expresses the sense of the Senate that up \nto an additional $2.9 billion in excess revenues should be made \navailable to the LIHEAP program.\n  Our Nation was struck by three extremely powerful hurricanes. While\n\n[[Page S13137]]\n\nthese hurricanes were devastating to the people of Florida and the gulf \ncoast, they have also had a major impact on the rest of the Nation. \nJust as the Nation should be building oil supplies for the winter \nheating season, these hurricanes have disrupted our already strained \nsupplies and sent both heating oil and gasoline prices to painfully \nhigh levels.\n  While high energy prices have been challenging for almost all \nAmericans, they impose an especially difficult burden on low-income \nfamilies and on the elderly living on limited incomes. Low-income \nfamilies spend a greater percentage of their incomes on energy and have \nfewer options available when energy prices soar. High energy prices can \neven cause families to choose between keeping the heat on, putting food \non the table, or paying for much-needed prescription medicine. These \nare choices that no American family should ever have to make.\n  We need more LIHEAP funding this year. Let me describe the situation \nthat we are facing in my home state. While the official start of winter \nis still 2 months away, temperatures have already fallen below freezing \nin much of Maine. In Maine, 78 percent of households use home heating \noil to heat their homes. Currently, the cost of home heating oil is \nroughly $2.34 per gallon, $0.38 above last year's already inflated \nprices. These high prices greatly increase the need for assistance, and \nat least 3,000 additional Mainers are expected to apply for LIHEAP \nfunding this year. With more people in need of assistance, the benefit \nis expected to fall by roughly 10 percent to $440 per qualifying \nhousehold. Unfortunately, at today's high prices, $440 is only enough \nto purchase 188 gallons of oil--far below last year's equivalent \nbenefit of 251 gallons and not nearly enough to get through even a \nsmall portion of a Maine winter. With rising prices and falling \nbenefits, we have a problem. Just to purchase the same amount of oil \nthis year as last year, Maine would need an additional $10 million in \nLIHEAP funds.\n  The bill before us is still a work in progress, and at this point it \nis impossible to know whether the final bill that we pass shall provide \nany increases in revenues to the Treasury beyond the amounts specified \nin the reconciliation instructions. I would note that Senator Wyden \noffered an amendment in committee that eliminates an unnecessary tax \nsubsidy for major oil and gas companies. This subsidy is worth hundreds \nof millions of dollars. I believe we should eliminate even more \nunnecessary subsidies for oil gas companies. Regardless, I believe that \nshould this act result in any increase in revenues to the Treasury \nbeyond the reconciliation instructions, those revenues should go to the \nLIHEAP program, up to the fully authorized amount.\n  With winter fast approaching and energy prices soaring, home heating \nbills are set to pound family budgets mercilessly. For low income \nfamilies, LIHEAP funds can be the factor that prevents families from \nhaving to choose between turning off the heat or putting food on the \ntable. I call on my colleagues to support this amendment expressing the \nsense of the Senate that we should fully fund the LIHEAP program.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to vote against this \namendment. I am not going to raise a point of order.\n  I ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2667) was rejected.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2670\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I send to the desk the managers' \namendment.\n  Traditionally, managers' amendments have been worked out with both \nsides of the aisle.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I filed an amendment to the Tax \nRelief Act of 2005, S. 2020, to provide additional relief for taxpayers \nfrom the individual alternative minimum tax by truly holding harmless \nall taxpayers not currently impacted by the AMT. Senator Wyden is a \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  This afternoon, the managers of the S. 2020, Senators Grassley and \nBaucus, crafted a managers' amendment including identical language to \nour amendment, and that managers' amendment was accepted by unanimous \nconsent and is now part of the legislation that will pass the Senate.\n  I think we misname this tax when we call it the alternative minimum \ntax. We should call it the family tax, for the simple reason that most \ntaxpayers get hit by the AMT because of where they live and because \nthey have children.\n  We can call it the AMT or any other innocuous name we like here on \nCapitol Hill or at the IRS, but in practice it is a tax on children--it \nis the family tax. If you live in a certain State, and you don't want \nto pay this family tax, about the only thing you can do is to not start \na family. We are literally punishing Americans for having children and \nbuilding families.\n  In May, we heard testimony from the Urban Institute about how the AMT \nwas once a ``class tax'' but will soon become a ``mass tax'' because \nmore and more taxpayers--mostly because they want children--will be \nforced to pay the AMT.\n  Nina Olson, the National Taxpayer Advocate who works every day on the \npractical implications of what we do here, has repeatedly testified \nabout the complexities and the inequities of the AMT. She said \nsarcastically that the AMT ``penalizes taxpayers for such classic tax \navoidance behavior as having children or living in a high-tax state.''\n  If you look at the history of the AMT, you can see that it badly \nneeds reform.\n  The individual AMT was created in 1969 to address the 155 individual \ntaxpayers with incomes exceeding $200,000 who paid no Federal income \ntax in 1966. It applied to a tiny minority of households. But it is \nrapidly growing from those 155 taxpayers in 1969 to 1 million in 1999 \nto almost 29 million by 2010. It now affects families with incomes well \nbelow $200,000. By the end of the decade, repealing the AMT will cost \nmore than repealing the regular income tax.\n  Unfortunately, we cannot end this family tax today, but we can do \nmore than what is in the bill. When S. 2020 was first brought before \nthe Senate it included a provision that would extend the current \nexemption level and indexes it for inflation. This provision seeks to \n``patch'' or ``hold harmless'' these middle-class taxpayers, but it is \na patch with a hole in it. It does not cover all the moderate income \nindividuals who are impacted by the family tax.\n  The Kerry-Wyden amendment, and the enacted Grassley-Baucus amendment, \nwould protect half a million more taxpayers from the family tax than \nthe original bill. This amendment truly holds taxpayers harmless. The \nsame amount of taxpayers that would be impacted by the AMT in 2005 will \nbe impacted in 2006.\n  This means 600,000 million taxpayers will be better off under the \namendment. We should protect as many families as possible from the \nunfair family tax. And this amendment is paid for with an offset that \nhas had bipartisan support and passed the Senate.\n  The cost of our proposal is fully offset. First, it reforms the tax \nlaw that now applies to U.S. citizens living abroad, so the income tax \nexclusion would apply to both foreign income and foreign housing costs. \nUnder current law, individuals get a tax credit for foreign taxes paid. \nThis provision passed the Senate last year and was included in the \nJoint Committee on Taxation recommendation on ways to reduce the tax \ngap. Second, it would modify a provision in the underlying bill that \nmakes modifications to the individual estimated tax-safe harbor to the \nappropriate percentage in 2006.\n  The Senate should stop punishing taxpayers because of where they \nlive, because they move from one State to another for work or school, \nor because they decide to start a family. Today we took a step in that \ndirection. I am grateful to Senator Wyden for cosponsoring the \namendment with me, and I am grateful that Senators Grassley and Baucus \nacted as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2670) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n\n[[Page S13138]]\n\n                         combating tax shelters\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment with my \ncolleague, Senator Coleman. I understand portions of our amendment have \nbeen cleared by both sides of the aisle and will be included.\n  I thank Senators Grassley and Baucus for accepting this toughening of \nthe penalties on those who promote abusive tax shelters or aid and abet \ntax evasion. Senators Grassley and Baucus have been battling abusive \ntax shelters for years now, and it is a privilege to have had them as \nallies in this fight.\n  Tax dodging costs the Government between $300 and $350 billion every \nyear. A significant portion of this ``tax gap'' results from abusive \ntax shelters and tax havens. Mr. President, $350 billion is more than \nthe Government spends on Medicare annually and is close to the size of \nthis year's deficit.\n  For 3 years, we have had an indepth subcommittee investigation into \nabusive tax shelters developed, marketed, and carried out by accounting \nfirms, banks, investment advisors, and lawyers. We found that tax \nadvisors cooked up one complex scheme after another, packaged them as \ngeneric ``tax products'' and then peddled the products to thousands of \ntaxpayers across the country. This investigative work provides the \nfoundation for our amendment today.\n  Tax chiseling is undermining the integrity of our tax system. It \nhurts middle income Americans by forcing them to pay for more than \ntheir fair share and constricting resources for essential government \nprograms.\n  The Levin-Coleman provision that the managers have agreed to will \nincrease penalties to 100 percent on persons who promote abusive tax \nshelters or knowingly aid or abet taxpayers to understate their tax \nliability. Currently, promoters face only a 50 percent penalty. Think \nabout this. Why should anyone who illegally pushes an abusive tax \nshelter get to keep half of the profits?\n  Even worse, the current penalty for those who knowingly aid and abet \na taxpayer in understating its tax obligation face a maximum penalty of \n$1,000, or $10,000 for a corporation. But this penalty applies only to \ntax return preparers. It leaves out those who design, market and carry \nout the tax shelter, unless they also prepared the taxpayer's return. \nWhen law firms are getting $50,000 for each cookie-cutter opinion \nletter they issue, the possibility of a $10,000 penalty provides no \ndeterrent whatsoever. That fine is like a jaywalking ticket for robbing \na bank.\n  I am pleased that today we have reached this agreement to toughen the \ncurrent penalties, but I hope that eventually we can enact penalties \nthat cause wrongdoers to not only disgorge their ill-gotten gains, but \nalso pay a monetary fine on top of that. Doing so would be fair and \nwould provide a meaningful deterrent.\n  The Levin-Coleman amendment also prevented abusive tax shelters by \ngetting banks out of the business and authorizing Federal agencies to \nshare information to strengthen abusive tax shelter enforcement. I \nunderstand that Senator Grassley is willing to consider these \nprovisions for inclusion in a future bill, and I look forward to \nworking with the chairman and Senator Baucus and having our staffs work \ntogether on these issues.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Let me say that I agree with the amendment's purpose to \ncombat abusive tax shelters. We need to eradicate the phony tax schemes \nthat abuse our tax laws at the expense of honest taxpayers. I have \nworked hard to enact legislation to combat tax shelters by shutting \nthem down and raising the penalties on those who promote and \nparticipate in those phony deals. This bill contains many more \nprovisions that do just that. I will add to the bill the increased \npenalties on tax shelter promoters and on aiders and abettors, and I \nwill support these provisions in conference. These provisions will help \ndeter the activities of those who sell illegal tax schemes and those \nwho help participants in these schemes.\n  I share the Senator's desire to combat tax shelters, and I share his \ngoals of deterring banks' participation in tax shelters and in \nexploring ways to let agencies work together to prevent tax shelter \nactivity. However, I think that your amendment has some technical \nmatters that I would like my staff to work through with your staff for \nfuture consideration. Combating tax shelters is a constant battle that \nwe will continue to fight.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I share Chairman Grassley's views with respect to curbing \nabusive tax shelters, and I look forward to working with Senators Levin \nand Coleman to shut down these abusive transactions.\n\n\n                              excise taxes\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the distinguished Chair of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, Senator Grassley, yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. The provisions of S. 2020 concerning excise taxes to be \nlevied on transfers of insurance products are of some interest to me. \nIt is clear that there are abuses in the system, and I am appreciative \nof the chairman and his staff for their substantial work to address \nthose problems.\n  It is my concern that the proposed excise tax language is so broadly \ndrawn that it will stop what I believe are legitimate transactions that \nconstitute best practice in this area. I am aware of a commercial loan \nstructure that relies upon a valid insurable interest between donors \nand charities, where the lender has isolated both donors and charities \nfrom all lending risks.\n  Further, there is an agreeable known benefit to the charity at loan \ninception, which is not reliant upon the payment of an insurance death \nbenefit, and the loan structure does not include outside investors. The \nloan is never recharacterized from inception to payoff as anything but \na loan.\n  Is it the intent of the chairman in this provision to shut down a \nstraightforward loan transaction?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. No, it is my intention that the provision should not \naffect the ability of charities to borrow to purchase life insurance, \nparticularly where the people insured are officers, directors, \nemployees or in some cases established donors of the charity that \nbenefits.\n  Mr. HATCH. Does the chairman believe there is room for further \ndiscussion in this area?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Because of the tight timeframe for action, we were not \nable to work out language prior to bringing the bill to the floor. \nWould the chairman be able to give his assurances that he is \nsympathetic to my constituents' concerns and that he will work to \naddress them in a managers' amendment or in conference?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to engage my colleague, Senator \nSalazar, in a colloquy regarding the technical changes adopted in the \nmanager's amendment to the reconciliation bill. We have worked hard to \naddress unintended consequences relating to changes made to treatment \nof Type III organizations. This is very important because there are \nmany fine organizations that support noble and much needed causes. I \nhave some of these organizations in my State of Colorado, including one \ngenerously supported by the Reisher family.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I am happy to engage with my distinguished colleague \nabout the intent of this modification. And I, too, am glad that we were \nable to make these modifications and create a special rule for certain \nholdings of Type III organizations.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Specifically, I am referring to the amendments providing \nfor the special rule for certain holdings of Type III supporting \norganizations if the holdings are held for the benefit of the community \npursuant to the direction of a State attorney general or a State \nofficial with jurisdiction over the Type III supporting organization. \nAs some of us with interest in this provision worked to address \nunintended consequences, we thought it would be a good idea to have the \nAG or State official direction needed to ensure that the abuses that \nconcerned the chairman would be addressed. As State officials issue \nthis general directive, it is our intention that there is not any \nburdensome red tape and that once the direction is given for the Type \nIII organization, the charity is not unnecessarily put in limbo by the \nneed for a reissuance when the official changes. It is safe to say that \nwe intend that once the necessary direction is given as part\n\n[[Page S13139]]\n\nof this compromise, then there is no requirement for renewals by that \nattorney general or subsequent attorney general that would put \nuncertainty at play for the organization. Isn't that my friend's \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I agree with Senator Allard on his understanding and our \nintent. Once an organization is required to retain holdings in any \nbusiness enterprise at the direction of an attorney general, those \nholdings will not constitute excess business holdings as a result of \nsome future directive or another authority coming in and saying \nsomething different. That is precisely the kind of uncertainty we are \nattempting to avoid with these modifications. The special rule \ncontinues to apply. Otherwise, these organizations and their benefit to \nthe community could be put at risk by future inconsistent actions \ndriven by political gain rather than by the benefit to the community. \nAnd we must not lose sight of the fact that the primary goal of these \norganizations is to benefit their community. We all agree it is \nnecessary for an organization to have certainty about its status and \nits exemption from the excess business holdings rules. I commend my \ncolleague from Colorado for his work in having this much needed \nclarification included in the manager's amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his kind remarks. \nThere is no question that we intend to encourage more charitable giving \nin this country. Mr. President, we are a generous nation, as evident \nfrom the amazing outpouring of private support for the recent \nunfortunate rash of natural disasters both here in this country and \nabroad. The donors and the organizations need to be able to rely on the \ndirection of the State attorney general and their legal status and this \namendment does that. I thank my colleague for engaging me in this \ncolloquy. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   EXXON VALDEZ OIL SPILL LITIGATION\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I engage Mr. Grassley in a colloquy \nconcerning income averaglng to recipients of punitive damages awards in \nthe Exxon Valdez oil spill case, Case Number A89-095-CV (HRH). \nSpecifically, I would like to address how this will affect those who \nengage in commercial fishing in Alaska as their occupation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would be happy if Ms. Murkowski \nexplained this issue in further detail.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. As all of us know, the Exxon Valdez ran aground in \nMarch of 1989, spilling 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William \nSound in Alaska. A class action jury trial was held in federal court in \nAnchorage, AK, in 1994. The plaintiffs included 32,000 fishermen among \nothers whose livelihoods were gravely affected by this disaster. The \njury awarded $5 billion in punitive damages to the plaintiff class. The \npunitive damage award has been on repeated appeal by the Exxon \nCorporation since 1994. Many of the original plaintiffs, possibly more \nthan 1,000 people, have already died.\n  Once the punitive damage award of the Exxon Valdez litigation is \nsettled, many fishermen will receive payments to reimburse them for \nfishing income lost due to the environmental consequences of the Exxon \nValdez oil spill. It is estimated that the eventual settlement may be \n$6.75 billion or more.\n  Fishermen already are eligible for income averaging of any fishing \nincome. Section 1301 of the Internal Revenue Code allows fishermen to \naverage fishing income over a 3-year period of time. Therefore, I want \nit to be clear that any commercial fishermen receiving punitive damages \nunder the aforementioned Exxon Valdez oil spill case should be allowed \nto average their income over a 3-year period.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank Ms. Murkowski for explaining \nthis issue in more detail.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the fiscal \ncourse this Senate is pursuing. The legislation before us today will \nunnecessarily add $60 billion to our Nation's debt. But even more \ntroubling is the insistence that reasonable tax cuts be passed using \nthe reconciliation process. I think most Senators in this body believe \nthat today's action is just the first step toward ultimately approving \nmore tax cuts for wealthy investors. I hope that my colleagues will \nreject this scheme.\n  I appreciate the work of the chairman of the Finance Committee, who \ncrafted a bill that includes only broadly supported tax cuts. Tax \nrelief for rebuilding the hurricane-devastated gulf coast; extension \nand enhancement of the R tax credit and the welfare tax credits; \nlimitations on the reach of the alternative minimum tax; and tax \nincentives for charitable giving are all policies that enjoy broad \nbipartisan support.\n  Unfortunately, though, this bill is not fiscally responsible. As the \nDemocratic alternative demonstrates, it is possible to enact the \npopular tax cuts proposed here without adding $60 billion to the debt \nwe pass down to our children and grandchildren. In an age of record \ndeficits, Congress must choose its priorities. We could close tax \nloopholes. We could make it more difficult for companies to avoid \ntaxation by moving their headquarters offshore. We could require oil \ncompanies to pay their fair share of taxes. We could close the tax gap \nby more aggressively enforcing our existing tax code.\n  These reasonable policies are included in the Democratic alternative, \nand I hope that all of my colleagues will support them to restore \nfiscal discipline in this Congress. And to anyone who believes the \nfallacy that ``deficits don't matter,'' I would point out that this \nyear we will spend more money paying interest on our debt than \nproviding health care to our most vulnerable citizens through Medicaid.\n  The budget reconciliation process, which allows for expedited \nconsideration of legislation on the Senate floor, was created so that \nCongress could enact difficult policies in order to reduce our national \ndeficits. Sadly, the process is now being abused to enact policies that \nworsen our deficit and are so narrowly supported that they cannot \ngarner sufficient votes under normal Senate procedures.\n  Foremost among the current proposals that does not enjoy bipartisan \nsupport is, of course, the extension of tax breaks for capital gains \nand dividends. I recognize that the leadership has dropped those \nprovisions from this bill. However, this Senator has absolutely no \nconfidence that the intention of using the reconciliation process to \npass those tax breaks has changed. Extending those tax breaks for even \none additional year would cost $10 billion. And it is important to \nconsider who will get that $10 billion instead of the federal treasury. \nThree quarters of the capital gains and dividend income is received by \ntaxpayers making more than $200,000 per year.\n  In my State of West Virginia, fewer than 17 percent of taxpayers \nreported any dividend income; and fewer than 11 percent of taxpayers \nhad any capital gains. Moreover, we ought to keep in mind that even \nwithout the extra tax breaks in 2009, people will pay at most 20 \npercent taxes on capital gains, which is a lower tax rate than we apply \nto many people's labor. I do not accept the argument that it is a \nnational priority to extend these tax breaks to 2009.\n  The investor tax breaks simply do not compare favorably with the \nprovisions of this bill. With the ever escalating costs of college and \nthe increasing need for a highly educated population that can be \nglobally competitive, it is appropriate to maintain the tax deduction \nfor tuition and fees that made education more affordable for 3.6 \nmillion Americans in 2003, including almost 17,000 West Virginians. And \nas low-income working Americans struggle to save for their retirement, \nI am pleased to support the saver's credit which helped 5.4 million \nAmericans in 2003, including more than 40,000 West Virginians.\n  The tuition deduction, the saver's cedit, and most of the other \nprovisions in this bill enjoy broad bipartisan support. Congress can \nact before the end of this year, in a bipartisan fashion, to extend \nthese important tax provisions, and offset the cost to the treasury.\n  I believe that many Senators on my side of the aisle would welcome an \nopportunity to support legislation providing relief to the gulf coast \nand extending the expiring tax provisions in a fiscally responsible \nway--but without the specter of a reconciliation process that is \nspecifically intended to enact more tax cuts for our wealthiest \ncitizens. I cannot support this bill, and I cannot condone a \nreconciliation process designed to limit the rights of the minority \nwhile increasing the deficit.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in light of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and \nthe\n\n[[Page S13140]]\n\nmounting $319 billion deficit, Americans have increasingly called on \nCongress to account for its spending. The reconciliation process is \ndesigned to answer these calls for fiscal responsibility by forcing \nlawmakers to look deeply and honestly into the federal budget and make \nnecessary spending cuts and provide deserved tax relief.\n  The tax reconciliation bill, currently being considered by the \nSenate, does many worthwhile things to this end--such as extending \nessential tax provisions set to expire this year like increased \nexemption levels for the AMT--and providing incentives to encourage \ncharitable giving. The good effects of these provisions, however, are \nundercut by a fundamental inconsistency in the larger bill--namely, the \nbill that claims to provide tax relief actually raises taxes. Demanding \nmore taxpayer dollars, in an effort to control federal congressional \nspending, is not the answer.\n  Section 561 of the bill, the LIFO provision, not only imposes an \nadditional $4.923 billion tax but does so selectively on the energy \nindustry alone. The LIFO provision artificially raises taxable income \nsolely for a subset of energy businesses, requiring them to report \nhigher profits than those mandated under prevailing accounting rules \nfor the sole purpose of imposing a discriminatory tax on these \nbusinesses. Section 561 calls this ``revaluation of LIFO inventories,'' \nbut let us call this provision what it really is--a windfall profits \ntax.\n  Proponents of a windfall profits tax on the energy industry justify \nthe tax on two grounds: that (1) energy industry companies currently \npay too little in taxes compared to profits, and (2) the tax is \neffective.\n  As to the first, over the past 25 years, oil companies directly paid \nor remitted more than $2.2 trillion in taxes, after adjusting for \ninflation, to Federal and State governments, including excise taxes, \nroyalty payments and State and Federal corporate income taxes. That \namounts to more than three times what they earned in profits during the \nsame period, according to the latest numbers from the Bureau of \nEconomic Analysis and U.S. Department of Energy. And these figures do \nnot include local property taxes, State sales and severance taxes, and \non-shore royalty payments.\n  In addition, far from being excessive, oil industry profits have \nhistorically been below the national average. The most recent \nstatistics available show that this continues to be the case. In the \nsecond quarter of 2005, the oil industry earned 7.7 cents for every \ndollar of sales, where the average profit for all of U.S. industry in \nthe second quarter was 7.9 cents for every dollar of sales. The rate of \nreturn on oil sales for the third quarter of 2005 is slightly higher at \n8.1 cents for every dollar of sale, still very near the average across \nall industries.\n  Even more illustrative, 13 U.S. industries earned higher profits in \nthe second quarter than the oil and natural gas industry, including \nbanking, 19.6 cents; software and services, 17 cents; consumer \nservices, 10.9 cents; and real estate, 8.9 cents. The facts speak for \nthemselves.\n  Proponents of the windfall profit tax also say that the tax is \neffective. In 1990, however, the Congressional Research Service, CRS, \nanalyzed the effects of the windfall profits tax which was enacted in \n1980 and repealed in 1988. CRS found that the tax reduced domestic oil \nproduction from between 3 and 6 percent and increased American \ndependence on foreign oil sources by 8 to 16 percent.\n  Energy markets are cyclical and the industry must manage its business \nin the face of significant price fluctuations. The industry has to ride \nout periods of low prices in anticipation of recovering during the \nperiods of high prices. When oil prices are low, as they were \nthroughout the 1990s, energy industry profits are insufficient to \ninduce investment. Oil supplies are tight today for this reason. When \nprices rise, however, the industry is induced to invest in new \ninfrastructure and production in hopes of capturing the benefits of \nhigher prices. Eventually, this leads to lower prices again.\n  Reinvestment is critical. The Congressional Budget Office estimates \ncapital losses from Hurricane Katrina and Rita in the energy-producing \nindustries will range from $18 billion to $31 billion. Imposing a tax \non profits, however, reduces essential investment in energy production. \nIf taxing profits prevents the energy industry from benefiting during \nperiod of high prices, there will be little incentive to invest in \ndomestic productions, thereby increasing the Nation's dependence on \nforeign oil.\n  The goal of Federal energy policy should not be to hurt--or help--the \nmajor oil companies. The goal should be to help American consumers. \nTaxing capital for investment does not grow jobs, does not grow the \neconomy--only fails American consumers.\n  The tax reconciliation bill is problematic not only for its inclusion \nof the windfall profit tax but also for its omission of a critical \nprovision--the extension of the 15 percent reduced tax rate for \ndividends and capital gains. While critics argue that the reduced tax \nrates of dividends and capital gains are tax cuts for the ``rich'' and \nthat the costs are too high, the lower rates have been remarkably \nsuccessful. Some of its successes include: significantly boosting \ncapital investment, contributing to the economic efficiency of the \ncorporate sector, and dramatically increasing dividend distributions--\nbenefiting all Americans owning dividend-paying stocks, a significant \nnumber of whom are far from wealthy.\n  Specifically, in the year following enactment of the dividend tax \ncut, 113 publicly traded corporations initiated dividend payments for \nthe first time, compared to an average of 22 companies in prior years. \nFurther, through July 29, 2005, the 500 U.S. companies making up the \nStandard & Poor's index alone have increased their dividend payments \n626 times, resulting in a 21 percent increase in average quarterly \ndividends. If these successes are to continue--and reach their full \npotential--reduced tax rates for dividends and capital gains must be \nincluded in any comprehensive tax relief bill.\n  And continued tax relief is what this country needs to both generate \nmore economic growth and encourage individuals and corporations to save \nand invest. I am prepared to vote for a tax relief package--I cannot \nthink of a time in the past when I have not--however, it must be \neffective, and it must actually provide relief. The tax reconciliation \nbill before the Senate falls short of this. I sincerely hope the \nconference report on this bill comes back better and stronger--\neliminating industry-specific tax increases antithetical to the bill's \npurpose while providing for sound relief provisions like the reduction \nin dividend and capital gains tax rates--so that we can satisfactorily \nanswer the American taxpayers' call for a policy of fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I regret that I am unable to vote for \nthe legislation. I support the overwhelming majority of provisions that \nare contained in this bill and appreciate that they need to be extended \nbefore next year so they don't expire. I cannot in good conscience, \nthough, vote for another tax bill that is unpaid for and adds to our \nnational debt. For too many years, the majority has passed tax cuts as \nshort term or temporary measures to mask the real costs of these \nprovisions. We can no longer continue on this course of fiscal \nirresponsibility. It is for this reason that I supported an alternative \noffered by the minority that provided similar tax relief but did it in \na budget neutral fashion by shutting down corporate loopholes. I also \nsupported amendments during debate on this bill that would put back in \nplace budget rules that would prevent Congress from either cutting \ntaxes or raising spending if the net effect is that it adds to our \nnational debt. We operated under these responsible budgetary rules \nduring the previous administration and it gave us our first back-to-\nback years of surplus in generations. In 5 short years we have not only \nsquandered the opportunities that these budgetary surpluses offered us, \nbut we created a fiscal mess that handicaps future generations. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the coming months to head our \nnation back towards the days of surpluses. Unfortunately, this bill is \nnot a step in that direction. Even though I support the majority of \nprovisions contained in it, I must respectively oppose its passage.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, pursuant to section 313(c) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I submit for the\n\n[[Page S13141]]\n\nRecord a list of material in S. 2020 considered to be extraneous under \nsubsections (b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), and (b)(1)(E) of section 313. The \ninclusion or exclusion of material on the following list does not \nconstitute a determination of extraneousness by the Presiding Officer \nof the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Title V--Revenue Offset Provisions\n\n\n                                 senate\n\n       Provision: Sec. 532(c). Violation/Comments: 313(b)(1)(A)--\n     Report to Congress.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I oppose the tax reconciliation bill now \nbefore us. This bill illustrates the cynicism of the whole \nreconciliation process this year, which, at the end of the day, is just \na vehicle to short circuit a full Senate debate on the President's \nunfair tax cuts.\n  The fiscal year 2006 budget resolution instructed the Finance \nCommittee to report up to $70 billion of tax cuts. Only half of those \ntax cuts were to be offset by reconciled spending cuts, so the net \neffect of reconciliation would be to add to the budget deficit. In the \ncurrent economic and budget environment, there is no justification for \nenacting tax cuts that increase the deficit and must be paid for by \nadding to the debt.\n  For various reasons, the bill before us does not contain the full $70 \nbillion of tax cuts. Most notably, it does not include provisions to \nextend the temporary capital gains and dividend tax cuts passed in 2003 \nand set to expire in 2008. It would be wise and prudent budget policy \nto abandon the effort to extend those debt-financed tax cuts, which go \nto taxpayers in the highest income brackets. But what you see is not \nwhat you are going to get. Those provisions will be back. In fact, the \nMajority Leader has said he will not bring a conference report to the \nfloor that does not include an extension of the capital gains and \ndividend provisions.\n  Even without any capital gains and dividend provisions, this tax bill \nprovides benefits mainly to upper-income taxpayers. An analysis by the \nJoint Economic Committee democratic staff finds that about $43 billion \nof the tax cuts can be allocated by family income group. Of those, \nabout 80 percent would accrue to the 20 percent of families with the \nhighest incomes, That fraction will rise when the extension of the \ncapital gains and dividend tax cuts is added in conference.\n  ``What you see is not what you are going to get'' is a phrase that \nalso applies to the spending piece of reconciliation. There is much to \ncriticize in the Senate's $35 billion spending reconciliation bill, but \nany conference bill that comes before us is likely to be far worse, \nwith much larger cuts to benefits that middle- and lower-income \nfamilies rely on that will be way out of all proportion to any tax cuts \nthey might receive.\n  The Senate can take a step toward restoring fiscal discipline by \nvoting down this tax reconciliation bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the tax \nreconciliation bill the Senate is now considering.\n  As with many of my Finance Committee colleagues, I am both relieved \nand disturbed to see this bill on the floor in its present form.\n  I am relieved because it includes many important provisions, \nincluding some that will serve to help keep the economy strong as well \nas particular relief provisions for the areas impacted by the \nhurricanes.\n  However, I am disturbed because we were unable to include in the bill \none of the most important provisions to our continuing prosperity--an \nextension of the lower tax rates for capital gains and dividends.\n  I understand perfectly the reasons some of my colleagues wanted the \nextension removed. In an era of high deficits it is tempting to \npreserve revenue any way we can. While I also want to reduce the \ndeficit, I believe that leaving out the extension for the special tax \nrate for capital gains and dividends will ultimately be \ncounterproductive and harmful to the economy.\n  In an economy where there is universal agreement that Americans are \nnot saving enough, the last thing we want to do is decrease the \nincentives to save. I urge my colleagues to hearken back to the debates \nwe had over Social Security reform earlier this year.\n  Over the course of those debates, we found that there was substantial \ndisagreement in the Senate over how to reform Social Security. But at \nthe same time, nearly everyone seemed to agree that Americans need to \nsave more for retirement and that our Government can do much better at \nencouraging us to save.\n  Allowing the lower tax rate on dividends and capital gains to expire \nis going in exactly the wrong direction.\n  The net return on savings is an important determinant for how much \npeople save, and the higher the tax on saving the less saving we do. \nWork by Glenn Hubbard of Columbia University and Kevin Hassett of the \nAmerican Enterprise Institute has shown that the net return on savings \nis an important determinant in how much people save.\n  The low returns in the stock market as well as the currently low \ninterest rates throughout the world explain in part the low savings \nrates that we currently see in the United States.\n  There is no question that reducing the net returns by increasing the \ntax rate on dividends and capital gains would definitely harm savings. \nNot only does treating dividend and capital gain ordinary income \ndepress saving, but it is also just plain unfair.\n  This is something I hear again and again from Utahns. Just consider \nhow pernicious the tax on dividends is. The person who buys stock for \n$1,000 already paid taxes on this money when he or she earned it.\n  The company then pays a corporate tax of 35 percent on its profits. \nThen, from what remains of its profits, the other 65 cents, it is free \nto declare a dividend and provide some money back to its stockholders, \nwho also pay a tax on those dividends.\n  Why on Earth should we not have a lower tax on dividends and capital \ngains? The Government has already made two grabs at that money.\n  What is more, the real cost of the lower tax rate on dividends and \ncapital gains has been consistently overstated. As my colleague, \nSenator Bunning, remarked in the Finance Committee markup, the revenue \ncollected from these two taxes exceeded the Joint Committee on \nTaxation's, JCT, estimate by nearly $20 billion in the past year, \naccording to one study.\n  In fact, the unprecedented 15-percent increase in tax revenue \ncollected in the past year demonstrates that the best way to lessen \nbudget pressures is not to raise taxes but to focus on policies that \nlead to solid economic growth. That 15 percent growth translates into a \n$100 billion reduction in the budget deficit this year.\n  Let us stop and think about that for a minute, Mr. President.\n  Pro growth tax policies have allowed us to grow our revenues by 15 \npercent in the past year, this translates into more than $250 billion \nin higher revenues. If we can find a way to control ourselves on the \nspending side, this could mean real progress in deficit reduction.\n  As my colleagues well know, we have gone through a great deal of pain \njust to find $35 billion in spending growth reductions in the spending \nreconciliation bill Sometimes I think that many of my colleagues \nignore, or are not aware of, the power of strong economic growth on our \ndeficit reduction capabilities.\n  If we look back to the late 1990s, when we did for a while eliminate \nthe deficit and create some surpluses, it is easy to see that strong \neconomic growth played a very strong part in that success, as did some \ncurbs on spending.\n  I urge my colleagues not to forget this as we consider the importance \nof extending these favorable rates on dividends and capital gains.\n  More generally, the attempt to lay blame for our budget deficit \nentirely at the hands of the tax cuts is mistaken.\n  The process of forecasting budget revenues is still a nearly \nimpossible task despite some hard work done by a group of very talented \neconomists at the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, the JCT, and the \nOffice of Management and Budget, OMB.\n  One fact that is clear from our many years of work is that the \nprincipal factor driving the amount of revenue collected by the \nGovernment is economic growth.\n\n[[Page S13142]]\n\n  Estimates done by CBO showed that the shift from budget surpluses to \ndeficits in the 2001-2003 time period owed more to spending increases, \nmuch of which could be attributed to 9/11, and the reduction in \neconomic growth than to the reduction in tax rates.\n  In short, maintaining our pre-2001 tax rates would not have preserved \nthe budget surplus, and in fact would have exacerbated the recession, \nfurther reducing revenues.\n  And today, we are seeing the powerful effects that solid economic \ngrowth can have on Government revenue.\n  As I alluded earlier, the booming tax revenues of today are \nreminiscent of the 1990s, when a sustained period of solid economic \ngrowth not only filled our Government's coffers but dramatically \nlowered unemployment, increased incomes at all levels, and reduced \npoverty in a dramatic fashion.\n  Many opponents of the extension argue that lower tax rates on \ndividends and capital gains represent yet another tax break for the \nrich. To boil down the lower tax rate to a tired class-warfare argument \nis over simplistic and wrong.\n  Reducing the taxation on investment income benefits everyone in \nAmerica because it ultimately increases productivity and, with it, \nwages and economic growth as well.\n  Nobel Prize-winning economists Robert Lucas and Ed Prescott have \nargued that eliminating the pernicious taxation on savings is the \nclosest thing there is to a free lunch.\n  When we save more it means that there is more money available for \nfirms to modernize and expand and compete in the world economy. Former \nchair of the Council of Economic Advisers Greg Mankiw has shown in his \nresearch that even those who do not own stocks benefit in the long run \nfrom the lower tax rates on investment income.\n\n  The U.S. economy benefits greatly from the presence of a stable, \nrelatively predictable tax and regulatory regime. Investors do not like \nto be surprised, and they like predictability.\n  As my colleague Senator Kyl has pointed out, leaving the extension of \nthe special tax rates on dividends and capital gains until later has \ndramatically increased uncertainty in the minds of nearly every person \ninvesting in the United States.\n  Investors are not looking at the tax rates in place today--they are \nlooking at the rates they expect to be in place several years down the \nroad when they plan to take the gains of their investments and pay the \ntaxes.\n  I note that the tax reconciliation bill approved this week by the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee included a 2-year extension of the lower \nrate for capital gains and dividends. I hope that this provision \nsurvives intact in the House bill and that bill passes the other body.\n  If so, the capital gains and dividends extension will be an item for \ndiscussion in the conference of these bills with the House. Therefore, \nthis tax bill may yet include this important provision before it goes \nto the President for his signature.\n  Another important provision that needs to be included in this \nlegislation is an extension of the research tax credit. Companies \nthroughout the country, and many in Utah, depend on this credit to \nremain competitive and to innovate.\n  A robust research credit is vital for our future world leadership in \ntechnology and our economic growth.\n  The revised mark includes the credit expansion in the form of the \nalternative simplified credit.\n  An increase in U.S. R spending benefits everyone, by ultimately \nimproving the productivity of the American worker. Increasing \nproductivity invariably results in an increase in wages throughout the \neconomy.\n  It is interesting to listen to some of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle when they talk about these tax provisions in their \nentirety. They make it appear that this package is nothing more than a \nlarge tax cut for the wealthy in our Nation. Of course, nothing could \nbe further from the truth.\n  In reality, other than those provisions that are designed to give aid \nto the victims of the hurricanes, and to help rebuild the gulf coast \nareas that were the hardest hit, this bill is about extending certain \nprovisions that are set to expire. Most of those provisions expire in \njust a few weeks.\n  I think it is important for Utahns and all Americans to understand \nthat enactment of this legislation is necessary to prevent a very large \ntax increase on middle-class Americans. Practically every single \nprovision in this bill enjoys plenty of bipartisan support.\n  So while some of my colleagues are deriding this bill as a whole as \nan unnecessary and unwarranted tax giveaway to the rich, they are \nquietly promoting the individual provisions in the bill as necessary \nprovisions for their constituents.\n  While I support this bill and certainly want to see it go forward to \nconference with the House, where we are hopeful it can be improved \nfurther, there are several provisions in it that cause me a great deal \nof concern.\n  One of these items of concern relates to a provision located in the \ncharitable reforms section of the bill.\n  Specifically, it would place a floor of $500 on a joint return on the \namount of deduction a taxpayer who itemizes his or her deductions may \nclaim for a charitable contribution.\n  I see absolutely no rationale for this limitation.\n  I do know that it would discourage and mistreat many Utahns who make \nsmall contributions to their churches and to local charities. It seems \nto me that this limitation would hit those who make small donations \nparticularly hard.\n  The entire point of extending the charitable deduction to those who \ndo not itemize is to give an incentive to more people to donate to \ncharity. I believe the non-itemizers deduction would do this, so I have \nsupported it.\n\n  But why in the world would we want to give an incentive to non-\nitemizers and then turn around and remove a current incentive to those \nwho itemize? It makes no sense.\n  This provision is unfair to itemizers in another way. The standard \ndeduction already assumes a certain level of charitable contributions.\n  In order to give non-itemizers an incentive to actually give those \nassumed contributions, we are effectively allowing them to double dip \nin this provision. I can live with that because I think it will result \nin increased donations.\n  However, to take away a current benefit from itemizers is beyond the \npale. There are many thousands of Utahns who give 10 percent of their \nincome to their church. Because of this, Utah has a higher percentage \nof taxpayers who itemize.\n  Why should they be penalized for doing the right thing?\n  Why would we remove an incentive to them so we could create another \nincentive to those who do not give as much?\n  This is totally unfair.\n  I am also very concerned about another revenue raising provision in \nthe bill that seems completely counterproductive and foolish to me. I \nam referring to the provision that would remove the ability of certain \nintegrated oil companies to use the LIFO method of accounting for their \ninventories.\n  To me, this seems like a backdoor attempt to place a windfall profits \ntax on oil companies, which was ineffective the first time it was \ntried.\n  I am even more concerned that this provision could very well miss its \nintended target and hit some of the smaller oil refineries around the \nnation that we have been trying to help in recent tax bills.\n  I am told that it would affect three companies in Utah that happen to \nhave some production, some refining, and are retailers. These three \nUtah companies are not the large integrated oil firms that this revised \nmark may be targeting.\n  I do not think this change is good policy for even the large \ncompanies, but in addition to being very poor policy, it also seems \nmisdirected.\n  The American Job Creation Act we passed a year ago included a tax \nincentive to encourage small refiners to comply with the new low-sulfur \ndiesel regulations. The Energy bill we passed this summer included a \nprovision to allow refiners to expense immediately the cost of \nadditional refinery capacity.\n  The provision in the bill before us would totally reverse these \nincentives and much more. Is not this like giving someone a quarter \nwith our right hand\n\n[[Page S13143]]\n\nand then taking a dollar away from that same person with our left hand?\n  If we wish to encourage more production of oil and especially if we \nwish to encourage the creation of more capacity to refine oil products, \nthis is not the way to go about it. I hope these offensive provisions \ncan be removed, or at least mitigated, in the managers' amendment.\n  Mr. President, I know that sometimes one must take one step back for \neach two steps forward. Well, I think that this bill is an example of \nus taking one step back to take one and a half steps forward, but in \nthe end, we are at least moving forward.\n  I would rather have an extension of the research tax credit and AMT \nalong with an extension of the low rates for dividends and capital \ngains, but I will save the battle for the latter for another day.\n  The Finance Committee has an incredible array of legislative \nprovisions that pass before us each year. The chair has, as usual, done \na masterful job of satisfying the diverse interests of the members of \nthe committee with his legislation.\n  One day, I hope to see a Finance Committee that takes a small step \nforward in every single piece of legislation to make it easier and more \nrewarding to save in America. The importance of increasing saving to \nthe growth potential of our economy cannot be underestimated.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, for too many years now, the administration \nand the majority in Congress have been pursuing an irresponsible fiscal \npolicy of giving tax cuts mainly to the wealthiest Americans among us.\n  By generating revenue less than we are spending, our Nation is \nfalling deeper into the debt ditch. The increase in our debt threatens \nus with rising long-term interest rates. At a time when so many \nAmericans have variable-rate mortgages, car loans, and other debts, \nrising interest rates that are predicted to accompany our swelling \ndeficits will have a very real and immediate impact on many American \nfamilies. And we will be passing this increased debt on to our children \nand grandchildren.\n  This tax reconciliation bill contains a number of good provisions. In \nparticular, the provision to ``patch'' the alternative minimum tax, \nAMT, is critical. Congress originally created the AMT to make sure that \nthe wealthiest Americans paid at least a minimum amount of tax; \nhowever, it is now catching many more taxpayers than Congress intended. \nThe ``fix'' in the bill before us today would once again implement a \ntemporary increase in the exemption level of the AMT by indexing it for \ninflation, thus saving many middle-income taxpayers from being affected \nby the AMT and having their Federal taxes increased.\n  Today's bill also includes an expansion and extension on the research \nand development tax credit. R provides strength for our economy. It \ncreates American jobs and improves the competitiveness of U.S. \ncompanies in the global marketplace. I am pleased that it will be \nextended.\n  I am also glad that this bill would establish an itemized deduction \nfor the mortgage insurance on qualified personal residence and \nincentives for donations to charitable organizations, as well as extend \ntax incentives for many important programs, including a deduction for \ntuition payments and related expenses, a continuation of the new \nmarkets tax credit, deductions for teachers who make out-of-pocket \npayments for classroom expenses.\n  However, while these tax cuts are well targeted, it would be \nunconscionable to support their passage without paying for them. To \nstart with, I wish we had adopted Senator Feinstein's amendment. Her \namendment would have maintained two little known but important \nprovisions known as ``PEP'' and ``Pease''. The personal exemption phase \nout, PEP, reduces a taxpayer's total personal exemption for incomes \nexceeding $218,950 for married couples, $145,950 for individuals. The \n``Pease'' provision, which is named after the late Representative Don \nPease, reduces certain itemized deductions for higher income taxpayers. \nThere is currently a repeal scheduled to start next year on both of \nthese, which does little for the economy beyond further increasing the \ndeficit. Keeping PEP and Pease could reduce the deficit by an estimated \n$31 billion over 5 years. That is enough to pay for the entire AMT fix.\n  Senator Feinstein's amendment also would have rolled back the Bush \ntax cuts on capital gains rates, dividend rates, and income tax rates \nfor millionaires. I supported this amendment, which unfortunately was \ndefeated.\n  In closing, I support many of the tax provisions in this bill, but I \ncannot support passing then without paying for them. On balance this \nfiscally irresponsible bill will leave our country worse off.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am increasingly alarmed about the \ncongressional budget process as it now operates.\n  I helped to write the Budget Act of 1974. At the time, I served as \nchairman of the Subcommittee on the Standing Rules of the Senate. The \nsubcommittee was tasked with studying the budget process reforms \nreported by the then-Senate Government Operations Committee as they \naffected the Senate rules. I met with a working group of staff that was \ncomprised of 10 standing committees of the Senate, and which included \n90 hours of meetings during 25 sessions over a 16-day period. After the \nstaff had completed its work, I spent many hours with the Senate \nParliamentarian and met in all day sessions and over holiday weekends \nwith the staff from the Congressional Research Service and the Senate \nlegal counsel. I helped to manage the Senate's floor deliberations of \nthe Budget Act as majority whip, and, when the Senate completed its \nmany weeks of debate and amendment, I served on the conference \ncommittee that finalized the Budget Act.\n  I studied the Budget Act. I championed it. I supported it.\n  And so I can say, without equivocation, that the process the Senate \nutilizes today hardly resembles the process envisioned in 1974. The \nbudget process used today obscures more than it clarifies the tax and \nspending decisions of the Congress. Through a growing list of 60-vote \npoints of order, it is weakening the ability of the Congress to \nexercise its power over the purse, deferring more and more authority \nover fiscal matters to the executive branch. The budget process \nincreasingly serves as a means to circumvent the role of the Senate to \ndeliberate, and, lately, it has been used in a way that has fostered an \nunprecedented and unbroken string of deficits and debt.\n  I have spoken many times about how the budget reconciliation process \nhas been distorted and the extent to which that process has been used \nto worsen deficits and unnecessarily limit debate and amendment. Here \ntoday is another example of one of these reconciliation bills, where \ndebate is limited, amendments are curtailed, and arms are twisted to \nget the bare minimum of a majority of Senators to advance partisan \nlegislation, only to see a brandnew bill rewritten in a closed \nconference committee that excludes any voice of dissent.\n  This week, the already grossly abbreviated reconciliation exercise \nhas been curtailed further, as the normal 3-day debate is crammed into \na period allowing for less than 2 days of debate. Meanwhile, Senators \nare distracted with other legislation that must be addressed before the \nSenate breaks for the Thanksgiving holiday--legislation that is more \npressing than the extension of some of these tax cuts which will not \nexpire for several more years.\n  The budget process has been distorted, where reconciliation is abused \nby both sides eager to score political points. Reconciliation is no \nlonger simply a budgetary device to round out the numbers at the end of \nthe fiscal year, as it was intended in 1974. It has become a favorite \nmechanism for bypassing the rules of the Senate for circumventing the \nlimits imposed upon the capricious passions of a determined majority. \nOnce a Senator's right to debate has been waived, what is left can \nalmost be described as a state of chaos in the Senate. If you think \nthat term ``chaos'' seems a bit extreme, just wait a few more hours for \nthe vote-arama to begin.\n  Soon, the statutory limit of 20 hours of debate on this bill will \nexpire, and the Senate will enter into a consent agreement whereby 2 \nminutes of each debate are allocated to each amendment and Senators are \nforced to vote\n\n[[Page S13144]]\n\nblindly in rapid succession on amendment after amendment after \namendment. Many of these amendments have never been seen before by the \nSenate, and many will not even be explained to Senators prior to the \ncasting of their votes.\n  To the credit of Senators Gregg and Conrad, the number of amendments \nconsidered in vote-aramas have been limited in recent times, but vote-\naramas continue to occur nonetheless.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, the Senate considered the so-called Deficit \nReduction Reconciliation Act of 2005. After the 20 hours of debate had \nexpired, the Senate entered into an agreement by unanimous consent that \nlimited debate to 2 minutes per amendment prior to each vote. In one \nday, the Senate considered 41 amendments, with only 2 minutes of debate \nper amendment, and with only 16 of those amendments offered prior to \nthe expiration of debate. That is 25 amendments that the Senate had not \ndebated, or even seen before, receiving votes based upon whatever \nknowledge Senators could extract from the din in just 2 minutes.\n  In 2003, the Senate considered 84 amendments in this manner, without \nany of those amendments being offered, debated, or generally made \navailable to Senators before casting their vote. In 2001, the number of \namendments considered in this manner was 78, again without any of those \namendments being offered, debated, or generally made available to \nSenators before casting their vote.\n  All together, in the last 6 years, the Senate has considered 246 \namendments to budget resolutions and reconciliation bills, within a so-\ncalled vote-arama process that does not allow the Senate to debate \namendments or, in too many cases, to even see amendments before \nSenators are asked to cast their vote. God help the American people.\n  I once described vote-aramas as pandemonium, which was the Palace of \nSatan designated by Milton in Paradise Lost. But that term almost fails \nto describe the ignominy of the Senate when it becomes engulfed in \nthese budget carnivals. It's embarrassing to the institution. It is no \nway to legislate. We cannot claim to serve the interests of our \nconstituents if we don't have time even to read the amendments on which \nwe are casting our votes. Read The Federalist Paper No. 62 by Madison: \n``It will be of little avail to the people, that the laws are made by \nmen of their own choice, if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot \nbe read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood.'' Vote-arama \nmeans Senators are flying blind.\n  I have pleaded with the Senate to avoid using this reconciliation \nprocess because I abhor what it does to this institution. It is not a \nnecessary exercise. The Budget Act does not require it, nor does the \nBudget Act require, or even mention, the use of vote-aramas. We are \ndoing this to ourselves. This is self-inflicted abuse, and our Nation \nsuffers as a result.\n  Since 2001, this reconciliation process has yielded an unbroken \nstring of unprecedented deficits and debt. At $339 billion in the \nfiscal year 2003, $412 billion in the fiscal year 2004, and $317 \nbillion in the fiscal year 2005, budget deficits have grown to record \nlevels 3 years in a row. Within 5 years, the national debt is projected \nto rise to $11 trillion. The interest payments on that debt is growing \nto enormous levels and will surpass in 2010 a whopping $314 billion per \nyear. That is $314 billion that could be used to build and modernize \nour transportation and energy infrastructure, but that will be paid to \nforeign and domestic bond holders instead. If there is a force that is \nsinking the budget into an ocean of deficits and debt, it resides, at \nleast in part, among abuses of the budget process.\n  Outside of the budget reconciliation process, Senators could insist \nthat tax cuts be offset. These are not controversial tax extensions. \nThe alternative minimum tax relief, the deduction of college tuition \nand teacher classroom expenses, the section 179 expensing and research \nand development credit--all of these could pass overwhelmingly if \noffsets could be found, and it could be done without having to put the \nSenate through this exercise. Senators might even have the opportunity \nto thoughtfully consider amendments to the bill to develop compromises \nthat improve the legislation and satisfy both parties. Senators could \ngo home touting a piece of bipartisan legislation that all sides find \nagreeable.\n  I call upon the Republican and Democratic leadership, as well as the \nmembers of the Budget Committee, and all Senators, to help reform this \nprocess. The process as it currently operates is intolerable, and it \ndamages this institution severely. Whatever political advantage may be \nclaimed today, this process ultimately weakens the Senate as an \ninstitution, and does a great disservice to the American people.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I oppose this legislation, and I would like \nto take just a few minutes to explain why. But before I do, I want to \nbegin by commending and congratulating both the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee for their hard work on this bill. \nSenator Max Baucus and Senator Chuck Grassley work very well together \non the broad range of issues that come before their Committee. While we \nhave an honest and good faith disagreement about this particular \nlegislation, I want them to know how much sincere respect I have for \nboth of them and how grateful I am for their outstanding leadership of \nthe Finance Committee.\n  Mr. President, I have two major concerns about this bill. First, it \nneedlessly increases the deficit when we should be saving for the \nfuture. And, second, it paves the way for a budget that is inconsistent \nwith the values of the American people.\n  Our country faces an enormous fiscal challenge that will begin in a \nfew years, when the baby boomers retire. America's debt now exceeds $8 \ntrillion. Under the Republican budget that figure will increase by more \nthan $3 trillion in just 5 years. We simply must restore fiscal \ndiscipline. That means we must do all we can to avoid further increases \nin the deficit, and to live under the pay-as-you-go rule. We did that \nin the 1990s, and that is a major reason why we not only eliminated our \ndeficit, but ran record surpluses. That, in turn, is one reason we \nenjoyed the longest peacetime economic expansion in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  During debate on this bill, Democrats tried to restore fiscal \ndiscipline. Led by the distinguished ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Kent Conrad, we offered an amendment that would have \nfully paid for the tax cuts in the bill. Unfortunately, the amendment \nwas defeated on a largely party-line vote.\n  Let me be clear: I support most of the tax cuts in this bill. I think \nwe should provide relief from the alternative minimum tax, and we \nshould extend the R and work opportunity tax credits, among others. I \njust think we should pay for them. Here and now. We shouldn't force our \nchildren and grandchildren to do so tomorrow.\n  The other reason why I oppose this legislation is that it will pave \nthe way for adoption of a budget that does not reflect America's \nvalues. To understand why, you need to step back and take a broad view \nof the budget legislation moving through the House and Senate.\n  This tax reconciliation bill is really just one part of a broader \nbudget plan that the Republican leadership is trying to push through to \nenactment. That plan includes substantial cuts in a wide range of \nprograms important to middle class and more vulnerable Americans. Not \nlong ago, the Senate approved legislation that cut Medicare, Medicaid, \nhousing and agriculture, while authorizing drilling in a pristine \nAlaskan wildlife refuge. At the same time, the House is considering \nlegislation to cut student loans, food stamps, and child support \nenforcement, while making even deeper cuts in Medicaid.\n  These spending cuts are troubling. But what makes them truly \noutrageous is that they're intended to partially pay for tax breaks for \nspecial interests and multimillionaires.\n  I know that the bill before us does not include those tax breaks. And \nI commend Senator Baucus and other colleagues on the Finance Committee \nfor their work to keep capital gains and dividend tax breaks out of the \nbill.\n  My concern, though, is that Senate Republican leadership has made it \nvery clear that they intend to put those tax breaks right back into the \nlegislation in a final agreement with the House. This isn't a secret. \nAs Senator Grassley told the publication Tax Notes, ``If we pass a tax \nbill, it is going to have\n\n[[Page S13145]]\n\nextension of capital gains in it.'' He further went on to say ``whether \nwe have one in the Senate or not . . . we'll end up with it.''\n  Other Republican colleagues have echoed the Chairman's comments.\n  We know that capital gains and dividend tax breaks will be included \nin a final bill, if we let it get to that point. But why should we \ncare? Why are those tax breaks so problematic?\n  Well, first of all, remember how they are being paid for. Cuts in \nMedicare, Medicaid, student loans, food stamps, and other programs for \nmiddle class Americans and those who need help the most.\n  Now let's consider who these tax breaks really help.\n  Here's the answer: 53 percent of their benefits will go to those with \nincomes greater than $1 million.\n  Let me repeat that: 53 percent of their benefits will go--no, not to \nmillionaires--but to people with incomes over $1 million. We are \ntalking about multi-millionaires, a small handful of America's most \nfortunate. These lucky few will get an average tax break of about \n$35,000.\n  But what about those with incomes between, say, $50- and $200,000? \nWell, they will get an average tax cut of $112.\n  And what about those with incomes less than $50,000? Six dollars.\n  $35,000 for those with incomes more than a million dollars. Six \ndollars for those earning less than $50,000.\n  And for this, the Republican majority wants to harm some of the \nNation's most vulnerable families. That is not just wrong. It is \nimmora1. And that is not my word--it comes from some of our Nation's \ntop religious leaders.\n  Again, Mr. President, I know this bill does not itself include those \ntax breaks. But if we send this fast track bill to conference, make no \nmistake: those tax breaks are coming. It is as clear as night following \nday. The only way to prevent it is to stop th from going to conference \nin the first place.\n  Finally, I want to make one more point. Even if my colleagues \ndisagree about the problems with the Republican budget, I wish they \ncould agree that we have more important things to do.\n  Gas prices are skyrocketing. Families are struggling to fuel their \nvehicles and heat their homes. Farmers and businesses are feeling the \npinch. Democrats have a plan to respond, to address price gouging and, \nultimately, to make our nation energy independent. That is more \nimportant than harming the vulnerable to provide tax breaks to special \ninterests and multi-millionaires, while increasing the deficit.\n  Hurricane survivors are struggling. Thousands lack health coverage; \n150,000 live in hotel rooms and face the threat of homelessness in just \n2 weeks. Devastated communities have been forced into massive layoffs \nand are unable to provide even basic services. Democrats have a plan to \naddress these urgent needs. That is more important than harming the \nvulnerable to provide tax breaks to special interests and multi-\nmillionaires, while increasing the deficit.\n  The Iraq war is not going as well as the administration promised. \nMore than 2070 Americans have died. More than 15,000 have been wounded. \nAbout 150,000 more remain in harm's way, while the Administration still \nhas no plan to end the conflict and bring them home. Instead of being \ngreeted as liberators, the violence continues nearly 2\\1/2\\ years after \nthe start of the conflict. As the Senate said just a few days ago, our \nNation badly needs a strategy for success. But we have a long way to go \nbefore that bill gets to the President's desk. And making that happen \nalso is more important than harming the vulnerable to provide tax \nbreaks to special interests and multi-millionaires, while increasing \nthe deficit.\n  While I support tax relief for the middle class, and I endorse most \nof the specific provisions in this legislation, I am going to vote \nagainst it. Approval of this bill will facilitate adoption of a \nRepublican budget that is based on the wrong values and the wrong \npriorities.\n  Together, we can do better.\n  Let's provide middle class tax relief, but let's do it in a fiscally \nresponsible way that doesn't harm families struggling to make ends \nmeet.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are ready for third reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, and was \nread the third time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we will be voting tomorrow morning at \napproximately 9:30. We will do the continuing resolution. We have an \namendment on the resolution in the morning.\n  There is going to be a lot going on tomorrow. We will not be able to \nfurther clarify the schedule until tomorrow. We will have multiple \nvotes tomorrow morning beginning at 9:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on passage of the bill. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant Journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that motion \non the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this legislation did not happen by itself; \nit took hard work and perseverance. There is a long list of individuals \nwho must be thanked.\n  First, I want to thank the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation \nand Senate Legislative Counsel for their service. They did a tremendous \njob with this bill.\n  I want to thank George Yin, the Chief of Staff of the Joint Committee \non Taxation, in particular. This will probably be the last tax bill \nGeorge will work on for the U.S. Congress. George is returning to the \nUniversity of Virginia where he is a professor. His last day is \ntomorrow. George has served on the Joint Committee on Taxation for just \nover 2 years. During that time, he has provided tremendous insight and \nknowledge to me and my staff. He is called upon to know all the nuances \nof the Tax Code and provide recommendations on tax policy. He does this \nwith unfailing competence. His work is of the highest caliber. I \ncommend him for his work and thank him for his service to the U.S. \nCongress.\n  Next, I must thank the hardworking staff of the Finance Committee. \nThey stayed up many a sleepless night, and I applaud them for their \nexpert counsel. I want to thank some staff members in particular. I \nappreciate the cooperation we received from the Republican\n\n[[Page S13146]]\n\nstaff, especially Kolan Davis, Mark Prater, Cathy Barre, Elizabeth \nParis, Christy Mistr, Dean Zerbe, Chris Javens, John O'Neill, and Nick \nWyatt.\n  I also thank my staff for their perseverance and dedication, \nincluding Russ Sullivan, Patrick Heck, Bill Dauster, Melissa Mueller, \nMatt Jones, Judy Miller, Jon Selib, Ryan Abraham, and Tom Klouda. I \nalso thank our dedicated fellows, Mary Baker, Brian Townsend, Richard \nLitsey, Jorlie Cruz, and Stuart Sirkin.\n  Finally, I thank our hardworking interns: Jennifer Alwood, Ray \nCampbell, Mandy Cisneros, Will Larson, and James Reavis.\n  I want to thank the chairman of the Finance Committee and my good \nfriend, Senatory Grassley.

There are a couple of \nappropriations conference reports that will likely be available, the \nPATRIOT conference report, the House message on the spending \nreconciliation bill, as well as other legislative and executive items \nwe are trying to clear. Therefore, additional votes may occur and will \noccur, and we will try to clarify Friday's schedule as early as \npossible.\n  I remind everyone that a weekend session is expected and Senators \nshould remain available Friday and Saturday and beyond until we finish \nour remaining work. I will have to say, starting now about 3 weeks ago \nwe set out a very aggressive agenda, and to date we have stayed right \non target to accomplish that agenda. The House is in session right now \nand is voting actually right now, and I understand they will be \nconducting more business tonight and in the morning that we will have \nto act on after they act on much of the legislation they are \nconsidering. So it will be a full day tomorrow. I expect to have a \nnumber of votes over the course of tomorrow. And again, as we have said \nfor the last 3 weeks, it will be important for our colleagues to keep \ntheir schedules flexible through tomorrow and Saturday, Sunday, and \npossibly beyond that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/17/senate-section/article/S13146-5", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.

Mr. President, yesterday Vice President Cheney said \nelected officials had access to the intelligence and were free to draw \ntheir own conclusions. They arrived at the same judgment about Iraq's \ncapabilities and intentions made by this administration and by the \nprevious administration. What world is the Vice President living in? No \none seriously believes what the Vice President is saying. Once again, \nhe is deliberately deceiving the American people. It is a calculated, \npartisan, political ploy.\n  President Bush and the Vice President have begun a new campaign of \ndistortion and manipulation because the polls show that Americans have \nlost trust in the President and believe he manipulated intelligence \nbefore the war. The President and Vice President have abandoned any \npretense of leading this country and have gone back on to the campaign \ntrail.\n  But the country won't have it this time. Not only can the President \nand Vice President not find weapons of mass destruction, they cannot \nfind the truth either. The administration broke the essential bond of \ntrust that has to exist between the White House and the American \npeople. They have to be able to trust that we will be told the truth, \nespecially on the important issues of war and peace.\n  The Congress did not have access to the intelligence the President \nand the Vice President had. It is plain wrong. The administration's \ndrumbeat for war began in the summer of 2002, but it did not provide an \nintelligence estimate--the collective wisdom of the intelligence \ncommunity--to back up its claims about al-Qaida and nuclear weapons and \nthe immediate threats until Democrats on the Intelligence Committee \ndemanded it.\n  Even then, the administration did not provide the intelligence \nestimate until October 1, 2002--2 days before the debate began on the \nresolution authorizing war. The vote on the resolution occurred 1 week \nlater, on October 11.\n  Beyond the NIE, the suggestion that the Members of Congress have \naccess to the same classified material as the President is \npreposterous. The President receives a Presidential daily brief and a \nbriefing every morning with top intelligence officials. The White House \nhas access to memos with intelligence information that the Congress \nnever sees. Even when we ask for this information, they do not provide \nit.\n  It is abundantly clear that the administration is engaged in nothing \nmore than a devious attempt to obscure the facts and take the focus off \nthe real reason we went to war in Iraq. No matter what the Vice \nPresident says, 150,000 American troops are bogged down in a quagmire \nin Iraq because the Bush administration misrepresented and distorted \nthe intelligence to justify a war America never should have fought. \nThey misled us on al-Qaida. They misled us on aluminum tubes, materials \nfrom Africa, and nuclear weapons.\n  What was said before by the administration does matter. The \nPresident's words matter, and so do the Vice President's, and so do the \nSecretary of State's, and so do the Secretary of Defense's, and the \nother high officials in the administration, and they did not square \nwith the facts.\n  The Intelligence Committee agreed to investigate the clear \ndiscrepancies, and it is important they get to the bottom of this and \nfind out how and why this President took America to war in Iraq. \nAmericans are dying. Already more than 2,000 have been killed, and more \nthan 15,000 have been wounded.\n  The American people deserve the truth. It is time for the President \nto stop passing the buck and for him to be held accountable. It is time \nfor a change in this country. Something has to give. A tarnished White \nHouse and damaged Presidency is pulling America backwards.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I spend most of my time with the work of \nthe Judiciary Committee and the work of the Finance Committee. I do not \nget into intelligence and Armed Services issues very often. But I \nlistened to Senator Kennedy's criticism of President Bush and Vice \nPresident Cheney that they deceived the American people.\n  I saw some things on television last night of which Senator Kennedy \nought to be reminded. If he watched television last night, he might \nhave a little different view.\n  I heard him say that President Bush maybe had more information than \nCongress had, and so it was wrong for the President today to say that \nCongress is rewriting history in any way because he maybe had more \ninformation than we had. I believe that is what Senator Kennedy said.\n  I do not know for sure if the President has more information than we \nhave because when I go upstairs to S-407, to our secure briefing room, \nI am assuming I am getting the same information as the President is \ngetting. Perhaps not as often, but getting the same information. So I \nthink it is ludicrous to say that Members of the Senate cannot be up to \nspeed on what the threats are to our Nation. But, for sure, if he had \nwatched television last night, he would have heard a speech by \nPresident Clinton in 1998. The speech was on the threat of Saddam \nHussein to our country at that time. Surely, Senator Kennedy cannot \ndeny that President Clinton had exactly the same information President \nBush would have had from our intelligence community. I very clearly \nheard President Clinton, when he was President, speak of the terrible \nthreat that Saddam Hussein was to the world and to America, and that he \nwas going down a road to do something about it.\n  Now, obviously, that did not happen. But we did pass a resolution \ncalled the\n\n[[Page S13148]]\n\nIraqi Liberation Act, where Congress, in a unanimous vote took a \nposition at that period of time that we considered Saddam Hussein a \nthreat and that he ought to be removed from office, from the leadership \nof his country.\n  If President Clinton, while he was in office, using that \nintelligence, saw Saddam Hussein as a threat, the same way President \nBush did, I do not see how any Democrat can be on the floor of the \nSenate and say the President of the United States is deceiving the \nAmerican people.\n  Also, last night I happened to hear a 2- or 3-minute speech by \nSenator Clinton, made in 2002, how horrible Saddam Hussein was and how \nhe was somebody to fear and a threat and the inclination of doing \nsomething about it.\n  It is intellectually dishonest for any Democrat to come to the floor \nand accuse our President of misleading the American people. They ought \nto be ashamed of themselves. Have they no shame?\n  I have something I want to refer to because we have had people \noutside the Congress, outside the administration, look at some of these \nvery issues. We had the Robb-Silberman commission report. Senator Robb \nis a former Democratic Member of this body. Judge Silberman is a \nRepublican, served on the DC Circuit. They gave a report about \nPresidential daily briefings versus what is in the National \nIntelligence Estimate. There is no significant difference between the \ntwo reports, the Presidential daily briefing and the National \nIntelligence Estimate. Quoting from the report:\n\n       It was not that the intelligence was markedly different. \n     Rather, it was that the PDBs and the SEIBs, with their \n     attention-grabbing headlines and drumbeat of repetition, left \n     an impression of many corroborating reports where in fact \n     there were very few sources. And in other instances, \n     intelligence suggesting the existence of weapons programs was \n     conveyed to senior policymakers, but later information \n     casting doubt upon the validity of that intelligence was not.\n\n  That is shortcomings of our intelligence community, the same \nshortcomings that President Clinton probably experienced during his \ntime in office, when he was making estimates of the threat of Saddam \nHussein, the same way that President Bush was making those estimates.\n  The Robb-Silberman commission found Presidential daily briefings to \ncontain similar intelligence in ``more alarmist'' and ``less nuanced'' \nlanguage. Continuing to quote:\n\n       As problematic as the October 2002 [National Intelligence \n     Estimate] was, it was not the Community's biggest analytic \n     failure on Iraq. Even more misleading was the river of \n     intelligence that flowed from the CIA to top policymakers \n     over long periods of time--in the President's Daily Brief and \n     in its more widely distributed companion, the Senior \n     Executive Intelligence Brief. These daily reports were, if \n     anything, more alarmist and less nuanced than the [National \n     Intelligence Estimate].\n\n  That is what one former Democratic Senator and a Republican judge, \nappointed to a commission to look into this, have reported. When you \ntake all of these things into consideration, plus the quotes of Senator \nClinton that I referred to in the year 2002 that I saw on television \nlast night, or the statements by President Clinton in 1998 when he was \nPresident that I saw on television last night, it seems to me it is \nabsolutely wrong and misleading to come up here and say the President \nof the United States and the Vice President were deceiving the American \npeople, particularly when Senators can have briefings if they want \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/17/senate-section/article/S13148-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FREEDOM IN ASIA AND BURMA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to commend \nPresident Bush for his superb remarks regarding freedom and democracy \nin Asia. It is fitting that these comments were made in Japan, a key \nstrategic ally of the United States.\n  I will not recount the entire speech--which I encourage all my \ncolleagues to read--but will highlight two paragraphs. The President \nsaid:\n\n       Unlike China, some Asian nations still have not taken even \n     the first steps toward freedom. These regimes understand that \n     economic liberty and political liberty go hand in hand, and \n     they refuse to open up at all. The ruling parties in these \n     countries have managed to hold onto power. The price of their \n     refusal to open up is isolation, backwardness, and brutality. \n     By closing the door to freedom, they create misery at home \n     and sow instability abroad. These nations represent Asia's \n     past, not its future.\n       We see that lack of freedom in Burma--a nation that should \n     be one of the most prosperous and successful in Asia but is \n     instead one of the region's poorest. Fifteen years ago, the \n     Burmese people cast their ballots--and they chose democracy. \n     The government responded by jailing the leader of the pro-\n     democracy majority. The result is that a country rich in \n     human talent and natural resources is a place where millions \n     struggle simply to stay alive. The abuses by the Burmese \n     military are widespread, and include rape, and torture, and \n     execution, and forced relocation. Forced labor, trafficking \n     in persons, and use of child soldiers, and religious \n     discrimination are all too common. The people of Burma live \n     in the darkness of tyranny--but the light of freedom shines \n     in their hearts. They want their liberty--and one day, they \n     will have it.\n\n  These words should ring loudly and clearly throughout the region. I \ncommend President Bush for these comments and for the solid leadership \nhe provides in supporting freedom in Burma. Moreover, I applaud the \nefforts made by President Bush and Secretary Rice to put Burma on the \nU.N. Security Council's agenda.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/17/senate-section/article/S13148-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13148-S13151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SUPPORT FOR JAILED JOURNALISTS DAY\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today is ``action day'' to support jailed \njournalists around the world, as declared by the independent \norganization, Reporters Without Borders. I rise today to express my \nsupport for this cause and to emphasize that our country has long \nbelieved that a free press is a cornerstone of democracy, both here and \nabroad. Last year, at my urging, Congress created a free press \ninstitute at the National Endowment for Democracy to promote, as part \nof our democracy-building efforts, free, independent and sustainable \nnews media organizations overseas. This year, I introduced the Free \nFlow of Information Act to allow journalists in this country to protect \nthe identity of their confidential sources. After I introduced the \nlegislation, a reporter for one of America's most respected media \norganizations, Judith Miller of the New York Times, was jailed for 85 \ndays for failing to disclose a confidential source, while another, Matt \nCooper of Time magazine, was also threatened with jail for the same \nreason. I believe that in order for the United States to foster the \nspread of freedom and democracy globally, we must support an open and \nfree press at home.\n  According to Reporters Without Borders, 112 journalists are currently \njailed in 23 countries, including places like China, Cuba, Eritrea, and \nBurma. This is not good company for the United States to keep. I urge \nthe administration and our diplomats overseas to do everything they can \nto gain the release of these jailed journalists, who were doing nothing \nmore than trying to keep their fellow citizens informed. I ask \nunanimous consent that the following information from Reporters Without \nBorders be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   16th Jailed Journalists' Support Day, Thursday, November 17, 2005.\n\n       Reporters Without Borders calls on the media to demonstrate \n     their solidarity with imprisoned journalists. We were \n     exceptionally active when journalists were being held hostage \n     in Iraq, and our challenges may seem less urgent now. But \n     that is not the case. A total of 186 media people (112 \n     journalists, 3 assistants and 71 cyber-dissidents) are \n     imprisoned in 23 countries. What crimes have they committed? \n     They have revealed sensitive issue, called for democracy and \n     greater respect for individual freedoms, refused to give in \n     to censorship or to an enforced line of thought. In short, \n     they simply tried to do their jobs.\n       In an appeal for solidarity with imprisoned journalists, \n     Reporters Without Borders is organizing the 16th consecutive \n     annual day of action. We are urging the worldwide news media- \n     throughout the world-- to acknowledge the fate of those who \n     have to struggle every day for the right to report the news.\n       To break the silence concerning their plight and to bring \n     it to the public attention of the public, Reporters Without \n     Borders calls on the news media to highlight the case of an \n     imprisoned journalist on this year's ``action day'', \n     Thursday, November 17.\n       The jails of three countries alone are holding more than \n     half of the world's imprisoned journalists. The three \n     countries that constitute the world's biggest prisons traps \n     for the press are China (with 31 journalists behind bars), \n     Cuba (23), and Eritrea (13).\n       Mobilization is needed to ease the harsh reality of prison \n     conditions. Denied contact with their families and even \n     proper nourishment, most of these journalists live within\n\n[[Page S13149]]\n\n     poor or non-existent sanitary conditions. They are frequently \n     isolated from fellow prisoners and left to cope in terrible \n     isolation.\n       The purpose of this Day is above to free these journalists \n     from yet another prison, that of silence and oblivion. Unless \n     their cases are regularly brought before international public \n     the guilty governments will retain impunity. They will have \n     no reason to worry about the fate of prisoners in their \n     jails. Publicity thus becomes a sort of ``life insurance'' \n     contributing directly to the protection of the prisoners.\n       It also allows a furtherance of the struggle begun by the \n     imprisoned journalists. Articles that media write about them \n     underscore the reasons and the circumstances of their arrest \n     as well as the issues the journalists were working on before \n     they were imprisoned. In speaking about their case, the \n     sponsor circumvents the censorship they suffered and exposes \n     the unfairness of their imprisonment.\n       A media's decision to cover the plight of a journalist \n     demonstrates its commitment to defend the right to freely \n     inform and to be informed. It allows journalists to show \n     their solidarity with colleagues with whom they share their \n     passion for a job that is so crucial to ensuring democracy. \n     Since this campaign was launched in 1989, more than 100 \n     journalists have been sponsored by media all around the \n     world. Some media outlets decided to cover their plight \n     without endorsing one particular case. Almost half of them \n     have been released and in part as a result of the support \n     from their sponsors. Several journalists sponsored by \n     International media have been released like Fatimah Nisreen \n     (The Maldives) amnestied on 9 May 2005 or Raul Rivero (Cuba) \n     released on 30 November 2004.\n       On the day of their release, many journalists stressed the \n     value of not feeling ``utterly forgotten''. It gave them the \n     courage to continue to bear their imprisonment.\n       The struggle the news media undertake alongside Reporters \n     Without Borders to defend the existence of a free press is \n     not hopeless. Even when those steps appear to have been in \n     vain, we know that international backing for a prisoner \n     brings essential psychological support and often protects his \n     or her life. This achievement alone represents a victory over \n     authoritarianism and repression carried out by so many \n     governments.\n       Please find below:\n       --a few examples of cases of jailed journalists\n       --press freedom barometer--Key statistics\n       --the list of 112 journalists imprisoned worldwide (as of \n     November 2, October 2005)\n       --the list of the current sponsors\n     Yu Dongyue--CHINA\n       A journalist and art critic with the Liuyang News, he was \n     arrested on 23 May 1989 during student demonstrations in \n     Tienanmen Square in Beijing. He was convicted on 11 July that \n     year of ``sabotage'' and ``counter-revolutionary propaganda'' \n     and jailed by the Beijing intermediate municipal court for 20 \n     years, with five years deprivation of civil rights. His \n     sentence was cut by two years in March 2000 but he is not due \n     to be released until 21 May 2007. Yu is suffering from \n     psychological problems as a result of long spells in solitary \n     confinement.\n     Miguel Galvan Gutierrez--CUBA\n       Journalist with the independent news agency Havana Press, \n     he was accused of being ``a mercenary in the pay of a foreign \n     power'' and convicted to 26 years in jail. As with other \n     dissidents arrested at the time, his arrest reportedly came \n     after a long search of his home and seizure of papers and \n     equipment such as a typewriter, fax machine and phone. He \n     appeared last August before the prison disciplinary council \n     for sending information to Miami radio stations. He was then \n     put in solitary confinement, without electricity, and was not \n     allowed to use the phone.\n       His health has steadily worsened in prison. His frequent \n     spells in solitary confinement (73 days in his first 11 \n     months) aggravated his ailments, including frequent diarrhea, \n     stomach and joint pains, swollen feet and a paralyzed arm \n     and, in April 2005, high fever, urinary problems and back \n     pain. He does not get the medicine he needs.\n     Win Tin--BURMA\n       Win Tin, one of the political mentors of Nobel Peace Prize \n     winner Aung San Suu Kyi, continues to serve his 20-year \n     prison sentence. He is regularly offered freedom in exchange \n     for a signed promise to give up all political activity. But \n     ``Saya'' (Teacher), as his friends call him, has always \n     refused to cut such a deal and break his ties with the \n     National League for Democracy, which was cheated out of its \n     landslide victory at the 1990 general elections.\n       He was convicted of ``subversion'' and ``anti-government \n     propaganda.'' In 1996, he was held for five months in a dog-\n     kennel at Rangoon's Insein prison. He has since had two heart \n     attacks and lost most of his teeth. Now 75, he has been \n     shuttling back and forth between his cell and the spartan \n     prisoners' wing of Rangoon hospital for the past few years.\n       These days, Burma's military rulers treat him with a little \n     more respect and he now has his own cell. But he is still not \n     allowed to write anything.\n     Akbar Ganji--IRAN\n       This Iranian journalist with the reformist daily Sobh-e-\n     Emruz, Neshat and Asr-e-Azadegan was arrested on April 22, \n     2000 when he returned from a conference in Berlin that the \n     Iranian authorities considered ``anti-Islamic'' and ``anti-\n     revolutionary.'' In January 2001, he was sentenced to 10 \n     years in jail and to banishment.\n       He had to answer 10 charges, based on complaints filed by \n     the ministry of intelligence, the police and a former \n     minister of intelligence. The prosecutor accused him of \n     ``acting against national security'', ``circulating \n     propaganda against the Islamic system'', and ``insulting \n     religious figures.'' He was also accused of publishing \n     articles accusing senior officials of involvement in the \n     murder of regime opponents and intellectuals in 1998. In \n     May 2001, his sentence was reduced from 10 years to six \n     months. In July 2001, the Supreme Court increased it to 6 \n     years.\n       Akbar Ganji was held in Evin prison in Tehran, where he was \n     able to continue reading and writing. But he was not able to \n     telephone his family or receive medical treatment despite \n     suffering from acute asthma. He began a hunger strike on June \n     11 and lost 44 kilos in the course of the next month. Akbar \n     Ganji finally calls off his hunger strike after more than 60 \n     days. He was sent back to Evin prison in early September.\n     Pham Hong Son--VIETNAM\n       Medical doctor and local representative of a foreign \n     pharmaceutical company. He has been in prison since March \n     2002 for translating and posting online an article from the \n     local US embassy website called ``What is democracy?'' and an \n     essay called ``Encouraging signs for democracy in Vietnam.'' \n     He had earlier written and posted on Vietnamese online \n     discussion groups several articles advocating democracy and \n     human rights.\n       He was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment in June 2003 for \n     ``spying,'' followed by three years of house arrest, by the \n     Hanoi People's Court. The prison sentence was reduced on \n     appeal to five years on 26 August that year.\n       He has a groin hernia which could kill him if he does have \n     an operation.\n     Dominique Makeli--RWANDA\n       Dominique Makeli, a Radio Rwanda commentator, has been in \n     prison in Rwanda since 18 September 1994. After being moved \n     several times, he is now in the main prison in Kigali.\n       The public prosecutor told Reporters Without Borders in \n     October 2001 that he was accused of ``incitement to genocide \n     in his reporting.'' He had reported on an apparition of the \n     Virgin Mary in Kibeho (west of Butare) in May 1994 and had \n     quoted her supposed words : ``The parent is in heaven.''\n       The prosecutor said people would have understood this as \n     divine support for President [Juvenal] Habyarimana and, by \n     extension, for the policy of exterminating Tutsis. Thiswas \n     disputed by Makeli and many witnesses. His case-file was sent \n     in August 2004 to a gacaca (a village court system revived by \n     the authorities).\n       Complete biographies of these journalists and others are \n     available upon request.

Mr. President, yesterday the U.S. Senate approved the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 2862, the Science-State-Justice \nappropriations bill. I voted for this legislation because it provides \ncritical funding for the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the Drug \nEnforcement Administration. However, I rise to explain that I am voting \nfor this bill reluctantly because I feel that some of the funding \npriorities set forth in the bill will leave our communities more \nvulnerable to terrorist attacks traditional crime. In particular, this \nbill continues the wrongheaded trend of slashing Federal funding for \nState and local law enforcement and important criminal justice \nprograms. This bill slashes funding for the Justice Assistance Grant \nand the COPS Program. And, for the first time, the Congress has decided \nto zero out the COPS hiring Program. I believe that this decision is a \nterrible mistake on so many levels, and I fear that our Nation's \ncitizens will be less safe from traditional crime and terrorism as a \nresult. Further, the bill slashes Federal assistance for the effective \nand cost-efficient drug court program by an astounding 75 percent.\n  Back in 1994 when we passed the legislation that created the COPS \nProgram, our crime rates were at all-time highs. At that time, we made \na commitment to our State and local law enforcement partners. During \nthose years, we invested roughly $2.1 billion for State and local law \nenforcement each year and substantially upgraded our ability to combat \ncrime. We added over 100,000 officers to patrol our neighborhoods, and \nwe expanded crime prevention programs such as community policing \nprograms across the Nation. What was the ultimate result? Crime rates \nfor violent crime, murder and rape were all reduced, and today they \nremain at all-time lows. Many law enforcement experts and local \nofficials credit the COPS Program for helping to achieve these results. \nIn fact, no one, to my knowledge, with law enforcement expertise has \nargued otherwise. The International Association of Chiefs of Police, \nthe National Sheriffs Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, the \nNational Association of Police Organizations, and other local law \nenforcement groups all support the COPS Program. Attorney General \nAshcroft has stated that the COPS Program was a miraculous success, and \nAttorney General Gonzalez stated that the COPS Program put officers on \nthe street and we reduced crime. Moreover, a recent report by the \nGovernment Accountability Office concluded that COPS hiring grants had \nan impact on reducing crime rates.\n  Why would the Congress eliminate a program that is strongly supported \nby local law enforcement officials and has been proven effective by \nstatisticians at the Government Accountability Office? Well, it has its \nbasis in ideology. Some of my Republican colleagues argue that local \ncrime is a local problem and the Federal Government should not be \nfunding these local efforts. I completely disagree. How can it be a \nlocal responsibility when roughly 60 percent of all the crimes \ncommitted in America relate to drugs, abuse of drugs, and the sale and \ntrafficking of illicit drugs? These drugs are smuggled across our \nnational borders from State to State and city to city by sophisticated \ndrug cartels and street gangs. How does a local sheriff prevent drugs \nthat start out in a foreign country from being trafficked into his or \nher county? How does a police chief prevent the recruitment of local \nkids into international street gangs? In my opinion, crime is a \nnational problem, and it requires a national response. The COPS Program \ndemonstrated the Federal Government's commitment to approach crime as a \nnational problem--and it worked.\n  I would also point out that State and local law enforcement forms our \nfirst line of defense against terrorism. Homeland security experts have \npointed out the value that community policing programs can have in \ncombating terrorism. This only makes sense--it is the local officer who \nknows the neighborhood who will be able to provide the types \ninformation necessary to help infiltrate a local terror cell. In \naddition, it will be a local officer walking the beat who happens to \ncatch a suspect trying to pump sarin gas into the local mall air-\nconditioning ducts. It won't be a brave Special Forces agent with night \nvision goggles; it will be a local cop walking the beat. In this era of \nuncertainty, we need to be providing more support for our local police \nagencies to help make their efforts against terrorism and crime as \nrobust as possible.\n  And by cutting the drug court program--one of the most effective \nprograms to reduce substance abuse in the criminal population--we are \nsending a devastating message to the 16,000 individuals that graduate \nfrom drug courts each year. We are telling them that we don't care that \ndiversion programs are successful at helping people overcome addiction \nto reenter society as productive citizens, holding down jobs, and \nregaining custody of their children. We are sending a message that we \nwould prefer to revert to the bad old days of locking up nonviolent \ndrug offenders in prisons where most will get no drug treatment and \nthey will most likely just sink deeper into a life of crime.\n  And what message are we sending to the 70,000 people currently \nenrolled in drug courts who are working hard to live sober, crime-free \nlives? By slashing funding for the drug court program we are telling \nthem that we are not invested in their recovery and we are putting \ntheir future in drug court programs in jeopardy.\n  It makes absolutely no sense to me that we are cutting this cost-\neffective program by 75 percent. By enrolling nonviolent drug offenders \nin drug courts, States save an enormous amount of money. One study \nshowed that California's drug courts save the State $18 million a year. \nAnother study showed that every dollar spent on a drug court program \nsaves the city of Dallas, TX, $9.43 over a 40 month period. It is \ninconceivable to me that we would choose to cut this program. The\n\n[[Page S13152]]\n\nNational Association of Drug Court Professionals estimates that our \nactions here today will result in more than 13,000 individuals losing \naccess to drug court services. These 13,000 people will likely continue \ntheir lives of crime and drugs and being a threat to public safety \ninstead of getting enrolled in a tough-love program that will help them \nto turn their lives around and get sober. It is truly a tragedy.\n  It is my opinion that we found a winning formula when we made the \ndecision to invest in our State and local law enforcement partners and \nsmart on crime initiatives in the nineties, and I believe that we are \nmaking a terrible mistake when we reduce funding for them. There is no \ngreater responsibility of the Federal Government than the protection of \nits citizens. This is true whether the threat comes from international \nterrorist or from a thug down the street, and I strongly believe that \nwe are taking the wrong approach when we cut funding for our State and \nlocal law enforcement partners. Sheriff Ted Sexton, the president of \nthe National Sheriffs Association, got it right when he stated that \n``cuts of this magnitude will seriously inhibit our ability to protect \nour communities and secure the homeland.'' And, the president of the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police was correct in pointing \nout that ``demanding that we play a central role in our Nation's \nhomeland security efforts, while at the same time cutting the resources \nwe need to do our job, is both hypocritical and irresponsible.'' I hope \nthat the Republican-led Congress and President Bush will heed the call \nof these brave men and women and fully fund these critical programs \nnext year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/17/senate-section/article/S13152-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MANUFACTURING DEDUCTION LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

My bill extends the benefits of the \nmanufacturing deduction, enacted last year with the American Jobs \nCreation Act of 2004, to apply to manufacturing operations that are \nconducted in Puerto Rico and are subject to full U.S. tax.\n  The new manufacturing deduction means that U.S. businesses operating \nin any of the 50 States will pay tax on their manufacturing income at \n32 percent. Without the manufacturing deduction, U.S. businesses \noperating a branch in Puerto Rico will pay tax on their manufacturing \nincome at 35 percent.

I want to speak about a matter that I suspect few Senators \nare aware of, but which should concern each of us.\n  On February 21, 2005, in the small Colombian community of San Jose de \nApartado, eight people, including three children, were brutally \nmurdered. Several of the bodies were mutilated and left to be eaten by \nwild animals.\n  This, unfortunately, was not unusual, as some 150 people, \noverwhelmingly civilians caught in the midst of Colombia's conflict, \nhave been killed by paramilitaries, rebels, and Colombian soldiers in \nthat same community since 1997. None of those crimes has resulted in \neffective investigations or prosecutions. No one has been punished.\n  That is an astonishing fact. Think of 150 murders, including \nmassacres of groups of people, in a single rural community, and no one \npunished.\n  This latest atrocity occurred in a remote area frequented by rebels \nand paramilitaries. As a result, the presence of the Colombian army has \nalso grown significantly there. Yet the army, which was sent to that \narea to protect civilians from attacks by illegal armed groups, is now \nsuspected by some of having committed this massacre.\n  Residents of San Jose de Apartado have blamed the army, and \ninternational observers who went with community members to locate the \nbodies witnessed disturbing behavior by soldiers who reportedly laughed \nwhile body parts were being exhumed, who took pictures of themselves \nmaking victory signs, and who mishandled evidence from the massacre \nsites. There is also the possibility that paramilitaries acted in \ncollusion with the army. And some have speculated that there were two \nseparate groups of perpetrators, perhaps including the FARC, the \nRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the country's oldest rebel \ngroup.\n  Even before an investigation began, top Colombian officials publicly \ndeclared that the FARC was responsible. The Minister of Defense, who \nhas since resigned, insisted that the army could not have done this \nbecause on February 21 they were more than 2 days' walking distance \nfrom the crime scene. It was soon determined, however, that there were \nsoldiers only half a day's walk away, and army helicopters had recently \nbeen seen in the vicinity.\n  While it has not been proven who is responsible for this horrific \ncrime, the government's rush to judgment was only its first mistake. \nThat was quickly followed by the decision, against the wishes of the \ncommunity, to send armed police officers into their midst. While I do \nnot doubt the authority of Colombian police to enter that territory, it \ncaused the majority of its inhabitants to flee their homes out of fear \nthat the police would become a target of illegal groups and that the \nvillagers could once again be harmed.\n  In fact, such an attack took place on June 26, when three policemen \nwere wounded in an attack by the FARC and community members were caught \nin the crossfire. Later, on July 18, an old man was found beaten to \ndeath. There were two more killings by the FARC, one in August and \nanother in September, and verbal threats and acts of intimidation by \nsoldiers and police officers towards members of the community have \nreportedly steadily increased. Then last month, there were three \nincidents in which armed paramilitaries and soldiers reportedly \nthreatened members of the community and destroyed property. It appears \nthat the community may be no safer today than it was on February 21.\n  One of the consequences of the government's tactless approach to this \nand previous cases is that several witnesses from the community have \nrefused to come forward and give testimony, and this has hindered the \ninvestigation. After a massacre of 6 members of this same community 5 \nyears ago when over 100 people gave testimony to judicial authorities, \nno one was convicted and no report on the investigation was ever \nissued. Convincing witnesses to come forward this time will require a \ndegree of sensitivity by the government that has, to date, been sorely \nlacking.\n  We are told by the Colombian Government that an investigation of the \nmassacre is ongoing. That, unfortunately, is the story of most heinous \ncrimes in Colombia. Investigations often continue without end, and \noften the perpetrators avoid punishment. I am concerned that this case \nmay be no different.\n  According to information I have received, neither the soldiers who \nwere in the area at the time of the February 21 killings nor hospital \nworkers who treated a girl who was wounded by soldiers there the \nprevious day have been interviewed by investigators. I find this hard \nto believe, but if it is correct the government has much to answer for.\n  For 5 years, the United States has provided significant military aid \nto Colombia despite ongoing concerns about human rights. Several months \nago, the\n\n[[Page S13153]]\n\nSecretary of State certified that the Colombian Government had met the \nhuman rights conditions in our law, and recommended the release of \nadditional military aid. However, the report accompanying her \ncertification also noted that ``[w]hile the human rights performance of \nmany of the Army's units is improving, an exception is evidenced by \ncontinued accusations of human rights violations and collusion with \nparamilitaries against the Army's 17th Brigade, which operates in \nnorthern Colombia. These reportedly include some 200 allegations \ninvolving the peace community of San Jose de Apartado in 2000-2001 and, \nmost recently, of involvement in the killings near San Jose de Apartado \nin February 2005. . . As a result of these allegations, the United \nStates has informed the Government of Colombia that it will not \nconsider providing assistance to the 17th Brigade until all significant \nhuman rights allegations involving the unit have been credibly \naddressed.''\n  While I might differ with the Secretary's decision to make the \ncertification at the time she did, which coincidently occurred just \nhours before President Uribe's arrival at President Bush's ranch in \nTexas, I commend her decision to withhold aid to the 17th Brigade. It \nis noteworthy, however, that concerns about the 17th Brigade had been \nconveyed to the State Department well before this incident, including \nreports that its members were openly colluding with paramilitaries. Yet \nthere is reason to believe that U.S. aid continued despite those \nreports.\n  This case presents the Bush administration with an important \nchallenge. It shows that despite billions of dollars from the United \nStates and lofty rhetoric about human rights, the Colombian \nGovernment's initial reaction to this despicable crime was not \nappreciably different from what we saw years ago. They denied \nresponsibility and blamed the victims even before an investigation \nbegan, and some of the key witnesses may not even have been interviewed \n8 months later.\n  This is unfortunate because there has been progress on human rights \nunder President Uribe's government. Parts of the country are noticeably \nsafer. The government reports a significant decline in violent crime. \nBut labor leaders and human rights defenders are still threatened and \nkilled, the judicial system remains sluggish, and impunity is more the \nrule than the exception. Clearly, much more needs to be done to protect \nhuman rights.\n  This case also presents a challenge for the Colombian Government to \ndemonstrate, albeit belatedly, that it can respond with sympathy, with \nimpartiality, and effectively to bring justice to the victims of a \ncrime that epitomizes the worst of Colombia's conflict.\n  I am also told that the Office of the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Human Rights conducted its own investigation of the \nmassacre, but that the Colombian Government has not requested a copy of \nthe report of that investigation. If this is correct I urge the \ngovernment to do so immediately and to release as much of the report to \nthe public as possible without compromising the investigation.\n  This conflict has brought nothing but suffering to the Colombian \npeople. It has caused the deaths of countless innocent civilians, \nuprooted millions from their homes, and perpetuated the trade in \nillegal drugs that has corrupted many sectors of society. The people of \nSan Jose de Apartado, with the conflict raging around them, sought to \ninsolate themselves from this danger by declaring themselves a peace \ncommunity. That strategy failed, as one after another of their members \nwas brutally murdered.\n  Before February 21, I was not aware of the many tragedies this \ncommunity had already suffered. While I do know, as a former \nprosecutor, that some crimes are harder to solve than others, in \nColombia, as in so many countries, political will is often what really \nmatters. It is imperative that this case not be added to the long list \nof unsolved, unpunished crimes in San Jose de Apartado, or become part \nof the history of impunity in Colombia. Who ever was responsible must \nbe brought to justice.\n  Mr. President, I also want to mention the demobilization of \nparamilitaries that is underway in Colombia. We all want these narco-\nterrorist organizations to be dismantled, their commanders punished, \ntheir illegally acquired assets seized, and their victims compensated. \nThe Colombian Government is asking the United States for millions of \ndollars to help finance the demobilization, and we want to help.\n  I am concerned, however, because if the demobilization of the \nparamilitary unit located in the area of San Jose de Apartado is \nindicative of the way this process is unfolding, there are serious \nproblems that need to be addressed. According to reports I have \nreceived, paramilitaries are engaging in the same threatening and \nviolent behavior, they continue to collude with the army, and some have \njoined the army. Little has changed for the people in that area who \ncontinue to live in fear of losing their property and their lives. I \nhope the Colombian authorities who have been touting the success of the \ndemobilization process will investigate these reports.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/17/senate-section/article/S13153-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE GREAT AMERICAN SMOKEOUT\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nacknowledge an important event that is taking place today in \nPhiladelphia, PA and across the Nation--the 29th Annual American Cancer \nSociety Great American Smokeout.\n  We are all aware that cancer is one of the greatest healthcare risks \nfacing Americans today. For years, this disease has taken the lives of \nour families, our friends, and our neighbors. As a member of the \nbipartisan Senate Cancer Coalition, I certainly understand that there \nare few things that would have a greater impact on the quality of life, \nfor millions throughout the world, than the eradication of this \nterrible disease.\n  Unfortunately, we are also all aware of the fact that we have not yet \nfound a cure. And while scientists and researchers around the world \nwork feverishly towards this lofty aspiration, the most important \naction we can take is the promotion of cancer prevention. The Great \nAmerican Smokeout is a wonderful example of a successful program aimed \nat assisting those at great risk of developing cancer to change their \nways. This annual event has, undoubtedly, saved lives.\n  Since the inaugural Great American Smokeout took place in 1976, this \ninitiative has provided a powerful platform for the American Cancer \nSociety to encourage Americans to stop smoking. This event, which urges \nAmericans who take the unnecessary health risks associated with the use \nof tobacco products to band together and make a lifestyle change, is \none of the most recognized awareness initiatives in the history of the \nAmerican Cancer Society--and rightfully so. Rarely does any \norganization touch so many with its message in a single day as the \nAmerican Cancer Society during the smokeout. And rarely is the \nintention of the message as important as reducing the number of \nAmericans who use tobacco products.\n  I am also pleased that the American Cancer Society has chosen my home \nState to host this year's smokeout. Pennsylvania has a long history of \nworking with the American Cancer Society, and in 2002, together with \nthe Pennsylvania Department of Health, they established the \nPennsylvania Free Quitline. This toll-free service, available 24 hours \na day, 7 days a week, provides advice and counseling to those \nattempting to quit smoking. Studies have shown that smokers who take \nadvantage of such services are twice as likely to successfully quit \nsmoking. By choosing Pennsylvania as the host for one of their most \nimportant events, the society is reaffirming its commitment to \ndecreasing the prevalence of tobacco use in my state--and, in turn, \nimproving the health of all Pennsylvanians.\n  Mr. President, these types of efforts have helped the American Cancer \nSociety develop a reputation as one of the most influential and \neffective participants in the fight to better the health of every \nAmerican. The Great American Smokeout is a vital event put on by a \ntruly impressive organization, and I thank the American Cancer Society \nfor its leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/17/senate-section/article/S13153-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13153-S13154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COLON CANCER SCREEN FOR LIFE ACT\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Colon \nCancer Screen for Life Act, S. 1010. Some\n\n[[Page S13154]]\n\nof its provisions were included in an amendment included in the \nreconciliation package. This legislation will increase the likelihood \nthat Medicare beneficiaries will receive a colonoscopy screening \nexamination which is proven to be the most effective way to detect and \ntreat colorectal cancer.\n  Colorectal cancer is the No. 2 cancer killer in the United States \ntoday. This year, according to the American Cancer Society, \napproximately 145,000 new cases will be diagnosed and 56,000 Americans \nwill die from colon cancer. We have the power to change these sobering \nstatistics by increasing access to this lifesaving procedure. Although \nCongress passed a colonoscopy screening benefit for Medicare \nbeneficiaries back in 1997, the percentage of seniors receiving a \ncolonoscopy reportedly has increased by only an estimated 1 percent. A \nrecent UCLA study, as discussed in an October 11 Wall Street Journal \narticle, documents the continuing underutilization of screening \ncolonoscopies. It points out that colorectal cancer screening rates \nstill lag far behind those for cervical, breast and prostate cancer. As \nthe Wall Street Journal article concludes, ``The results were \nparticularly disturbing because `we could eliminate this disease if \nAmerica had the will,''' as the study's lead author noted.\n  One reason for the underutilization of colonoscopy screening in the \nMedicare population is rapidly declining rates of reimbursement for the \nprocedure. Medicare reimbursement for colonoscopies performed in the \noutpatient setting has dropped by nearly one-third from the initial \n1998 reimbursement rates. In the majority of States today, Medicaid \npayment rates actually exceed Medicare reimbursement for colonoscopy. \nThis fact alone underscores the Medicare reimbursement problem is real. \nThis legislation increases Medicare reimbursement for colorectal \ncancer-related procedures to assure more equitable reimbursement for \nphysicians who absorb significant costs in providing these valuable \nservices.\n  Another reason for this underutilization is that Medicare currently \ndoes not pay for a physician office visit prior to a screening \ncolonoscopy, although it does pay for a physician office visit prior to \na diagnostic colonoscopy. The procedures are identical--both involve \nthe same amount of risk, so there is simply no reason why Medicare \nwould pay for an office visit prior to one procedure and not the other. \nBecause Medicare does not pay for this necessary office visit, many \nphysicians must provide them for free. This amendment would fix this \ndiscrepancy by providing Medicare coverage for a preoperative visit or \nconsultation prior to a screening colonoscopy, as it does for a \ndiagnostic colonoscopy.\n  Every year, thousands of Americans needlessly die from colorectal \ncancer. We have the means to change this and we should do so. I \nappreciate our Senate colleagues joining in support of this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/17/senate-section/article/S13154-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL ADOPTION DAY\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge National \nAdoption Day on November 19, 2005. With over 118,000 children available \nfor adoption out of the U.S. foster care system, I think it is crucial \nto celebrate those lawyers, social workers, officials, and, most \nimportantly, parents who help get many children out of foster homes \ninto adoptive families.\n  National Adoption Day was started in 2000 by the Alliance for \nChildren's Rights, the Freddie Mac Foundation, and the Dave Thomas \nFoundation for Adoption and helped complete foster care adoptions in \nnine jurisdictions. National Adoption Day continued to grow and in 2001 \ncompleted adoptions in 17 jurisdictions. In 2002, the Casey Family \nServices, Children's Action Network, the Congressional Coalition on \nAdoption Institute and Target became National Adoption Day partners and \nhelped 34 cities across the country finalize 1,350 adoptions. In 2003, \n3,100 adoptions were completed. National Adoption Day 2004 was the \nbiggest celebration to date, finalizing the adoptions of more than \n3,400 children from foster care. It seems quite appropriate that as we \ncelebrate Thanksgiving, we also celebrate the formation of new families \nthrough adoption.\n  As a member of the bipartisan Congressional Coalition on Adoption, I \nam committed to assisting children in the United States to find stable, \nloving and permanent homes. Additionally, I support the goals of \nNational Adoption Day to encourage others to adopt children from foster \ncare, to build stronger ties between local adoption agencies, courts, \nand adoption advocacy organizations, and to continue to research and \nlearn more about families wanting to adopt and the children waiting to \nbe adopted.\n  I am also proud that Members of the Senate continue to support ways \nto make adoption easier and more affordable. Since the cost of adoption \ncan be very high, we ought to do what we can to lessen this initial \nburden for the exceptional people who provide caring homes for \nchildren. Adoption proceedings and legal fees for some domestic \nadoptions can cost more than $40,000. To ease some of this burden, \nCongress adopted a $10,000 tax credit for adoption expenses. If we ask \nindividuals to care for and adopt children, we must provide some relief \nfrom the financial burdens associated with that care. The adoption tax \ncredit is an effective vehicle to provide this relief.\n  The commitment of adoptive parents in South Dakota and throughout our \ncountry to provide children with safe, permanent, and loving homes \nwill, of course, have a positive impact on their lives. As we celebrate \nNational Adoption Day on November 19, 2005, I call on my colleagues to \ncontinue supporting efforts to make adoption easier for parents, \nchildren and other important players in the adoption process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/17/senate-section/article/S13154-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13154-S13155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                 Private First Class Tyler R. Mackenzie\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments of this \nbody's time to remember a true fallen hero, a Coloradan that has been \nlost to us in defense of our freedoms.\n  Last week, on Veterans' Day, the family of PFC Tyler R. Mackenzie \nburied him back home in Weld County. A native of Evans, CO, Private \nFirst Class Mackenzie was killed in early November near Baghdad when an \nimprovised explosive device detonated near his Humvee. He was only 20 \nyears old, taken from his family and friends just a few days shy of his \n21st birthday.\n  Tyler was a tower of a young man, a six-foot-seven-inch high school \nfootball player at Greeley West High School. Tyler's coaches remember \nhim for having held himself to the highest standards and being his own \ntoughest critic. He enjoyed the horticulture classes at Greeley West. \nHe expected excellence from himself and refused to accept anything \nless.\n  After graduating Greeley West in 2003, Tyler went to work at his \nfamily's business, manufacturing kitchen cabinets. He also worked for \nthe Greeley-Evans School District 6.\n  Tyler was a man of faith, active in his church. Tyler also had a \nsense of humor, and his older sister used to call him ``Monkey'' for \nhis ability to climb across the rafters of the family's basement.\n  But seeking something else, perhaps a larger opportunity to give back \nto this Nation, Tyler joined the Army in January of this year. He \nbecame a member of the 1st Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment, 2nd \nBrigade Combat Team of the storied 101st Airborne Division that bravely \nhalted the march of tyranny across Europe during World War II. Private \nFirst Class Mackenzie was following a long tradition of military \nservice in his family: his two grandfathers had served in the Navy \nduring World War II, and his father had served as a military police \nofficer with the Army.\n  Private First Class Mackenzie completed basic training in May of this \nyear and was deployed to Iraq on September 28. He had been in Iraq only \n6 weeks before his tragic death.\n  Tyler is exactly the kind of young man we as a Nation are so \nfortunate to have serving in our Armed Forces. He was a young man of \nintellect, self-discipline, courage and concern. He joined the Army \nbecause he wanted to help, to serve his country as his father and \ngrandfathers and so many others had before him. He wanted to ensure \nthat Iraqis knew the full blessings of their new freedom and could \nshare the same opportunities he had here.\n  Tyler's sacrifice on behalf of this Nation is a reminder to all of us \nof the\n\n[[Page S13155]]\n\nprecious gift we have to live in such a country. To his parents, David \nand Julie, his sister Nicole and the entire Mackenzie family, this \nNation humbly thanks you for Tyler. We are forever grateful for your \nsacrifice and his.\n\n\n               marine lance corporal jeremy p. tamburello\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak for a moment about a brave son of \nWestminster, CO, lost to us in the fighting in Iraq: Marine LCpl Jeremy \nP.

Tamburello was killed earlier this month when his military \nvehicle was struck by an improvised explosive device near Rutbah, Iraq. \nHe was a member of the 1st Light Armor Reconnaissance Battalion, 1st \nMarine Division, I Marine Expeditionary Force, and was only 19 years \nold.\n  Jeremy was a straight-A high school student at Ranum High School in \nAdams County. Jeremy had a gift for science and dreams of serving his \nNation in the United States Marine Corps before going on to pursue a \ndegree in computer science.\n  When Jeremy announced his intention to join the Marine Corps, his \nfather, Kevin tried at first to talk him out of it, warning him of the \nterrible risks of serving during this time of conflict in Iraq. Kevin \nsuggested to his son that he pursue a computer science degree at a \ntechnical college.\n  Jeremy's response to his father was respectful, but firm: ``This is \nwhat I want to do, Dad. Sign the papers.''\n  And so in the summer of 2004, Jeremy Tamburello joined the Marine \nCorps and began his brave journey of service to America. This past \nAugust, he was deployed to Iraq. It was a challenge in which he was a \nfirm believer. He cared about the future of the people of Iraq and \nabout the sacrifices made by the over 3,000 Americans in the September \n11th attacks. He wanted to serve his Nation and protect those freedoms \nthat all too often so many of us take for granted and help bring them \nto the fledgling democracy of Iraq.\n  This Nation is blessed to have a young man like Lance Cpl. \nTamburello. He served his country with honor and distinction, with a \ncourage and conviction that makes us all so very proud. Lance Cpl. \nTamburello did not seek glory or parade honors, but instead chose to \nhumbly serve to help shine the blessings of freedom and liberty to \nthose who had for too long languished behind a curtain of oppression.\n  To Jeremy's family, I can only offer the quiet and humble thanks of a \ngrateful Nation. Jeremy exemplified the nobility and honor, courage and \nself sacrifice, that has made every American proud of his example. We \nshall not forget your sacrifice, nor his.\n\n\n                Tribute to Staff Sergeant Kyle B. Wehrly\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a true American \nhero, SSG Kyle B. Wehrly. On November 3, 2005, Staff Sergeant Wehrly \nwas tragically killed in action during Operation Iraqi Freedom by an \nimprovised explosive device outside of Ashraf, Iraq. He served with B \nBattery of the 2nd battalion, 123rd Field Artillery Regiment in the \nArmy National Guard.\n  I request that all Americans join me today in honoring Staff Sergeant \nWehrly. We should all remember his bravery, his compassion, and his \nfinal sacrifice to the cause of freedom. Throughout our history, great \nmen and women have stood up and given their lives for their country, \nand it is with great sadness that we pay tribute to another brave \nAmerican whose time with us was all too short.\n  Staff Sergeant Wehrly patriotically joined the National Guard when he \nwas only a junior in high school and was sent to the Middle East in \nOctober 2004. Upon his arrival in Iraq, his father, Rev. Peter Wehrly \nof Springfield, IL, recalls that his son only wanted to be sent things \nhe could give away to the Iraqi children. ``All he wanted was stuff for \nkids. Candy, flip-flops. . . . We had five boxes of stuff. He didn't \nwant anything for himself,'' Reverend Wehrly said.\n  All those who knew Staff Sergeant Wehrly will greatly miss him. My \nprayers go out to his family and friends in their time of grief, his \nfather Peter, his mother Nita, and his wife Janet. We should especially \nremember Staff Sergeant Wehrly's 6-year-old daughter, Kylee, who will \nunfortunately grow up with too few memories of her courageous and \ncompassionate father. Our thoughts and prayers are with her and with \nthe entire family. It is important to remind them and to remind all \nAmericans that Staff Sergeant Wehrly did not die in vain but, rather, \ndied protecting his country and protecting the freedom of countless \nindividuals around the world. May he always be remembered as the true \nAmerican hero that he was.\n\n\n                     LANCE CORPORAL SCOTT ZUBOWSKI\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man who grew up \nin North Manchester. Scott Zubowski, 20 years old, died on November 12 \nnear Fallujah, Iraq when a roadside bomb exploded under the military \nvehicle in which he was riding. With his entire life before him, Scott \nrisked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our \nhearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  Remembered for his intelligence and honorable service, Scott was \nkilled during his second tour of duty in Iraq. A 2003 graduate of \nManchester High School, Scott enlisted in the Marine Corps shortly \nafter graduation, inspired by his older brother's Marine service. \nRecently married to another Manchester graduate, Scott was set to \nreturn home before his 21st birthday in March. One of his classmates \ntold the Muncie Star Press that ``Not only was he the smartest guy I've \never known, he was unique in a way for which words aren't good enough \nto actually describe who he was. But to those of us who knew him and \nwere his friends, his presence made a profound impact in our lives that \nstill continues to shape us today.''\n  Scott was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. He was a member of the 2nd Batallion, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st \nMarine Division, I Marine Expeditionary Force. This brave young soldier \nleaves behind his wife, Klancey; his mother, Barbara Weitzel; his \nfather, Richard Zubowski; and his brothers, David and Brian.\n  Today, I join Scott's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Scott, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Scott was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Scott will be remembered by family members, \nfriends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Scott's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Scott's actions will live on far longer that any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Scott Zubowski in the official \nrecord of the United States Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I \nthink about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the \nunfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that \nfamilies like Scott's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Scott.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/17/senate-section/article/S13155-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13155-S13156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law,\n\n[[Page S13156]]\n\nsending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our \nsociety. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight \na separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On October 22, 1998, in Madison, WI, Johnny L. Ellis attacked a man \nin what police say was a hate motivated crime. The victim, a man \ndressed in woman's clothing, was hit over the head with a full 40-ounce \nbottle of malt liquor, causing the bottle to break. Mr. Ellis then \nstabbed the victim in the stomach with the broken bottle, causing a \nwound that required 55 stitches. Throughout the ordeal Mr. Ellis \nreferred to the victim as a ``he-she.''\n  I believe that our Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nin all circumstances, from threats to them at home. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a major step forward in achieving that \ngoal. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current \nlaw, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/17/senate-section/article/S13156-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       RECOGNITION OF DANIEL PACK\n\n Mr. ALLARD.

GRIER\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nTommy F. Grier, who is retiring as the director of the Division of \nEmergency Management for the State of Colorado after spending more than \n12 years in the emergency management field.\n  Colorado has been honored to have Tommy, a leading expert in the \nfield of operational design and preparedness, helping to establish \nColorado as a leader in the areas of homeland security and emergency \nmanagement. Prior to working for the State of Colorado, BG Tommy F. \nGrier served his country as an operations officer in the U.S. Army with \nassignments spanning the gamut of organizations from battalion though \ndivision level. He is a graduate of both the Naval War College and the \nArmy War College.\n  Tommy had a long and distinguished military career, earning the \nSilver Star, the Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster, the \nDistinguished Flying Cross with three Oak Leaf Clusters, the Bronze \nStar with two Oak Leaf Clusters, Meritorious Service Medal with four \nOak Leaf Clusters, Air Medal with ``V'' device and Numeral ``40'', the \nArmy Commendation Medal, the master Parachutist Badge, Senior Army \nAviator Badge, Special Forces Tab, and Army Staff Identification Badge.\n  He received his commission on August 16, 1962, through the U.S. Army \nReserve Officers Training Corps. In July 1963, he was transferred to \nthe Special Forces Training Group where he served as executive officer \nto the commander and then subsequently as an instructor.\n  In 1966, he began the first of two tours in Southeast Asia, serving \nas an armed helicopter section leader with the 121st Aviation Company \nin the Republic of Vietnam; as Operations Officer, 25th Aviation \nBattalion, 25th Infantry Division during the Cambodian Incursion, and \nhe commanded the 238th Aerial Weapons Company in I Corps, II Corps, and \nLaos.\n  Grier's assignments included the Directorate, Office of the Deputy \nChief of Staff for Operations in Washington, DC; Executive to the \nDirector of Requirements; Senior Operations Officer, Joint Staff for \nPlanning and Controlling for ``Jack Frost '79''--a full-scale military \njoint force readiness exercise; Chief, Infantry and Armor Branch, \nEnlisted Personnel Management Directorate, Military Personnel Center; \nand Operations Officer, 7th Infantry Division at Fort Ord, CA.\n  From July 1987 until his retirement from active duty, he served as \nSenior Advisor for the Colorado Army National Guard. Brigadier General \nTommy F. Grier was appointed Assistant Adjutant general and Commander \nof the Army National Guard on Oct. 1, 1993. He retired from the \nColorado Army National Guard in 1996.\n  While serving as the Assistant Adjutant General for Army and \ncommander of the Colorado Army National Guard, Brigadier General F. \nTommy Grier oversaw the participation of State troops and assets for \nWorld Youth Day 1993 where more than half a million pilgrims traveled \nto Denver to hear Pope John Paul II deliver his international message \nof peace. Tommy has also planned, directed, and participated in \ncountless search and rescue missions both domestically and abroad.\n  With relentless emphasis on weapons of mass destruction, WMD, \ncontingency planning, Tommy put Colorado in a very desirable position \nfrom a preparedness standpoint at a most appropriate time. In \npreparation for the Denver Summit of the Eight in 1997, he initiated \nand coordinated several innovative technical assistance visits from the \nDepartment of Defense Chemical and Biological Defense Command.\n  Tommy's remarkable insight undoubtedly set the benchmark for future \nprograms. His WMD efforts in Colorado predate the Defense Against \nWeapons of Mass Destruction Act of 1996, also known as the Nunn-Lugar-\nDomenici amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal \nyear 1997, which stipulated the training of first responders to deal \nwith WMD terrorist incidents.\n  Tommy worked closely with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, \nFEMA, to ensure affected local communities received the support \nnecessary to facilitate recovery during numerous Colorado emergencies, \nincluding the 1997 and the 1999 floods, the 2002 wildfires, and the \n``blizzard of the century'' in 2003.\n  But perhaps Tommy's greatest contribution to the State of Colorado \nhas been his efforts in helping modernize the State's emergency \npreparedness efforts. Playing a key role in the set up of the new \nColorado Multi-Agency Coordination Center, MACC, and State Emergency \nOperations Center, SEOC, his in-depth knowledge and operational \nexpertise has helped craft a nationwide model of excellence.\n  Tommy and his wife Jan are the proud parents of three sons: Tom III, \nJud, and Andy.\n  I commend Tommy Grier for his dedicated service to his country, his \ncommitment to ensuring public safety, and his leadership in emergency \nmanagement. Colorado is a better place because Tommy Grier chose to \nserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/17/senate-section/article/S13156-3", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13156-S13157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO PEGGY SHADDUCK PALOMBI\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Michigan \nState University as they continue their 150th anniversary celebration. \nThroughout its history, Michigan State has made a tremendous \ncontribution to the State of Michigan and to our Nation as a whole.\n  Michigan State University, or the Agricultural College of the State \nof Michigan as it was originally known, was created in 1855 by an act \nof the Michigan Legislature authorizing the creation of a school of \nhigher education for agriculture. Two years later, Michigan State \nwelcomed its first class of 63 students.\n  Nearly 100 years ago, President Teddy Roosevelt visited Michigan \nState and delivered a commencement speech to more than 20,000 students, \nfaculty, and family of the graduates. In his speech, he stated ``The \nfiftieth anniversary of the founding of this college is an event of \nnational significance, for Michigan was the first State in the Union to \nfound this, the first agricultural college in America.''\n  While Michigan State was the first agricultural college in the United \nStates, the curriculum studied by its students went far beyond \nagriculture and included classes in English, philosophy, and economics. \nThis multifaceted approach to higher education produced well-rounded \ngraduates and became the foundation of the educational philosophy later \nemployed by the land grant colleges created by Congress in 1862. In \naddition, this philosophy marked an important change in the way higher \neducation was perceived around the country. No longer was a college \ndegree available only to society's elite, but also to the less \nprivileged who made use of the practical education they received to \nimprove their own standard of living as well as that of their family, \ncommunity, and our Nation as a whole. The significance of this shift in \nthinking cannot be overstated and remains as important today as it was \nin the mid-1800s.\n  Of course, President Roosevelt's commencement address was only one of \nmany significant events in the history of Michigan State University. \nThe University welcomed its first female students in 1870 and presented \n22 degrees to women by 1895. Michigan State's color barrier was broken \nin the early 1900s when it awarded its first degrees to an African-\nAmerican man, William Thompson, in 1904 and an African-American woman, \nMyrtle Craig, in 1907.\n  Among the nearly 400,000 Michigan State Alumni worldwide are 16 \nRhodes Scholars, a Pulitzer Prize winner, a Grammy award winner, two \nformer Michigan Governors, a former U.S. Senator and Secretary of \nEnergy, and the first women to represent the State of Michigan in the \nU.S. Senate, my colleague and friend, Debbie Stabenow. Michigan State \nnow offers more than 200 programs of study and serves almost 45,000 \ncurrent students from all 50 States and more than 120 foreign \ncountries.\n  Among many other things, researchers at Michigan State University are \ncredited with the development of leading cancer fighting drugs and the \nprocess of milk homogenization. Michigan State is currently home to the \nNational Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, the leading rare isotope \nresearch facility in the country. The nuclear science research taking \nplace at this facility is improving our knowledge of the elements that \nmake up the world around us and could provide new medical \nbreakthroughs, including new tools for the treatment of cancer. This \nresearch, primarily funded by the National Science Foundation and the \nuniversity, has made Michigan State's nuclear physics doctoral program \none of the most prestigious in the Nation.\n  I know my colleagues will join me in congratulating Michigan State \nUniversity on 150 years of contributions to Michigan and the Nation as \na whole. I would also like to wish Michigan State University, its \nstudents, faculty, alumni, and supporters good luck and continued \nsuccess as they work to make the next 150 years as productive and full \nof accomplishment as previous 150 have been.\n Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the \nsesquicentennial, the 150th anniversary, of my alma mater, Michigan \nState University, MSU.\n  Located on the banks of the Red Cedar River, Michigan State \nUniversity was the first agricultural college in the Nation and the \nprototype for land-grant institutions later established under the \nMorrill Act of 1862. In fact, in the mid 1950s, the U.S. Postal Service \nhonored Michigan State University with a postage stamp commemorating it \nas the original land-grant university.\n  The land-grant philosophy is rooted in the principle to extend the \nvalues of education to all who seek it, and the Morrill Act grew out of \na movement to bring benefits of education to rural areas. The original \ntract of land in 1855 for my nascent college, then known as the \nAgricultural College of the State of Michigan, consisted of 677 acres. \nAdditional lands were purchased, and presently, the combined size of \nMichigan State lands--from its central campus to its research stations \naround the state--totals close to 20,000 acres across Michigan. As the \ncampus has grown, so has Michigan State's imprint on the world through \nits commitment to its students and its offering of a quality, public \nhigher education to all.\n  Academically, MSU students and colleges are highly regarded. The \nuniversity has had more Rhodes Scholars than any other Big Ten \nConference university in the past generation. U.S. News & World Report \nranks 10 of MSU's graduate departments in the Top 10 in their field \nnationally. On an international note, the University's Study Abroad \nprogram is the largest of any public university in the Nation, offering \nmore than 190 programs in more than 60 countries on all continents, \nincluding Antarctica. Furthermore, MSU is proud to have the highest \npercentage of in-state students among Michigan universities, with many \nof those who receive a bachelor's degree from MSU staying and working \nin the state.\n  The University has a notable and strong athletic history. In its 108-\nyear football history, Michigan State has won six NCAA national \nfootball championships, while last year, both its men's and women's \nbasketball teams made it to their respective and coveted Final Four \ntournaments. Sparty the Spartan is Michigan State University's fearless \nand loveable mascot, a figure known throughout the State of Michigan \nand recognized across the Nation as well. Sparty is the heart of \nMichigan State, forever supporting its teams, bringing smiles to young \nand old and continually uplifting all who meet him.\n  The State of Michigan has always been the ``first beneficiary'' of \nMSU's\n\n[[Page S13158]]\n\nhigh-quality academic programs and its global networks.

A bill to bring the FBI to full strength to carry out its \nmission; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Full Strength \nBureau Initiative Act of 2005. This is a piece of legislation that I \nthink is critically important to our national security. Over the past \nfour years, we\n\n[[Page S13163]]\n\nhave had numerous debates here in the Senate about what we need to do \nto protect ourselves from international terrorists. While I have \ndisagreed with many of the specific decisions this Congress and \nPresident Bush have made, I do agree that we face a grave threat from \nradical fundamental terrorists. And, it should be a primary focus of \nour national security efforts. However, it simply makes no sense for us \nto spend all of our time worrying about terrorism if we turn a blind \neye to traditional crime and the threat that it poses to our citizens. \nWe simply have to be able to do both, and the legislation that I am \nintroducing today will help do that.\n  Part of the response to address this threat has been to shift the \nprimary function of the Federal Bureau of Investigation from \ninvestigating and capturing criminals to the prevention of terror \nattacks. I don't disagree that this is an appropriate shift in \npriorities, but, we haven't made the investments necessary for the FBI \nto shift priorities and meet its commitment to combat traditional \ncrime. To address this concern, I am introducing legislation that will \nauthorize funding for the FBI to hire an additional 1,000 agents. These \nagents will replace the ones that have been reassigned to \ncounterterrorism cases and will help keep our communities safe. The \ncost--$160 million per year--is minimal when compared to the benefits \nit will provide. Its passage will help ensure that the FBI has the \nresources to achieve its counterterrorism priorities without neglecting \nits traditional crime fighting functions.\n  A 2004 Government Accountability Office found that the number of \noverall agents at the FBI has increased by only seven percent since \n2001. During the same time, the overall percentage of agents dedicated \nto counterterrorism by twenty five percent--with 678 agents being \npermanently shifted from drug, white collar, and violent crime cases to \ncounter-terror activities. In addition, we know that many agents are \nworking on counterterrorism cases even if they have not been \n``officially'' dedicated to that effort in a process know within the \nFBI as ``overburning.''\n  Ultimately, the GAO concluded, as it often does, that the impact on \ntraditional crime was statistically inconclusive; however the report \ndemonstrated many concerns. First, the report found that the FBI \nreferred 236 counterterrorism matters to U.S. Attorneys for prosecution \nin fiscal year 2001, which ended three weeks after September 11. Two \nyears later, in fiscal year 2003, the FBI referred 1,821 \ncounterterrorism cases to U.S. Attorneys for prosecution--this is a 671 \npercent increase. During the same period of time, referrals for drug, \nwhitecollar, and violent crime matters all declined by 39 percent, 23 \npercent, and 10 percent respectively. This statistically demonstrates \nthat the reprogramming effort--while critical--has had an impact on the \nFBI's traditional crime fighting efforts.\n  In addition to investigating Federal crimes, the FBI also provides \ncritical assistance to State and local law enforcement. Quite simply, \nthe FBI has technical expertise and resources that are not available to \nmany State and local agencies--especially smaller jurisdictions. These \nlocal agencies rely on the FBI to assist them on technical matters, and \nas the FBI continues to divert resources from criminal cases, a gap in \noverall law enforcement capabilities is developing. In order to \npreserve public safety and national security this is a gap that must be \nfilled.\n  Unfortunately, local budget woes are making it impossible for local \nagencies to fill the slack. A recent survey indicated that 23 of 44 \npolice agencies are facing an officer shortfall. The USA Today and the \nNew York Times have reported officer shortages in New York, Cleveland, \nLos Angeles, Houston and others. In addition, I recently attended a \nJudiciary Committee hearing in Philadelphia and we heard testimony from \nthe Philadelphia Chief of Police that he had lost 2,000 officers in \nrecent years, and the Pittsburgh police chief reported that she had \nlost nearly \\1/4\\ of her officers and had to suspend her community \npolicing programs and other crime prevention programs due to budget \ncuts.\n  In addition to local budget woes, the U.S. Congress continues to \nslash Federal assistance for State and local law enforcement. In this \nyear's Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill, the Congress cut \nroughly $300 million from the Justice Assistance Grant and completely \neliminated the COPS hiring program. Any local sheriff or police chief \nwill tell you how important this funding assistance is to their \nefforts, and the investments that we made in them over the past ten \nyears helped drive down crime rates from all-time highs to the lowest \nlevels in a generation. In addition, the COPS program has been \nstatistically proven to reduce crime by the Government Accountability \nOffice, and the Justice Assistance Grants are the primary grant \nprograms used by local agencies to combat illegal drug use in their \ncommunities. I voted for this spending bill because it provided \ncritical funding for the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Agency, but I \nremain very critical of the cuts to state and local law enforcement \nassistance and hope that the President and the Republican-led Congress \nwill change course.\n  Unfortunately, these cuts and the FBI reprogramming of agents from \ncrime to counter-terror cases is creating a perfect storm that I'm \nafraid will contribute to rising crime rates in the future. The good \nnews is that the 2004 Uniform Crime Reports show that crime rates \nremain at historic lows. But, many criminologists have pointed out that \nmany crime indicators should caution against complacency. Last year, \nthere were over 16,000 murders throughout the United States, and police \nchiefs and sheriffs are reporting worrying signs of local youth \nviolence. Indeed, a 2005 report by the FBI on youth gangs shows that \ngang activity is on the rise. Rather than pull-back, we need to re-\ndouble our effort to ensure that crime rates don't rise in the future \nand to push them even lower. I've often said that the safety of \nNation's citizens should be the top priority of our Federal \nGovernment--this applies to combating international terrorists and \ntraditional crime.\n  We spent a bulk of the nineties creating a Federal, State, and local \npartnership that helped make our Nation safer than it has been in a \ngeneration. This partnership is breaking down because the President and \nmany in Congress feel that local crime is not a national priority. I \ncouldn't disagree more. The safety of the American people is the most \nimportant priority that we have. It doesn't matter whether the threat \ncomes from international terrorists, drug traffickers, or from the thug \ndown the street. In my opinion, it is a terrible mistake to use the \nsuccesses of the past ten years and the new focus on terrorism as an \nexcuse to abandon our critical anti-crime responsibilities. We can--and \nwe must do both. The American people are counting on us, and the \nlegislation that I am introducing today will help ensure that we meet \nour commitment to the American people to make sure that they are safe \nfrom crime and terrorism.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. Durbin (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Leahy, \n        Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n        Akaka, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Pryor, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 2039. A bill to provide for loan repayment for prosecutors and \npublic defenders; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Prosecutors \nand Defenders Incentive Act of 2005. I am honored to have the support \nand cosponsorship of Senator DeWine with whom I have enjoyed working on \nsimilar measures in previous Congresses. I am further pleased that \nSenators Specter, Leahy, Kennedy, Feingold, Feinstein, Akaka, Cantwell, \nHarkin, Lautenberg, Pryor, and Kerry have also agreed to join me as \noriginal cosponsors of this legislation. Our bill is designed to \nencourage the best and the brightest law school graduates to enter \npublic service as criminal prosecutors and public defenders by making a \nstudent loan repayment program available to them.\n  I am pleased that this legislation enjoys bipartisan support. I am \nanxious to work closely with Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Leahy \nto advance it through the Judiciary Committee and secure its enactment \nby the full Senate.\n\n[[Page S13164]]\n\n  Our proposed loan repayment program is supported by the American Bar \nAssociation, the National District Attorneys Association, the National \nAssociation of Prosecutor Coordinators, the National Legal Aid and \nDefender Association, and the American Council of Chief Defenders.\n  We can--and should--do more to help prosecutor and public defender \noffices compete with the higher salaries available in the private \nsector. In many instances, despite high aspirations and strong \nmotivation to work in the public sector, many graduates find it \neconomically impossible to pursue that career path due to the \noverwhelming burden of debt. The availability of student loan repayment \ncan be a powerful incentive for attracting some of our most talented \nnew lawyers to public service employment.\n  Many of today's law graduates are finishing law school owing \nstaggering amounts of student loan debt. According to the American Bar \nAssociation, the median total cumulative educational debt for law \nschool graduates in the class of 2004 was $97,763 for private schools \nand $66,810 for public schools. Educational loan debts represent a \nserious financial obligation which must be repaid. A default on any \nloan triggers serious consequences. Moreover, the looming obligation \ncan impact career choices for many new graduates.\n  Many budding prosecutors and public defenders face a disheartening \ndilemma. On the one hand, they have a deep commitment to pursuing a \ncareer in public service. On the other hand, they need a level of \nincome to meet the demands of exorbitant educational loan liabilities. \nThis wrenching choice has not only personal impact but adverse \nimplications for the legal profession and its commitment to ensuring \naccess to justice for all citizens. And from an employer's perspective, \ncomparatively low salaries and high debt make it extremely difficult to \nrecruit and retain attorneys in prosecutor and public defender offices.\n  The results of a special study, ``Lifting the Burden: Law Student \nDebt as a Barrier to Public Service,'' published in August 2003 by the \nAmerican Bar Association, reflects eight key findings, which I will \ndescribe in more specificity in my remarks.\n  First, law school tuition levels have skyrocketed. Second, the vast \nmajority of law students borrow funds to finance their legal education. \nThird, law students are borrowing increasingly larger sums to finance \ntheir legal education. Fourth, public service salaries have not kept \npace with rising law school debt burdens or private sector salaries. \nFifth, high student debt bars many law graduates from pursuing public \nservice careers. Sixth, many law graduates who take public service \nlegal jobs must leave after they gain 2 to 3 years of experience. \nSeventh, public service employers report serious difficulty recruiting \nand retaining lawyers. And eighth, the legal profession and society pay \na severe price when law graduates are shut out from pursuing public \nservice legal careers due to high educational debt burden.\n  On the matter of skyrocketing tuition levels, since the early 1970s, \nthere have been steep and persistent hikes in the costs of legal \neducation and in the tuition rates law schools charge. Researchers \nfound that tuition increased about 340 percent from 1985 to 2002 for \nprivate law school students and out-of-state students at public law \nschools. In state students at public law schools saw their tuition jump \nabout 500 percent. During the period 1992-2002, the cost of living in \nthe United States rose 28 percent while the cost of tuition for public \nlaw schools rose 134 percent for residents and 100 percent for \nnonresidents, and private law school tuition increased 76 percent.\n  In 1975, when private law school tuition averaged $2,525 and public \nlaw school tuition for in state residents was $700, the need to borrow \nto finance a legal education was not as prevalent or necessary. In \n1990, when tuition was $11,680 for private institutions and $3,012 for \npublic law schools, it was at least manageable. In 2002, the median law \nschool annual tuitions were $24,920 for private law schools, $18,131 \nfor nonresident students at public law schools, and $9,252 for resident \nstudents at public law schools.\n  A computation of the tuition rates of the 186 ABA-accredited law \nschools for 2004 reflects that charges for State residents at public \nlaw schools average $10,820 per year. For nonresidents attending public \nlaw schools, the average tuition amounts to $20,176 per year. Students \nattending private law schools pay an average of $25,603 per year.\n  Additional amounts for food, lodging, books, fees and personal \nexpenses increase the costs for 3 years to more than $60,000 in almost \nall cases and well over $100,000 in many instances.\n  The vast majority of law students must borrow funds to finance their \nlegal education. In 2002, almost 87 percent of law students borrowed to \nfinance their legal education. That level remained consistent in 2004. \nMany of these students also carried unpaid debt from their \nundergraduate studies.\n  Law students are borrowing increasingly larger sums to finance their \nlegal education. As tuition and other expenses of attending law school \nrose, more and more students found they needed to borrow to pay for law \nschool. During the 1990s, the average amount students borrowed more \nthan doubled. Today, the amount borrowed by many students exceeds \n$80,000.\n  Public service salaries have not kept pace with rising law school \ndebt burdens or private sector salaries. Entry-level salaries for \ngovernment or other public service position, have always been \nsignificantly lower than those in private practice.\n  Over the years since the mid-1970s, the median starting salaries in \nprivate practice have risen at a much faster pace than entry-level \npublic service salaries. Between 1985 and 2002, the median starting \nsalaries at private law firms rose by about 280 percent. Government \nlawyers, such as prosecutors and public defenders, saw their salaries \nincrease by just 70 percent.\n  According to the 2004 Public Sector and Public Interest Attorney \nSalary Report, published in August 2004 by the National Association for \nLaw Placement, Inc., the median entry-level salary for public defenders \nis $39,000; with 11 to 15 years of experience, the median is $65,000. \nThe salary progression for State and local prosecuting attorneys is \nsimilar, starting at about $40,000 and progressing to $68,000-69,000 \nfor those with 11 to 15 years of experience.\n  In August 2004, NALP also released the results of its tenth annual \ncomprehensive survey of associate compensation in private sector law \nfirms. According to the 2004 Associate Salary Survey Report, based on \nsalary information as of April 1, 2004 provided by 599 offices, the \nmedian salary for first-year associates ranged from $65,000 in firms of \n2 to 25 attorneys to $120,000 in firms of 500 attorneys or more, with a \nfirst-year median for all participating firms of $95,000. These figures \nevidence the stark reality of compensation differentials for those \ngraduates electing to devote their skills to public service jobs as \nprosecutors and defenders.\n  High student debt bars many law graduates from pursuing public \nservice careers. As law school tuition and student debt have sharply \nescalated, fewer and fewer law school graduates can afford to take the \ncomparatively low-paying public service positions that are available in \ngovernment agencies or with prosecutor, public defender, or legal \nservices offices.\n  A national study of law school debt conducted by Equal Justice Works, \nthe Partnership for Public Service, and the National Association for \nLaw Placement found that law student debt prevented two-thirds of law \nstudent respondents from considering a public service career.\n  The report was based on a spring 2002 survey of graduating law \nstudents. Survey respondents included 1,622 students from 117 law \nschools representing 40 States, the District of Columbia, and Canada. \nAmong the findings reported were the following: Overall, 66 percent of \nrespondents stated that law school debt kept them from considering a \npublic interest or government job. The percentage is higher among those \nwho ultimately accepted jobs in small or large private firms, with 83 \npercent and 78 percent, respectively, stating that debt prevented them \nfrom seeking work with public interest organizations or the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Seventy-three percent of students who had not yet accepted a job when \nsurveyed also indicated that they were disinclined to seek a public \ninterest or government position due to heavy debt load. Providing \n$6,000 a year in available loan repayment assistance would\n\n[[Page S13165]]\n\nresult in increased interest in a post graduate Federal Government job \nfor 83 percent of student respondents.\n  Despite their high debt burden, some law graduates initially accept \npublic service jobs. However, the magnitude of debt precipitates high \nturnover because many of these cannot repay loan obligations on a \nmedian starting salary of $36,000 and pay all their other remaining \nliving expenses with the remaining $1,100 per month. Some who begin \ncareers in public service, and who would like to remain, leave after a \nfew years when they find their debts are too severely constraining on \ntheir hopes for making ends meet, much less raising children or saving \nfor retirement.\n  Many public service employers report having a difficult time \nattracting the best qualified law graduates. Public service employers, \nsuch as prosecutor or public defender offices, have vacancies they \ncannot fill because new law graduates cannot afford to work for them. \nAlternatively, those who do hire law graduates find that, because of \neducational debt payments, those whom they do hire leave just at the \npoint when they have acquired the experience to provide the most \nvaluable services.\n  The legal profession and society pay a severe price when law \ngraduates are shut out from pursuing public service legal careers due \nto high educational debt burden. Lawyers with dreams of serving their \ncommunities as prosecutors or public defenders are unable to use their \nskills to do so. And when governments cannot hire new lawyers or keep \nexperienced ones, the ability to protect the public safety is \nchallenged. The inability of poor and moderate-income persons to obtain \nlegal assistance can result in dire consequences to those individuals \nand the communities in which they live.\n  Our bill, the Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act, is designed to \nhelp remedy some of these problems. Enacting this measure will help \nmake legal careers in public service as prosecutors and public \ndefenders in the criminal justice system more financially viable and \nattractive to law school graduates who have incurred significant \nfinancial obligations in acquiring their education.\n  Our proposal would establish, within the Department of Justice, a \nprogram of student loan repayment for borrowers who agree to remain \nemployed for at least 3 years as public attorneys who are either State \nor local criminal prosecutors or State, local, or Federal public \ndefenders in criminal cases. It would allow eligible attorneys to \nreceive student loan debt repayments of up to $10,000 per year, with a \nmaximum aggregate over time of $60,000.\n\n  Repayment benefits for such public attorneys would be made available \non a first-come, first-served basis and subject to the availability of \nappropriations. Priority would be given to borrowers who received \nrepayment benefits for the preceding fiscal year and have completed \nless than 3 years of the first required service period. Borrowers could \nenter into an additional agreement, after the required 3-year period, \nfor a successive period of service which may be less than 3 years. It \nwould cover student loans made, insured, or guaranteed under the Higher \nEducation Act of 1965, including consolidation loans. Furthermore, it \nwould extend to Federal public defenders the existing Perkins loan \nforgiveness program available for Federal prosecutors.\n  Our bill is modeled on the program for Federal executive branch \nemployees which has been enjoying growing success. Federal law permits \nFederal executive branch agencies to repay their employees' student \nloans, up to $10,000 in a year, and up to a lifetime maximum of \n$60,000. In exchange, the employee must agree to remain with the agency \nfor at least 3 years.\n  During fiscal year 2004, 28 executive branch agencies provided 2,945 \nFederal employees with more than $16.4 million in student loan \nrepayments, as reported by the Office of Personnel Management in April \n2005. This marked a 42-percent increase in the number of beneficiaries \nand a 79-percent increase in benefits over fiscal year 2003.\n  It is noteworthy that across the Federal Government in 2004, agencies \nused the loan repayment program most often to recruit and retain \nattorneys. In fiscal year 2004, 473 Federal lawyers received loan \nrepayments, representing 16.1 percent of all employees who received the \nbenefit.\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission provided the benefit to 239 \nlawyers, and the Justice Department distributed program benefits to 118 \nof its attorneys. According to the Office of Personnel Management's \nreport, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission reported that the program has \nbeen of tremendous benefit in recruiting and retaining attorneys in its \nHonors Law Graduate Program. NRC commented that law school debt is \ncontinuing to rise--to more than $100,000 in some cases--and a gap \nexists between Federal and private law firm salaries. As a result, some \nquality candidates may rule out a career as an attorney in the Federal \nGovernment. NRC believes the Federal student loan repayment program \nhelps the Commission overcome these obstacles.\n  I recently received a compelling letter from Jennifer Walsh, the \nassistant appellate defender for the State of Illinois. Her experiences \nportray in testamentary terms the real dilemmas encountered by perhaps \nthousands of attorneys desiring public service careers despite \nexorbitant student loan obligations.\n  To simply paraphrase Ms. Walsh's sentiments would diminish their \nimpact, so I would like to quote some excerpts from her letter: ``I \nlove being a public servant. . . . Helping those who cannot afford to \nhelp themselves isn't charity and it isn't socially progressive. It is \njustice and it has made me a better person. . . . However, the one \nproblem that I have consistently had since becoming a public defender \nis getting my student loans paid. I have a debt burden over $110,000. . \n. . My student loan payments will soon exceed $950 a month. This \nrepresents about one-third of my monthly take-home pay. I cannot help \npay the mortgage on my house. I cannot save for my two children's \nfutures. During a financial crisis, my husband knows that he cannot \nlook to me to help the family finances. . . . I am now faced with a \nHobson's choice--do I fulfill the needs of my indigent clients or my \nstruggling family? I absolutely, positively don't want to leave. But my \nresponsibilities to my family and my student loan creditors make \nstaying in the public sector feel selfish and irresponsible. Imagine \nthat--working for the public good seems selfish and irresponsible \nbecause I cannot do what I love and, at the same time, repay what I \nowe.''\n  I appreciate Ms. Walsh's willingness to share her perspectives with \nme. By enacting and funding this legislation, we can take a meaningful \nstep toward alleviating some of the financial burden for attorneys such \nas Ms. Walsh who choose careers as criminal prosecutors and public \ndefenders.\n  I know there are many other law graduates who, like Jennifer Walsh, \nwant to apply their legal training and develop their skills in the \npublic sector, but are deterred by the weight of student loan \nobligations. Passage of our legislation will help them make their \ncareers dreams a reality. I urge its swift adoption.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2039\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. \n101 et seq.) to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security is led \nby qualified, experienced personnel; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill help ensure our homeland security is in the hands of the best and \nthe brightest leaders. The Department of Homeland Security Qualified \nLeaders Act will establish minimum qualification standards for most \nSenate-confirmed positions in the Department of Homeland Security, DHS. \nI am joined by Senators Lautenberg and Carper in introducing this bill, \nand I thank them for their support.\n  Hurricane Katrina and the resignation of Under Secretary Michael \nBrown have raised concerns regarding the experience and qualifications \nof political appointees in the Federal Government. Mr. Brown had \nminimal emergency management experience prior to joining the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, FEMA. Despite Mr. Brown's 3 years as a \nsenior official at FEMA, the agency faltered during Hurricane Katrina \nunder his leadership.\n  While not all of the Government's failures to prepare for and respond \nto Hurricane Katrina can be placed at Mr. Brown's doorstep, leadership \nmatters. At a recent Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee hearing on the Coast Guard's response to Hurricane Katrina, \nCpt Bruce C. Jones, the commanding officer of Coast Guard Air Station \nNew Orleans, testified, ``What counts most in a crisis, is not the \nplan, it's leadership. Not processes, but people. And not \norganizational charts, but organizational culture.''\n\n  According to Captain Jones, one of the reasons the Coast Guard was \nable to respond immediately and perform efficiently during Hurricane \nKatrina is because the leaders of the Eighth District and Sector New \nOrleans were able to make quick, sound decisions while following a \npredetermined plan. Quick thinking and good judgement cannot be written \ninto a plan.\n  In addition, DHS, with its multitude of management challenges, \nrequires leaders with strong management experience. Over the past few \nyears, the DHS Inspector General and the Government Accountability \nOffice have cited DHS for poor contract management, ineffective \nfinancial systems, and major human capital challenges. Moreover, DHS is \nin the process of implementing its Second Stage Review, an attempt to \nbetter organize the Department to meet its many missions. As Secretary \nMichael Chertoff overhauls the Department to create what will hopefully \nbe a structure that serve DHS well for years to come, he needs senior \nofficials who have experience running large organizations--people who \nknow which systems and chains of command work and which do not. Good \nmanagers are needed across the Federal Government, but nowhere are they \nmore needed than in an infant agency.\n\n  Comptroller General David Walker said in a September 21, 2005, \ninterview with Federal Times that ``for certain positions, given the \nnature of the position, there should be statutory qualification \nrequirements for any nominee.'' I agree.\n  For these reasons, we must ensure that the right people are leading \nDHS. Our bill delineates requirements for Senate-confirmed positions \nbased on their compensation under the Executive Schedule. The most \nsenior officials, those in Executive Level II and III, will be required \nto possess at least 5 years of management experience, 5 years of \nexperience in a field relevant to the position for which the individual\n\n[[Page S13167]]\n\nis nominated, such as customs intelligence, or cybersecurity, and a \ndemonstrated ability to manage a substantial staff and budget. These \nrequirements will apply to the following positions: the Under Secretary \nof Science and Technology; the Under Secretary of Preparedness; the \nDirector of FEMA; and the Under Secretary of Management. The Secretary \nand Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security are exempt from this bill.\n  Executive Level IV positions will be required to possess significant \nmanagement experience, at least 5 years of experience in a field \nrelevant to the position for which the individual is nominated, and a \ndemonstrated ability to manage a substantial staff and budget. These \nposition include the Assistant Secretary for Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement; the Assistant Secretary for Customs and Border Patrol; the \nAssistant Secretary for Border and Transportation Security Policy; the \nAssistant Secretary for Plans, Programs, and Budgets; the Director of \nthe Office State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness; \nthe Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services; the \nInspector General; the Chief Financial Officer; the U.S. Fire \nAdministrator; and the General Counsel. The bill exempts the commandant \nof the Coast Guard from this section since requirements for selection \nof the commandant already exist in law.\n  I believe that any program or agency will succeed or fail based on \nleadership. This is especially true at Federal agencies, which need \nsenior leaders with management skills and subject matter expertise. Our \nbill is a step in the right direction, and I urge my colleagues to join \nus in passing this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord following my statement.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2040\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Homeland \n     Security Qualified Leaders Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Department of Homeland Security, a large \n     organization comprised of 180,000 employees and 22 legacy \n     agencies, has a complex mission of securing the homeland from \n     man-made and natural disasters;\n       (2) the Department and the agencies within require strong \n     leadership from proven managers with significant experience \n     in their respective fields; and\n       (3) the majority of positions requiring Senate confirmation \n     at the Department do not have minimum qualifications.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for the conveyance of a United States Fish \nand Wildlife Service administrative site to the city of Las Vegas, \nNevada; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Ed Fountain \nPark Expansion Act. This legislation would transfer approximately eight \nacres of Federal land to the city of Las Vegas to allow for the \nexpansion of one of the city's most popular parks.\n  Ed Fountain Park is one of the best known and well-used parks in the \ncity of Las Vegas. Located in a mature part of the city, adjacent to \nthe city's oldest golf course, Ed Fountain Park has provided \nrecreational opportunities for generations of local residents. For many \nyears it has been home to Pop Warner football practices, youth soccer \ngames, and family picnics and reunions. On any given day or night, a \nmultitude of activities are taking place at the park, many of which are \nassociated with the numerous nonprofit organizations that utilize the \npark's resources.\n  The city of Las Vegas contacted my office several months ago to \nexpress their desire to expand Ed Fountain Park by acquiring land \nadjacent to the park that served as the site of the local \nadministrative offices for the Bureau of Land Management, BLM, and U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service. The property was vacated by both Federal \nland management agencies several years ago after they relocated to a \nlarger, multi-jurisdictional facility in the northwest part of the Las \nVegas Valley.\n  The property to be acquired by the city is technically classified as \npart of the Desert National Wildlife Refuge Complex and is currently \nunder the jurisdiction of the Fish and Wildlife Service. The parcel in \nquestion, however, is many miles away the actual wildlife refuge and \nsits as a vacant urban lot. The former administrative offices that were \nhoused on the land were placed there many decades ago when this area \nwas considered to be in the outskirts of town. Now, after years of \nunprecedented growth, this land is surrounded by well-established \nneighborhoods. The site also contains a single empty historical \nstructure that would be part of the conveyance.\n  Were the property under the jurisdiction of the BLM, as is usually \nthe case in the Las Vegas Valley, the property could have been \ntransferred administratively under the authority of the Recreation and \nPublic Purposes Act. But because it is the property of the Fish and \nWildlife Service, legislation is needed to transfer ownership of the \nproperty from the Fish and Wildlife Service to the city.\n  This legislation provides the city with maximum flexibility to use \nthe parcel to expand Ed Fountain Park, to build new athletic fields, to \ndevelop a community center, or any combination of these uses. All of \nthese potential uses are in the public interest and provide important \njustification for conveying the land to the city at no cost.\n  I look forward to working with the distinguished chairman and ranking\n\n[[Page S13168]]\n\nmember of the Environment and Public Works Committee to move this \nlegislation forward in a timely manner.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2041\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ed Fountain Park Expansion \n     Act ''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Administrative site.--The term ``administrative site'' \n     means the parcel of real property identified as ``Lands to be \n     Conveyed to the City of Las Vegas; approximately, 7.89 \n     acres'' on the map entitled ``Ed Fountain Park Expansion'' \n     and dated November 1, 2005.\n       (2) City.--The term ``City'' means the city of Las Vegas, \n     Nevada.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior, acting through the Director of the United \n     States Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONVEYANCE OF UNITED STATES FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE \n                   ADMINISTRATIVE SITE, LAS VEGAS, NEVADA.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall convey to the City, \n     without consideration, all right, title, and interest of the \n     United States in and to the administrative site for use by \n     the City--\n       (1) as a park; or\n       (2) for any other recreation or nonprofit-related purpose.\n       (b) Administrative Expenses.--As a condition of the \n     conveyance under subsection (a), the Secretary shall require \n     that the City pay the administrative costs of the conveyance, \n     including survey costs and any other costs associated with \n     the conveyance.\n       (c) Reversionary Interest.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Secretary determines that the City \n     is not using the administrative site for a purpose described \n     in paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (a), all right, title, \n     and interest of the City in and to the administrative site \n     (including any improvements to the administrative site) shall \n     revert, at the option of the Secretary, to the United States.\n       (2) Hearing.--Any determination of the Secretary with \n     respect to a reversion under paragraph (1) shall be made--\n       (A) on the record; and\n       (B) after an opportunity for a hearing.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAMBLISS (for himself and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 2042. A bill to amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and \nRodenticide Act to implement pesticide-related obligations of the \nUnited States under the international conventions or protocols known as \nthe PIC Convention, the POPs Convention, and the LRTAP POPs Protocol; \nto the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, today, Senator Harkin and I are \nintroducing the POPs, LRTAP POPs and PIC Implementation Act of 2005. \nThis bill would amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and \nRodenticide Act (FIFRA) to implement the United States' pesticide-\nrelated obligations under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent \nOrganic Pollutants (POPs Convention), the Aarhus Protocol on Persistent \nOrganic Pollutants to the Geneva Convention on Long Range Transboundary \nAir Pollution (LRTAP POPs Protocol) and the Rotterdam Convention on the \nPrior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and \nPesticides in International Trade (PIC Convention).\n  POPs are certain chemicals that are toxic, persist in the environment \nfor an extended period of time and can bioaccumulate in the human food \nchain. POPs have been linked to adverse health effects on humans and \nanimals. Due to their persistent characteristics and ability to \ncirculate globally, POPs that are released in one part of the world can \ntravel to neighboring regions and negatively affect environments where \nthey are not produced or used.\n  The United States has taken a leading role in reducing and \neliminating the use POPs. For example, in the late 1970s, the United \nStates prohibited the manufacture of new PCBs and severely restricted \nthe use of remaining stocks. And over the past 35 years, the United \nStates has had a strong regulatory process that restricted the \nproduction and use of dangerous pesticides. Even prior to signing the \nPOPs Convention, the United States prohibited the sale of all the POPs \npesticides initially targeted by the convention.\n  In 2001, President George W. Bush signed the POPs Convention. Its \nultimate goal is the safe management of hazardous chemicals. Over time, \nthe convention will help bring an end to the production and use of \ndangerous pollutants around the world and to positively affect the U.S. \nenvironment and public health.\n  Specifically, the convention requires all signatory nations to stop \nthe production and use of 12 listed POPs, including DDT, PCBs and \ndioxins. Parties to the convention also agree to control sources of \nPOPs by-products to reduce releases and provide for the safe handling \nand disposal of POPs in an environmentally sound manner. The convention \nincludes a science-based procedure to allow other POPs to be added and \nprovides technical and financial assistance to help developing \ncountries manage and control POPs.\n  In 1998, the United States and members of the United Nations Economic \nCommission for Europe (UN-ECE) negotiated a regional protocol on POPs \nunder the auspices of the Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air \nPollution (LRTAP). Informally, the agreement is called the LRTAP POPs \nProtocol. The goal of the protocol is to eliminate production and \nreduce emissions of POPs in North America and Europe.\n  The LRTAP POPs Protocol was the basis for the POPs Convention. The \ntwo agreements are similar in purpose, except that the LRTAP treaty is \nregional and it does not include trade restrictions or the technical \nand financial assistance available to developing nations under the POPs \nConvention. Also, the LRTAP POPs Protocol includes four additional \nchemicals to the 12 listed in the POPs Convention.\n  In 1998, the PIC Convention established an information-sharing \nprocess to promote cooperative efforts among the parties to the \nconvention regarding trade in chemicals. The process is designed to \nhelp nations decide whether to allow a chemical to be imported. \nBasically, the PIC Convention provides for prior notification to \npotential importing countries by nations exporting chemicals that have \nbeen banned or severely restricted in the exporting country. Countries \nexporting the chemicals listed in the convention must generally ensure \nthat the importing country has consented to import the chemical.\n  The bill we are introducing today would prohibit the sale, \ndistribution, use, production or disposal of any listed POPs pesticides \nor LRTAP POPs pesticide. It would establish notice and reporting \nprocedures to ensure the American public is aware of potential actions \nand decisions made by the parties to the conventions. The bill also \nwould add new export reporting and labeling requirements to ensure \ncompliance with U.S. obligations under the PIC Convention.\n  In order for the United States to become a party to the conventions, \nthe Senate must ratify the POPs and PIC Conventions. Congress also must \npass implementing legislation. This bill does not include a \nratification resolution and it does not amend the Toxic Substances \nControl Act.\n  At this time, the United States is not a party to the conventions and \ndoes not have a seat at the negotiating table. This weak position \nhampers the ability of our technical experts and negotiators to protect \nour leadership role in international pesticide policy and regulation. \nOur observer-only status also limits our ability to participate in the \ncritical decisions that affect U.S. businesses and economic interests \nand our environment and public health. The delay in ratifying the \nconventions serves to marginalize us.\n  The U.S. delegation was unable to fully participate in the first \nmeeting of parties to the POPs Convention held in May 2005 in Punta del \nEste, Uruguay. The next meeting of the parties to the POPs Convention \nis May 2006. I urge my colleagues to ratify the conventions and pass \nimplementing legislation so that the United States can reclaim its \nrightful place as a world leader in the safe management of hazardous \nchemicals.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee and the Environment and Public Works Committee on \nthis matter.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with Chairman \nChambliss in introducing legislation to implement the Stockholm \nConvention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, the\n\n[[Page S13169]]\n\nLRTAP POPs Protocol, and the Rotterdam PIC Protocol. These three \nagreements provide an international framework for controlling and \neliminating the use of chemicals that have the greatest potential for \nlong-term environmental damage. These persistent organic pollutants, or \nPOPs, are chemicals that do not easily break down in the environment. \nAs a result, they tend to move across international boundaries and bio-\naccumulate--in other words, they travel up the food chain. This \nlegislation modifies existing U.S. law under the Federal Insecticide, \nFungicide and Rodenticide Act, FIFRA, to bring us into compliance with \nthese agreements with regard to chemicals used in agriculture. \nImplementation of the agreements will also require modification of the \nToxic Substances Control Act, TSCA.\n  These conventions and protocols have already entered into force. But \nat this point, though the United States is a signatory to all of them, \nwe have not ratified them. All of the chemicals that are listed in the \nagreement are already banned or tightly controlled under U.S. law, but \nthe Stockholm Convention's Review Committee just met in Geneva and \nfurther meetings are planned, and decisions are being made without our \ndelegation able to fully participate as a party to the agreement. The \nUnited States needs to ratify the convention in order to have a voice \nin this process.\n  Our goal in writing this legislation is narrow. It has not been our \nintention to open up FIFRA as part of this process, but only to craft \nthose changes compelled by our international commitments. That is not \nto say that FIFRA is perfect or could not be improved and \nstrengthened--only that this is not the occasion to launch into \nchanging the domestic law beyond the narrow goal of compliance with \nthese agreements.\n  Some have urged that this measure provide for automatic processes \ntriggered by the decisions of the review committee overseeing the \nStockholm Convention. For instance, if the review committee lists a \nchemical, they would have the United States automatically take steps to \nregulate or ban the chemical domestically. I have sympathy with that \napproach, and I would hope that our existing environmental laws would \nbe used to restrict the use of such a chemical before international \naction, as they have with all the initial chemicals listed in the \nStockholm Convention.\n  But that is not what is called for in the Stockholm Convention. The \nconvention that this legislation will implement does not compel parties \nto adopt new chemicals added to the convention in future years. \nInstead, the parties are allowed to opt in to the convention's \nrestrictions. The legislation we are introducing today would allow for \nany information or studies generated as part of the international \nprocess to be used as part of a domestic regulatory action on the \nchemical, but would not provide an automatic process that compelled the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, to take action. In essence, we \nare allowing the EPA to move forward and take action on a chemical if \nthe case made in the international review for a ban is strong, and not \nmake EPA reinvent the wheel and generate new data to back up their \nconclusions, while at the same time, not mandating EPA action to ban or \nregulate a chemical. This legislation strikes a fair balance and one \nthat is consistent with the limited goal we have in this process to \nbring FIFRA into compliance with our international obligations.\n  The most controversial aspects of this legislation are the provisions \nthat deal with the process by which new chemicals are brought under the \nconvention's control. It is critically important that the position of \nthe United States in the international regulation of chemicals take \ninto account the views of all parties--pesticide manufacturers, \nfarmers, environmental scientists, State regulators--everyone who has a \nstake in the process.\n  Under the Stockholm Convention, the process of listing new POPs \nchemicals follows a three-part process. The review committee determines \nwhether a chemical satisfies the agreed screening criteria in the \nconvention; if the criteria are satisfied, a risk profile is prepared; \nif on the basis of the risk profile, it is determined that global \naction is required, the committee or parties would consider listing the \nchemical.\n  In each of these stages, the U.S. position should be informed by \nformal notice and comment periods as provided in existing law. The \nFederal notice and comment process is open, well developed, and well \nunderstood by stakeholders in the process. If this process is optional, \nthere is the risk that the U.S. position could be formed without taking \ninto account important views. While nothing in this legislation \ndictates that any particular position in this established process be \ntaken by the administration, there is a requirement that the \nadministration use this process to collect information to inform its \nposition in the international body regarding any particular chemical.\n  The administration's draft of this legislation gave the EPA \nAdministrator permission to initiate a notice and comment period but \ndid not require it. The argument for this position was a constitutional \nclaim that the executive's authority over negotiations with other \nnations includes a right to rely on whatever information that the \npresident chooses to use. The ``remedy'' for negotiating a faulty \ntreaty, according to the letter received from the Department of \nJustice, is for the Senate to refuse to consent to the treaty.\n  This position is not consistent with existing Federal law and is \nimpractical particularly in a process like this one, where the \nnegotiation in question would never be subject to ratification by the \nSenate. My concern with this constitutional theory resulted in an \nexchange of correspondence last year, when this bill was being drafted \nby then-Chairman Cochran.\n  I wrote to then-Administrator Michael Leavitt at the EPA, asking for \na written explanation of the administration's position on this issue. \nThis resulted in two letters, one from Administrator Leavitt on behalf \nof the EPA dated March 25, 2004, and one from Assistant Attorney \nGeneral William Moschella on behalf of the Department of Justice dated \nMarch 25, 2004. Finally, I requested an analysis of the constitutional \nissues raised by this provision from the American Law Division of the \nCongressional Research Service and received a memorandum dated March \n30, 2004. I will offer all of these letters and the CRS memorandum for \ninclusion in the Record at the end of my statement.\n  Having reviewed all this material, I find that the administration's \nposition is not well supported, and I would urge the Senate to reject \nany effort to include it in this legislation. The CRS memorandum on the \nEPA draft summarizes the state of the law as follows:\n  Stated succinctly, the separation of powers doctrine ``implicit in \nthe Constitution and well established in case law, forbids Congress \nfrom infringing upon the Executive Branch's ability to perform its \ntraditional functions.'' The Supreme Court has established that in \ndetermining whether an act of Congress has violated the doctrine, ``the \nproper inquiry focuses on the extent to which it prevents the Executive \nBranch from accomplishing its constitutionally assigned functions.''\n  The memo goes on to state that it is ``difficult to see how a \nmandatory notice and comment requirement would implicate this \ntraditional executive function.'' The memorandum concludes that ``it \ndoes not appear that a mandatory notice and comment requirement would \npresent any substantive separation of powers concerns.'' Clearly, there \nis no merit to the Justice Department's contention that mandatory \nnotice and comment would be an unconstitutional intrusion into the \nPresident's exclusive prerogative over foreign policy. Clearly, future \nsteps taken domestically to carry out these international agreements \nshould be informed by the views of all stakeholders and build the \nrecord through the notice and comment procedure for domestic \nimplementation of any international action. This legislation makes the \nright choice by mandating notice and comment.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to work with Chairman Chambliss on this \nlegislation, and with our committee's previous chair, Senator Cochran, \nwhose staff worked tirelessly to develop this legislation. I am hopeful \nthat we can work together with the other body to reach agreement on \nimplementing legislation along the lines of this bill,\n\n[[Page S13170]]\n\nthat will clear the way for ratification of the Stockholm Convention.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a letter to \nAdministrator Michael Leavitt, his response from March 25, 2004, the \nresponse to the same letter by William Moschella on behalf of the \nJustice Department, and the memorandum of law from the Congressional \nResearch Service.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Committee on Agriculture,\n\n\n                                      Nutrition, and Forestry,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 12, 2004.\n     Hon. Michael Leavitt,\n     Administrator, Environmental Protection Administration, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Administrator Leavitt: Thank you for your note asking \n     for my help in passing legislation to implement the Stockholm \n     Protocols. I certainly want to be helpful in that regard and \n     support moving implementing legislation quickly that will \n     enhance the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency to \n     eliminate the threat that persistent organic pollutants \n     (POPs) pose to our environment.\n       As we move forward on this legislation, I believe it is \n     important to regulate not only the so-called ``dirty dozen'' \n     POPs that are explicitly controlled by the Stockholm \n     Protocols, but also to improve your agency's ability to \n     address these types of pollutants through the EPA's \n     regulatory system as expeditiously as possible, with \n     opportunities for public participation and comment. This \n     public participation and comment is particularly important to \n     inform the agency in its evaluation of potential new \n     pollutants brought before the review committee formed by this \n     legislation.\n       One version of proposed implementing legislation would \n     provide for mandatory notice and comment periods to allow \n     public input at each of the three stages of the review \n     committee process. The most recent draft of the legislation \n     put forward by the EPA, however, makes each of these notice \n     and comment periods fully subject to the agency's discretion. \n     It has also been asserted that if Congress required the \n     agency to provide a notice and comment period based on action \n     of the international body, it would unconstitutionally \n     impinge on our national sovereignty. This is a novel \n     constitutional analysis that I would like to understand \n     better before this legislation moves forward.\n       I request that, prior to our Committee taking up this \n     issue, you provide me with any legal analysis, legal \n     opinions, and citations to any legal authority supporting the \n     proposition that Congress cannot require the EPA to hold \n     notice and comment periods in response to the actions of an \n     international body. I know that you are as committed as I am \n     to move this legislation expeditiously, and I look forward to \n     receiving this information soon.\n       Again, I look forward to working with you on this matter \n     and want to help in any way I can to assist you in your work \n     of improving our nation's environment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Tom Harkin,\n     Ranking Democratic Member.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       United States Environmental\n\n\n                                            Protection Agency,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 25, 2004.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and \n         Forestry, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: Thank you very much for your letter of \n     February 12, 2004. I appreciate your willingness to support \n     the legislative efforts of the Administration to allow the \n     United States to become a Party to the Stockholm Convention \n     on Persistent Organic Pollutants, the Rotterdam Convention on \n     the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous \n     Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade and the \n     Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants to the 1979 \n     Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution.\n       In your letter, you noted a particular interest in the \n     discretionary notice and comment procedures contained within \n     the Administration's proposed legislation to implement the \n     FIFRA-related obligations of the three environmental treaties \n     referenced above. The Administration's proposal does not make \n     these notice and comment procedures mandatory, and you \n     requested additional information about the constitutional \n     concerns that underlie that decision. I asked my staff to \n     organize a meeting for the Department of Justice to discuss \n     its constitutional concerns with your legislative assistants \n     and to answer any questions. I understand that meeting \n     occurred on March 3, 2004.\n       As you know, the Stockholm Convention creates an \n     international ``Persistent Organic Pollutants Review \n     Committee'' to evaluate whether various substances should be \n     added or removed from the Convention's coverage. The United \n     States expects to play a strong role at the international \n     meetings of the Review Committee, and, as you note in your \n     letter, the United States could use the notice and comment \n     procedures under the proposed bill to ``allow public input at \n     each of the three stages of the review committee process.''\n       U.S. stakeholders will no doubt have a great deal of \n     expertise about proposed pollutants brought before the \n     international review committee, and the Administration \n     proposal specifically includes notice and comment procedures \n     to allow the Executive branch to take advantage of this \n     knowledge. The statutory notice and comment procedures are \n     precatory, however, because the Department of Justice has \n     advised the Administration that it has concluded that a \n     mandatory consultation requirement would raise constitutional \n     concerns with respect to the President's authority to conduct \n     negotiations with other nations. I have forwarded your letter \n     to the Department of Justice to respond to you more \n     specifically on this point.\n       I do, however, agree with the concern behind your letter \n     that ``public participation and notice and comment is \n     particularly important to inform the agency in its evaluation \n     of potential new pollutants brought before the review \n     committee.'' The constitutional concerns that are presented \n     by a mandatory requirement could be avoided by fully \n     authorizing the Executive Branch to gather information from \n     the public, but not requiring the Executive Branch to \n     exercise that authority. In order to ensure that the public \n     is well informed about events that are taking place \n     internationally, and to provide an opportunity for the \n     consideration of public comment in the event that the \n     Administration does not execute the discretionary notice and \n     comment procedures, my staff has included a new section in \n     the legislation that I transmitted to you on February 25.\n       In this section, there is a mandatory requirement that the \n     Administration publish a semiannual federal register notice \n     that provides a full description of the events occurring at \n     the international level and any domestic regulatory actions \n     that have been initiated. Because this requirement is based \n     on the calendar, relates to information that is publicly \n     available, and is not linked to decisions in the \n     international process, it does not raise the same \n     constitutional concerns. This new provision also obligates \n     the Environmental Protection Agency to consider comments \n     received as a result of these semiannual federal register \n     notices. I will be interested in your reaction to this \n     proposal, which I believe addresses our respective concerns.\n       I appreciate the reiteration of your commitment to passing \n     this legislation and to completing the necessary steps for \n     the United States to deposit its instrument of consent to \n     join these three very important multilateral environmental \n     treaties. I look forward to working with you. If you have any \n     further questions or concerns, please contact me or your \n     staff may contact Peter Pagano in EPA's Office of \n     Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations, at (202) 564-\n     3678.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael O. Leavitt.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 25, 2004.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n         Forestry, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: The EPA has forwarded to the \n     Department of Justice your letter dated February 12, 2004, \n     regarding legislation proposed by the Administration to \n     implement the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic \n     Pollutants, the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed \n     Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and \n     Pesticides in International Trade, and the Protocol on \n     Persistent Organic Pollutants to the 1979 Convention on Long-\n     Range Transboundary Air Pollution.\n       Specifically, you are interested in the discretionary \n     notice and comment procedures contained within the \n     Administration's proposed legislation to implement the FIFRA-\n     related obligations of the three environmental treaties \n     referenced above. At the request of the Department of \n     Justice, the Administration's proposal does not make these \n     consultations mandatory, and you requested additional \n     information about the constitutional concerns underlying that \n     decision.\n       The Stockholm Convention creates an international \n     ``Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee'' to \n     evaluate whether various substances should be added to, or \n     removed from, the Convention's coverage. Also, as you note in \n     your letter, the notice and comment procedures under the \n     proposed bill would ``allow public input at each of the three \n     stages of the review committee process.'' The statutory \n     notice and comment procedures are precatory, however, because \n     a mandatory consultation requirement would raise \n     constitutional concerns.\n       The Executive branch has sole authority over the United \n     States' negotiations with other nations. See, e.g., Letter to \n     Edmond Charles Genet, from Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of \n     State (1793), reprinted in 9 The Writings of Thomas Jefferson \n     256 (Andrew A. Lipscomb ed., 1903) (``[T]he President of the \n     United States. . . being the only channel of communication \n     between this country and foreign nations, it is from him \n     alone that foreign nations or their agents are to learn what \n     is or has been the will of the nation.''). The Supreme Court \n     has long concurred in this understanding of the President's \n     power, noting that this exclusive authority extends \n     throughout the entire ``field of negotiation.'' See United \n     States v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., 299 U.S. 304,319 (1936) (``In \n     this vast external realm, with its important, complicated, \n     delicate, and manifold problems, the President\n\n[[Page S13171]]\n\n     alone has the power to speak or listen as a representative of \n     the nation. He makes treaties with the advice and consent of \n     the Senate; but he alone negotiates. Into the field of \n     negotiation the Senate cannot intrude; and Congress itself is \n     powerless to invade it.''). See also New York Times Co. v. \n     United States, 403 U.S. 713, 728 (1971) (Stewart, J., \n     concurring) (``In the governmental structure created by our \n     Constitution, the Executive is endowed with enormous power in \n     the two related areas of national defense and international \n     relations.''); United States v. Louisiana, 363 U.S. 1, 35 \n     (1960) (the President is ``the constitutional representative \n     of the United States in its dealings with foreign nations''); \n     Earth Island Inst. v. Christopher, 6 F.3d 648, 652-54 (9th \n     Cir. 1993); Sanchez-Espinoza v. Reagan, 770 F.2d 202, 210 \n     (D.C. Cir. 1985) (Scalia, J.) (``[B]road leeway'' is \n     ``traditionally accorded the Executive in matters of foreign \n     affairs.'').\n       Within this constitutional framework, statutes cannot \n     direct the President to vote a certain way in an \n     international forum, and they cannot require that the \n     President consult with specific private organizations as he \n     prepares to cast such a vote. Congress can certainly assist \n     the President in his intentional negotiations by providing \n     him with the authority to gather information from private \n     citizens, cf. New York Times Co., 403 U.S. at 729-30, but it \n     remains for the President to decide how much, if any, \n     additional information is needed and what should be done with \n     it. If a proposed treaty is ill-informed, then the \n     Constitution provides the remedy: the Senate may refuse to \n     concur in that document. Joseph Story, 3 Commentaries on the \n     Constitution of the United States Sec. 1507 (1833) (``The \n     President is the immediate author and finisher of all \n     treaties; and all the advantages, which can be derived from \n     talents, information, integrity, and deliberate investigation \n     on the one hand, and from secrecy and despatch on the other, \n     are thus combined in the system. But no treaty, so formed, \n     becomes binding upon the country, unless it receives the \n     deliberate assent of two thirds of the Senate.''). What \n     Congress may not do is direct, through legislation, how the \n     President exercises his exclusive power to negotiate.\n       The Administration's concerns over legislation that would \n     mandate consultation with Congress or with private parties in \n     connection with the conduct of international negotiations are \n     not new. Similar concerns were raised by the Department of \n     Justice under President Clinton, President George H. W. Bush, \n     and President Reagan. In each case, the Department objected \n     to legislative proposals that would have required that the \n     Executive branch consult in the context of international \n     negotiations. For example, during the Clinton administration, \n     the Department of Justice objected to legislative proposals \n     that would have directed the Executive branch to consult with \n     interested parties prior to negotiating trade agreements or \n     prior to taking a position before the World Trade \n     Organization. In 1991, the Department advised that the United \n     States Trade Representative could not be required to \n     periodically consult with interested parties on the progress \n     of international trade negotiations. During the Reagan \n     Administration, the Department wrote to Senator Lowell \n     Weicker explaining that a proposed consultation requirement \n     was objectionable because any provision that would require \n     that the Executive branch disclose information that might \n     interfere with the success of international negotiations \n     would be subject to a valid claim of executive privilege. \n     Presidents of both parties have also noted concerns about \n     appropriations legislation containing similar provisions, \n     and have stated that they would interpret such provisions \n     not to intrude into this exclusive constitutional power \n     over international negotiations.

Pres. \n     Doc. 2809-10 (Nov. 13, 2000) (Statement of President \n     Clinton) (``Certain provisions of the Act could interfere \n     with my sole constitutional authority in the area of \n     foreign affairs by directing or burdening my negotiations \n     with foreign governments and international organizations . \n     . . I will not interpret these provisions to limit my \n     ability to negotiate and enter into agreements with \n     foreign nations.''); Statement on Signing the Foreign \n     Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs \n     Appropriations, 2002, 38 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 49-50 \n     (Jan. 10, 2002) (Statement of President Bush) (objecting \n     to . provision ``which purports to direct the Secretary of \n     State to consult certain international organizations in \n     determining the state of events abroad'' and noting this \n     and other provisions ``shall be construed consistent with \n     my constitutional authorities to conduct foreign affairs, \n     participate in international negotiations, and supervise \n     the Executive Branch'').\n       In the pending legislation, the Department concluded that a \n     mandatory requirement for ``public participation and \n     comment'' would raise similar constitutional concerns and \n     therefore recommended that more precatory language be used.\n       That said, the Department does not take issue with the \n     general belief that ``public participation and notice and \n     comment is particularly important to inform the \n     [Administration] in its evaluation of potential new \n     pollutants brought before the review committee.'' The \n     constitutional concerns that are presented by a mandatory \n     consultation requirement can be avoided by fully authorizing \n     the Executive Branch to gather information from the public, \n     but not requiring the Executive Branch to exercise that \n     authority. To ensure that the public is well informed about \n     events that are taking place internationally, and to provide \n     an opportunity for the consideration of public comment in the \n     event that the President chooses not to execute the \n     discretionary notice and comment procedures, the bill \n     requires that the Administration publish a semi-annual \n     Federal Register notice that provides a full description of \n     the events occurring at the international level and any \n     domestic regulatory actions that have been initiated. Because \n     this requirement based on the calendar, relates to \n     information that is publicly available, and is not linked to \n     decisions in the international process, this does not raise \n     the same constitutional concerns.\n       We trust this provides an answer to your inquiry. We would \n     welcome the opportunity to assist you with any future \n     inquiries you may have. The Office of Management and Budget \n     has advised that there is no objection to the submission of \n     this letter from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                William Moschella,\n     Assistant Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 30, 2004.\n     Re: Validity of Provisions Mandating Notice and Comment \n         Proceedings in Response to the Decisions of Parties \n         Operating Pursuant to International Conventions and \n         Protocols.\n\n       Hon. Tom Harkin: Pursuant to your request, this memorandum \n     analyzes certain provisions of a draft bill forwarded by the \n     Administration that would amend the Federal Insecticide, \n     Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) to allow for the \n     implementation of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent \n     Organic Pollutants (POPs Convention), the Rotterdam \n     Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for \n     Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International \n     Trade (PIC Convention) and the Protocol on Persistent Organic \n     Pollutants to the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air \n     Pollution (LRTAP POPs Protocol). In pertinent part, the draft \n     bill would imbue the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency (hereinafter referred to as \n     ``Administrator'') with discretionary authority to publish \n     notices in the Federal Register and to provide an opportunity \n     for comment in response to certain actions taken by parties \n     to the POPs Convention and the LRTAP POPs Protocol.\n       The Administration has asserted that the notice and comment \n     provisions in its proposal are necessarily ``precatory'' in \n     nature, ``because a mandatory consultation requirement would \n     raise constitutional concerns.'' You have asked whether it \n     would be constitutionally problematic to make the notice and \n     comment provisions in the draft proposal mandatory, despite \n     the concerns raised by the Administration. A review of \n     relevant constitutional principles appears to indicate that \n     such a requirement would pass constitutional muster.\n\n\n                            POPs Convention\n\n       The POPs Convention was signed by the United States on May \n     31, 2001, and requires nations to reduce or eliminate the \n     production and use of listed chemicals. The POPs Convention \n     allows new chemicals to be added to the list by amendment to \n     the relevant treaty annexes, and an amendment may be proposed \n     by any party to the Convention. Amendments may be adopted at \n     a meeting of the Conference of the Parties after the \n     circulation of such a proposal to all parties at least six \n     months in advance of the meeting. The POPs convention also \n     creates a Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee \n     (POPs Review Committee) that is to consist of government-\n     designated experts in chemical assessment or management. The \n     POPs Review Committee is charged generally with determining \n     whether a listing proposal submitted by a party meets \n     screening criteria established in the Convention, determining \n     whether global action is warranted regarding the proposal, \n     and recommending whether a proposed chemical should be \n     considered for listing by the Conference of the Parties.\n\n\n                          LRTAP POPs Protocol\n\n       The 1998 Aarhus Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants \n     (hereinafter referred to as ``LRTAP POPs Protocol'') amended \n     the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution with \n     the objective of eliminating discharges, emissions and losses \n     of listed persistent organic pollutants during their \n     production, use and disposal. Any party may offer an \n     amendment to add a new chemical to the LRTAP POPs Protocol, \n     which may be adopted by consensus of the parties represented \n     at a session of the Executive Body\n\n[[Page S13172]]\n\n     of the Convention. Prior to the addition of a chemical, the \n     LRTAP POPs Protocol requires the completion of a risk profile \n     on the chemical establishing that it meets selection criteria \n     specified under the protocol.\n\n\n                           The Draft Proposal\n\n       The Administration's draft proposal, as supplied by your \n     office, provides for the implementation of the PIC and POPs \n     Conventions and the LRTAP POPs Protocol. To effectuate this \n     implementation, the proposal imbues the Administrator with \n     the discretionary authority to publish notices in the Federal \n     Register in response to actions taken to add chemicals to the \n     list of those covered under the POPs Convention and the LRTAP \n     POPs Protocol specifically.\n       As noted above, the POPs Convention establishes a POPs \n     Review Committee that is responsible for considering \n     proposals to add chemicals to those listed in the POPs \n     Convention and recommending to the Conference of the Parties \n     whether a proposed chemical should be considered for listing \n     by the Conference. In the event that the POPs Review \n     Committee does not forward a proposal, the Conference may \n     choose to consider the proposal on its own accord. Section \n     3(4) of the draft bill contains several provisions \n     authorizing the Administrator of the EPA to publish \n     notices in the Federal Register at certain stages of the \n     listing process and to provide an opportunity for comment \n     on a proposed listing. In particular, Section 3(4), \n     establishing a new 7 U.S.C. 136o(e)(3), authorizes the \n     publication of a notice and opportunity for comment after \n     a decision by the POPs Review Committee that a listing \n     proposal meets the screening criteria specified in the \n     POPs Convention or, alternatively, if the Conference of \n     the Parties decides that such a proposal should proceed.\n       Likewise, a new 7 U.S.C. 136o(e)(4) would authorize the \n     publication of notice and opportunity for comment upon a \n     determination by the POPs Review Committee that a proposed \n     listing warrants global action, or, alternatively, if the \n     Conference of the Parties decides that the proposal should \n     proceed. Finally, a new 7 U.S.C. 136o(e)(5) would authorize \n     the publication of notice and opportunity for comment after \n     the POPs Review Committee recommends that the Conference of \n     the Parties consider making a listing decision regarding the \n     chemical at issue.\n       Publication of notice and opportunity for comment would \n     also be authorized after a party to the LRTAP POPs Protocol \n     submits a risk profile in support of a proposal to add a \n     chemical to those already listed. Additional notice and \n     comment proceedings would be authorized in instances where \n     the Executive Body determines that further consideration of a \n     pesticide is warranted, as well as after the completion of a \n     technical review of a proposal to add a chemical to the LRTAP \n     POPs Protocol. It is interesting to note that while the draft \n     proposal makes the decision as to whether to engage at all in \n     notice and comment procedures discretionary, the \n     Administrator is required to provide detailed elements of \n     notice in the event that such procedures are offered.\n\n\n                                analysis\n\n       You have specifically inquired as to whether it would \n     violate the doctrine of separation of powers to make the \n     aforementioned discretionary notice and comment procedures \n     mandatory, irrespective of the general concern voiced by the \n     Administration that ``a mandatory consultation requirement \n     would raise constitutional concerns.'' An examination of \n     applicable principles and precedent appears to indicate that \n     a mandatory notice and comment requirement would be \n     constitutionally permissible.\n       Stated succinctly, the separation of powers doctrine \n     ``implicit in the Constitution and well established in case \n     law, forbids Congress from infringing upon the Executive \n     Branch's ability to perform its traditional functions.'' The \n     Supreme Court has established that in determining whether an \n     act of Congress has violated the doctrine, ``the proper \n     inquiry focuses on the extent to which it prevents the \n     Executive Branch from accomplishing its constitutionally \n     assigned functions.'' Furthermore, as was noted by the Court \n     of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Confederated Tribes of \n     Siletz Indians v. United States:\n       Although the Supreme Court has not announced a formal list \n     of elements to be considered when determining whether a \n     violation of the doctrine has taken place, it has \n     consistently looked to at least two factors: (1) the \n     governmental branch to which the function in question is \n     traditionally assigned, see Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 364, 109 \n     S.Ct. at 65-51; Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 694-96, 108 \n     S.Ct. 2597, 2620-22, 101 L.Ed. 2d 659 (1988); and (2) the \n     control of the function retained by the branch, see \n     Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 408-12, 109 S.Ct. at 673-75; Morrison, \n     487 U.S. at 692-96, 108 S.Ct. at 2619-22.\n       Applying these factors to the case at hand, it appears \n     unlikely that a reviewing court would hold that mandatory \n     notice and comment provisions would violate the doctrine. As \n     is indicated by the DOJ letter, it seems that any argument \n     that a mandatory requirement would offend the separation of \n     powers doctrine would hinge on the assertion that such a \n     requirement necessarily constitutes an intrusion into the \n     core power of the Executive Branch over external affairs. \n     Specifically, in United States v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., the \n     Supreme Court declared:\n       [n]ot only . . . is the federal power over external affairs \n     in origin and essential character different from that over \n     internal affairs, but participation in the exercise of the \n     power is significantly limited. In this vast external realm, \n     with its important, complicated, delicate and manifold \n     problems, the President alone has the power to speak or \n     listen as a representative of the nation. He makes treaties \n     with the advice and consent of the Senate; but he alone \n     negotiates. Into the field of negotiation the Senate cannot \n     intrude; and Congress itself is powerless to invade it. As \n     Marshall said in his great argument of March 7, 1800, in the \n     House of Representatives, `the President is the sole organ of \n     the nation in its external relations, and its sole \n     representative with foreign nations.'\n       However, it is difficult to see how a mandatory notice and \n     comment requirement would implicate this traditional \n     executive function. Specifically, while it is generally \n     conceded that there are some powers enjoyed by the President \n     alone regarding foreign affairs, it is likewise evident that \n     Congress possesses wide authority to promulgate policies \n     respecting foreign affairs. Congress has often exercised \n     this authority to determine policy objectives for the \n     United States in international negotiations and to require \n     subsequent legislative approval of international \n     agreements before they may enter into force for the United \n     States.\n       A mandatory notice and comment requirement would not appear \n     to be an attempt to control the substance of negotiations \n     between the United States and other parties to POPs \n     Convention or the LRTAP POPs Protocol. Instead, such a \n     requirement would simply establish that the Administrator \n     must publish notices in the Federal Register providing \n     information regarding chemicals that are being considered for \n     listing to either the Convention or the Protocol. A somewhat \n     analogous requirement in the international arena may be found \n     at 19 U.S.C. 3537, which requires the United States Trade \n     Representative to consult with the appropriate congressional \n     committees and to publish detailed notices in the Federal \n     Register whenever it is a party to any dispute settlement \n     proceedings under the WTO. Furthermore, it should be noted \n     that this notification provision could be likened to \n     reporting requirements that are often imposed by Congress. As \n     a general proposition, Congress is entitled to full access to \n     information that is in the possession of the Executive \n     Branch, subject to claims of executive privilege.\n       In addition to the general assertion that a mandatory \n     notice and comment requirement would intrude on the \n     President's power over the ``field of negotiation'' in \n     foreign affairs, the DOJ letter states that any potential \n     requirement that the Administrator consult with private \n     parties or give consideration to comments received therefrom \n     would also be constitutionally problematic. However, it is \n     likewise difficult to ascertain how such a provision would \n     necessarily impair the ability of the executive branch to \n     carry out its core functions in this context. There is no \n     indication that such a provision would be drafted so as to \n     require the disclosure of sensitive information, or to \n     require the inclusion of such individuals in the actual \n     negotiation process. Rather, the notice and comment \n     procedures at issue would appear to be tailored to ensure \n     that the public is kept informed regarding ongoing \n     proceedings in this context, and is further afforded the \n     opportunity to comment on proposals under consideration. \n     Accordingly, it appears that such a dynamic would not raise \n     concerns any more significant than existing consultation \n     requirements. Based on these factors, it does not appear that \n     a mandatory notice and comment requirement would present any \n     substantive separation of powers concerns.\n\n                                                T.J.

Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that would \ncreate a National Methamphetamine Information Clearinghouse (NMIC). \nThis web-based source of information would promote sharing of ``best \npractices'' regarding law enforcement, treatment, environmental, social \nservices, and other programs to combat the production, use, and effects \nof methamphetamine.\n  The purpose of the NMIC is to make a one-stop shop, where all the \n``best practices'' in the fight against meth can be found--information \nfrom law enforcement, treatment-based organizations, social services \nand environmental agencies. It will be a website providing information \nthat agencies and organizations submit, describing what has worked in \ntheir local communities. The people who have had success with \naddressing meth and meth-related issues will be providing this \ninformation. Additionally, there will be information and links \nregarding available grants for establishing and maintaining anti-meth \nprograms.\n  The NMIC will serve two distinct populations--law enforcement and the \nbroader community. The NMIC will contain a restricted access section \nwhere law enforcement will be able to post their successful strategies, \ntraining techniques, and conference notes so that other law enforcement \nwill be able to get ideas and incorporate them in their own \njurisdictions. The unrestricted portion of the website will include \nresources for other agencies and the public at large. For example, \nchild protection agencies might post techniques on dealing with meth \norphans, community health centers might post treatment options that \nprovided them with some success, and environmental groups might post \ntips on cleaning up the toxic waste.\n  So, a landlord or hotel owner whose property was used as a meth lab \nand who wants to be able to rent out the property again, or the mother \nwho wants to figure out if her child is a meth addict--and what to do \nif she is they would all be able to find useful information on the \nsite.\n  One of our challenges in the fight against meth is finding those who \nneed assistance and connecting them with those who can help--and that \nis exactly what this clearinghouse can do. Many people and \norganizations that have had some success in controlling meth are more \nthan willing to share the techniques they found that work, if only they \nknew who needed the information. And, there are those who are just \nstarting to attack the meth problem in their communities and need \nguidance as to how to make that start an effective one. The NMIC can \nhelp bring those groups of people together and enhance everyone's \nability to fight the plague of meth.\n  NMIC will be housed under the auspices of the Department of Justice \nand\n\n[[Page S13174]]\n\nwill be governed by an Advisory Council comprised of 10 members from a \nvariety of agencies and organizations. It is this Council who will \nmonitor the submissions to the Clearinghouse and make sure that the \ninformation found on the site is accurate, up-to-date, and useful.\n  The bill I am introducing today provides the basic outline of this \nidea, and over the next two months, I will be working closely with law \nenforcement and community groups to modify and improve the \nClearinghouse before we move forward with this legislation next year. I \nlook forward to that process and encourage all of my colleagues to join \nme in this effort to combat the meth problem.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2046\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to promote healthy communities; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Healthy \nCommunities Act of 2005, and I am pleased to have the support of my \ngood friend and colleague Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n  Over the last few decades, our medical researchers and scientists \nhave developed increasingly sophisticated and high tech methods to \ndiagnose and treat disease. Yet, this approach has caused us to lose \nsight of the need for preventing diseases on the front-end, with \ngreater investment in basic public health interventions that too often \nget short shrift.\n  Today, I would like to bring it back to the basics and talk about \nenvironmental quality. The air we breathe, the food we eat, the houses \nin which we live, and the parks in which our children play--all of \nthese factors contribute to our health. Environmental health, as \ndefined by the World Health Organization, includes both the direct, \ndamaging effects of chemicals, radiation, and some biological agents, \nand the effects on health and well-being of the broad physical, \npsychological, social, and aesthetic environment. The legislation that \nI have introduced draws attention to that aspect of the environment \nthat is the physical environment--the toxicants and pollutants that we \nmay not notice, but are present in our everyday surroundings and taking \na toll on our health.\n  My home State of Illinois faces a number of environmental challenges, \nincluding high levels of lead poisoning. It is estimated that over \n400,000 children in this country suffer from elevated blood lead \nlevels. Chicago has the unfortunate distinction of ranking number 1 for \nchildren with elevated blood lead levels. 6,691 children have elevated \nblood lead levels, which is 50 percent higher than the number of \nchildren in the second ranked city of Philadelphia. Elevated blood \nlevels are known to cause behavioral and learning problems, slowed \ngrowth, impaired hearing and damage to the kidneys, brain and bone \nmarrow. Adults are not exempt from lead toxicity--poisoned adults \nsuffer pregnancy difficulties, high blood pressure, digestive problems, \nnerve disorders, memory and concentration problems, and muscle and \njoint pain. Lead poisoning is completely preventable, and although our \nagencies have made good progress, we can and must do more to address \nthis issue.\n  Obviously lead is only one of many toxicants and pollutants with \nwhich we must contend. Different areas of the U.S. face unique \nchallenges--States like California are grappling with the repercussions \nof air pollution, while Massachusetts and others in the Northeast are \nchallenged with high levels of mercury in the water. As much as we know \nabout these hazards, the effects of many chemicals are unknown.\n  Less than half of the chemicals produced in this country in \nquantities greater than 10,000 pounds have been tested for their \npotential human toxicity, with less than 10 percent studied to assess \neffects on development. This lack of knowledge has serious health \nrepercussions--in children, environmental toxins are estimated to cause\n\n[[Page S13175]]\n\nup to 35 percent of asthma cases, up to 10 percent of cancer cases, and \nup to 20 percent of neurobehavioral disorders. Overall, an estimated 25 \npercent of preventable illnesses worldwide can be attributed to poor \nenvironmental quality. Diseases such as cancer, heart disease, asthma, \nbirth defects, infertility, and obesity are all caused or exacerbated \nby toxicants or pollutants in the environment.\n  Minority Americans are significantly more likely to be affected than \nother Americans. Some studies have found that 3 of every 5 African- and \nLatino Americans live in communities with one or more toxic waste \nsites. Communities with existing incinerators, and those that are \nproposed for placement of new incinerators, have substantially higher \nnumbers of minority residents. Minority Americans are already plagued \nwith higher rates of death and disease, and fewer health resources in \ntheir neighborhoods. As we focus our efforts on environmental health, \nwe must be cognizant that some groups are disproportionately affected \nby federal policies and decision-making, and deserve careful attention.\n  The Healthy Communities Act of 2005 addresses environmental health \nconcerns in a comprehensive fashion, building upon many of the \nsuccessful federal initiatives and filling in gaps in other critical \nareas. The bill establishes an independent advisory committee to \nprovide recommendations across all relevant Federal agencies. It asks \nthe CDC and the EPA to assess and report the environmental public \nhealth of the nation, and each State. The Health Action Zone Program \nwill provide intense Federal attention and resources to clean up and \naddress the health needs of the nation's most blighted communities. \nEnvironmental research is expanded, including biomonitoring and health \ntracking initiatives. Finally, the Act promotes environmental health \nworkforce programs at the CDC and the NIH.\n  The Healthy Communities Act of 2005 will increase national attention \non the importance of the environment, and its relationship to good \nhealth. As we work to make our future stronger for our communities, let \nus look to our past. In the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of \n1969, Congress wrote that it is the continuing responsibility of the \nFederal Government to assure that all Americans live in ``safe, \nhealthful and aesthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings.'' \nAlmost forty years later, our responsibility to the American people \ncontinues. I encourage all of my colleagues to join me and support \npassage of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA:\n  S. 2048. A bill to direct the Consumer Product Safety Commission to \nclassify certain children's products containing lead to be banned \nhazardous substances; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Lead Free \nToys Act of 2005, which directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nto intensify efforts to reduce lead exposure for children.\n  The unfortunate reality for many children--particularly in low-income \nand minority households--is the continued presence of high blood lead \nlevels. Over 400,000 children in this country have elevated blood lead \nlevels, with my own hometown of Chicago having the largest \nconcentration of these children.\n  Lead is a highly toxic substance that can produce a range of health \nproblems in young children, including IQ deficiencies, reading and \nlearning disabilities, impaired hearing, reduced attention spans, \nhyperactivity, and damage to the kidneys, brain and bone marrow. Even \nlow levels of blood lead in pregnant women, infants and children can \nlead to impaired cognitive abilities, fetal organ development and \nbehavioral problems.\n  We know that lead poisoning is completely preventable. As the Nation \nhas increased efforts to reduce environmental lead exposure, the number \nof children with high blood levels has steadily dropped. Restricting \nlead in gasoline and paint represent two major accomplishments in this \nregard. But much work remains to be done.\n  Earlier today I introduced the Healthy Communities Act of 2005, to \nstrengthen Federal, State and local efforts to address environmental \nhealth issues in communities already affected by lead and other toxins. \nHowever, we need to take greater proactive steps to prevent \ncontamination, and the Lead Free Toys Act of 2005 will help us do just \nthat.\n  Disturbingly, lead is present in a number of toys and other \nfrequently used objects by young children. According to research \nconducted by the National Center for Environmental Health, about half \nof tested lunch boxes have unsafe levels of lead. The highly popular \nAngela Anaconda lunch box was found to have 56,400 parts per million of \nlead, which is more than 90 times the 600 parts per million legal limit \nfor lead in paint for children's products. Other lunch boxes showed \nlevels of lead between two and twenty-five times the legal limit for \nlead paint in children's products. In most cases, the highest lead \nlevels were found in the lining of lunch boxes, where lead could come \ninto direct contact with food.\n  This problem is not limited to lunchboxes. One study found that 60 \npercent of more than 400 pieces of costume jewelry purchased at major \ndepartment stories contain dangerous amounts of lead. From September \n2003 through July 2004, there were 3 recalls of nearly 150 million \npieces of toy jewelry because of toxic levels of lead.\n  This past August the Centers for Disease Control updated their \n``Preventing Lead Poisoning in Young Children'' statement calling for \nthe elimination of all nonessential uses of lead in children's \nproducts. Specifically, the CDC urged a more systematic approach to \nidentifying lead-contaminated items and prohibiting their sale before \nchildren are exposed, rather than usual recall efforts after exposure \nhas occurred.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission leads our national efforts to \nsafeguard our children from potentially dangerous objects. However, the \nCommission has dragged its feet in aggressively addressing the problem \nof lead in toys. The Lead Free Toys Act, introduced by my colleague \nCongressman Henry Waxman earlier this year, requires the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission to prescribe regulations classifying any \nchildren's product containing lead as a banned hazardous substance \nunder the Hazardous Substances Act. It defines ``children's product \ncontaining lead'' as any consumer product marketed or used by children \nunder age 6 that contains more than trace amounts of lead as determined \nby the Commission and prescribed by regulations. The Act also requires \nthe Commission to issue standards for reduction in lead in electronic \ndevices.\n  It's a national disgrace that toys that could pose a serious and \nsignificant danger to children are readily available in our department \nstores and markets. The Lead Free Toys Act of 2005 will help us keep \nour children safe and healthy, and contribute to national efforts to \nreduce lead exposure. I ask each of my colleagues to help support this \nAct.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Talent):\n  S. 2049. A bill to improve the security of the United States borders \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend from North \nDakota, Senator Dorgan, and my friend from Missouri, Senator Talent, to \nintroduce a bill of critical importance to the security of our borders: \nthe Border Modernization and Security Act of 2005.\n  Securing our borders is the first necessary step towards immigration \nreform, and I believe the legislation I am introducing makes an \nenormous leap in the right direction.\n  Our bill builds upon legislation we introduced in the last Congress \nto improve our port of entry infrastructure as well as a lot of good \nideas proposed by other Senators in this Congress, and adds some \nprovisions that I think are important to a comprehensive border \nsecurity and immigration reform effort.\n  The Border Modernization and Security Act increases the number of \nCustoms and Border Protection (CBP) officers and Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement (ICE) agents each by 1000 for each of fiscal years \n2007 through 2011. These personnel are necessary to improve our \nenforcement at ports of entry and within the United States, and \nincreasing the number of these employees goes hand in hand with our \nrecent efforts to increase the number of\n\n[[Page S13176]]\n\nborder patrol agents who are enforcing the law along our international \nborders. Along this same line, the bill allows the Department of \nHomeland Security (DHS) to support its border and immigration forces \nwith National Guard personnel and volunteer retired law enforcement \nofficers, provides for an increase in the number of DHS alien and \nimmigration investigative personnel, and increases the number of Deputy \nMarshals to investigate criminal immigration matters.\n  Increasing the number of DHS employees alone will not solve our \nborder problems. Unauthorized aliens also cause a significant burden on \nour courts. For example, for the 12-month period ending September 30, \n2004, 364 felony cases per judge were filed in the New Mexico District. \nIt is apparent how burdensome this number is for my border State's \ncourt when you consider that the national average of felony cases filed \nper judge is 88. To help with these high caseload levels, our bill \nincreases the number of DHS immigration attorneys, federal defenders, \nOffice of Immigration Litigation attorneys, assistant US Attorneys, and \nimmigration judges.\n  Increased personnel is only one aspect of our effort to secure the \nborder. Any border security effort must provide DHS personnel with \nnecessary technologies and assets. To that end, our bill authorizes \nfunds for the Department to acquire new technologies, construct roads, \nfences, and barriers, purchase air assets, vehicles, and other \nequipment, maintain temporary and permanent border checkpoints, and \nconstruct the appropriate facilities to support the increased number of \nDHS personnel being hired. Such assets are invaluable tools for our CBP \nand ICE employees, and we must make sure those men and women have what \nthey need. We also provide for up to 15,000 new detention beds for \nunauthorized aliens in our bill.\n  Another area Congress must address is our land port of entry \ninfrastructure. No American border has undergone a comprehensive \ninfrastructure overhaul since 1986, when Senator Dennis DeConcini of \nArizona and I put forth a $357 million effort to modernize the \nsouthwest border. A great deal has changed in the past nineteen years. \nMore importantly, much has changed since September 11, 2001. Congress \nhas passed legislation to improve security at airports and seaports, \nbut we have not yet addressed the needs of our busiest ports, located \non the United States' northern and southwestern land borders. The \nBorder Modernization and Security Act would change that and would \nprevent terrorists from exploiting weaknesses at our land ports.\n  My bill requires the General Service Administration (GSA) to identify \nport of entry infrastructure and technology improvement projects that \nwould enhance homeland security. The GSA would work with the Department \nof Homeland Security to prioritize and implement these projects based \non needs along the border. The Secretary of Homeland Security would \nalso have to prepare a Land Border Security Plan to assess the \nvulnerabilities at each port of entry located on the northern border or \nthe southern border. This plan will require the cooperation of Federal, \nState and local entities involved at our borders to ensure that \neveryone who plays a role in border security is consulted about the \nplan.\n  The Border Modernization and Security Act would also modernize \nhomeland security along the United States' borders by implementing \ntechnology demonstration programs to test and evaluate new port of \nentry and border security technologies. Because equipment and \ntechnology alone will not solve the security problems on our border, \nthese test sites will also house facilities to provide the necessary \ntraining to personnel who must implement and use these technologies \nunder realistic conditions.\n  We must also improve the enforcement of existing immigration laws. \nOur bill authorizes funds for the Department of Homeland Security to \nexpand its Expedited Removal Procedures so DHS can expeditiously return \nnon-Mexican illegal aliens who have spent less than 14 days in the US \nand who are apprehended within 100 miles of the international border to \nthe alien's country of origin. We also allow DHS to create an automated \nbiometric entry and exit data system at our land ports of entry so we \ncan more accurately keep track of who is entering and leaving the US.\n  In order for the Department to more easily identify and remove \nunauthorized aliens who commit crimes under State law and are held in \nState and local prisons, we authorize the expansion of DHS' \nInstitutional Removal Program. Because of the burden these aliens place \non our State and local prisons, DHS will be responsible for reimbursing \nprisons that detain an alien after the alien has completed his prison \nsentence in order to effectuate the alien's transfer to federal \ncustody.\n  Along the same line, the Border Modernization and Security Act \nprovides additional assistance to States that are impacted by \nunauthorized aliens who commit crimes. I know first hand the impact \nsuch aliens have on our State and local prisons from talking to \nprosecutors and judges in New Mexico, so our bill reauthorizes the \nState Criminal Alien Assistance Program to help our States with the \ncosts of incarcerating these aliens. Additionally, the bill allows for \nthe reimbursement of State and local costs of processing illegal aliens \nthrough the criminal justice system and creates a new grant program for \nState, local, and Indian tribe law enforcement agencies who incur costs \nrelated to border security activities.\n  I believe that these measures are an important part of addressing \nthis nation's homeland security needs, and I am pleased to introduce \nthis bill today with Senators Dorgan and Talent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2049\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Domenici in \nintroducing the Border Security and Modernization Act of 2005.\n  Senator Domenici and I represent border States, but the bill we are \nintroducing today is not one of merely regional importance. Border \nsecurity is an issue that affects our country as a whole. We cannot \nhave homeland security without strong and effective border security.\n  The Administration has signaled that it wants to have a vigorous \ndebate on border security and immigration issue early next year. Our \nbill does not attempt to change immigration law, but it squarely \naddresses the border security issue.\n  I began working on border security long before the attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001. The Northern border is over 4,000 miles long. In \nthe past, almost all of our resources in this country were targeted at \nthe Southern border. It used to be that we had ports of entry at the \nNorthern border where, at night, the only barrier was an orange rubber \ncone in the middle of the road. The polite people crossing at night \nactually stopped and removed the cone before they came across the \nborder. Those who were not so polite would run over it at 60 miles an \nhour.\n  In 2001, before the September 11 attacks, I proposed something called \nthe Northern Border Initiative. That bill added hundreds of Customs \nofficers to the Northern border, and it became law. I also worked to \nreplace the orange cones with hardened gates. But we clearly have to do \nmuch more.\n  The legislation we are introducing today, which Senator Domenici has \ndescribed in detail, would devote significant new resources to our \nborder security. Among other things, this legislation would authorize \nthe hiring of an additional 1,000 Customs and Border Protection \ninspectors and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers a year for \nthe next five years. It would authorize the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to work with States to use National Guard and a volunteer \nforce of retired law enforcement officers as resources to help monitor \nthe borders. And it would have the Federal Government reimburse State \ngovernments for the cost of detaining undocumented aliens while \ndecisions are made regarding possible deportation.\n  This bipartisan proposal is not about immigration. It's about border \nsecurity. We need to do a better job of securing our borders, and we \nneed to do so on an urgent basis. We hope our colleagues will join us, \non a bipartisan basis, in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 2050. A bill to establish a commission on inland waters policy; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  I rise today to introduce legislation that creates a national \ncommission on island waters policy to support the long-term \nsustainability of our water resources. A 2001 National Academy of \nSciences report found that U.S. Federal policies and research lack the \ncoordination necessary to respond to increasing future demands. The \noverarching goal of this legislation is to recommend actions that will \nbetter coordinate and improve the Federal Government's water management \npolicies, similar to the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, PL 106-256.\n  My legislation is supported by the American Society of Limnology and \nOceanography, ASLO, and the Council of Scientific Society Presidents, \nCSSP, representing 1.4 million scientists and science educators. I \nespecially want to thank Dr. Peter Jumars of the School of Marine \nSciences at University of Maine at Orono and Darling Marine Center and \nimmediate past president of ASLO, for all of his extensive knowledge \nand assistance that helped craft the legislation.\n  The bill creates a commission to study the Nation's policies for \ninland waters--a category that would include all lakes, streams, \nrivers, groundwaters, estuaries, and fresh- and salt water wetlands. \nThe stewardship of these resources is essential to human health, the \necosystem, the economy, agriculture, energy production, and the \ntransportation sector.\n  The National Academy of Sciences, NAS, issued a report in 2001 \ndescribing that water resources of the United States will be subjected \nto more intense and a broader array of pressures in the 21st century. \nIt found that U.S. Federal policies and research lack the coordination \nnecessary to respond to increasing future demands. An inland waters \npolicy commission should be viewed as an attempt to make sure our \nNation's clean water laws are achieving what Congress mandated. Water \npolicies have been very contentious in many parts of the Nation and \nhave oftentimes pitted people and their livelihoods against \npreservation concerns. Only by developing greater water research and \ncoordinating a comprehensive national policy will the conflict between \nanthropogenic needs and water preservation be overcome.\n  Mr. Chairman, in April of this year, the GAO published a report with \nfindings that the administration is not addressing the study of water \nresources, agriculture, energy, biological diversity and other areas in \nrelation to climate change as mandated under the Global Change Research \nAct. None of those topics has been addressed in 21 studies that the \nBush administration plans to publish by September 2007, the GAO report \nfound, even though fairly robust climate models are now making \npredictions about changes in rainfall globally and nationally as the \nclimate changes. Water policy currently has no intelligent mechanism \nfor using this information. The GAO report points out that a \ncomprehensive study of the Nation's water resources is needed.\n  The bill authorizes an appropriation of $8.5 million until expended. \nBy comparison, the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy appropriation was \nset at a total of up to $6 million for fiscal years 2001 and 2002.\n  I hope my colleagues will take a close look at this legislation and \nsee the great value in supporting the long-term sustainability of our \nNation's water resources.\n  I thank the Chair.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 2051. A bill to extend eligibility for certain Federal benefits to \ncitizens of the Freely Associated States; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nmy senior colleague from Hawaii, Senator Dan Inouye, to provide certain \nFederal\n\n[[Page S13182]]\n\npublic benefits for citizens of the Freely Associated State, FAS, who \nare residing in the United States. The bill would provide eligibility \nfor nonemergency Medicaid, Food Stamps, Temporary Assistance to Needy \nFamilies, TANF, and Supplemental Security Income, SSI, to FAS citizens \nresiding in the United States.\n  Citizens from the FAS are from the Republic of the Marshall Islands, \nRMI, Federated States of Micronesia, FSM, and the Republic of Palau, \nwhich are jurisdictions that have a unique political relationship with \nthe United States. The Compact of Free Association established these \nnations as sovereign states responsible for their own foreign policies. \nHowever, the FAS remain dependent upon the United States for military \nprotection and economic assistance.\n  Under the compact, the United States has the right to reject the \nstrategic use of, or military access to, the FAS by other countries, \nwhich is often referred to as the ``right of strategic denial.'' In \naddition, the U.S. may block FAS government policies that it deems \ninconsistent with its duty to defend the FAS, which is referred to as \nthe ``defense veto.'' The compact also states that the United States \nhas exclusive military base rights in the FAS.\n  In exchange for these prerogatives, the United States is required to \nsupport the FAS economically, with the goal of producing self-\nsufficiency, and FAS citizens are allowed free entry into the United \nStates as nonimmigrants for the purposes of education, medical \ntreatment, and employment. Many FAS citizens reside in the State of \nHawaii. Since 1997, when Hawaii began reporting its impact costs, the \nState has identified more than $140 million in costs associated with \nFAS citizens. In 2002, the State of Hawaii expended more than $32 \nmillion in assistance to FAS citizens. P.L. 108-188, the Compact of \nFree Association Amendments Act of 2003, provides $30 million in annual \nfunding for compact impact assistance to be shared between the State of \nHawaii, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, CNMI, \nand American Samoa. While this funding is a positive step forward, it \ndoes not begin to reimburse the affected jurisdictions for the costs \nassociated with FAS citizens.\n  This legislation would provide assistance to states and territories \nthat shoulder the majority of the costs associated with the compact. \nThe Federal Government must provide appropriate resources to help \nStates meet the needs of the FAS citizens--an obligation based on a \nFederal commitment. It is unconscionable for a State or territory to \nshoulder the entire financial burden of providing necessary \neducational, medical, and social services to individuals who are \nresiding in that State or territory when the obligation is that of the \nFederal Government. For that reason, we are seeking to provide \nreimbursement of these costs. It is time for the Federal Government to \ntake up some of the financial responsibility that until now has been \ncarried by the State of Hawaii, CNMI, Guam, and American Samoa by \nrestoring public benefits to FAS citizens.\n  This bill would restore eligibility of FAS citizens for nonemergency \nMedicaid. FAS citizens lost many of their public benefits as a result \nof the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity, PRWORA, Act of \n1996, including Medicaid coverage. FAS citizens were previously \neligible for Medicaid as aliens permanently residing under color of law \nin the United States.\n\n  After the enactment of welfare reform, the State of Hawaii could no \nlonger claim Federal matching funds for services rendered to FAS \ncitizens. Yet the State of Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, and the CNMI \nhave continued to meet the health care needs of FAS citizens. The State \nof Hawaii has used its resources to provide Medicaid services to FAS \ncitizens.\n  In 2003 alone, the State spent approximately $9.77 million to provide \nMedicaid services without receiving any federal matching funds. This \nrepresents a dramatic increase from $6.75 million in State fiscal year \n2002. Furthermore, the trend in the need for health care services among \nFAS citizens continues to rise. During fiscal year 2004, the number of \nindividuals served in the State of Hawaii's Medicaid program grew from \n3,291 to 4,818 people based on the average monthly enrollment. This is \nan increase of 46 percent.\n  This bill would also provide eligibility for FAS citizens residing in \nthe United States to participate in the Temporary Assistance for Needy \nFamilies and Supplemental Security Income programs. According to \nHawaii's attorney general, financial assistance in the form of the \nTemporary Assistance to Other Needy Families, TAONF, Program, a State \nprogram, provided $5.1 million to FAS citizens in State fiscal year \n2003. This continues an upward trend from $4.5 million in State fiscal \nyear 2002. This total includes funds that go to the General Assistance \nProgram, which supports individuals and couples with little or no \nincome and who have a temporary, incapacitating medical condition; the \naged, blind, and disabled program for FAS citizens with little or no \nincome who are not eligible for federally-funded Supplemental Security \nIncome; and the State's TAONF Program that assists other needy families \nwho are not eligible for federal-funding under the Temporary Assistance \nto Needy Families program. The financial assistance that the State of \nHawaii provides to FAS citizens in the form of TAONF is a great support \nto those families attempting to achieve economic stability, but it has \na significant financial impact on the State's budget.\n  The bill would also provide eligibility for the Food Stamp Program. \nMr. President, the Food Stamp Program serves as the first line of \ndefense against hunger. It is the cornerstone of the Federal food \nassistance program and provides crucial support to needy households and \nthose making the transition from welfare to work. We have partially \naddressed the complicated issue of alien eligibility for public \nbenefits such as food stamps, but again, I must say it is just partial. \nNot only should all legal immigrants receive these benefits, but so \nshould citizens of the FAS. Exclusion of FAS citizens from Federal, \nState, or local public benefits or programs is an unintended and \nmisguided consequence of the welfare reform law. We allow certain legal \nimmigrants eligibility in the program. Yet FAS citizens, who are not \nconsidered immigrants but who are required to up for the Selective \nService if they are residing in the United States are ineligible to \nreceiving food stamps. This bill corrects this inequity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record. I also ask unanimous consent that a letter of \nsupport I received last week from Director Lillian Koller of the State \nof Hawaii, Department of Human Services be printed in the Record.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this measure \nwhich is of critical importance to my State of Hawaii, which has borne \nthe costs of these benefits for FAS citizens living in Hawaii for the \npast 19 years.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2051\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka, I am writing in support of your \n     legislation to reinstate eligibility for Compact migrants \n     from the Freely Associated States for various Federal \n     programs, including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \n     (TANF), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Food Stamps, and \n     Medicaid. As you know, ``Compact migrants'' refers to those \n     who have relocated to Hawaii from the Republic of Palau, the \n     Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of the \n     Marshall Islands. As you know, a high percentage of the \n     Compact migrant population are poorly educated and live in \n     poverty, and are thus part of the additional demand on the \n     already strained social support systems of the State.\n       The Department of Human Services is the lead agency that \n     administers social safety net programs for individuals and \n     families in Hawaii. The amount of State resources that is \n     being expended to care for Compact migrants has been steadily \n     increasing as the number of migrants continues to grow. The \n     costs to the State cannot be measured in the numbers of \n     migrants alone. What is not reflected in the numbers of \n     migrants alone, is that many of these migrants come to Hawaii \n     with serious medical conditions that require costly intensive \n     and extensive services. In 2004, the Department of Human \n     Services alone spent over $26.6 million to provide services \n     to over 10,800 migrants in our financial assistance, medical \n     assistance, vocational rehabilitation, and youth services \n     programs.\n       Allowing Compact migrants to be served with Federal funds \n     under the TANF, SSI, Food Stamps, and Medicaid programs would \n     tremendously assist the State of Hawaii. I appreciate your \n     leadership in this area and look forward to continuing to \n     work with you on your legislative efforts to assist Compact \n     migrants in Hawaii.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Lillian B.

Res. 319\n\n       Whereas on October 8, 2005, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake \n     struck Pakistan, India, and Afghanistan;\n       Whereas the epicenter of the earthquake was located near \n     Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani-administered Kashmir, \n     and approximately 60 miles north-northeast of Islamabad, with \n     aftershocks and landslides continuing to affect the area;\n       Whereas the most affected areas are the North West Frontier \n     Province, Northern Punjab, Pakistani-administered Kashmir, \n     and Indian-administered Kashmir;\n       Whereas more than 75,000 people have died, nearly 70,000 \n     are injured, and approximately 2,900,000 people are homeless \n     as a result of the earthquake, and, according to the \n     Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund \n     (UNICEF), 17,000 of the dead are children;\n       Whereas the United States has pledged a total of \n     $156,000,000 to provide assistance in the affected countries, \n     with $50,000,000 to be used for humanitarian relief, \n     $50,000,000 to be used for reconstruction, and $56,000,000 to \n     be used to support Department of Defense relief operations;\n       Whereas the total amount of humanitarian assistance \n     committed to Pakistan by the United States Agency for \n     International Development is more than $40,000,000;\n       Whereas the Department of Defense has deployed \n     approximately 875 members of the Armed Forces and 31 \n     helicopters to aid in the earthquake relief efforts;\n       Whereas since October 8, 2005, United States helicopters \n     have flown more than 1,000 missions, evacuated approximately \n     3,400 people, and delivered nearly 5,600,000 pounds of \n     supplies;\n       Whereas the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the \n     affected areas is difficult due to the mountainous terrain, \n     cold weather, and damaged or collapsed infrastructure;\n       Whereas Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, during her \n     October 12, 2005, visit to Pakistan, said the United States \n     would support the efforts of the Government of Pakistan over \n     the long-term to provide assistance to the victims of the \n     earthquake and rebuild areas of the country devastated by the \n     earthquake;\n       Whereas the cost of rebuilding the affected areas could be \n     in excess of $1,000,000,000; and\n       Whereas the recovery and reconstruction of the areas \n     devastated by the earthquake will require the concerted \n     leadership of the United States working with the governments \n     of the affected countries and the international community: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the members of the United States Armed Forces \n     and civilian employees of the Department of State and the \n     United States Agency for International Development for taking \n     swift action to assist the victims of the earthquake in South \n     Asia that occurred on October 8, 2005;\n       (2) commends the international relief effort that includes \n     the work of individual countries, numerous international \n     organizations, and various relief and nongovernmental \n     entities;\n       (3) commends the Governments of Pakistan and India for \n     their cooperation in the common cause of saving lives and \n     providing humanitarian relief to people on both sides of the \n     Line of Control;\n       (4) encourages further cooperation between Pakistan and \n     India on relief operations and efforts to fortify and expand \n     peace and stability in the region as they cope with the \n     impact of the earthquake during the winter of 2005 and the \n     spring of 2006 and seek to rehabilitate the lives of those \n     affected;\n       (5) urges the United States and the world community to \n     reaffirm their commitment to\n\n[[Page S13184]]\n\n     additional generous support for relief and long-term \n     reconstruction efforts in areas affected by the earthquake; \n     and\n       (6) urges continued attention by international donors and \n     relief agencies to the needs of vulnerable populations in the \n     stricken countries, particularly the thousands of children \n     who have been left parentless and homeless by the disaster.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \ncommending relief efforts in response to the earthquake in South Asia \nand urging a commitment by the United States and the international \ncommunity to help rebuild critical infrastructure in the affected \nareas.\n  On October 8, 2005, a devastating magnitude 7.6 earthquake hit remote \nmountainous regions of northern Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. More \nthan 75,000 people have died, nearly 70,000 have been injured and 2.8 \nmillion remain homeless. On a bipartisan basis, the President and \nmembers of Congress joined the world community in expressing our \nsympathy and pledging our assistance to help those suffering in the \nface of this terrible disaster.\n  But expressions of sympathy are not enough. The United States must \nset an example and lead the world in the humanitarian effort of \nrecovery and rebuilding. That's why I supported the initial pledge of \n$156 million in humanitarian aid from the United States.\n  The Department of Defense, the State Department and the U.S. Agency \nfor International Development (USAID) have taken the lead in making \ngood on that pledge. USAID has provided more than $50.1 million in \nassistance to Pakistan and more than $600,000 to India. The Defense \nDepartment has so far spent about $56 million on relief efforts, \nincluding sending more than 1,000 troops into Pakistan to provide \nurgent medical care, delivering much-needed supplies and clearing roads \nand opening routes for ground transportation so more help can reach \nthose most in need.\n  The American private sector has also pitched in. U.S. charities have \nraised more than $21 million to support earthquake relief efforts. Non-\ngovernment organizations like Catholic Relief Services, Mercy Corps and \nSave the Children all have a presence in Pakistan and are providing aid \nand relief. At President Bush's request, five major American \ncorporations are encouraging additional private donations. General \nElectric, Pfizer, Citigroup, Xerox and UPS are coordinating a \nnationwide fund raising effort through the South Asia Earthquake Relief \nFund. To date, more than $46 million has been donated by American \ncorporations.\n  As Americans, we can all be proud of these efforts to help the people \nof South Asia survive, recover and rebuild. I applaud President Bush \nand his administration for acting quickly to provide relief and \nsupport. But I know that, together, we can do better.\n  That's why I support the immediate reprogramming by USAID of \nassistance funds for Pakistan in the FY 2006 Foreign Operations Act to \nhelp meet the immediate, emergency need for medical care and shelter. \nThe nearly 3 million Pakistanis left homeless by the earthquake are \nalready facing snow and freezing rain. Conservative estimates suggest \nanother 80,000 people could die from exposure in the next few months \nwithout a massive effort to provide thousands of heated tents. Those \npeople can not afford to wait for the next supplemental appropriations \nbill--we must act now.\n  The United States should also engage with the international community \nto boost relief and recovery efforts. The United Nations has already \nresponded, convening a donors' conference to organize international \nrelief efforts. Economic institutions like the World Bank and the Paris \nClub can assist long-term recovery efforts by re-examining their debt \npolicy toward the affected countries. And members of NATO and the \nEuropean Union must step-up their support for relief and recovery. NATO \nin particular has unique assets that can make a difference today for \npeople on the ground in South Asia.\n  I also believe the United States should make a long-term investment \nin rebuilding the areas devastated by the earthquake. We have strong \npartnerships with the nations of South Asia, and we have strong \naffection for their people. We must commit to work with our friends for \nas long as it takes to help them rebuild their infrastructure, with a \nparticular emphasis on boosting medical resources for a health care \nsystem now overwhelmed by caring for the weak and injured.\n  The people and governments of Pakistan, India and Afghanistan must \nknow that the United States will be an unwavering partner in their \nrecovery and reconstruction. Our U.S. military and the employees of the \nState Department and USAID are working hard to extend support to our \nfriends in this terrible time of need. We thank them for their service \nand pledge that we, too, will do our part.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/17/senate-section/article/S13184-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13184-S13185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 65--RECOGNIZING THE BENEFITS AND \n  IMPORTANCE OF FEDERALLY-QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS AND THEIR MEDICAID \n                       PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. BURR (for himself, Mr. Obama, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mr. Kerry, \nMr. Smith, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Collins, and Ms. \nSnowe) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 65\n\n       Whereas community, migrant, public housing, and homeless \n     health centers form the backbone of the health care safety \n     net of the United States, providing health care to nearly \n     6,000,000 of the 53,000,000 people enrolled in the Medicaid \n     Program nationwide;\n       Whereas health center patients are more likely than the \n     general population to be enrolled in Medicaid, with 36 \n     percent of all health center patients enrolled in Medicaid \n     compared to 12 percent nationally;\n       Whereas in 1989, Congress established the services of the \n     Federally-qualified health center (FQHC) program as a \n     guaranteed benefit under Medicaid to protect the valuable \n     resources intended to assist health centers in caring for the \n     uninsured;\n       Whereas health centers have doubled the number of uninsured \n     people served since 1989, a growth rate more than twice that \n     of the uninsured population of the United States;\n       Whereas health centers provided 17 percent of all Medicaid \n     and State Health Insurance Program office visits in 2001;\n       Whereas Medicaid on average contributes 36 percent of a \n     health center's budget, with the remainder provided by \n     Federal grants, State and local governments, Medicare, \n     private contributions, private insurance, and patient fees;\n       Whereas the cost of treating health center Medicaid \n     patients is 30 to 34 percent less than the cost of treating \n     those that receive care elsewhere, and similarly, 26 to 40 \n     percent lower for prescription drug costs, 35 percent lower \n     for diabetics, and 20 percent lower for asthmatics;\n       Whereas health center Medicaid patients are 22 percent less \n     likely to be hospitalized for conditions that were \n     potentially avoidable than those obtaining care elsewhere;\n       Whereas a bipartisan majority of Congress in 2000 \n     established a prospective payment system (PPS) to ensure that \n     Federally-qualified health centers receive sufficient \n     Medicaid funding, thereby striking a balance between \n     protecting the Federal investment in health centers and \n     providing State flexibility in designing the payment system \n     for these centers;\n       Whereas the prospective payment system has allowed States \n     to appropriately predict and budget the cost of health center \n     Medicaid expenditures;\n       Whereas the prospective payment system has allowed health \n     centers to provide and expand primary care services to more \n     people in need, while promoting efficient operation of and \n     ensuring adequate Medicaid reimbursement for these centers;\n       Whereas without the assurance of sufficient Medicaid \n     funding under the prospective payment system, health centers \n     would be forced to cross-subsidize Medicaid underpayments \n     with Federal grant dollars intended to care for the \n     uninsured;\n       Whereas if the PPS were eliminated or changed, entire \n     communities could be left without any access to primary and \n     preventive health care services, thus undoing decades of \n     investment by Congress in providing a health care safety net;\n       Whereas health centers provide cost-effective, high-quality \n     health care to the poor of the Nation and the medically \n     underserved, including the working poor, the uninsured, and \n     many high-risk and vulnerable populations; and\n       Whereas health centers act as a vital safety net in the \n     health delivery system of the Nation, meeting escalating \n     health needs, and reducing health disparities: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) it is the sense of Congress that the Medicaid \n     prospective payment system for the Federally-qualified health \n     center program is critical to ensuring that both Medicaid \n     recipients and the uninsured population of the Nation have \n     access to quality affordable primary and preventive care \n     services; and\n       (2) Congress recognizes the critical role of health centers \n     as an essential source of health care for millions of \n     Medicaid recipients and uninsured Americans and supports \n     continuation of the prospective payment system in helping to \n     maintain this system of health care.\n\n[[Page S13185]]\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, today, Senator Burr and I are introducing a \nresolution that reaffirms the importance of the Medicaid prospective \npayment system for federally qualified health centers.\n  Federally qualified health centers--community, migrant, public \nhousing, and homeless health centers--form the backbone of the Nation's \nhealth care safety net. FQHC's provide cost-effective, high-quality \nhealth care to the Nation's poor and medically underserved, including \nthe working poor, the uninsured, and many high-risk and vulnerable \npopulations.\n  Federally qualified health centers serve nearly 1 of 5 low-income \nchildren. Two-thirds of health center patients are members of racial \nand ethnic minority groups. And over 675,000 homeless persons receive \ncare at health centers every year.\n  FQHC's play a particularly critical role in serving patients enrolled \nin Medicaid. Health centers provide care to nearly 6 million of the 53 \nmillion people enrolled in the Medicaid Program nationwide. Thirty-six \npercent of all FQHC patients are Medicaid beneficiaries compared to 12 \npercent nationally. Notably, the cost of treating Medicaid patients at \nFQHCs is about one-third less than the cost for those receiving care \nelsewhere, with drug costs alone about 25 percent lower.\n  In 2000, a bipartisan majority of the Congress established a \nprospective payment system, or PPS, to ensure that FQHC's receive fair \nMedicaid reimbursement. This system strikes a balance between \nprotecting Federal investment in such health centers and allowing State \nflexibility in designing the payment system for these centers. The PPS \nallows health centers to provide and expand primary care services to \nmore people in need, promotes efficient operation of FQHC's, and \nensures they receive adequate Medicaid reimbursement.\n  Today, PPS has allowed health centers to provide quality health care \nto nearly 15 million people nationally, while also delivering \nsignificant cost savings to the Medicaid Program. Congress should \nrecognize the critical role of such health centers as the primary \nsource of care for millions of Medicaid recipients and uninsured \nAmericans and support continuation of the prospective payment system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/17/senate-section/article/S13185-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 66--AFFIRMING THAT THE INTENT OF CONGRESS \nIN PASSING THE NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1997 \n  WAS TO ALLOW HUNTING AND FISHING ON PUBLIC LAND WITHIN THE NATIONAL \n  WILDLIFE REFUGE SYSTEM AND DECLARING THAT THE PURPOSE OF RESERVING \nCERTAIN LAND AS PUBLIC LAND IS TO MAKE THE LAND AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC \n                          FOR REASONABLE USES\n\n  Mr. VITTER submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources:\n\n                            S.

Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Feinstein, \nMr. Feingold, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Salazar, Mrs. \nBoxer, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. Kennedy) submitted \nan amendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 2020, to \nprovide for reconciliation pursuant to section 202(b) of the concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006; which was ordered to lie \non the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title IV, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE FEDERAL TAX \n                   DEDUCTION FOR STATE AND LOCAL TAXES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) No American should be unnecessarily or excessively \n     burdened with additional taxes.\n       (2) The Federal income tax has grown more complicated and \n     unmanageable over time, imposing burdensome administrative \n     and compliance costs on American taxpayers.\n       (3) On January 7, 2005, President George W. Bush created \n     the President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform (the \n     ``Panel'') via Executive Order 13369.\n       (4) The Panel was tasked with providing several options for \n     Federal tax reform that would simplify Federal tax laws, \n     retain progressivity, and promote long-run economic growth \n     and job creation.\n       (5) In its final report, released publicly on November 1, \n     2005, the Panel recommended the complete repeal of the \n     Federal deduction for State and local taxes, as a central \n     component of both the ``Simplified Income Tax Plan'' and the \n     ``Growth and Investment Tax Plan''.\n       (6) State and local taxes have been deductible from the \n     Federal income tax since the inception of the Federal income \n     tax in 1913.\n       (7) Eliminating the deduction for State and local taxes \n     would create a new form of double taxation at a time where \n     efforts are being made to reduce other forms of double \n     taxation, since repeal would require millions of taxpayers to \n     pay Federal taxes on income that is also taxed at the State \n     or local level.\n       (8) Congress has recently taken steps to expand, rather \n     than cut back, the State and local tax deduction, by \n     reinstating a deduction for State sales taxes for some \n     taxpayers (previously repealed as part of the Tax Reform Act \n     of 1986), as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.\n       (9) There is some concern, as noted by the nonpartisan \n     Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, that eliminating the \n     deduction could ``lower support for public services and lead \n     to a `race to the bottom' in terms of State and local \n     expenditures as States compete to have the lowest taxes in \n     order to attract higher-income households''.\n       (10) The deduction for State and local taxes is not just a \n     concern for a small minority of taxpayers in the largest \n     States, as 22 States saw more than \\1/3\\ of their taxpayers \n     take the deduction in 2003, the latest year for which data is \n     available (Maryland, New Jersey, Connecticut, Colorado, \n     Oregon, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Virginia, Utah, California, \n     Georgia, New York, Wisconsin, Arizona, Rhode Island, \n     Michigan, Delaware, North Carolina, Illinois, New Hampshire, \n     Nevada, and Idaho (ranked in order of the percentage of \n     taxpayers affected)).\n       (11) In tax year 2003, 43,538,000 taxpayers in the United \n     States took advantage of the Federal deduction for State and \n     local taxes, deducting a total of $315,690,000,000, thereby\n\n[[Page S13210]]\n\n     saving taxpayers in the United States approximately \n     $88,390,000,000 in Federal income taxes, assuming an average \n     marginal rate of 28 percent for taxpayers who itemize.\n       (12) In tax year 2003, the top 25 States ranked by the \n     number of taxpayers affected represented 77 percent of the \n     taxpayers affected nationally, and took 85 percent of the \n     total deductions for State and local taxes, as described in \n     the following

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) As many as 44,000,000 Americans are estimated to lack \n     health insurance during the course of the year, many of whom \n     are uninsured for a short period of time while a smaller \n     number face longer periods without coverage.\n       (2) Rising health care costs contribute to the problem of \n     the uninsured and make it more difficult to find a simple \n     solution to make health care affordable.\n       (3) There is not a one-size fits all solution to address \n     health care coverage issues.\n       (4) Businesses have competing needs for their resources, \n     including investments to ensure their competitiveness and \n     providing health care coverage for their employees and \n     dependents.\n       (5) Lower tax rates on dividends and capital gains saved \n     24,000,000 families an average of nearly $950 on their 2004 \n     taxes, including about 7,000,000 seniors who saved, on \n     average, $1,230 each.\n       (6) These pro-growth tax cuts have spurred economic \n     development and job creation and have been partly responsible \n     for an increase in tax receipts.\n       (7) Of the more than 30,000,000 tax returns that included \n     dividend income, those with adjusted gross income of less \n     than $75,000 accounted for 64 percent, or over 19,000,000 of \n     such returns.\n       (8) Of the nearly 23,000,000 tax returns that included \n     capital gains, 62 percent of these returns, or about \n     14,000,000, had less than $75,000 in adjusted gross income.\n       (9) Allowing taxes to increase will make it harder for \n     employers and individuals to afford health care insurance, \n     leading to more individuals without health insurance.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Senate should--\n       (1) prevent an increase in taxes on millions of Americans \n     by not allowing the tax policy enacted in 2003 to expire; and\n       (2) extend tax policies that have proven to enhance \n     economic growth, create jobs, and improve business' and \n     individuals' ability to afford health insurance coverage; and\n       (3) address the multiple aspects of our Nation's health \n     care crisis, including the need to make health care more \n     affordable, to expand coverage, and to strengthen the health \n     care safety net by--\n       (A) promoting the use of health care technology, which will \n     help reduce medical errors that contribute to higher costs \n     and promote greater efficiency in care delivery;\n       (B) providing new financial assistance and tax credits to \n     make health insurance more affordable;\n       (C) creating financial incentives for young adults to \n     purchase lifetime, portable health insurance;\n       (D) expanding health insurance coverage options for low-\n     income entrepreneurs and self-employed individuals;\n       (E) increasing access to specialty care within the health \n     care safety net by providing a tax deduction to physician \n     specialists who provide care for patients referred from \n     health care safety net providers;\n       (F) reducing regulatory burdens on health care safety net \n     providers that lead to higher administrative costs and a \n     diversion of funds that could be spent on patient care; and\n       (G) improving outreach efforts to maximize participation of \n     eligible beneficiaries in Federal health care safety net \n     programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2655.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING DOHA ROUND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) are \n     currently engaged in a round of trade negotiations known as \n     the Doha Development Agenda (Doha Round).\n       (2) The Doha Round includes negotiations aimed at \n     clarifying and improving disciplines under the Agreement on \n     Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on \n     Tariffs and Trade 1994 (Antidumping Agreement) and the \n     Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (Subsidies \n     Agreement).\n       (3) The WTO Ministerial Declaration adopted on November 14, \n     2001 (WTO Paper No. WT/MIN(01)/DEC/1) specifically provides \n     that the Doha Round negotiations are to preserve the ``basic \n     concepts, principles and effectiveness'' of the Antidumping \n     Agreement and the Subsidies Agreement.\n       (4) In section 2102(b)(14)(A) of the Bipartisan Trade \n     Promotion Authority Act of 2002, the Congress mandated that \n     the principal negotiating objective of the United States with \n     respect to trade remedy laws was to ``preserve the ability of \n     the United States to enforce rigorously its trade laws . . . \n     and avoid agreements that lessen the effectiveness of \n     domestic and international disciplines on unfair trade, \n     especially dumping and subsidies''.\n       (5) The countries that have been the most persistent and \n     egregious violators of international fair trade rules are \n     engaged in an aggressive effort to significantly weaken the \n     disciplines provided in the Antidumping Agreement and the \n     Subsidies Agreement and undermine the ability of the United \n     States to effectively enforce its trade remedy laws.\n       (6) Chronic violators of fair trade disciplines have put \n     forward proposals that would substantially weaken United \n     States trade remedy laws and practices, including mandating \n     that unfair trade orders terminate after a set number of \n     years even if unfair trade and injury are likely to recur, \n     mandating that trade remedy duties reflect less than the full \n     margin of dumping or subsidization, mandating higher de \n     minimis levels of unfair trade, making cumulation of the \n     effects of imports from multiple countries more difficult in \n     unfair trade investigations, outlawing the critical practice \n     of ``zeroing'' in antidumping investigations, mandating the \n     weighing of causes, and mandating other provisions that make \n     it more difficult to prove injury.\n       (7) United States trade remedy laws have already been \n     significantly weakened by numerous unjust and activist WTO \n     dispute settlement decisions which have created new \n     obligations to which the United States never agreed.\n       (8) Trade remedy laws remain a critical resource for \n     American manufacturers, agricultural producers, and \n     aquacultural producers in responding to closed foreign \n     markets, subsidized imports, and other forms of unfair trade, \n     particularly in the context of the challenges currently faced \n     by these vital sectors of the United States economy.\n       (9) The United States had a current account trade deficit \n     of approximately $668,000,000,000 in 2004, including a trade \n     deficit of almost $162,000,000,000 with China alone, as well \n     as a trade deficit of $40,000,000,000 in advanced technology.\n       (10) United States manufacturers have lost over 3,000,000 \n     jobs since June 2000, and United States manufacturing \n     employment is currently at its lowest level since 1950.\n       (11) Many industries critical to United States national \n     security are at severe risk from unfair foreign competition.\n       (12) The Congress strongly believes that the proposals put \n     forward by countries seeking to undermine trade remedy \n     disciplines in the Doha Round would result in serious harm to \n     the United States economy, including significant job losses \n     and trade disadvantages.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should not be a signatory to any \n     agreement or protocol with respect to the Doha Development \n     Round of the World Trade Organization negotiations, or any \n     other bilateral or multilateral trade negotiations, that--\n       (A) adopts any proposal to lessen the effectiveness of \n     domestic and international disciplines on unfair trade or \n     safeguard provisions, including proposals--\n       (i) mandating that unfair trade orders terminate after a \n     set number of years even if unfair trade and injury are \n     likely to recur;\n       (ii) mandating that trade remedy duties reflect less than \n     the full margin of dumping or subsidization;\n       (iii) mandating higher de minimis levels of unfair trade;\n       (iv) making cumulation of the effects of imports from \n     multiple countries more difficult in unfair trade \n     investigations;\n       (v) outlawing the critical practice of ``zeroing'' in \n     antidumping investigations; or\n\n[[Page S13232]]\n\n       (vi) mandating the weighing of causes or other provisions \n     making it more difficult to prove injury in unfair trade \n     cases; and\n       (B) would lessen in any manner the ability of the United \n     States to enforce rigorously its trade laws, including the \n     antidumping, countervailing duty, and safeguard laws;\n       (2) the United States trade laws and international rules \n     appropriately serve the public interest by offsetting \n     injurious unfair trade, and that further ``balancing \n     modifications'' or other similar provisions are unnecessary \n     and would add to the complexity and difficulty of achieving \n     relief against injurious unfair trade practices; and\n       (3) the United States should ensure that any new agreement \n     relating to international disciplines on unfair trade or \n     safeguard provisions fully rectifies and corrects decisions \n     by WTO dispute settlement panels or the Appellate Body that \n     have unjustifiably and negatively impacted, or threaten to \n     negatively impact, United States law or practice, including a \n     law or practice with respect to foreign dumping or \n     subsidization.\n                                 ______\n

The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 705) to establish the Interagency Council on \n     Meeting the Housing and Service Needs of Seniors, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill, \nwhich had been reported from the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs, with an amendment, as follows:\n  [Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert the part printed \nin italic.]\n\n                                 S. 705\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     [SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       [This Act may be cited as the ``Meeting the Housing and \n     Service Needs of Seniors Act of 2005''.\n\n     [SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       [Congress finds the following:\n       [(1) The senior population (persons 65 or older) in this \n     country is rapidly growing, and is expected to increase from \n     34,700,000 in 2000 to nearly 40,000,000 by 2010, and then \n     will dramatically increase to over 50,000,000 by 2020.\n       [(2) By 2020, the population of ``older'' seniors, those \n     over age 85, is expected to double to 7,000,000, and then \n     double again to 14,000,000 by 2040.\n       [(3) As the senior population increases, so does the need \n     for additional safe, decent, affordable, and suitable housing \n     that meets their unique needs.\n       [(4) Due to the health care, transportation, and service \n     needs of seniors, issues of providing suitable and affordable \n     housing opportunities differ significantly from the housing \n     needs of other families.\n       [(5) Seniors need access to a wide array of housing \n     options, such as affordable assisted living, in-home care, \n     supportive or service-enriched housing, and retrofitted homes \n     and apartments to allow seniors to age in place and to avoid \n     premature placement in institutional settings.\n       [(6) While there are many programs in place to assist \n     seniors in finding and affording suitable housing and \n     accessing needed services, these programs are fragmented and \n     spread across many agencies, making it difficult for seniors \n     to access assistance or to receive comprehensive information.\n       [(7) Better coordination among Federal agencies is needed, \n     as is better coordination at State and local levels, to \n     ensure that seniors can access government activities, \n     programs, services, and benefits in an effective and \n     efficient manner.\n       [(8) Up to date, accurate, and accessible statistics on key \n     characteristics of seniors, including conditions, behaviors, \n     and needs, are required to accurately identify the housing \n     and service needs of seniors.\n\n     [SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       [In this Act:\n       [(1) The term ``housing'' means any form of residence, \n     including rental housing, homeownership, assisted living, \n     group home, supportive housing arrangement, nursing facility, \n     or any other physical location where a person can live.\n       [(2) The term ``service'' includes transportation, health \n     care, nursing assistance, meal, personal care and chore \n     services, assistance with daily activities, mental health \n     care, physical therapy, case management, and any other \n     services needed by seniors to allow\n\n[[Page S13254]]\n\n     them to stay in their housing or find alternative housing \n     that meets their needs.\n       [(3) The term ``program'' includes any Federal or State \n     program providing income support, health benefits or other \n     benefits to seniors, housing assistance, mortgages, mortgage \n     or loan insurance or guarantees, housing counseling, \n     supportive services, assistance with daily activities, or \n     other assistance for seniors.\n       [(4) The term ``Council'' means the Interagency Council on \n     Meeting the Housing and Service Needs of Seniors.\n       [(5) The term ``senior'' means any individual 65 years of \n     age or older.\n\n     [SEC. 4. INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON MEETING THE HOUSING AND \n                   SERVICE NEEDS OF SENIORS.\n\n       [(a) Establishment.--There is established in the executive \n     branch an independent council to be known as the Interagency \n     Council on Meeting the Housing and Service Needs of Seniors.\n       [(b) Objectives.--The objectives of the Council are as \n     follows:\n       [(1) To promote coordination and collaboration among the \n     Federal departments and agencies involved with housing, \n     health care, and service needs of seniors in order to better \n     meet the needs of senior citizens.\n       [(2) To identify the unique housing and service needs faced \n     by seniors around the country and to recommend ways that the \n     Federal Government, States, State and local governments, and \n     others can better meet those needs, including how to ensure \n     that seniors can find and afford housing that allows them to \n     access health care, transportation, nursing assistance, and \n     assistance with daily activities where they live or in their \n     communities.\n       [(3) To facilitate the aging in place of seniors, by \n     identifying and making available the programs and services \n     necessary to enable seniors to remain in their homes as they \n     age.\n       [(4) To improve coordination among the housing and service \n     related programs and services of Federal agencies for seniors \n     and to make recommendations about needed changes with an \n     emphasis on--\n       [(A) maximizing the impact of existing programs and \n     services;\n       [(B) reducing or eliminating areas of overlap and \n     duplication in the provision and accessibility of such \n     programs and services; and\n       [(C) making access to programs and services easier for \n     seniors around the country.\n       [(5) To increase the efficiency and effectiveness of \n     existing housing and service related programs and services \n     which serve seniors.\n       [(6) To establish an ongoing system of coordination among \n     and within such agencies or organizations so that the housing \n     and service needs of seniors are met in a more efficient \n     manner.\n       [(c) Membership.--The Council shall be composed of the \n     following:\n       [(1) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or a \n     designee of the Secretary.\n       [(2) The Secretary of Health and Human Services or a \n     designee of the Secretary.\n       [(3) The Secretary of Agriculture or a designee of the \n     Secretary.\n       [(4) The Secretary of Transportation or a designee of the \n     Secretary.\n       [(5) The Secretary of Labor or a designee of the Secretary.\n       [(6) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs or a designee of the \n     Secretary.\n       [(7) The Secretary of the Treasury or a designee of the \n     Secretary.\n       [(8) The Commissioner of the Social Security Administration \n     or a designee of the Commissioner.\n       [(9) The Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and \n     Medicaid Services or a designee of the Administrator.\n       [(10) The Administrator of the Administration on Aging or a \n     designee of the Administrator.\n       [(11) The head (or designee) of any other Federal agency as \n     the Council considers appropriate.\n       [(12) State and local representatives knowledgeable about \n     the needs of seniors as chosen by the Council members \n     described in paragraphs (1) through (11).\n       [(d) Chairperson.--The Chairperson of the Council shall \n     alternate between the Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development and the Secretary of Health and Human Services on \n     an annual basis.\n       [(e) Vice Chair.--Each year, the Council shall elect a Vice \n     Chair from among its members.\n       [(f) Meetings.--The Council shall meet at the call of its \n     Chairperson or a majority of its members at any time, and no \n     less often than quarterly.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The senior population (persons 65 or older) in this \n     country is rapidly growing, and is expected to increase from \n     34,700,000 in 2000 to nearly 40,000,000 by 2010, and then \n     will dramatically increase to over 50,000,000 by 2020.\n       (2) By 2020, the population of ``older'' seniors, those \n     over age 85, is expected to double to 7,000,000, and then \n     double again to 14,000,000 by 2040.\n       (3) As the senior population increases, so does the need \n     for additional safe, decent, affordable, and suitable housing \n     that meets their unique needs.\n       (4) Due to the health care, transportation, and service \n     needs of seniors, issues of providing suitable and affordable \n     housing opportunities differ significantly from the housing \n     needs of other families.\n       (5) Seniors need access to a wide array of housing options, \n     such as affordable assisted living, in-home care, supportive \n     or service-enriched housing, and retrofitted homes and \n     apartments to allow seniors to age in place and to avoid \n     premature placement in institutional settings.\n       (6) While there are many programs in place to assist \n     seniors in finding and affording suitable housing and \n     accessing needed services, these programs are fragmented and \n     spread across many agencies, making it difficult for seniors \n     to access assistance or to receive comprehensive information.\n       (7) Better coordination among Federal agencies is needed, \n     as is better coordination at State and local levels, to \n     ensure that seniors can access government activities, \n     programs, services, and benefits in an effective and \n     efficient manner.\n       (8) Up to date, accurate, and accessible statistics on key \n     characteristics of seniors, including conditions, behaviors, \n     and needs, are required to accurately identify the housing \n     and service needs of seniors.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Housing.--The term ``housing'' means any form of \n     residence, including rental housing, homeownership, assisted \n     living, group home, supportive housing arrangement, nursing \n     facility, or any other physical location where a person can \n     live.\n       (2) Service.--The term ``service'' includes transportation, \n     health care, nursing assistance, meal, personal care and \n     chore services, assistance with daily activities, mental \n     health care, physical therapy, case management, and any other \n     services needed by seniors to allow them to stay in their \n     housing or find alternative housing that meets their needs.\n       (3) Program.--The term ``program'' includes any Federal or \n     State program providing income support, health benefits or \n     other benefits to seniors, housing assistance, mortgages, \n     mortgage or loan insurance or guarantees, housing counseling, \n     supportive services, assistance with daily activities, or \n     other assistance for seniors.\n       (4) Council.--The term ``Council'' means the Interagency \n     Council on Meeting the Housing and Service Needs of Seniors.\n       (5) Senior.--The term ``senior'' means any individual 65 \n     years of age or older.\n\n     SEC. 4.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     Act, $1,500,000 for each of fiscal years 2005 through 2010.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport passage of S. 705, legislation to establish an Interagency \nCouncil on Meeting the Housing and Service Needs of Seniors. This \nlegislation will help the Federal Government work with its partners to \nmeet the growing housing and related needs of senior citizens around \nthe country. The Interagency Council will work to better coordinate \nFederal programs so that seniors and their families can access the \nprograms and the services necessary to allow them to age in place or \nfind suitable housing alternatives.\n  The challenges that confront us are growing more urgent as our \npopulation ages. Data from the 2000 census show that the population \nover 65 years of age was 34.7 million. This number is expected to grow \nto over 50 million by 2020. It is projected that by 2030 nearly 20 \npercent of our population will be over 65. That is, almost one American \nin every five will be elderly.\n  As our senior population continues to increase, so will the demand \nfor affordable housing and service options. This is a matter of concern \nnot only for those who will need the services but for families--\nchildren along with spouses. It concerns communities all around the \ncountry, as productive and responsible citizens grow older and need \nhelp. It is a matter of deep concern for us all, because it will affect \nthe well-being of our entire society.\n  In order for seniors to age in place, or find alternative housing \narrangements, services must be linked with housing. Seniors must be \nable to access needed health supports, transportation, meal and chore \nservices, and assistance with daily tasks in or close to their homes. \nWithout needed supports, seniors and their families face difficult and \neven daunting decisions.\n  The Commission on Affordable Housing and Health Facility Needs for \nSeniors--``Seniors Commission''--established by Congress in 1999 found \nthat too often, seniors face premature institutionalization because \nhousing and services are not linked. According to the Commission's \nreport, ``the very\n\n[[Page S13257]]\n\nheart'' of its work ``is the recognition that the housing and service \nneeds of seniors traditionally have been addressed in different \n`worlds' that often fail to recognize or communicate with each other.'' \nThe Commission concluded that: ``the most striking characteristic of \nseniors'' housing and health care in this country is the disconnection \nof one field from another.''\n  If left unattended, the problem of lack of coordination will \nincreasingly undermine all of our efforts to assure that Americans, as \nthey age, have access to the services they need. The Interagency \nCouncil on the Housing and Service Needs of Seniors will increase \ncoordination and will serve as a permanent national platform to address \nthe needs and issues of our aging population.\n  The Interagency Council will help to improve collaboration and \ncoordination among the Federal agencies and our State and local \npartners, to ensure that seniors are better able to access housing and \nservices. This Council will work to find new ways to link housing \nprograms and needed supportive services to increase their efficiency, \nto make them more accessible, and to strengthen their capacity.\n  The decisions that our seniors and their families must make are \ndifficult enough. They should not be made more painful and burdensome \nby having to negotiate a confusing maze of programs and services and a \nmultiplicity of administrative procedures. I am hopeful that the \nInteragency Council on Meeting the Housing and Service Needs of Seniors \nwill be able to focus attention on this problem, while working towards \nsolutions.\n  This bill has wide support from a diverse array of groups, ranging \nfrom senior advocates to faith-based organizations and direct service \nproviders. The diversity of groups that have worked together in support \nof this legislation is indicative of the great need for such \ncoordination. If we are to successfully address the growing needs of \nseniors, it is clear that much work must be done. The establishment of \nan Interagency Council on Meeting the Housing and Service Needs of \nSeniors is a critical first step in this endeavor. I urge my colleagues \nto vote in favor of this important legislation. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the legislation as reported from Committee be printed immediately \nfollowing this statement. I also ask unanimous consent that the \nattached letters of support, section-by-section analysis of the bill, \nand relevant fact sheet be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Finally, I want to thank Chairman Shelby for his \nleadership and assistance in moving this legislation. I also want to \nacknowledge the excellent work of the staff on this bill, especially \nthat of Jennifer Fogel-Bublick, as well as Sarah Garrett, Mark \nCalabria, and Tewana Wilkerson. In addition, we could not have done \nthis without the active support of Kathy Casey, Chairman Shelby's Staff \nDirector.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 15, 2005.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of AARP, thank you for \n     introducing S. 705, the ``Meeting the Housing and Service \n     Needs of Seniors Act of 2005,'' a bill to establish an \n     Interagency Council to improve coordination in service \n     delivery. As proposed, the Interagency Council would not only \n     coordinate, but also monitor, evaluate, and recommend \n     improvements in existing programs and services that assist \n     seniors in meeting their housing and service needs at the \n     federal, state, and local level. And, the Council would \n     collect and disseminate information about seniors along with \n     these programs and services.\n       Better coordination of housing programs is needed for a \n     variety of reasons. In many instances, multiple program \n     requirements and paperwork may become duplicative and \n     burdensome. Resident means testing and qualifications may \n     also be slightly different across programs. And, different \n     methods of establishing rent levels and defining market areas \n     for comparison are used by different programs. Lastly, \n     different housing sponsors and agencies may have different \n     waiting lists that can overlap for a population at need.\n       The need for greater coordination is particularly apparent \n     when trying to put together the housing, health, and social \n     services programs at all levels of government that are \n     critical to successfully serving persons with disabilities of \n     all ages. Research has shown that federal housing programs \n     have very efficiently, if inadvertently, targeted those who \n     are at high risk of needing supportive services to remain \n     independent. Analysis by AARP's Public Policy Institute of \n     data from the 2002 American Communities Survey found that, \n     compared to older homeowners, older renters in subsidized \n     housing were:\n       Much older--half of the older renters in subsidized housing \n     were 75 or older compared to just over a third of older \n     homeowners;\n       Twice as likely to experience physical and cognitive \n     limitations that threaten their ability to live \n     independently;\n       More than three times as likely to live alone and have weak \n     informal supports from family; and\n       Roughly three times as likely to be at high risk of needing \n     Medicaid assistance due to low incomes and high levels of \n     disability.\n       Better coordination of housing, health, and social services \n     programs would serve a variety of purposes. Housing managers \n     need reliable partners from health and social services \n     agencies to serve the large and growing number of frail older \n     people in their buildings. Social services agencies could \n     benefit from the greater efficiencies of serving \n     concentrations of older people with supportive services \n     needs. But the most compelling case for better coordination \n     comes from the lives of the older people who need \n     assistance--the older woman who is desperately clinging to \n     independence in her apartment; the older man who is told he \n     must move to a nursing home to get needed services; or the \n     older resident in a nursing home who might have been able to \n     leave if suitable housing and services were available.\n       AARP actively participated in the Seniors Housing \n     Commission whose 2002 report called attention to many of \n     these issues. We have supported efforts to expand the mission \n     of housing programs and to provide the needed tools for \n     serving older persons with disabilities through building \n     features that accommodate service needs, staffing that \n     includes trained service coordinators, and retrofitting \n     dollars to convert buildings to assisted living. AARP is co-\n     chairing a process, along with the National Cooperative Bank \n     Development Corporation, Fannie Mae, and the National Council \n     of State Housing Finance Agencies, to develop recommendations \n     on how housing finance programs could be better structured to \n     promote affordable assisted living. While these efforts have \n     been important, they do not yet approach the scale of what is \n     needed to serve the frail older people who need help. Only a \n     concerted effort by all agencies at all levels of government \n     can adequately address these needs.\n       We urge Congress and the Administration to work together to \n     expedite the passage of this legislation and subsequent \n     establishment of the Interagency Council. AARP again thanks \n     you for your attention to the needs of American seniors, and \n     stands ready to assist you to enact this important \n     legislation.

Paul Sarbanes,\n     Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, \n         U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes, The Elderly Housing Coalition (EHC) \n     is comprised of organizations that represent providers of \n     affordable housing and supportive service for the elderly. We \n     are writing in enthusiastic support of your legislation that \n     would establish the Interagency Council on Housing and \n     Service Needs of Seniors. This Council is desperately needed \n     and will help federal, state and local governments better \n     serve the housing and service needs of our elderly \n     population.\n       According to the Congressional Commission on Affordable \n     Housing and Health Facility Needs for Seniors in the 21st \n     Century, we must integrate our current fragmented system of \n     programs that seniors rely on to find the housing and \n     services they need. As the number of seniors grows \n     exponentially and will, in fact, have doubled by 2030, we \n     must find a way to use our resources more effectively.\n       Your bill will be a great first step to bringing the key \n     governmental agencies together to identify how they can best \n     work to maximize program efficiency and streamline access. \n     Again, we are pleased to offer our support for this \n     legislation establishing an interagency council and thank you \n     for your leadership on this issue.\n       If there is anything that the Elderly Housing Coalition can \n     do to help or if you have any questions about the EHC please \n     contact Nancy Libson or Alayna Waldrum.\n           Sincerely,\n         Alliance for Retired Americans, American Association of \n           Homes and Services for the Aging, American Association \n           of Service Coordinators, Association of Jewish Aging \n           Services of North America, B'nai B'rith International, \n           Catholic Charities USA, Catholic Health Association of \n           the United States, Council of Large Public Housing \n           Authorities,\n\n[[Page S13258]]\n\n           Elderly Housing Development and Operations Corporation.\n         Kinship Caregiver Resources/Intergenerational Village \n           Project, Local Initiatives Support Corporation, \n           National Association of Housing Cooperatives, National \n           Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials, \n           National Housing Conference, National Low Income \n           Housing Coalition, National PACE Association, Stewards \n           of Affordable Housing for the Future, Volunteers of \n           America.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           American Association of\n\n\n                                         Service Coordinators,\n\n                                      Columbus, OH, April 5, 2005.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the 1,600 members of \n     the American Association of Service Coordinators (AASC), I \n     want to express our support for your proposed legislation to \n     establish an Interagency Council on Housing and Service Needs \n     of Seniors. AASC believes that this bill is urgently needed \n     to assist service coordinators and others seeking to bring \n     together the various federal and other programs needed by \n     older persons and other special populations.\n       In my testimony, before the Commission on Affordable \n     Housing and Health Facility describing the present fragmented \n     system, I stated that ``even for long-time professionals, the \n     current `crazy-quilt' tapestry of services and shelter \n     options make it difficult to fully grasp their complexities, \n     let alone try to access them. The results are confusion among \n     consumers, duplication of service delivery, government \n     agencies not knowing who supplies what service or that some \n     services even exist, reduction in qualified service workers, \n     regulations that impede dedicated service providers from \n     providing the service they were hired and want to perform.''\n       One of AASC recommendations to the Commission was the \n     establishment of a cabinet-level department that would \n     encompass in one entity housing, health care and other \n     federal support programs serving the elderly to better focus \n     federal policy and regulatory efforts, in conjunction with \n     states and communities. AASC believes that your bill is an \n     important step to establish a permanent national platform to \n     address many of the cross-cutting needs and issues \n     confronting increasing numbers of frail and vulnerable older \n     persons.\n       As you may know, AASC is a national, nonprofit organization \n     representing professional service coordinators who serve low-\n     income older persons and other special populations living in \n     federally assisted and public housing facilities nationwide, \n     their caregivers, and others in their local community. Our \n     dedicated membership consists of service coordinators, case \n     managers and social workers, housing managers and \n     administrators, housing management companies, public housing \n     authorities, state housing finance agencies, state and local \n     area agencies on aging and a broad range of national and \n     state organizations and professionals involved in affordable, \n     service-enhanced housing. Background information on AASC is \n     available on our website: www.servicercoordinators.org.\n       We are grateful for your leadership on the vital issue. \n     Please let me know how AASC can assist you to expedite \n     enactment of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Janice Monks,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     American Association of Homes\n\n\n                                   and Services for the Aging,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 5, 2005.\n     Re Interagency Council on Housing and Service Needs of \n         Seniors legislation.\n\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, \n         U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of AAHSA, I am writing to \n     thank you for introducing legislation to establish an \n     Interagency Council on Housing and Service Needs of Seniors. \n     AAHSA members serve two million people every day through \n     mission-driven, not-for-profit organizations dedicated to \n     providing the services people need, when they need them, in \n     the place they call home. Our members offer the continuum of \n     aging services: assisted living residences, continuing care \n     retirement communities, nursing homes, senior housing \n     facilities, and outreach services. AAHSA's mission is to \n     create the future of aging services through quality the \n     public can trust.\n       Half of our members own or operate federally subsidized \n     senior apartment buildings and work collaboratively with home \n     and community based service providers that operate programs \n     governed by a maze of departmental regulations. This unique \n     perspective gives us and our members a bird's eye view of how \n     important it is for the various federal agencies to work \n     together to ensure the best care in the most responsive and \n     efficient manner possible.\n       In 2002 the Commission on Affordable Housing and Health \n     Facility Needs for Seniors in the 21st Century reported to \n     Congress that a top priority for the federal government \n     should be integrating the existing fragmented system of \n     programs that seniors rely on to piece together the housing \n     and services they need. Time is precious--the United States \n     is facing exponential growth in our senior population, which \n     will double by 2030. AAHSA members have created a number of \n     successful models for combining services and senior housing. \n     Unfortunately these are limited and difficult to replicate \n     because of the programmatic barriers. Now is the time to get \n     the policymakers to the table to address the barriers and \n     opportunities that exist in our federal programs and how to \n     make them work.\n       We know that this can be done. AAHSA strongly supports your \n     bill, which will help the Executive branch and Federal \n     agencies better coordinate the successful aging programs, as \n     an important first step. Thank you for your leadership. If \n     there is anything that AAHSA or my staff can do to support \n     you, please do not hesitate to let me know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Larry Minnix,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    United Jewish Communities,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 12, 2005.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of United Jewish \n     Communities, I am pleased to offer our support for your \n     efforts to establish an Interagency Council on Housing and \n     Service Needs for Seniors through your introduction of S. \n     705, the Meeting the Housing and Service Needs of Seniors Act \n     of 2005. As proposed, the executive level Interagency Council \n     will provide crucial coordination of housing, health and \n     social services for seniors. The Interagency Council will \n     also make possible greater cooperation between the federal \n     agencies involved with these programs, including HUD, HHS, \n     DOT and AOA.\n       As you may know, UJC represents and serves 155 Jewish \n     Federations and 400 independent Jewish communities across \n     North America--one of the world's largest and most effective \n     networks of social service providers and programs, meeting \n     the needs of all people, Jews and non-Jews, wherever they \n     live. More importantly, the American Jewish population is \n     aging faster than the general population. More than a million \n     Jews are over 65; more than 318,000 live alone. Federation-\n     supported programs, transportation assistance, home-delivered \n     meals and a myriad of other services help ensure that our \n     seniors are cared for with dignity and loving-kindness. It is \n     critical that we maximize program efficiency and streamline \n     access.\n       United Jewish Communities strongly supports your bill, \n     which will better help key governmental agencies coordinate \n     aging programs. We urge Congress and the Administration to \n     work together to pass this legislation. Thank you for your \n     leadership on this initiative. If there is anything that UJC \n     can do to be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to \n     let us know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Stephan O.

Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and \n         Urban Affairs, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: The Enterprise Foundation strongly \n     supports your bill to establish an Interagency Council on \n     Housing and Service Needs of Seniors (S. 705). Developing \n     effective and efficient coordination among the various \n     federal agencies that are involved in providing housing, \n     health care and supportive services to seniors is critical to \n     meeting the needs of elderly low-income Americans and their \n     families.\n       The Enterprise Foundation and our subsidiary organization, \n     the Enterprise Social Investment Corporation, certainly \n     recognize that providing decent, affordable housing for low-\n     income seniors requires effective linkages between housing \n     and services to enable seniors to remain in their homes and \n     communities. To date, ESIC has completed 212 elderly housing \n     projects, representing an invetment of more than $729 \n     million. Of the 68,727 affordable housing units ESIC has \n     produced, 20,005 include support services for elderly and \n     disabled residents as well as families.\n       In recognition of the need for collaboration, The \n     Foundation, ESIC and the Corporation for Supportive Housing \n     have recently embarked on a new Supportive Housing Investment \n     Partnership that is the nation's largest, most ambitious \n     initiative focused on leveraging private capital investments \n     to significantly increase the production of supportive \n     housing across the country. This partnership will enable \n     nonprofit developers to build more than 3,000 new supportive \n     housing units over the next two years. This partnership is \n     designed to expand the impact of all of the partners, to be \n     flexible in adapting to local needs and environments, and \n     also to support the established relationships and the \n     significant efforts to date of each partner.\n       Similar collaboration at the federal level among and within \n     agencies providing programs and services for seniors would \n     maximize the impact of . . . seniors receive the assistance \n     they need.\n       The Enterprise Foundation commends you for your leadership \n     on this and other housing issues and urges Congress to \n     expedite the passage of this critical legislation. Please\n\n[[Page S13259]]\n\n     call upon us if we can provide additional information or \n     assistance.,\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         F.

Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: I am pleased that Elderly Housing \n     Development and Operations Corporation (EHDOC) representing \n     over 40 senior housing facilities in 14 states, is joining \n     with other non-profit organizations involved with federally \n     assisted senior housing to strongly support your bill to \n     establish an Interagency Council on Housing and Service Needs \n     of Seniors. We believe that the establishment of this \n     Interagency Council will provide a cost-effective and \n     efficient means to promote coordination between the various \n     federal agencies involved with senior housing and services, \n     particularly HUD and HHS.\n       EHDOC is well aware of the need to improve collaboration \n     between the various federal agencies based on our efforts to \n     assist low-income, frail elderly in Council House in \n     Suitland, MD. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to link \n     the various services needed to enable many frail elderly to \n     remain in their homes as they age due to the existing \n     fragmentation of federal housing, services and health care \n     policies and programs.\n       The difficulty experienced by EHDOC with linking housing \n     and services is repeated by many nonprofit sponsors of \n     federally assisted senior housing throughout the country. As \n     you know, I was honored to serve as your appointee to the \n     recent Commission on Affordable Housing and Health Care \n     Facilities Needs of Older Persons. We repeatedly heard \n     testimony from public and private agencies involved with \n     senior housing, supportive services and health care, older \n     persons and others, of their difficulties in bringing \n     together these services to meet the needs of older persons.\n       As stated in the Senior Commissions' final report, ``the \n     very heart of this Commission's work is the recognition that \n     the housing and service needs of seniors traditionally have \n     been addressed in different `worlds' that often fail to \n     recognize or communicate with each other.'' Findings of the \n     Commission concluded ``while policymakers have struggled to \n     be responsive to the needs of seniors, the very structure of \n     Congressional committees and Federal agencies often makes it \n     difficult to address complex needs in a comprehensive and \n     coordinated fashion. For example: medical needs of seniors \n     are addressed by Medicare and Medicaid; social service needs \n     are addressed by Medicaid, the OAA, and other block grant \n     programs; housing programs are administered by HUD and the \n     Department of Agriculture's RHS; and transportation programs \n     are administered by the U.S. Department of Trsportation \n     (DOT).''\n       We commend you for your leadership in addressing this \n     critical need to effectively bring together the various \n     federal agencies and others involved with affordable housing \n     and service needs of older persons through the establishment \n     of an Interagency Council on Senior Housing. Please let me if \n     you have any questions or how EHDOC can assist you with the \n     enactment of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Steve Protulis,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  S. 705--Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n     Section 1. Short title\n       This section establishes the title of the bill, the \n     ``Meeting the Housing and Service Needs of Seniors Act of \n     2005''\n     Section 2. Congressional findings\n       This section states Congressional Findings, including:\n       (1) The senior population (persons 65 or older) in this \n     country is rapidly growing, and is expected to increase from \n     34,700,000 in 2000 to nearly 40,000,000 by 2010, and then \n     will dramatically increase to over 50,000,000 by 2020.\n       (2) Seniors need access to a wide array of housing options, \n     such as affordable assisted living, in home care, supportive \n     or service-enriched housing, and retrofitted homes and \n     apartments to allow seniors to age in place and to avoid \n     premature placement in institutional settings.\n       (3) While there are many programs in place to assist \n     seniors in finding and affording suitable housing and \n     accessing needed services, these programs are fragmented and \n     spread across many agencies, making it difficult for seniors \n     to access assistance or to receive comprehensive information.\n       (4) Better coordination among Federal agencies is needed, \n     as is better coordination at State and local levels, to \n     ensure that seniors can access government activities, \n     programs, services, and benefits in an effective and \n     efficient manner.\n     Section 3. Definitions\n       This section provides definitions of the following terms: \n     ``housing,'' ``service,'' ``program,'' ``Council,'' and \n     ``senior.''\n     Section 4. Interagency Council on Meeting the Housing and \n         Service Needs of Seniors\n       This section establishes a high level executive branch \n     Interagency Council on Meeting the Housing and Service Needs \n     of Seniors.\n       This section also lays out the objectives of the Council, \n     including promoting coordination and collaboration among the \n     federal agencies and departments which serve seniors; \n     identifying housing and service needs of seniors; \n     facilitating the aging in place of seniors; and making \n     recommendations about needed changes to maximize the impact \n     of existing programs, reduce duplication and increase access \n     to programs and services.\n       This section details the Council membership--the \n     Secretaries of HUD and HHS, as well as the Secretaries or \n     designees of the Department of Agriculture, Labor, \n     Transportation, Veterans Affairs, and the Treasury. Also \n     serving on the Council will be the following (or their \n     designees): the Commissioner of the Social Security \n     Administration, the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare \n     and Medicaid Services and the Administrator of the \n     Administration on Aging. The Council will also have three \n     additional members- a Governor, a Mayor and a local official, \n     as appointed by the President. This section establishes that \n     the Secretaries of HUD and HHS will chair the Council in \n     rotating 2-year terms. Under this section, the Council is \n     required to meet quarterly, and must hold at least 2 meetings \n     a year with stakeholders and interested parties. This \n     requirement can be met by opening at least two of the \n     quarterly meetings to the public.\n     Section 5. Functions of the council\n       This section lists the activities that the Council will \n     undertake in meeting its objectives. In meeting its \n     objectives, the Council will: review all federal programs and \n     services that assist seniors; monitor, evaluate and recommend \n     improvements in existing programs, and how programs can be \n     better coordinated; recommend ways to reduce duplication and \n     ensure greater collaboration; work to facilitate the aging in \n     place of seniors; work with states to ensure programs and \n     services are coordinated at state and local levels; identify \n     best practices for meeting the needs of seniors; ensure \n     seniors have access to information about programs and \n     services, including the establishment of a website; and \n     maintain updated data sources on seniors and their needs.\n       This section also requires that each agency or department \n     that is a member of the Council provide a report to the \n     Council that describes: each program in the agency or \n     department that serves a substantial number of seniors; any \n     barriers to the access and use of such programs; the efforts \n     made by the agency in increasing service enriched housing \n     opportunities for seniors; and any new data relating to \n     housing and service needs of seniors.\n       Based on the information provided by each member agency, \n     the Council is required to prepare and transmit a report to \n     Congress and the President that summarizes the agency \n     information; assesses the needs of seniors; provides a \n     comprehensive description of the programs and services that \n     exist for seniors; describes how the agencies and Council are \n     working with state and local governments and private \n     organizations to better coordinate senior programs; and makes \n     recommendations for legislative and administrative changes \n     needed to better meet the needs of seniors.\n     Section 6. Powers of the council\n       This section details how the Council will work, including \n     granting the Council the power to hold hearings and take \n     testimony as needed. In addition, this section provides that \n     member agencies must provide the Council with all requested \n     information. This section also requires the Council to adopt \n     internal ethics guidelines.\n     Section 7. Council personnel matters\n       This section clarifies that Council members shall not be \n     compensated for their service on the Council. Under this \n     section, the Council must appoint an Executive Director at \n     its initial meeting, and the Executive Director, with the \n     approval of the Council may hire staff.\n       This section also requires the Secretaries of the U.S. \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. \n     Department of Health and Human Services to provide all \n     necessary administrative support including office space and \n     computer/internet access.\n     Section 8. Authorization of appropriations\n       This section authorizes $1.5 million per year for 5 years \n     for the Council.\n\n Summary of Legislation to establish an Interagency Council on Meeting \n                the Housing and Service Needs of Seniors\n\n       This legislation will create an executive level Interagency \n     Council to better coordinate housing programs and related \n     services so that senior citizens can age in place and access \n     needed services. Unfortunately, the current programs and \n     services that assist the elderly in meeting their needs are \n     spread across numerous federal agencies, making it difficult \n     for seniors to understand and access needed services.\n       The senior population (persons 65 or older) in this country \n     is rapidly growing, and is expected to increase from 34.7 \n     million in 2000 to nearly 40 million by 2010, and then will \n     dramatically increase to over 50 million by 2020. By the year \n     2030, nearly one-fifth of the United States population will \n     be above 65 years of age. As the senior population increases, \n     so does the need for additional safe, decent, affordable, and \n     suitable housing that meets their unique needs.\n       The Council will undertake a number of activities to help \n     coordinate housing programs and services for seniors:\n\n[[Page S13260]]\n\n       Conduct a thorough review of all federal programs and \n     services designed to assist seniors with their housing needs\n       Facilitate the ``aging in place'' of seniors\n       Make recommendations about how to reduce duplication among \n     programs and how to more effectively coordinate programs and \n     services\n       Collect and disseminate data and information on seniors and \n     their needs\n       Maintain an updated website with information on how seniors \n     can access housing and services that fit their needs\n       Work with States to coordinate programs and services at the \n     State and local level\n       Implement the recommendation of the 1999 Congressionally \n     established Seniors Commission that the federal government \n     streamline and consolidate its programs and services for \n     seniors\n       This Interagency Council will be comprised of the \n     Secretaries (or designees) of the agencies which operate \n     programs for seniors: HUD, HHS, DOT, Agriculture, Treasury, \n     Labor, Veterans Affairs, as well as the Commissioner of the \n     Social Security Administration, the Administrator of the \n     Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the \n     Administrator of the Administration on Aging.\n       The legislation authorizes $1.5 million per year for 5 \n     years to pay for staff and other expenses. .\n       The legislation is supported by many organizations involved \n     in housing and services for seniors, including: AARP \n     (American Association of Retired Persons), NAHRO (the \n     National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials), \n     AAHSA (American Association of Homes and Services for the \n     Aging), the Elderly Housing Coalition, and the National Low \n     Income Housing Coalition.\n\n\n                    Aging Needs in the United States\n\n       Our Nation's Senior Population is Rapidly Growing, and \n     Americans are Living Longer Than Ever Before.\n       The senior population (age 65 and older) is expected to \n     double by 2030, from 36 million to 70 million, one-fifth of \n     the Nation's population.\n       By 2050 there will be over 86 million seniors, an increase \n     of 147% since 2000.\n       The average American life expectancy is anticipated to \n     increase from 76 to 81 by 2060.\n       By 2020 the number of seniors over age 85 is expected to \n     double to 7 million and then double again to 14 million by \n     2040.\n       Seniors Want to Age in Place.\n       82% of Americans age 45 and older say that even if they \n     need help caring for themselves, they prefer receiving \n     services that allow them to stay in their current home.\n       89% of those 55 and older desire to age in place, up from \n     84% in 1992.\n       To Facilitate Aging in Place, Services Must Be Connected to \n     Housing.\n       While many seniors want to remain at home, over 18% of \n     seniors (over 5.8 million) who do not reside in nursing \n     facilities have difficulty performing their daily activities \n     without assistance, and over one million of these seniors are \n     severely impaired, requiring assistance with many of their \n     basic tasks.\n       Many other seniors, those that can perform their daily \n     functions, still require access to health care, \n     transportation and other services.\n       In fact, nearly 20% of seniors have significant long-term \n     care needs.\n       It is predicted that both shrinking family size and \n     increasing workforce participation by women could make \n     informal care less available (women currently provide the \n     majority of such care), leading to a greater reliance on care \n     from other sources.\n       In 2005, $129 billion will be spent on paid care for \n     seniors; roughly $15,000 per senior.\n       To pay for long-term care, many seniors rely on government \n     funding--Medicaid (39%) and Medicare (20%), while 36% of \n     seniors pay out-of-pocket expenses.\n       Today, approximately one-third of all Medicaid spending \n     pays for long-term care, making Medicaid our Nation's largest \n     source of payment for such services and supports.\n       Medicaid spent a total of $83.8 billion for long-term care \n     services in 2003.\n       Of those over age 85, roughly 55% are impaired and require \n     long-term care.\n       A Florida study showed that more than 34% of seniors in \n     government-assisted housing have no family to turn to if sick \n     or disabled.\n       Many Seniors Are Not in a Financial Position to Pay for the \n     Housing and/or Services They Need.\n       There are nearly six times as many seniors in need of \n     affordable housing as are currently served in rent-assisted \n     housing.\n       81% of seniors are homeowners, but: 44% of those have \n     incomes of less than 50% of Area Median Income; 40% have no \n     savings; 26% have less than $25,000 saved.\n       35% of senior renters are severely rent burdened and pay \n     more than 50% of their income for rent.\n       The median income of older persons in 2002 was $19,436 for \n     males and $11,406 for females.\n       In home support services are expensive and can cost from \n     $140-$200 per day, or up to $73,000 per year.\n       Roughly one-third of seniors who enter a nursing home are \n     eligible for Medicaid upon admission; another third deplete \n     their assets paying for care and then turn to Medicaid to pay \n     for the portion of care that exceeds their income.\n       Nuring Homes: Without services, seniors find it difficult \n     to remain outside of nursing homes or other institutional \n     settings.\n       One third of seniors leave their homes to go to nursing \n     homes.\n       Nursing home costs average $60,000 per year; these costs \n     are expected to rise at least 5% annually.\n       Almost 20% of seniors over age 85 live in nursing homes, \n     compared with less than 2% of seniors age 65-84.\n       65% of nursing home admissions are directly from hospitals, \n     giving families little time to explore other options.\n       The Congressionally established Seniors Commission found in \n     their 2002 report that the unsynchronized federal housing and \n     health policies often lead to premature institutionalization.\n       Assisted Living Facilities: Many seniors could be well \n     served in assisted living facilities, an immediate step \n     between aging in place and nursing homes.\n       Assisted living is the fastest growing type of senior \n     housing in the United States, accounting for roughly 75% of \n     all new senior housing produced in recent years.\n       The typical assisted living resident is a widowed White \n     woman, age 85.\n       Roughly 50% of assisted living residents have Alzheimer's \n     disease or other cognitive impairment.\n       In 2002, over 36,000 assisted living facilities served \n     approximately 910,000 residents.\n       Assisted living costs between $2,100 and $2,900 a month, \n     and is primarily private pay. Few people have private \n     insurance coverage, and public subsidies are limited.\n       In 2002, 41 states provided at least some Medicaid coverage \n     for assisted living (serving about 102,000 elderly Medicaid \n     beneficiaries), but this covered personal care services, not \n     room and board.\n       Programs and Services for Seniors are Fragmented: \n     Regardless of where seniors live, it is clear that housing \n     and services must be linked.\n       The 1999 Congressionally established Seniors Commission \n     found that ``the most striking characteristic of seniors' \n     housing and health care in this country is the disconnection \n     of one field from another.''\n       The Seniors Commission also found that ``the time has come \n     for coordination among Federal and State agencies and \n     administrators.''\n       What these facts illustrate is that there is tremendous \n     stress on seniors and on their families to find, maintain and \n     afford housing; to acquire and pay for personal care \n     assistance or long term care; and to access other needed \n     services that can keep them independent and enable them to \n     stay connected to their communities and age in place.\n       Senator Sarbanes has introduced an Interagency Council on \n     Meeting the Housing and Service Needs of Seniors, to better \n     coordinate housing programs and related services so that \n     seniors can age in place and access needed services.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

REAUTHORIZATION OF INCENTIVE GRANTS REGARDING \n                   TELEMEDICINE.\n\n       Section 330L(b) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n     254c-18(b)) is amended by striking ``2002 through 2006'' and \n     inserting ``2006 through 2010''.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Enzi \nsubstitute at the desk be agreed to, the committee-reported amendment, \nas amended, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2671) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1418), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Senate just passed a bill that takes a \nmajor step--major step--to bringing health care into the information \nage, finally. This bill, the Wired for Health Care Quality Act, \nreflects the hard work by Senator Enzi, to whom I will turn the floor \nover shortly, myself, Senator Kennedy, Senator Clinton, and many \nothers.\n  This bill will do as much as anything we have done in this Congress \nand the last Congress and the Congress before that to cut waste and \ninefficiency out of our health care system. What the bill does is \nencourage the use of secure and interoperable health care records, \nelectronic records, electronic medical records.\n  This has a huge benefit for every American. It reduces waste and \ninefficiency. It reduces medical errors. It improves the quality of \nhealth care. It reduces health care costs throughout the system, \nraising quality. When you lower costs and you raise quality, by \ndefinition, you improve access as well.\n  This bill will help empower patients to become full partners in what \nwe all have as a vision; and that is, a patient-centered, provider-\nfriendly, consumer-driven system that will be driven by information, \nand be driven by choice, and be driven by control.\n  Patient privacy is protected. This secure exchange of lifesaving \ninformation improves efficiency throughout the system. It will allow, \nfor the first time, because there are interoperable standards that are \nset, the exchange of information, which will seamlessly help integrate \nhealth care delivery from the time a patient first presents to see a \nphysician or a nurse to ultimate discharge and treatment.\n  So this really is a pivotal moment. I encourage the House to act \nquickly on the legislation.\n  Again, I thank Senator Enzi for his leadership. Without it, this \nmoment simply would not be possible. I thank Senator Clinton who has \nstressed, from day one, the importance of having quality injected into \nthis bill, and Senator Kennedy. I thank them all for their commitment \nto this effort.\n  I thank the staff who have worked many hours: Andrea Palm, Katy Barr, \nSteve Northrup, and David Bowen, and many others.\n  Mr. President, I do want to at least turn to my colleague to thank \nhim and\n\n[[Page S13272]]\n\nso he can make a few comments because this is truly historic \nlegislation. And although it is mighty early in the morning now--late \nat night or early in the morning--this really is a historic time for \nhealth care and health care delivery.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the leader for his kind comments but \nmuch more so for his diligent work and leadership on this issue. As the \nheart doctor of the Senate, and the doctor with a lot of heart, he \nunderstands the need for health information technology and worked in a \nvery bipartisan way with Senator Clinton to come up with some of the \nprecepts we have in this bill. Senator Kennedy and I were working on \nsome other aspects of it. And we merged those two to come up with a \nmuch more comprehensive health IT bill.\n  This will make a huge difference in the country. A RAND study that \nwas recently released said this will save about $162 billion a year in \nmedical costs. In my opinion, that is not even going to be the biggest \nbenefit. The biggest benefit is that it is going to allow medical data \nto move with the people as they move.\n  When they go to the doctor's office, they will not have to take that \nlittle clipboard and fill out whatever it is they can remember about \ntheir health. And it will not matter because a lot more information \nwill be available to the doctor so he can make the right kinds of \ndecisions and choices.\n  It will also benefit travelers. If a tourist is out on the road and \nhas a wreck and has to see a doctor, they will have their information \nwith them. They will have access to it so the doctor will know what \nmedications they are on, even if they are in a coma, and can make sure \nthey are taken care of properly. And yes, it will reduce medical errors \nand eliminate some adverse reactions from medications or even missed \nmedications.\n  So this will make a huge difference to the people of this country. \nThe difficulty with doing something by unanimous consent is that a lot \nof times people think there is not much to it, or if there wasn't much \ncontroversy, that nothing really happened. But there has been \ncontroversy that has been taken care of behind the scenes, where people \ngot together and actually realized how important this was. So they \nworked together to come up with solutions, and came up with a truly \nbipartisan solution in this instance.\n  So it is almost too bad that it has to go through unanimous consent, \nthat we cannot have some very heated debates on the floor so people \nwill realize the intensity and the interest in the bill.\n  But there is not anything bad about the bill. This was a teamwork \neffort from both sides of the aisle. I appreciate the leader mentioning \na number of the people who were involved in this bill. This is a truly \nmonumental piece of legislation we just passed, and I add the \nencouragement to have the House act on it quickly.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the Senate passage of S. 1418, \nthe Wired for Health Care Quality Act. As chairman of the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions, I have been working to improve \nthe quality and reduce the cost of health care in this Nation.\n  Some of the most serious challenges facing health care today--medical \nerrors, inconsistent quality, and rising costs--can be addressed \nthrough the effective application of available health information \ntechnology linking all elements of the health care system. Information-\nsharing networks have the potential to enable decision support anywhere \nat any time, thus improving the quality of health care and reducing \ncosts.\n  Health IT allows medical data to move with people as they move. When \nthey go to the doctor's office they won't have to take the clipboard \nand write down everything they can remember about themselves. This \nsystem also benefits travelers. If a tourist were to get in a car wreck \nor hurt in some other way, the doctor would be able to find out \neverything he or she needs to know. If in a coma this technology could \nsave a person's life and if they happen to be on medications, it could \nprevent adverse drug reactions. This system could also cut down on \nmedical errors with prescriptions--instead of deciphering the doctor's \nhandwriting, the information could be given to the pharmacist \nelectronically.\n  A RAND study recently released suggested that health IT has the \npotential to save $162 billion a year. In order for these savings to be \nrealized, we must create an infrastructure for interoperability. S. \n1418 is the first step in building that infrastructure.\n  Most folks agree that there are significant barriers to widespread \nadoption of interoperable health information technology. One of the \nprimary barriers is the current lack of agreed-upon standards and \ncommon implementation guides and a certification process. This bill \naddresses those factors in a way that appropriately incorporates \ninvolvement of both the public and private sectors.\n  This legislation brings the government and the private sector \ntogether to make health care better, safer and more efficient by \naccelerating the widespread adoption of interoperable health \ninformation technology and quality measurement across our health care \nsystem. The legislation formalizes involvement of private entities in \nthe standards and policy-setting process by directing the Secretary to \nestablish and chair the public-private American Health Information \nCollaborative, which shall be composed of representatives of the public \nand private sectors. S. 1418 also codifies the Office of the National \nCoordinator for Health Information Technology. President Bush, \nSecretary Leavitt, and Dr. Brailer have done a lot to advance the \nhealth IT infrastructure, and I am glad that Congress is finally \nstepping up to the plate.\n  In order to address the health information technology ``adoption \ngap'' in the United States, S. 1418 authorizes three grant programs \nthat will carefully target financial support to health care providers \nand consortia for the purpose of facilitating the adoption of \ninteroperable health information technology. To maximize the Secretary \nof Health and Human Service's flexibility, the bill leaves to the \ndiscretion of the Secretary the allocation of the authorization among \nthe three programs.\n  In addition, the greatest improvements in quality of health care and \ncost savings will be realized when all elements of the health care \nsystem are electronically connected and speak a common technical \nlanguage--that is they are interoperable. For this reason, each grant \nprogram requires that each grant recipient acquire only qualified \nhealth information technology systems that are capable of supporting \ncommon technical standards adopted by the Federal Government.\n  Another barrier to widespread adoption of interoperable health \ninformation is cultural. I recognize that many physicians and hospitals \nare hesitant to move from paper-based systems to electronic systems. \nSome physicians have been writing prescriptions by hand for many years \nand may resist changing to electronic prescribing. One way to address \nthis cultural barrier to the widespread adoption of health information \ntechnology is to support teaching hospitals and continuing education \nprograms that integrate health information technology in the clinical \neducation of health care professionals. Exposing students and residents \nto effective everyday uses of health IT will lead to a greater adoption \nby these students and residents when they graduate and begin practicing \non their own. The bill authorizes the Secretary to award demonstration \ngrants to health professions centers and academic health centers to \nintegrate health IT into clinical education in community settings.\n  The issue of health IT is also critical for effective response in \npublic health emergencies. Interoperable health IT systems will help to \ntrack infectious disease outbreaks and increase the Federal \nGovernment's rapid response in emergency situations.\n  I thank all of my Senate colleagues for their support of this very \nimportant legislation, which will help facilitate the widespread \nadoption of electronic health records to ultimately result in fewer \nmistakes, lower costs, better care, and greater patient participation \nin their health and well-being. This is a great stride forward in the \njourney to improve our Nation's health care system. I look forward to \nseeing meaningful health information technology legislation signed into \nlaw this Congress.\n\n[[Page S13273]]\n\n  I would like to commend various staff for the hard work they did in \nbringing this bill to fruition. First, I want to recognize my fine \nstaff from the Senate HELP Committee, who have doggedly worked with \nmany interested parties over many months--Stephen Northrup and Katy \nBarr. I would also like to recognize David Bowen from Senator Kennedy's \noffice for his dedication to this legislation. Elizabeth Hall of \nSenator Frist's office did a good job providing leadership support \nthroughout the process. I should also mention Andrea Palm from Senator \nClinton's office and Michelle Spence with Senator Ensign's office for \nensuring that the health care quality provisions stayed strong. \nSecondly, I want to recognize the work of the Senate Finance Committee \nand the complementary bill supporting improvements in health care \nquality in the Medicaid and Medicare programs that has contributed to \nour success today. Mark Hayes and Ted Totman from the Senate Finance \nCommittee were very dedicated to seeing this bill pass. And finally, \nwithout the dedication and patience of Bill Baird of Senate Legislative \nCounsel, we would not have the bill that will pass here today.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today the Senate has passed legislation \nthat can help transform our health care system and save lives. The \nWired for Health Care Quality Act will improve the use of lifesaving \nhealth information technology in hospitals and doctors' offices across \nthe country. In so doing, we will improve the quality of care, lower \nadministrative costs, and reduce medical errors.\n  This legislation is being considered by the Senate because of the \nleadership and commitment of the chairman of our Health Committee, \nSenator Enzi. He made health information technology a priority for our \ncommittee, and he has guided this legislation to the Senate floor. \nSuccessful legislation takes creative thinking and hard work--and \nSenator Enzi has supplied an abundance of both to this measure.\n  I also thank our partners in this legislation, Senator Frist and \nSenator Clinton. As a surgeon, Senator Frist knows firsthand the \nimportance of making sure that doctors have the information they need \nto provide the best possible care for patients--and that they get that \ninformation in time for it to be of value. It is inconceivable that in \nthe 21st century, doctors are asked to treat patients in life or death \nsituations without knowing their medical histories or even the \nmedications they are taking--but that happens every hour of every day \nin hospitals and emergency rooms around the country. Senator Frist has \nbeen tireless in his commitment to correcting this unacceptable \nsituation.\n  Senator Clinton has done an excellent job as well. She has championed \nbetter studies of the comparative effectiveness of medications, she is \ndedicated to improving the quality of care for every patient, and this \nlegislation owes much to her ability and commitment.\n  This legislation is urgently needed, because we live in a new era of \nmedical miracles and rapid changes in medicine.\n  Modern electronics have given doctors implantable pacemakers to save \npatients from sudden cardiac failure.\n  The sequencing of the human genome offers extraordinary opportunities \nfor new cures and better treatments.\n  But there is another medical miracle to add to the list.\n  Modern information technology can transform health care as profoundly \nas any of these discoveries.\n  We have a moral responsibility to make the miracles of modern \nmedicine available to every American--but we have failed to meet that \nresponsibility. Costs are crushing our health care system. Premiums are \ngoing through the roof. The ranks of the uninsured grow every day. \nFamilies are forced to choose between paying the cost of health care or \npaying for food, rent, and college tuition. That is not the American \ndream.\n  Information technology alone can't solve these problems, but it can \nhelp substantially. Electronic medical records. Software to warn if a \ntreatment could harm a patient. Computer prescribing. These and many \nother applications of information technology can save lives and \ndramatically reduce costs.\n  Despite the wonders of modern medicine, too many patients today are \nharmed by preventable mishaps. They waste hours and face new risk when \ntests must be duplicated, because a crucial record is locked in another \narchive. Too many doctors only guess at the right course of treatment, \nbecause they don't know a patient's medical history. Millions of \npatients are needlessly put at risk, and billions of dollars are \nwasted.\n  When so many Americans are already struggling to afford health care \nfor their families, it is profoundly wrong to squander more than half a \ntrillion dollars each year on administrative expenses.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that better use \nof information technology will save $140 billion every year. Such \nsavings would produce a technology dividend worth over $700 on the cost \nof an average family's insurance policy. That is like getting 1 month \nfree every year.\n  Other nations are already using this extraordinary technology to cut \ncosts and save lives--but America lags behind. We can't continue to \nallow the high cost of health care to price American goods and services \nout of the global marketplace.\n  The need to invest in this technology is urgent. In the words of \nSecretary Leavitt, ``Every day that we delay, lives are lost.'' The \ntime to act is now. The bill before us will improve care, save lives \nand make health care more affordable for every American.\n  The need to reduce medical errors is especially urgent. It is already \n6 years since the Institute of Medicine reported that medical errors \ncause 98,000 deaths every year. According to the National Patient \nSafety Foundation, 42 percent of Americans have been affected by a \nmedical error, either personally or through a friend or relative. One \nout of every three of those affected said that the error had a \npermanent negative effect on the patient's health. The exact figures \nmay be the subject of debate, but it is undeniable that preventable \ndeaths occur in our health care system all too often. For even one \npatient to die needlessly in our health care system ought to be \nunacceptable.\n  Our response should be broad based. New technology, new ideas, aud \nnew ways of practicing medicine all have a role in improving the \nquality of care and saving lives. We no longer expect airline pilots to \nnavigate by looking at the stars or local landmarks. Engineers no \nlonger rely on slide rules to design strong buildings. In virtually \nevery field except medicine, professionals use computers to expand \ntheir skills. Yet in medicine, we expect doctors to keep in their heads \nthe possible interactions of the dozens of medications that a patient \nmay be receiving. Under these circumstances, the wonder is not that \nerrors occur, but that they don't occur even more frequently.\n  The evidence that information technology can save lives is \nundeniable. In terms of drug safety alone, a recent analysis by the \nRAND Corporation estimates that by using computerized data, the nation \ncould prevent 2.2 million adverse drug events, and 1 million additional \ndays in the hospital.\n  What we have today, in the words of the Institute of Medicine, is a \n``quality chasm.'' Doctors repeat tests that have already been \nperformed. Residents take medical histories that have already been \ntaken. Patients show up for doctor's appointments that are essentially \na waste of time because the tests have been performed but the results \nhave not yet been delivered.\n  Information technology can help close this gap by improving the \ncoordination of care, providing guidance on the best methods of care \nand reminding busy physicians when it's time to schedule preventive \nscreenings. The Veterans Administration is a national leader in using \nIT to improve quality, and patients get better preventive services \nthere than almost any other patient group in America gets, especially \nin areas such as proper cholesterol screening, eye exams for diabetic \npatients, and proper immunization against pneumonia.\n  Electronic medical records improve the quality of care, and can also \nimprove our ability to monitor drug safety, detect outbreaks of disease \nbefore they become epidemics and decide which treatments are most \neffective for patients.\n  Electronic medical records can be critical in a natural disaster. The \ndevastation of Hurricane Katrina was\n\n[[Page S13274]]\n\ncompounded because most hospitals kept their records on paper. As a \nresult, medical histories of tens of thousands of hurricane survivors \nwere irretrievably lost. It would be inexcusable if we didn't make the \ninvestments needed for the nation to benefit from these innovations.\n  Information technology doesn't simply improve the quality of care--it \nreduces costs as well. According to the Institute of Medicine, each \nprescription error that is prevented saves $4,000 in additional care. \nThis isn't just a theory. Since 1996, when the Veterans Administration \nbegan investing significantly in information technology, its costs per \npatient have actually decreased by 7 percent while private sector costs \nper patient have increased by 62 percent.\n  Excessive administrative costs are weighing down our health care \nsystem. We are spending over $500 billion a year on such costs--nearly \n33 cents out of every health care dollar. These already high costs are \nalso growing 50 percent faster than other health costs. It can cost as \nmuch as $20 to process a single insurance claim using antiquated paper \nrecords--and nearly half the 18 billion insurance claims in America are \nstill settled in this old-fashioned way every year. We know that paper-\nbased records are prone to error. About one in four health insurance \nclaims is initially rejected because of errors. By contrast, in the \nfinancial industry, only 1 in 10,000 ATM transactions has an error.\n\n  Despite clear evidence that health IT saves lives and cuts costs, its \nuse is still scandalously low. Our health care system should be the \nenvy of the world, but nations from Australia to Scandinavia are \noutpacing us in this technology. In Sweden and Holland, nine out of ten \nprimary care physicians use electronic medical records. In Britain, \nAustria, Finland and many other nations, it is over half. But in the \nUnited States, less than a quarter of all doctors use electronic \nmedical records.\n  Obviously, there are significant barriers to the adoption of health \ninformation technology that Congress should also address. Many \nproviders don't have the financial ability to absorb the costs of \nbuying the equipment, making the transition to computer systems, and \ntraining staff. It costs a physician's office $30,000 and significant \naggravation to install the system. The savings from its use tend to \ncome over the longer term, while the costs are immediate, which is a \nmajor financial barrier to hospitals, physicians, and nursing homes \nalready drowning in red ink. Providers get savings over the long run, \nbut the largest share of the savings goes to payers, not providers. If \na diabetic is kept out of the hospital by better management of his \ncondition as the result of information technology, that's a loss of \nrevenue to the hospital.\n  This bipartisan legislation will help overcome these barriers. It \nrequires the development of standards on interoperability and other \ntechnical measures for health information technology, and it \nestablishes a public-private consultation to develop those standards.\n  But standards without Federal resources are not enough to achieve the \ngoal of a modern health care system that we all share. That is why the \nlegislation includes financial assistance to hard pressed providers to \nmeet the technical standards. It provides this assistance in three ways \nin recognizing the fact that different health care providers and \ndifferent communities will have different needs. It authorizes direct \ngrants to needy providers. It authorizes financial assistance to \nestablish regional networks. And it creates an innovative Federal-\nState, public-private partnership to modernize health care by enabling \nstates to fund low interest loans to help health professionals in \nfinancial need to acquire the technology to improve the quality and \nefficiency of health care.\n  Getting the right hardware and software into the hands of doctors is \nonly half the battle. It is also essential to see that doctors have \naccess to the knowledge necessary to make the technology a success. The \nlegislation establishes a Best Practices Center where technology users \ncan learn from the experience of others who have established such \nnetworks. It sets up a Help line at the Department of Health and Human \nServices to answer technical questions and help meet technical \nrequirements. To assist doctors in sorting through the confusing array \nof options for this technology, the legislation establishes a \ncertification program, so that providers can quickly determine whether \nparticular systems meet the applicable technical standards.\n  There are many Senate colleagues who deserve great credit for their \nthoughtful contributions to this legislation and for their leadership \nin getting to this moment.\n  Again, I commend the chairman of our Health Committee, Senator Enzi, \nfor his impressive leadership on this issue. It has been a privilege to \nwork closely with him and his staff since the beginning of this year \nand to deal with this priority.\n  The pending legislation combines the bill that Chairman Enzi and I \nintroduced and the bill that Senator Frist and Senator Clinton \nintroduced. We have also had broad input from many other committee \nmembers, and we have produced a better bill because of it.\n  Senator Dodd was a leader on the issue in the last Congress as well, \nand our bill includes many of his ideas, especially on making sure that \nstandards are widely available.\n  Senator Ensign made sure that best practices are front and center in \nimplementing this technology.\n  Our subcommittee chairman, Senator Burr, has a strong interest in \nusing information technology to improve our ability to respond to \nbioterrorist attacks or other disease emergencies, when lost hours can \nmean countless lost lives.\n  Senator Reed of Rhode Island had the innovative idea of including a \n1-800 number to help providers on technical questions. Senator Harkin \ncontributed important proposals to use the technology to improve the \ntreatment of chronic diseases.\n  Senator Reid of Nevada has shown impressive leadership in making sure \ntechnology improves the lives of American families, and I thank him for \nhis strong support.\n  Senator Snowe and Senator Stabenow have a major commitment to \neffective funding for this technology, and I look forward to working \nwith them on this issue in the days to come. I also commend Senator \nSnowe for her strong commitment to protecting the privacy of electronic \nmedical data.\n  I also commend Steve Northrup and Katy Barr of Senator Enzi's staff, \nAndrea Palm of Senator Clinton's staff, Liz Hall of Senator Frist's \nstaff, and my own health staff, for their effective work on this issue \nfor so many months.\n  I thank these and all our Senate colleagues who contributed to the \nlegislation we consider today. I look forward to working with all of \nyou and with our colleagues in the House to see this needed measure \nsigned into law as soon as possible.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the passage of \n1418, the Wired for Health Care Quality Act. As chairman of the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, I have been \nworking to improve the quality and reduce the cost of health care in \nthis Nation. I commend the ranking member of my committee for his \ndedication to this great cause.\n  I want to commend my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, and my \ncolleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, for their leadership on the \nissue of health information technology. They have made a major \ncontribution to the debate, and I look forward to working with them as \nwe continue to consider this important issue.\n  I see the legislation we consider today as the first step toward more \neffective use of information technology in health care. This proposal \nwill provide the framework to improve the use of health IT. Senator \nSnowe and Senator Stabenow have several thoughtful proposals on \nproviding additional financial incentives through Medicare for the use \nof health information technology.\n  Providing adequate funding for health IT is a critically important \nissue, and I believe that it should be carefully considered in our \ncommittee and by the Senate. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on the committee and with Senator Snowe and Senator Stabenow \nto see that health IT receives an appropriate level of funding.\n\n[[Page S13275]]\n\n  I also believe it is important to examine carefully the privacy \nprotections that apply to individually identifiable health information \nmaintained in electronic databases. The manager's amendment to S. 1418 \ncontains several important provisions relating to privacy, including a \nGAO investigation on methods to enhance privacy protections for \nelectronically stored and transmitted health information.\n  I believe it is important to examine the issues surrounding \nimplementation and adoption of health IT systems carefully. To that \nend, I intend to hold a hearing by the Memorial Day recess next year on \nthe essential issue of funding to promote wide adoption of health \ninformation technology. We will also examine the report of the GAO to \naddress the critical issue of protections for the privacy of health \ninformation that must be part of health IT systems and practices. I \nwill work closely with my colleagues, Senator Snowe and Senator \nStabenow, as well as with the ranking member on this hearing.\n  I will also work with the Finance Committee, the committee with \njurisdiction over Medicare, and with Senators Stabenow and Snowe on \nlegislation to spur the widespread adoption of interoperable health \ninformation technology through such innovative financing mechanisms, \nand we will work to achieve passage of that legislation before the end \nof this Congress.\n  I happen to be an original sponsor of legislation in the Finance \nCommittee to reward high-quality health care through value based \npurchasing under Medicare. By rewarding doctors and hospitals for the \nquality of care they provide, not just the quantity of care, we can \nimprove health care quality in a fiscally responsible way.\n  I look forward to working with Senators Kennedy, Grassley, Baucus, \nSnowe, Stabenow, Frist, and Clinton on these important proposals, and I \ncommend them for their leadership on this important field of health IT.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the distinguished chairman of our Health \nCommittee for his impressive leadership on the issue of health \ninformation technology. Health information technology can revolutionize \nhealth care, with lasting benefits in areas from improving quality to \nbetter detection of bioterrorist attacks and epidemics.\n  I also commend my colleagues, Senator Stabenow and Senator Snowe, for \ntheir commitment to seeing that we provide adequate financial support \nfor doctors and hospitals to use health information technology systems. \nI will work closely with them, and with our chairman and our colleagues \non the health committee, to see that we build on the legislation under \nconsideration today in order to assist health care providers to meet \nthe cost of acquiring health IT.\n  Senator Snowe and Senator Stabenow have made a major contribution to \nour debate, and I look forward to working with them on additional \nproposals on this important issue in the very near future.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I want to commend Senators Enzi, Kennedy, \nFrist, and Clinton for their work in addressing the inadequate state of \nour individual health records today. The Wired for Health Care Quality \nAct will accelerate the development of essential standards to protect \ninvestment in health information technology. Very soon the Federal \nGovernment will require compliance with these standards for its \npurchases--a long overdue step in modernizing health care information \nmanagement.\n  I began work with on this issue in the last Congress when we learned \nfrom the Institute of Medicine that an estimated 98,000 Americans die \neach year as a result of medical errors. Technology can help us prevent \nthese deaths and injuries from medical mistakes. That is one reason I \njoined with Senator Stabenow to assure that we implement live saving \ntechnology.\n  A second reason for our work is that information technology, IT, will \nhelp us reduce the cost of health care. As health care costs increase \nfar more rapidly than inflation, care becomes less affordable and the \nranks of the uninsured grow. Each of us appreciates that technology \nwill help us reduce that unsustainable trend. Recent reports \ndemonstrate that the cost of implementing health IT is exceeded by a \nsingle year of savings. That is a remarkable return on investment, but \nsince an estimated 89 percent of savings accrues to payers, not \nproviders, standards alone will not spur adoption.\n\n  Since the rewards for adoption primarily accrue to payers and \npatients, it is wholly appropriate that payers--including the Federal \nGovernment--act in their best interest to reduce costs. That means we \nmust ensure adoption not just by those providers for whom investment is \nrelatively easy, but by those with lesser resources, such as the many \nwho provide care for our Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP beneficiaries. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to see that we implement \nfinancing--including grants and tax incentives--to allow all providers \nto adopt this promising technology. Otherwise we will see a two-tiered \nsystem develop.\n  If some patients do not receive the benefits of the electronic health \nrecord the President has set as a goal, their care will suffer. In \nfact, if their providers cannot adopt technology, their clinical data \nmay not be not properly integrated in pay-for-performance \nmethodologies. If the resulting criteria don't account for such \npatients, they then pose the risk of inadequate compensation to \nproviders, and many may decline to serve them. So it is critical that \nwe assure all providers can adopt health IT.\n  I thank Chairman Enzi and the Senator Kennedy for their commitment to \na hearing next spring on the adoption and financing issue. I also thank \nthe majority leader for his assistance. The issue of adoption certainly \nmultiple committees, and we appreciate his efforts in helping the full \nSenate to consider promising financing proposals to assure broad \nadoption.\n  As we move forward together, we should also remember to follow the \nphysician's adage--certainly one the leader knows so well--to ``first \ndo no harm''. We are all agreed that genetic information, which may \nindicate probability of disease, must be protected. One's medical \nrecord includes even more than probability--it is indisputable evidence \nof the presence of disease, the drugs one uses, your full physical and \nmental health history. Consequently, Americans are worried about their \nhealth records. A recent survey demonstrates that two-thirds of all \nconsumers have substantial concerns about the privacy of their medical \nrecords. The same proportion say that recent reports of privacy \nbreaches have actually increased these concerns. So it comes as no \nsurprise that consumers engage in behaviors to avoid such data from \neven being created--such as paying out-of-pocket for medical expenses, \nusing a different physician on occasion, or simply asking that vital \ninformation not be included in their chart. Patients even forgo \ntreatment altogether in fear of disclosure. This compromises health, so \nwe simply must provide Americans with confidence in the security of \ntheir health record.\n  We simply must have the highest levels of data security. So first we \nmust see procedures established to assure that inappropriate disclosure \ndoes not occur. Next, if a data breach does occur, the patient must be \ninformed. To do otherwise is unconscionable.\n  I am pleased to see that the managers amendment requires such \nnotification for those handling data under the programs established by \nthis legislation, and the bill also establishes a process to address \nconcerns on medical data privacy by directing a GAO study to guide us \nin providing the assurance all Americans must have that their medical \ndata is protected. I thank my colleagues for including these essential \nprovisions.\n  Today marks the beginning of a process to offer all Americans a \nsafer, more affordable system of health care. I look forward with \nSenator Stabenow to working with the majority leader and Senators Enzi, \nKennedy, and Clinton, as well as Senators Grassley and Baucus, as we \nmove forward to realizing the full potential of health IT become \nreality for our constituents. The rewards in lives and dollars saved \ncompels us to act promptly.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I want to commend the leadership of \nSenators Enzi, Kennedy, Frist, and Clinton in this critically important \narena. Their diligent work in introducing and passing S. 1418 \nestablishes the groundwork necessary to begin to realize the promises \nof health information technology, IT.\n\n[[Page S13276]]\n\n  The evidence showing the ability of health IT to reduce costs and \nimprove quality of care is simply overwhelming. Dr. David Brailer's \noffice attributes savings from widespread adoption of electronic health \nrecords in the range of 7.5 percent to 30 percent of annual health care \nspending that is between $135 and $540 billion annually.\n  Manufacturers in Michigan and across the country are struggling to \nremain competitive in a global market with skyrocketing health care \ncosts. Health IT can, and should, play a key role in managing these \ncosts.\n  Equally compelling is the promise health IT holds for improving the \nquality of our health care system by ensuring that patients get the \ncare they need, at the right time, and in the best setting.\n  To realize these promises, however, Congress must enact legislation \nproviding meaningful resources through Federal financial incentives, \nboth mandatory grants and tax incentives, to physicians, hospitals, \nskilled nursing facilities, and community health and mental health \ncenters for health information technology.\n  Health care providers are struggling to keep up with their daily \nneeds at the same time they are anticipating cuts in their rates. A \nmajor barrier to widespread use of IT is the initial investment cost: \nthe costs of procuring and implementing health IT can be staggering.\n  Every day we delay providing Federal seed money through a grant \nprogram and accelerated depreciation of health information technology \nexpenses, we delay getting health information technology systems in \nplace, and businesses, taxpayers and patients pay in both dollars and \nlives.\n  I appreciate the majority leader's commitment to encourage the \nchairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee and the chairman \nand ranking member of the HELP Committee to schedule, at the earliest \nopportunity, consideration of legislative proposals to ensure federal \nfunding to accelerate adoption of health IT.\n  A meaning Federal investment must be robust, funded with mandatory, \nrather than discretionary, dollars, and available to individual \nproviders and health care systems.\n  This is not the place to skimp on dollars; we know every dollar we \nspend will come back to us many times over. Federal investments, \nthrough grants and tax incentives, in health information technology \nwill result in lower Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP spending, reduced \nmedical errors, and greater quality and efficiency in our health care \nsystem. We must provide a level of funding that will allow a \nsignificant percentage of our health care providers to adopt and use \nhealth IT systems. Additionally, funding must not be limited to \nauthorizations of appropriations. We must actually provide the dollars \nneeded to begin realizing the benefits of health IT.\n  Nor should we limit funds to providers in networks. We should work \ntowards a system where all health care providers are linked, but we do \nnot need to wait for those networks to be formed to see the benefits of \nhealth IT. Standalone e-prescribing systems could reduce medication \nerrors by 50 percent; there is no reason to delay the quality, safety, \nand financial savings possible through immediate health IT adoption by \nindividual providers.\n  In addition to funding, we must pay careful attention to privacy and \nconfidentiality rights and concerns. A patient's right to health \ninformation privacy is paramount, and an essential component of the \nhealth care provider-patient relationship. According to a survey \nrecently released by the California HealthCare Foundation, CHCF, 67 \npercent of Americans remain concerned about the privacy of their \npersonal health information. The survey also reports that many \nconsumers may be putting their health at risk by avoiding their regular \ndoctor or forgoing needed tests over privacy concerns. Apprehension \nover privacy and confidentiality, if not addressed thoughtfully, could \npose enormous barriers to the savings and health care improvements \npossible through adoption of health information technologies. Strong, \nenforceable privacy safeguards based on a patient's right to health \ninformation privacy are absolutely critical as we move towards a \nnationwide, interoperable electronic health care system.\n  I appreciate provisions included in the managers' amendment \naddressing the need for patients to be notified if their individually \nidentifiable health information is wrongfully disclosed and a study by \nthe General Accounting Office examining the issue as it relates to all \nAmericans.\n  I look forward to working with the majority leader, and Senators \nSnowe, Enzi, Kennedy, and Clinton, as well as Senator Grassley and \nBaucus to ensure passage of legislation this Congress providing \nmeaningful, substantial Federal financial incentives to accelerate \nadoption of life and dollar saving health information technologies.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak in support of S. \n1418. I share an important goal with Senators Enzi, Kennedy, Snowe, \nStabenow, and Clinton--to improve health care quality and reduce costs \nthrough the use of health information technology tools.\n  I spent 20 years as a physician and heart surgeon before coming to \nthe Senate. Like most physicians, I wanted the latest and best medical \ntechnology, anything that could make my patients healthier or more \ncomfortable, while reducing health care costs and increasing \nefficiency.\n  But amidst the artificial heart assist devices, lasers, CT Scan \nmachines, endoscopic devices, digital X-Rays, and digital thermometers, \ndoctors today keep patient records the same way I did and the way my \nfather did 50 years ago: on paper, in manila folders in file cabinets, \nin the basements of clinics and hospitals. Yet computers, and computer \ntechnology, is everywhere, both inside and outside the hospitals and \nclinics. From bedside monitors to massive MRI machines, computers power \nalmost all of the diagnostic devices we rely on.\n  S. 1418 represents an important and crucial first step towards \nrecognizing the importance of computers and the electronic medical \nrecord in contemporary health care. Establishing interoperability of \nthe electronic medical record, an essential hurdle towards effective \nuse of health information technology, is a priority. Proposals for \nproviding Federal financial incentives for physicians, community health \ncenters, community mental health centers, hospitals and skilled nursing \nfacilities like that introduced by Senator Snowe and Senator Stabenow \nneed to be considered.\n  Assuring proper funding of health IT is an issue of major importance \nfor the Senate to consider in the coming congressional session. I will \nwork with the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee and \nthe chairman and ranking member of the HELP committee as well as \nSenators Snowe and Stabenow to encourage these committees to schedule, \nat the earliest opportunity, consideration of legislative proposals to \nensure creative and reasonable Federal funding for such an important \nand relevant mission. I will also work with relevant committees to \nencourage consideration of legislation that would enable providers to \nconnect to a secure, interoperable network for the electronic exchange \nof health information.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I would like to commend Chairman Enzi and Senator \nKennedy for all of their work on this legislation. I would also like to \nrecognize the commitment and leadership of the majority leader, who I \nhave been working closely with on this issue. Today's passage of S. \n1418, the Wired for Health Care Quality Act, is a fundamental first \nstep in establishing a nationwide, interoperable health IT \ninfrastructure.\n  Our legislation provides the framework and authorizes several grant \nprograms to begin the process of funding health IT projects that are \ncompliant with the framework established in the bill. The legislation \nintroduced by Senators Snowe and Stabenow and their work more broadly \non this issue will be critical as we work on additional financing \nmechanisms. I am anxious to begin that work and am committed to working \nclosely with them, and my colleagues on the HELP and Finance committees \nto ensure that physicians and hospitals are able to afford to \nparticipate in a 21st century health care system.\n  Mr. ENZI. I see this bill as the first step of many in improving the \nhealth care in the United States. I look forward to working with my \nfriends on the Finance Committee as well as\n\n[[Page S13277]]\n\nworking with Senators Snowe and Stabenow to look at creative financing \nmechanisms to help doctors and hospitals go on line.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in closing our comments on this bill, I \nalso thank my staff who have been shepherding this for me for the last \n3 years, Liz Hall, Jennifer Romans, and many others. The real \nsignificance is that patient care will be improved. It will get the \nwaste and abuse out of the system. It makes the health care system more \nefficient. I am excited about it. Having interoperable standards that \npeople begin to agree with means you will have an influx of private \ncapital which will help with the spreading of this information \ntechnology infrastructure over time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/17/senate-section/article/S13277-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13277-S13282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE EXTENSION ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 467, the \nTerrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005, introduced by my \ncolleagues on the Banking Committee, Senators Dodd and Bennett and \nreported out unanimously by the Banking Committee.\n  In the wake of the events of September 11, Congress passed the \nTerrorism Risk Insurance Act, also known as ``TRIA.'' The law was \nintended to ensure the continued availability and affordability of \nproperty and casualty insurance for terrorism risk, and to provide for \na transitional period to allow private markets to stabilize.\n  At this point in time, it seems that this program has largely \nachieved both of its stated objectives. Over the last 3 years, the \nproperty and casualty insurance market has rebounded and is now far \nmore profitable and competitive. Indeed, despite the enormous losses \nincurred as a result of the hurricanes, insurer capital has grown \ntremendously and now greatly exceeds pre-September 11 levels.\n  While the private insurance markets have made tremendous strides \nduring the course of the TRIA program, however, the private insurance \nmarketplace has not yet entirely stabilized.\n  As a result, without some form of backstop, it is very likely that \nthere would be gaps in some terrorism insurance coverage.\n  S. 467 extends the TRIA program and addresses this market \ndysfunction. Additionally and importantly, it also recognizes the \npositive developments in the insurance markets and contains reforms to \nthe original law intended to require more private sector responsibility \nand to facilitate further recovery in the insurance markets. It strikes \nthe proper balance between ensuring that terrorism insurance remains \navailable and affordable, while also protecting the American taxpayer.\n  I note that I did not support enactment of TRIA when it was first \nconsidered 4 years ago. My reservations were based on concerns about \nthe Government intruding into private markets. While my concerns are \nnot entirely diminished, I believe that the Banking Committee has \nproduced a responsible, targeted product that will help the marketplace \nsmoothly transition to efficient function.\n  This bill, this bipartisan compromise package, could never have been \nachieved without the cooperation and commitment of the members of the \nBanking Committee. Specifically, I commend Senators Dodd and Bennett, \nthe original cosponsors of this bill, for their leadership, their \neffort and their willingness to work together. I also thank Senator \nSarbanes, who, in his usual manner, was extremely helpful to achieving \nthis result.\n  Additionally, I thank the various staffers whose hard work behind the \nscenes helped get this bill done. Particularly, I want to commend the \nefforts of Alex Sternhell from Senator Dodd's staff, Sarah Kline and \nSteve Harris from Senator Sarbanes's staff, Mike Nielsen from Senator \nBennett's staff, and Jim Johnson, Andrew Olmem, Mark Oesterle and Kathy \nCasey from my staff.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in support of the \nTerrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005. Three years ago, we \npassed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act to stabilize the insurance \nmarketplace after the shock of the September 11 attacks. TRIA, as that \nAct became known, established a partnership between the insurance \nindustry and the Federal Government to share the risk of significant \nlosses from terrorism. TRIA is scheduled to expire at the end of this \nyear. The bill that is now pending before the Senate would extend TRIA \nfor an additional 2 years while requiring the insurance industry to \ntake on progressively more of the terrorism risk.\n\n[[Page S13279]]\n\n  This bill is the product of a great deal of effort by the Banking \nCommittee to accommodate the widely differing views of many members on \nthe structure of a TRIA extension. I thank the chairman of the \nCommittee, Senator Shelby, for his willingness to reach across the \naisle in developing this bill. Under his skillful guidance, we have \nbeen able to develop a product that has won unanimous support in the \nBanking Committee. I also want to recognize Senator Dodd for his \ndedication to this issue. He was instrumental in 2002 in the \ndevelopment and passage of the original TRIA legislation, and he has \nbeen a strong and effective leader this year as well.\n  The original TRIA was designed to address the adverse impact on the \nterrorism insurance marketplace of the sudden lack of terrorism \nreinsurance after the September 11 attacks. Reinsurance is a mechanism \nby which insurance companies spread their own risks, allowing them to \nwrite more policies. Without it, insurers' capacity to offer coverage \nfor losses due to terrorism shrank considerably. By all accounts, the \nFederal backstop provided by TRIA achieved its goal of making terrorism \ninsurance coverage available and affordable once again. The Treasury \nDepartment reported this summer, ``TRIA was effective in terms of the \npurposes it was designed to achieve. TRIA provided a transitional \nperiod during which insurers had enhanced financial capacity to write \nterrorism risk insurance coverage. . . . More generally, TRIA provided \nan adjustment period allowing both insurers and policyholders to adjust \nto the post-September 11th view of terrorism risk.''\n  As discussions began over a possible extension of TRIA, it became \nclear that there are serious disagreements as to what would be the most \nefficient, effective, and equitable way to assure the continued \navailability of terrorism insurance. A number of studies have concluded \nthat the reinsurance market has not rebounded to any great extent since \nthe attacks of 2001. These studies conclude that if the backstop \nprovided by the Federal Government does not continue, insurers will \nwrite fewer terrorism policies or charge much higher prices for them, \ncreating a drag on our nation's economy and leaving companies uninsured \nagainst a terrorist attack. On the other hand, the administration and \nothers argue that the insurance industry is now better prepared to \nhandle the risk of terrorism than it was three years ago, and that any \nextension of TRIA should therefore be significantly narrower than the \ncurrent program to avoid crowding out additional private sector \nactivity.\n  These are issues that deserve careful analysis, which is why this \nextension bill contains a requirement for a study by the President's \nWorking Group on Financial Markets on the long-term availability and \naffordability of terrorism risk insurance. I hope that this requirement \nwill result in a thorough examination of the issues which will help us \nanswer the question of how to insure against terrorism over the \nlongterm.\n  To allow time for that examination to take place, the pending \nlegislation continues the TRIA program for two additional years, with \ncertain modifications, which I will briefly summarize.\n  This bill narrows the scope of the TRIA program, further targeting \nthe program toward the types of terrorism insurance that are the most \ndifficult to provide. Under the terms of the extension, the Federal \nbackstop will no longer be available for insurance policies covering \ncommercial automobiles, professional liability, burglary and theft, \nfarmowners' multiple peril, and surety.\n  Just as the original TRIA did, this exteusion places more of the risk \non the insurance industry, and correspondingly less on the federal \ngovernment, in each year. For example, in 2005, under the current \nprogram, the amount of terrorism losses that an insurer must cover \nbefore Federal assistance becomes available is 15 percent of the \npremiums collected by that insurer in lines covered by the TRIA \nprogram. Under this extension, this ``insurance company deductible'' \nwill rise to 17.5 percent of premiums in 2006, and 20 percent of \npremiums in 2007. Moreover, the amount that insurers must pay above \ntheir deductible also increases, rising from 10 percent of losses in \n2006, to 15 percent of losses in 2007.\n  In addition to the individual insurance companies' deductible, tbe \ninsurance industry as a whole must cover a certain amount of losses \nbefore federal assistance becomes available. In 2005, the last year of \nthe current TRIA program, that amount is $15 billion. Under this \nlegislation, that will rise to $17.5 billion in 2006, and $20 billion \nin 2007.\n  Also, starting in 2006, no Federal assistance will be available at \nall under tbe program for a terrorist attack in which total losses do \nnot exceed $50 million, a level which rises to $100 million in 2007.\n  Finally, I want to emphasize that the extension retains a critically \nimportant piece of the current TRIA program: the requirement that \ninsurers make terrorism coverage available to policyholders in all of \nthe lines covered by TRIA.\n  These provisions follow the framework of the existing TRIA program, \nkeeping the Federal backstop in place so that insurers will continue \nwriting terrorism policies, while placing progressively more of the \ncosts onto the industry itself. I want to take just a moment to \nacknowledge the hard work that the staff has put into this bill, \nparticularly Sarah Kline from my Banking Committee staff, Alex \nSternhell with Senator Dodd, Kathy Casey and Mark Oesterle with \nChairman Shelby, and Mike Nielson with Senator Bennett. As with any \ncompromise product, no one would say that the legislation is perfect. \nBut it is a serious effort to address the concerns we have heard raised \nregarding TRIA and the potential effects of its expiration, and I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate Banking Committee \nreported the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005, and I look \nforward to the full Senate passing this legislation that is so vital to \nthe economic well-being of this country.\n  In 2002 I cosponsored, and Congress passed, the Terrorism Risk \nInsurance Act, commonly referred to as TRIA. This important legislation \nprovided a Government backstop for the terrorism insurance market that \ndisappeared after the attacks of September 11.\n  The primary purpose behind TRIA, and the reason it needs to be \nextended, is to make sure that the American economy and markets \nfunction in the face of a terrorist threat. September 11 proved that \nthere needs to be a mechanism in place to allow the economy to rebound \nmore quickly and to protect American jobs in the unfortunate event of \nanother terrorist attack here in the United States. Since it became \nlaw, TRIA has proven to be an effective program that has made terrorism \nrisk insurance available and provided businesses meaningful access to \ncoverage in a post-9/11 world.\n  TRIA is a temporary program set to expire at the end of this year, \nwhich created significant uncertainty in the terrorism insurance market \nand threatened to stall construction and building projects across the \ncountry. Most lenders who finance these projects require borrowers to \nhave terrorism risk coverage, but in the face of TRIA's looming \nexpiration, that coverage became more difficult and expensive to get, \nmaking those projects infeasible. Recognizing these problems early in \nthe year, Senator Dodd and Senator Bennett drafted TRIA extension \nlegislation, which I cosponsored.\n  Mr. President, although slightly different from the bill that Senator \nDodd introduced earlier this Congress, and that I and other Democrats \ncosponsored, the legislation that passed out of the committee yesterday \nessentially maintains the structure of TRIA and extends the program \nthrough the end of 2007. I am disappointed that group life insurance \nwill not be covered under the program and that other lines originally \ncovered have been excluded. But my colleagues, Senators Dodd, Sarbanes, \nShelby, and Bennett, worked closely with others on the Banking \nCommittee to construct a product that all of us in the Senate should be \nable to support. I am hopeful the Senate action on this bill today will \nbreak the logjam over this legislation so it can be signed into law \nbefore the Congress adjourns this year.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr President, I rise to lend my strong support for S. 467, \nthe Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension\n\n[[Page S13280]]\n\nAct of 2005, which I originally introduced with Senator Bennett and 34 \ncosponsors earlier this year. Our legislation was amended in committee \nwith the hard work and leadership of Banking Committee Chairman Shelby \nand Ranking Member Sarbanes to develop the product before the Senate \ntoday.\n  I would like to commend the members on the Banking Committee: \nSenators Johnson, Reed, Schumer, Bayh, Carper, Stabenow, Corzine, \nHagel, Bunning, and Dole as well as the other cosponsors of the \nlegislation for recognizing--very early on--how important extending the \nTerrorism Risk Insurance Act, TRIA, was to our Nation's economy and for \ntheir efforts on this legislation.\n  I would especially like to commend Chairman Shelby for his work on \nthis legislation. This is not the bill I would have written, nor is it \nthe bill that he would have written. For example, it was my hope that \nwe could have included group life as a covered line in this \nlegislation. However, I am acutely aware that the chairman has had \nconcerns about the TRIA program and what the role of the Federal \nGovernment should be in this area--and I would like to thank him and \nhis staff for helping to craft a compromise that not only adheres to \nhis principles but also satisfies the concerns of so many Members of \nthis body who believe it is imperative to pass an extension of TRIA.\n  Like many bills, this legislation is a document of compromise. We \nhave carefully taken into consideration the recommendations of \npolicyholders, insurers, consumers, academics, think-tanks, the \nTreasury Department and others to craft this important extension \nlegislation.\n  And I think that this product is very good one.\n  Let me take a few brief moments to provide my colleagues with a \nlittle background on TRIA and why it needs to be extended today.\n  As a result of the tragic terrorist acts of 9/11, we repeatedly heard \nfrom businesses, large and small, from labor unions and manufacturers, \nfrom hospitals to hotels, from professional sports teams to utility \ncompanies, from insurers and the insured about the need for the Federal \nGovernment to act to help them receive financial protection from future \nterrorist attacks.\n  Congress listened, and we acted--creating the Terrorism Risk \nInsurance Act--TRIA.\n  In November 2002, TRIA was passed by both the House and Senate by \nsignificant margins and was signed into law. It created 3-year program \nestablishing a Federal backstop against catastrophic losses in the \nproperty and casualty insurance marketplace.\n  And we heard an overwhelming response from policyholders across the \ncountry--TRIA has worked. It has achieved its primary goal--continued \navailability and affordability of insurance against future terrorist \nattacks.\n  Industries as diverse as commercial real estate, shipping, \nconstruction, manufacturing, and even ``mom and pop'' retailers require \ninsurance to obtain credit, loans, and investments necessary for their \nnormal business operations. TRIA was designed to do just that--restore \n``business as usual'' in every State across our Nation.\n  I believe that the greatest indicator of the success of TRIA is what \nwe have not heard over the past 3 years since the enactment of TRIA \npublic outcry from businesses and workers whose livelihoods are \nthreatened by their inability to purchase coverage against acts of \nterror.\n  Construction projects are no longer stalled, mortgages are no longer \nin doubt, and jobs are no longer in jeopardy as a result of the \ninability to receive terrorism insurance.\n  Insurance isn't something we think about every day, yet it is vital \nto the overall health of our economy. By protecting people and \nproperty, goods and services in every sector of America's $10 trillion-\nplus economy, insurance provides the stability and certainty required \nto keep our economic engine humming. Every prospective homeowner needs \ninsurance to obtain a mortgage from a bank. Insurance of all types is a \ncritical component of our capital markets.\n  Not only has TRIA been effective in ensuring that terrorism is \navailable and affordable, and that our economy remains vibrant, it is \nalso an incredibly important taxpayer protection law. With relatively \nlittle money necessary to fund the administration of the TRIA program, \nwe have ensured that insurers and policyholders take the first $30 to \n$40 billion of losses of a potential terrorist attack.\n  According to a recent study conducted by the RAND Institute, ``Based \non our analysis (of TRIA), the role of taxpayers is expected to be \nminimal, unless there is are several large events in a single year.''\n  TRIA has essentially provided that in the unfortunate event of a \nfuture terrorist attack a $30 to $40 billion check is written to U.S. \ntaxpayers. TRIA has not only worked to help provide available and \naffordable terrorism risk insurance, it has also protected our Nation's \ntaxpayers.\n  With the expiration of TRIA in less than 45 days, and this session \nnear completion, it is essential that Congress extend TRIA immediately.\n  I would like to bring to your attention a letter from 28 Governors \nacross the Nation urging us to extend the TRIA program.\n  There is one provision in this legislation that I believe is an \nimportant component--the mandate for the President's Working Group--our \nNation's Federal financial regulators--to do an analysis of the long-\nterm availability and affordability of terrorism risk insurance.\n  This legislation provides for a 2-year extension of TRIA--and in \nthese next 2 years we need to find a long-term solution to this issue. \nIt may be determined that this is an unwritable risk for the private \nsector, and that a continued Federal role is needed or we may find that \ninsurers are able to return to underwriting this risk without a Federal \nbackstop. But we need to start work on developing this information and \npotential solutions as soon as possible.\n  Since the enactment of TRIA, our Nation has been fortunate enough not \nto suffer the tremendous loss of life or destruction of property that \nwe endured on September 11, 2001. But by no means has the political \nclimate, either domestically or abroad, returned to a sense of \nnormalcy. We are engaged in a violent conflict in Iraq and we have seen \ndespicable terrorist attacks abroad in Europe and elsewhere.\n  We have heard repeated dire warnings that terrorism will return to \nU.S. soil. We must be prepared against this threat. Providing insurance \nagainst terrorist attacks, which allows our economy to function, is a \ncritical part of our preparedness.\n  But we cannot fail to extend TRIA. We cannot afford--and we should do \neverything in our power to avoid--restoring the tremendous uncertainty \nand instability to businesses and workers and our economy as a whole.\n  The enactment of this legislation will ensure that our Nation and its \neconomy are best prepared to deal with a future terrorist attack. I \nurge the my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the Senate is undertaking a long awaited \ndebate on S. 467, Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005. This \nbill extends the important program that allows for the Federal \nGovernment to share the risk of loss from future terrorist attacks with \nthe insurance industry for 2 more years, to 2007.\n  As we all know, terrorism remains a clear and present danger. The \nneed for terrorism insurance is real, pressing, and a long-term issue. \nIn the post-9/11 world, it is important to keep the existing TRIA \nprogram in place, while continuing to work with the private sector--\nboth policyholders and insurers--to craft a longer term program that \naddresses all the needs of policyholders.\n  I want to particularly commend Minority Leader Reid, Chairman Shelby, \nSenators Sarbanes, Dodd, Bennett, and their staffs for their tireless \nefforts in bringing this issue to the forefront of the Senate's \nlegislative agenda.\n  The need for terrorism insurance coverage has been widely established \nas an economic issue, rather than just simply an insurance issue. In \nthe past year, we have heard that many American businesses--\npolicyholders--are already receiving exclusion notices from insurers \ninforming them that they will not be covered on policies beyond TRIA's \nsunset date. As a result, there has been increasing uncertainty about \nthe availability of adequate terrorism\n\n[[Page S13281]]\n\ncoverage beyond 2005. Clearly, a Federal backstop is vital to ensuring \nthe ongoing availability of terrorism risk coverage.\n  The other key reason to act on this issue is the fact that should \nanother catastrophic event occur, the Federal Government will likely be \non the hook for the total amount of the damage.\n  An important aspect of this debate is making certain that terrorism \ninsurance coverage is available in the workers' compensation market. \nWorkers' compensation is unique insurance coverage in that law requires \nthat it cover acts of terrorism and war. For close to a century now, \nworkers' compensation has been a safety net available to all workers \nand their families, replacing lost wages, and paying for medical needs \nand death benefits regardless of the cause of the workplace injury or \ndeath. A strong workers' compensation system is integral to helping \nvictims and their families rebuild their lives.\n  In my State of Rhode Island, the burden of providing workers' \ncompensation falls to one mutual insurance compan, Beacon Mutual, which \nwas created by the State to ensure that there will always be workers' \ncompensation available to companies in the State. With less \navailability of reinsurance, the concern for one company conceivably \nunderwriting the entire market for workers' compensation was \nsignificant and would have created a very tenuous situation for the \ncompany, the State, and its residents. Extending TRIA will address the \nvarious problems that employers, insurance companies, and State workers \ncompensation pools alike have had to endure in the absence of a Federal \nbackstop.\n  I would note, however, that although S. 467 is an improvement on the \nadministration's proposal for the trigger for a terrorist incident--$50 \nmillion in the first year of the extension and $100 million in the \nlast, down from $500 million, I remain concerned that because of the \nconcentration of risk and their small capitalization, a higher trigger \nlevel for State fund companies put these funds uniquely at risk. A \nnumber of terrorist targets could create a result where workers' \ncompensation losses could exceed property losses, but still not reach \nthe proposed higher trigger. As we move towards finding a long-term \nsolution to terrorism insurance coverage, I hope we can work to better \naddress this issue.\n  There remains a great need to do something because, as it has been \nstated very plainly during this debate, the situation without a Federal \nterrorism risk insurance program could be very dire. Extending TRIA is \nabsolutely the right thing to do to protect the economic security of \nour country. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I look \nforward to its speedy adoption and signature into law.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my unwavering \nsupport for S. 467, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005, \nintroduced by my friend, Senator Dodd of Connecticut.\n  I would like to commend Senators Dodd, Bennett, Shelby and Sarbanes \nfor getting a bill done that we can all stand here and be proud to \nsupport. A bill that is good for this country and good for the State of \nNew York.\n  We still live in America, and particularly in my city of New York, in \nthe shadow of 9/11, of the terrorism that occurred. Obviously, the \nthousands of families who have had a loved one taken from their midst \nlive with it every moment of their remaining lives, but the rest of us \nlive with it, too, not only in empathy for them but also in terms of \nthe economic consequences of terrorism.\n  The bottom line is very simple, and that is, because of terrorism, \nthe insurance industry, in terms of insuring risk of large structures \nin America--whether it be large buildings that make us so proud of the \nManhattan skyline or large arenas such as the football stadiums that \ndot America or larger facilities such as Disneyland, Disney World, and \namusement parks--all have difficulty getting insurance.\n  Insurers are worried that if, God forbid, another terrorist act \noccurs, it will be so devastating that it will put them out of \nbusiness.\n  So 2 years ago, the Senate, House, and the President got together at \nsort of the end of the day, just like today, and passed terrorism risk \ninsurance.\n  It has been a large success. That, no one can dispute.\n  Insurance rates have come down, terrorism insurance is available, and \ninsurance companies know, if, God forbid, the worst happens, there will \nbe a backstop, and they are willing to issue policies.\n  In turn, that meant developers, builders who wanted to build new \nlarge structures in America, did so, employing thousands and thousands \nof people, creating profits and new businesses as well.\n  Well, today we are all here to do the right thing. Yesterday, the \nBanking Committee, of which I am member, passed unanimously a bill to \nextend the TRIA. In this bill, we have kept the trigger levels \nmanageable for the policyholder community. We kept the retention levels \nat a responsible level for the private market, retaining the public/\nprivate nature of the program.\n  The bottom line is that we have made some necessary modifications to \nthe program without losing the major protections. We did not all agree \nwhat should have been in the bill. Many of us felt strongly about \nincluding group life and protections against nuclear, biological, \nchemical and radiological attacks. But the beauty of the process is \nthat it is a negotiation where we all give and take.\n\n  This bill is a good compromise.\n  The continuation of this program is vital to our Nation's economic \nstability. By passing this bill on the floor today, we will be sending \na message to the world that our financial markets will be protected, \nthat our country will be able to bounce back in the event of any \ndisruptions or financial dislocation caused by another possible \nterrorist attack.\n  It is still my strong belief that there needs to be a long-term \nsolution--a permanent program. The President has continued to say that \nwe are fighting a war on terrorism.\n  The bombing in Jordan last week, the London bombings this past July, \nand the recent threat to the New York subway system are a few examples \nof why we must continue fighting this war on terrorism.\n  So it would have been my preference to get a bill that extended \nbeyond 2 years. But I am at least pleased to know that there was a \nserious effort to address this concern by including a provision to \ncreate a commission that would begin to analyze the long-term \navailability and affordability of insurance for terrorism risk.\n  I would particularly like to thank Chairman Dodd and Shelby for \nspecifically including the language I requested which directs the \nPresident's working group to analyze the long-term affordability and \navailability of coverage for chemical, nuclear, biological, and \nradiological events.\n  This is an issue of great importance to many New Yorkers. Many \nretailers and business owners in Lower Manhattan are afraid of a \npossible dirty bombs attack and the availability of insurance for such \nan event. This must be addressed and right away.\n  The bottom line is that financial dislocation caused by another \npossible terrorist attack--God forbid--is too much for our country to \nrisk. I urge the entire Senate to pass this legislation today. It is \nonly right that we let the markets, let the insurance world, and, most \nof all, let jobs and construction go forth.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, very briefly, I want to comment on this \nbill as well. This is the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of \n2005. We are doing this by unanimous consent which reflects a \ntremendous amount of work by a range of Senators over the course of the \nlast several months, weeks, days, and especially over the last few \nhours. This is a bill that has been subjected to a lot of debate, and \nthat debate has culminated in a lot of agreement. I appreciate the \ngreat work of Senator Shelby, Senator Dodd, and so many others. The \nHouse hopefully will act on terrorism risk insurance shortly. It is a \nvery important bill to our economy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment at the desk be agreed to; \nthe committee reported amendment, as amended, be agreed to; the bill, \nas amended, be read a third time and passed; the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table; and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S13282]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Therefore, additional votes may occur and will \noccur, and we will try to clarify Friday's schedule as early as \npossible.\n  I remind everyone that a weekend session is expected and Senators \nshould remain available Friday and Saturday and beyond until we finish \nour remaining work. I will have to say, starting now about 3 weeks ago \nwe set out a very aggressive agenda, and to date we have stayed right \non target to accomplish that agenda. The House is in session right now \nand is voting actually right now, and I understand they will be \nconducting more business tonight and in the morning that we will have \nto act on after they act on much of the legislation they are \nconsidering. So it will be a full day tomorrow. I expect to have a \nnumber of votes over the course of tomorrow. And again, as we have said \nfor the last 3 weeks, it will be important for our colleagues to keep \ntheir schedules flexible through tomorrow and Saturday, Sunday, and \npossibly beyond that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/17/senate-section/article/S13282-6", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
