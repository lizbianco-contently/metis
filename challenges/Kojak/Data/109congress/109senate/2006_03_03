Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I know we will not be in very long today. \nAs a matter of fact, I am going to Wyoming in a little bit. There are \nsome things I have wanted to talk about for some time, and since we \nhave some time this morning, I thought I might take a few minutes to \ntalk a bit about energy.\n  We, of course, have been on a number of other things, and \nunfortunately taking a long time to do them. But I hope we get back to \nthose things that are really vital to us in terms of the economy, in \nterms of jobs, in terms of health care, and terrorism. But one of the \nmost important questions, of course, that we face is the question of \nenergy.\n  Sometimes I think we forget how vital and what such a part of our \nlives energy is. All we have to do is look around and turn the lights \noff or turn the heat off for a little while and we recognize how \nimportant it is. We have talked about it a great deal.\n  As a matter of fact, last year one of the most important and vital \nthings that we did was to put together a policy on energy. I think it \nwas a very good policy. It is a policy that is in effect. The fact is, \nhowever, it is a policy, as it should be, but then we should be faced \nwith and take on the responsibility of implementing that policy. It is \none thing to have a policy, and it is very important to have one, but \nthen you have to put something in place to cause the policy to be in \naction. I think that is where we are now.\n  Being part of the committee, I may be a little prejudiced. I think \nthe policy was a good one and looked forward to the future and took \ninto account things such as conservation and efficient use. That is a \nvery important part.\n  One of the things we really have to stress is how we can get more \nmileage out of the energy we have. We also looked--again importantly--\nat the idea of alternative sources of energy. Over time, we can look at \nwind energy, we can look at ethanol, we can look at Sun energy--all \nkinds of things out there. And we should.\n  The fact is, most of those--even though I think they have great \npotential and will be a real part of our lives in the future--are out \nthere waiting.\n  The other thing we talked about, however, in the policy is to make \nbetter use of those things that are already available to us. That is \nreally what I want to talk about for a couple of minutes this morning; \nthat, specifically, is coal. Coal is our largest fossil fuel resource. \nAs a matter of fact, we have the largest supply of coal in the world \nthat we can depend on in the future. About 27 percent of future coal is \nin the United States. We use a great deal of it right now generating \nelectricity by and large, but the fact is, even though we are using \ntrain loads to run a generator for 1 day, we still have the resources \nto do this for a good long time in the future.\n  However, there are some things pending we can be doing in the fairly \nshort term that will have a real impact. If we wait for these \nalternatives, we are going to have some real pressing times between the \ntime they are ready to go and what we are doing now. I am hopeful and \ninvolved in the budget right now. I, frankly, wish there was a little \nmore attention--I think there should be--in the budget not only to look \nat research over time but to do some things to incentivize the \ndevelopment of those things that will have an impact in the next 4, 6, \nor 8 years. That is very important because energy is that nearly on the \nedge.\n  One of them, of course, is the various alternative uses of coal. We \nkind of know what to do. In fact, there are some plants now that are \nusing coal and converting it and processing gas, which takes out \nCO2, which takes out the climate-warming kinds of things and \nyet produces coal. Of course, as we produce more generation we have to \nlook at other ways.\n  Coal has been the only kind of fuel that has been used over the last \n20 years. About 50 percent of our generation is done by coal, and more \nrecent plants have been gas.\n  In our policy, we are better off using coal for generation and let \ngas be used for things which are more flexible.\n  For instance, my State of Wyoming is the largest producer of coal. We \nhave some of the biggest resources for coal in the future. These are \nopen-pit mines, which are very efficient and very effective. We are \nvery anxious to try to bring to this country and put into use fairly \nsoon some of the procedures that can be used. As I said, you can make \ndiesel fuel out of coal, which is very important.\n  We have plants in Wyoming that are ready to do that, if we can get \nstarted. We can make gas out of coal. We can make hydrogen out of coal. \nThese things, of course, take incentives and take some money.\n  I hope in this budget, in addition to looking out in the future in \nterms of research, we also look at how we implement in the shorter term \nthe things we already know how to do--how we use our greater resources, \nuse them in a more efficient way, and in a way which is environmentally \nsound so we can put ourselves in the position of being less dependent \non foreign oil and foreign imports.\n  I want to talk some more about it as time goes by, but I guess the \npoint I wanted to make and leave and see if we can't talk about is, we \nhave a policy. We have a policy that deals with some fairly short-term \nchanges. We need to be putting some emphasis on those as we look at our \nbudget needs, look at things which can have an impact in the short \nterm. We have to look at where these resources are so we can make our \ndevelopment around where the resources are and look forward to \nproviding energy in this country on an economically sound basis, \nreasonably effectively, and available to everyone. We can do that.\n  I hope we pursue our policies and implement them.\n  I will continue over time to focus on these things.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                             Pension Reform\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, another day is gone. The Senate has been \nunable to appoint conferees on the pension reform bill. I am terribly \ndisappointed that is the case.\n  Forty-four million American workers are covered by private sector \npension plans. They need our help. They can only get help if we have a \nconference with the House, a bill comes back here,\n\n[[Page S1667]]\n\nand it is approved by both the House and the Senate. Forty-four million \npeople would have peace of mind.\n  Senate Democrats are ready to go to conference now so we can produce \na pension reform bill that will improve worker retirement security. \nThroughout this process, Democrats have worked with Republicans. This \nis truly a bipartisan effort to produce a bill that passed the Senate \nwith 97 votes. It wasn't until we got into a position of appointing \nconferees that the majority decided to, for lack of a better \ndescription, play games.\n  I have to, frankly, say--I haven't had this job a long time--it has \nnever happened during the time that I have been leader. I don't \nremember it happening during the time I was assistant leader for 6 \nyears.\n  I don't know when the last time was that we had a prolonged dispute \nabout how many people are going to be on a conference committee.\n  Why are we seeing this now? Perhaps they are trying to stack the deck \nin favor of downtown interests--I should say some downtown interests. \nWe should give the opportunity to the Senate to stack the deck in favor \nof the 44 million workers and not a few special interests down on K \nStreet.\n  Yesterday, the distinguished majority leader said, and I quote:\n\n       We have two committees with equal stakes in this bill, and \n     they should have an equal number of conferees in the \n     committee. The conference committee should fairly represent \n     the two committees of jurisdiction.\n\n  I agree. This is precisely why I proposed a conference of eight \nRepublicans and six Democrats instead of seven Republicans and five \nDemocrats.\n  Under my proposal, four Republicans and three Democrats can be \nappointed from the HELP Committee, and four Republicans and three \nDemocrats could be appointed from the Finance Committee. Remember, \nthese numbers give the majority a two-vote majority.\n  The proposal I suggested establishes equal and fair representation to \nthe two committees but for the fact we have 55 Republicans and 45 \nDemocrats. We have acknowledged they should have a two-vote majority in \nthis conference. But it is fair, eight Republicans, six Democrats; \neight Republicans representing the Committee on Finance and the HELP \nCommittee, six Democrats representing the Committee on Finance and the \nHELP Committee. My proposal established equal and fair representation \nof the two committees--exactly what the leader said we need to \naccomplish so we can at least get the conference underway.\n  We are ready to go. It is puzzling when the majority leader refuses \nto take ``yes'' for an answer. The proposals put forward by the \nmajority leader only add to this confusion. It appears that seven \nRepublicans are okay, eight Republicans are not okay, nine Republicans \nare okay but only if they have, not a two-vote majority, but now a \nthree-vote margin.\n  So what conclusions could be drawn? At least two could be drawn. \nFirst, the majority leader and his supporters downtown do not really \ncare about the equal and fair representation; they only care about \nstacked representation. Second, and most unfortunately, they apparently \ncare more about stacking the deck than they do about completing action \non this vital piece of legislation.\n  Remember, whatever suggestion I have made, I don't change the \nmajority of the Republicans. They have a two-vote majority. The \nmajority leader has an opportunity to prove these words wrong. What am \nI saying? That they care more about stacking the deck than they do \nabout completing this important legislation.\n  If the distinguished majority leader believes what he said yesterday, \nwe can go to conference today with equal and fair representation from \nthe HELP Committee and the Committee on Finance. If he does not accept \nthis offer, it indicates he believes the lobbyists on K Street are more \nimportant than the workers on Main Street.\n  Yesterday, I listened to statements by Senators Baucus and Conrad, \nthe Democratic ranking members on the Committee on Finance and \nCommittee on the Budget. What they said speaks volumes on what is wrong \nwith this administration. I have trouble comprehending how the majority \nignores these huge deficits. They are there. They are piling up. Why? \nWe vote to approve these deficits.\n  In the pay-as-you-go system, if someone wants to spend some money, \nyou have to have an offset. Those rules have been abandoned by this \nadministration and this Republican-dominated Congress. I don't \nunderstand this. I always had in my mind that the Republicans were \nfiscally concerned about the status of our economy. Obviously, that is \nnot true.\n  President Bush is the most fiscally irresponsible President in the \nhistory of our country. No other President comes even close. When this \nadministration came to office, the Federal debt was about $5 trillion. \nWe were running large annual budget surpluses. We were paying down the \ndebt.\n  Alan Greenspan, the recently departed Federal Reserve Chairman, \nexpressed concern during the final year of President Clinton's \nadministration that the public debt was being paid down so rapidly that \nit may cause a concern to the financial markets.\n  Over the last 5 years, rather than reducing the debt, our Nation has \nsuffered record deficits and gone on an unprecedented and dangerous \nborrowing spree. Total debt now stands at over $8 trillion, and we are \nbeing asked to increase it by another $800 billion, which will last, \nsome say, for no more than about a year.\n  Compounding matters, the President's most recent budget makes matters \nsubstantially worse, leading to a $12 trillion debt by the year 2011. \nThat is just as the first wave of baby boomers begins to retire.\n  Not only is the debt exploding at the worst possible time, \nincreasingly we are borrowing from foreigners--Dubai, China, Japan. \nSince this administration took office 5 years ago, our country has more \nthan doubled its foreign debt, increasing such borrowing by over $1 \ntrillion. That is more foreign debt than we accumulated in the first \n224 years of this Republic.\n  During the last 3 years of the Clinton administration, we paid off \n$200 billion in foreign debt. We paid it off. Given the explosion of \ndebt in recent years, it is long past time for Washington to change \ncourse and adopt a new fiscal policy. All we are asking is that people \nbe concerned about the future of our economy. Our Nation is at stake.\n  I had the good fortune of being able to serve for a number of years \nin this Senate with Pat Moynihan, Daniel Pat Moynihan, who will go down \nin the history of this country as one of its most outstanding Senators. \nHe served in Democratic Presidential administrations, Republican \nPresidential administrations. He was a man who had a great intellect. \nHe served during World War II. He was a great patriot and a great \nintellect.\n  Before he died, he said that he believed all this debt which was \nbeing accumulated, all the tax cuts, were not to help the wealthy; they \nwould starve Government because the programs that some people in this \nadministration hate, such as Social Security, which the President \nwanted to privatize in the 1970s, Medicare and Medicaid and other such \nprograms, could not be attacked on a frontal basis. They could not do \nit directly. So by starving the Government, that is what has happened. \nAnd the Government is being starved. The American people are being \nstarved with this huge debt.\n  At a minimum, this is a matter which deserves considerable debate in \nthe Senate and an opportunity for all Senators of both political \nparties to participate. Unfortunately, there is reason to believe that \nsome on the other side are doing everything they can to squelch this.\n  My friend, the senior Senator of the Committee on Finance, Mr. \nGrassley, is reported to have said--not reported; he said it--that he \nwould like the debt limit to be extended but ``with the least debate.'' \nAccording to one news story, he said, ``I would like to see a bill on \nThursday night just prior to recess.'' Those are code words for saying: \nLet's jam this thing out of here. It appears that is what the \nleadership intends to do.\n  I got a letter in December from Secretary Snow saying that the \ncountry's debt limit is going to be exceeded, and to do something about \nit. During the holiday season, I got to this letter. It wasn't suddenly \ngiven to us. It appears to me we should be spending some time on this \nissue. But we are not; we just shove it under the rug. It is only \nanother $800 billion of taxpayers' money,\n\n[[Page S1668]]\n\nmost of which will be borrowed from foreign governments, with no \ndebate, no amendments, no public scrutiny, with no accountability for \nthe massive debt we are imposing on future generations of Americans. \nThat is not how this Republic, that is not how this Senate is supposed \nto work. It is not how our great democracy is supposed to function. We \nshould be inviting public input, not trying to hide what we are doing \nbecause people are embarrassed of public reaction. We shouldn't be \njamming things through Congress for political expediency.\n  The chairman of the Committee on Finance has said to extend the debt \nlimit ``with the least debate,'' and, ``I would like to see a bill on \nany Thursday night just prior to a recess.''\n  If the majority believes that increasing our debt by about $800 \nbillion is the right thing to do, they should be upfront about it. They \nshould explain why they think more debt is good. They should explain \nwhy they think it is fair to force our children, our grandchildren, and \ngreat grandchildren to pay higher taxes, why it is right to increase \nour Nation's dependence on foreign creditors. Let them try to defend \nthat. Maybe they can convince the public they are right, but I don't \nthink so because most Americans know that increasing the debt is wrong. \nThe baby boomers are about to retire. Under the circumstances, as \nalmost any credible economist would tell you, we should be reducing \ndebt, not increasing it.\n  I am appreciative of Ranking Member Baucus and Ranking Member Conrad. \nWe have sent a letter to the majority leader urging him to allow a \nthorough and open debate on any legislation to increase our debt. The \nletter says that before we approve hundreds of billions of dollars in \nadditional borrowing, we should adopt reforms to reduce the need for \nmore debt in the future. In particular, we should reinstate the pay-as-\nyou-go rules that proved so effective in promoting fiscal discipline in \nthe 1990s. That meant if you want a new program, pay for it, take it \nfrom someplace else. When you finish, there has been no new debt to \nthis country. And to show the cynicism of what is going on around here, \nwe have been debating for more than a year the Republican's deficit \nreduction bill--that is what they call it--which increases the debt.\n  We should not allow our Government to go deeper and deeper into debt \nwithout full and complete debate. We believe we should be more fiscally \nresponsible. All this will do is create more fiscal irresponsibility. \nIt will create higher taxes on our children and a weaker economy for \nfuture generations.\n  The American public will see whether this vote takes place in the \ndark of night or in broad daylight. They will see that Democrats are \nnot going to vote to increase this debt. This debt has been generated \nby President Bush and his Republican Members of Congress, and $8.2 \ntrillion is not enough. My good friends on the other side--all 55--will \nhave to belly up to the bar and vote to increase the debt of this \ncountry by $800 billion, or whatever figure is chosen, because \nDemocrats are not going to do this. The votes are going to have to come \nfrom the Republican Party. We are not going to support this \nirresponsible Government we have in America today.\n  How can you run a business like we are being run here? When the \ncredit cards run out, you cannot borrow more money from the bank. \nInstead, you go out and find the money--you rob the American people. \nHow could you run your home this way?\n  If I can no longer manage on my salary, I can no longer pay for the \nstyle of living we have, I talk to my wife and children and say: We \nwill have to cut back on things.\n  Not here.\n\n\n                   Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act\n\n  More than 9 months ago, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 810, \nthe Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. It was one of the rare \nvictories in the House for bipartisanship. I felt good about that. It \nwas my hope we would embrace the same spirit of bipartisanship in the \nSenate and pass this legislation, as well. It offers so much hope to \nuntold millions of Americans and their families, people who suffer from \nthese dread diseases.\n  After the House passed the stem cell bill, I spoke with my friend, \nthe majority leader, about the need to take up this crucial legislation \nas soon as possible. At that time, Dr. Frist assured me he would \nconsider the bill in the Senate by July. That was last July.\n\n  By the end of July, the majority leader still had not found time to \nschedule debate on the stem cell bill, so I moved to take up and pass \nthe House bill on the Senate floor. It was objected to by the majority, \nbut Senator Frist and I admire him for this, Mr. President--delivered a \nspeech the next day in which he expressed support for Federal funding \nfor expanded embryonic stem cell research. That was not easy for him to \ndo. I admire him for doing it, and I appreciate it. In the speech, Dr. \nFrist said that the potential of stem cell research to save lives and \nease human suffering ``deserves our increased energy and focus.''\n  Now, Senator Frist is a surgeon, a transplant surgeon, one of the \npioneers. When he started doing this transplant surgery, most people \nthought it was an experiment that was doomed to failure. I have spoken \nto Senator Frist. He personally would travel on little airplanes with a \nheart that had been taken out of one human being. He would take that \nheart and transplant it in another human being.\n  Now, since he did that, they have certainly come up with easier and \nbetter methods of transporting human hearts. But that is what he did. \nAnd he, coming from a different perspective than I, believes that stem \ncell research will save lives, it will help us, it will ease human \nsuffering. I am not a scientist, but I believe that, also.\n  But after he gave this remarkable speech--and I know he received \ncriticism from certain political folks--we returned from the August \nrecess, and he still did not find time to debate this important \nlegislation. He found time to do a lot of other things, like drilling \nin the Arctic Wildlife Refuge. He found time for the Majority's budget, \na budget that leaders of the faith-based community and major religious \ninstitutions said was immoral. He found time to give sweeping liability \nprotections to the drug industry. But he could not find time to keep \nhope alive for millions of Americans counting on the promise of stem \ncell research.\n  In December of last year, the majority leader asked consent to take \nup and pass the House-passed cord blood bill. Now, we all supported the \ncord blood bill, but we did not want to do that because we wanted to \nconsider the cord blood bill and the stem cell bill together. That is \nwhat the House did. But in an effort of bipartisanship and in an effort \nof hope and faith in the process here, we said go ahead and do that.\n  When we passed the cord blood bill, Senator Frist expressed his \ncommitment to the stem cell bill, but he did not bring it to the floor. \nHe asked the proponents of stem cell research to support his request to \ntake up and pass the cord blood bill in exchange for a commitment to \nconsider the stem cell bill early in the 2006 session.\n  At that time, Dr. Frist explained:\n\n       It is going to take some time that I will give on the floor \n     of the Senate early in the year and have committed to do so \n     because of its importance. It is important to address that in \n     order for that research to be amplified. Much of that \n     research needs to be amplified for cures that may occur 5 or \n     10 years down the road.\n\n  That is a statement from Dr. Bill Frist. Three months have gone by. \nWe are now into March 2006 and still no time has been scheduled to \nconsider the House-passed stem cell bill. We all know this is a short \nlegislative year. We have less than 3 weeks remaining in the work of \nthis period and a short work period in April. Before you know it, it \nwill be May and an entire year will have passed since the House \nfinished this bill.\n  Mr. President, recently I was in Las Vegas with the Las Vegas \nMetropolitan Police Department SWAT team for a demonstration of their \nnew mobile command center, which is really state of the art. When the \ndemonstration was over, I saw a man in a wheelchair. I walked over and \nintroduced myself and asked why he was in a wheelchair. He said: I was \na motorcycle officer, and somebody ran a red light and hit me. He has \nbeen paralyzed from the waist down for 5 years. He said to me: You \nknow--he grabbed his leg--I am getting a little bit of feeling. I hope \nthat is the case. But he said: Stem cell is my only hope.\n\n[[Page S1669]]\n\n  Now, he does not know anything about stem cells other than what \npeople have told him. He is not a scientist. He is a police officer. He \nworks in an office now. But he has hope. He has hope. As Dr. Frist \nsaid:\n\n       Much of that research needs to be amplified for cures that \n     may occur 5 or 10 years down the road.\n\n  He has been 5 years in a wheelchair. He is willing to wait a lot \nlonger.\n  One year may not seem like a lot of time to some of us, but it is an \neternity, I am sure, to some people out there who are so sick with some \nof those diseases where stem cell research could help. Diseases and \nconditions like spinal cord injuries, Alzheimer's, diabetes, \nParkinson's.\n  Last Sunday, ``60 Minutes,'' the public affairs program on CBS, ran a \nsegment on embryonic stem cell research. They featured a woman named \nSuzanne Short who is paralyzed from the neck down who was hit by a \ndrunk driver almost 25 years ago. Here is something she said about her \nhope for stem cell research:\n\n       Whether I walk or not, I really don't care. And, yeah, if I \n     do that's great. But . . . if you could just wake up one \n     morning and not have to wait for someone to come in my room \n     and get me out of bed, I could at least transfer myself into \n     my own wheelchair, be amazing. I'd be completely independent.\n\n  That is what she said. She has waited more than 24 years for help. \nNow we need action in the Senate. She should not have to wait longer.\n  Mr. President, less than a month ago, my friend died, Jeanie Sherman, \nJeanie McCall. She was paralyzed from the waist down. She wrote the \nmost, to me, heartrending letter about her experiences in a wheelchair \nfor all those many years.\n  Every day we delay consideration of this legislation is a day we deny \nhope to the hundreds of millions of Americans who suffer from these \ndevastating illnesses and conditions that have no cure--diseases such \nas cancer, as I have indicated, Alzheimer's, diabetes, Parkinson's, \nspinal cord injuries, and heart disease, even Lou Gehrig's disease.\n  There are a number of very important issues that this body ought to \nconsider this session, but few are as important to the American people \nas stem cell legislation that could provide medical breakthroughs that \nwould benefit hundreds of millions of people.\n  So, Mr. President, I know that we are crammed for time here, but I \nwould hope we can find time early this year to debate stem cell \nresearch. We have to keep hope alive.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask the Democratic leader to stay on the \nfloor just so we can discuss some of these issues. And I apologize for \nnot being here. I was in my office, and so I don't know exactly what \nissues he talked about. But I am fascinated by the comments on stem \ncells and would love to talk further about stem cells in terms of both \nthe power and the potential for stem cells to cure, something I have \nspent a lot of time with and know something about.\n  But if the implication was made that for some reason the issues \nsurrounding life, surrounding cures, surrounding healing are any less \nimportant to this side than the other side of the aisle, I think it is \ndisingenuous to say. I say to the Democratic leader, on stem cells--he \nknows I am a great advocate for the potential and promise for embryonic \nstem cells, the practical application; where I have run a transplant \ncenter, where tens of thousands of people have benefited from the \nprocedures of adult stem cells, mainly bone marrow transplants--I hope \nhe does not question my commitment to healing, to addressing that this \nyear.\n  He knows it was the other side of the aisle that refused the \nunanimous consent request last year in July where we would take up four \ndifferent stem cell bills. And, again, I was not on the floor, but I \nwould ask the Democratic leader what point he was trying to make in \nterms of stem cells?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, I think you would have \nappreciated what I said about you. I do not think there is anything \ndisingenuous about what I said. I talked about your pioneering \ntransplant surgery. I talked about your courageous statement on the \nSenate floor about the need to do something about the stem cell \nresearch and how difficult it was from a political perspective for you \nto do what you did.\n  So my point that I made here is that we need to find time to work on \nstem cell research. I did not say we should do it tomorrow. I said we \nshould figure out a time to do it this year. There is nothing \ndisingenuous about what I said. And there was nothing that I said \nduring my statement on stem cell research that was disrespectful to \nyou. I recognize the burden you have trying to juggle things to get \ntime here. But this is an issue that we have to figure out a way to \nmove forward on.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, so we can make it clearly understood--and I \napologize for not being on the floor--the Democratic leader understands \nand has agreed to the fact that we are going to address stem cells as \nearly as we possibly can this year, that that is a commitment that was \nmade after the unanimous consent request was not accepted from the \nother side to address it last July, that that commitment is there in \nworking together to address this important issue.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I said in my statement, the distinguished \nmajority leader said that we would bring this up early in this session. \nI am not critical of its not having already been brought up, even \nthough I would rather have done that than--I hate to bring up the ``A'' \nword--asbestos. There are other things we could be doing. As I said, I \nam willing to work with the majority leader. We still have time until \nwe get out of here to set aside some time to do stem cell. We are ready \nto move forward on stem cell research. As I said when we agreed to pass \nthe cord blood bill, we wanted to keep the cord blood bill and the stem \ncell bill together. That is what the House did. We agreed to pass the \ncord blood bill with the understanding that the majority leader would \nschedule time early this year to consider the House-passed stem cell \nbill.\n  Mr. FRIST. Bipartisan, working together.\n  Mr. REID. We wanted to move the two bills together. A number of my \npeople didn't want to separate them, but we took you at your word and \nthe cord blood bill is now the law. That is what I said in my earlier \nstatement. We cannot pass stem cell research unless there is a \nbipartisan effort to move it. That is why I didn't demand in my \nstatement that we take this up instead of debt limit or instead of \nlobbying reform. I am saying that we have a lot to do, but stem cell \nought to be a priority.\n  Mr. FRIST. But things such as asbestos, you can't deny that there are \npatients with mesothelioma and clinical diseases today who are being \nhurt by the system and that that is not an important issue from a \nhumanitarian standpoint, from a healing standpoint, for people who are \nsuffering from disease right now, dying from lung cancer today who are \nnot getting adequate compensation or appropriate compensation in a \ntimely way. You don't mean to imply that we should not be addressing \nthis asbestos crisis that is out there that also has a huge healing \nhumanitarian component to it?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could respond to the distinguished \nmajority leader, there is no question that the majority of this Senate \nfeels that asbestos is a difficult, very complex problem and should be \naddressed. But the bill that came before the Senate was a bad bill. \nThat is why now and before this, but now especially, a group of \nSenators is working on a bipartisan basis to come up with legislation \nto address that issue. Sure, it is important. That was a bad bill, and \nthe Senate treated it so.\n  Mr. FRIST. Then, on pensions, my staff said that you mentioned \npensions, perhaps trying to stack the issues for downtown interests, \nthe majority decided to play games. What are you even implying? We \nfinished this bill on November 15 on this floor. We completed it. The \nHouse finished it a month later. We have been waiting to go to \nconference now for I guess 3 months. My distinguished colleague knows \nit is the majority that ultimately sets the ratios. The ratio has been \ncrystal clear for weeks now, and now the argument seems to be shifting \nthat there are outside interests dictating all this, when I have been \ncrystal clear for weeks now on what those ratios will be. What is the \nimplication, that there is somebody outside dictating what we are \ndoing?\n\n[[Page S1670]]\n\n  Mr. REID. First, let me say, moving on beyond stem cells, I guess, \nbut so the record is clear, yes, we did object to the unanimous consent \nagreement because it was for six or seven bills. What we proposed--\n  Mr. FRIST. That is on stem cells.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. What we proposed is that we work on the stem cell bill \nand the cord blood bill. That is what the House did, and there was no \nreason we couldn't do the same.\n  Mr. FRIST. I take that. But let's move on to pensions. This is \ngetting old, and it is almost childish in terms of us not getting to \nconference. People are going to be hurt again.\n  Mr. REID. I have given several statements this week on pension \nreform. I believe that we should move forward. I have given all the \nstatistical numbers. People who are watching this would tend to agree \nthat seven Republicans is OK with the majority. Eight is not. Nine is, \nif there is a three-vote margin. I am saying that we should have a \nconference. The Senate, whether it is fair or unfair, has worked for \n224 years. These conferences ordinarily are fairly easy. It is fairly \neasy to go to conference. What we are saying is, let's have another \nRepublican and another Democrat or two more Republicans and two more \nDemocrats. There will still be a two-vote margin that the Republicans \nhave. Why can't we go to conference? That is what every one of my \nstatements has said.\n  I have said that and I gave reasons. What are the reasons for this? I \ngave an example yesterday about some of my trial experience. Are you \ntrying to--juries usually come up with the right result, not always for \nthe right reasons, but they usually come up with the right results. So \ndo conference committees. So I am saying, let's go to conference. I am \nwilling on my side to make choices as to who should go. But I say that \nwe have the HELP Committee and we have the Finance Committee. Both have \njurisdiction on this matter. I don't think it is asking too much to \nhave three Senators representing the Finance Committee, three Senators \nrepresenting the HELP Committee. That is what I am asking, rather than \nfive.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, just so people understand, the 7-to-5 \nratio, which I have been clear on for weeks now, does allow for equal \nparticipation between those two committees, so the fairness is that 7-\nto-5 ratio.\n  This protections to the drug industry, no time for stem cells--first \nof all, the timing issue is because of this postponement. The fact that \nthe PATRIOT Act finally passed yesterday, when it should have passed \nweeks ago, is a manifestation. This wasn't a problem with your whole \ncaucus. It was a handful of people who felt strongly about it, and that \nis within their rights. But some way or another, we need to keep moving \non all of these issues, whether it is stem cells, whether it is \npensions, whether it is lobbying reform, whether it is coming in to \naddress the debt limit. We are going have to move along and stop \npostponing, obstructing, and then saying we are running out of time. We \ncan't address these important issues.\n\n  Asbestos is important. My distinguished colleague may diminish how \nimportant it is, but it is an important issue from a range. We are \ngoing to systematically go through and address them, but we need \ncooperation, working together. Let me ask the Senator, I wasn't here--\nagain, I apologize--but protections to the drug industry, something was \nsaid about that. What does that mean?\n  Mr. REID. Well, I could have gone into more detail, but I talked \nquite a long time anyway. What I was complaining about is the \ninordinate amount of time that we spent dealing with certain issues--\nand I did mention specifically the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. And \nthe pharmaceuticals, I thought they got a sweetheart deal with the \nprovision that was inserted in the DoD Conference report in the middle \nof the night without any debate. I think I have a right to complain \nabout how that bill was handled. I thought the Appropriations \nCommittee, had they not been burdened with the ANWR thing, we could \nhave been out of here weeks earlier than what we were, but that held \nthings up for a long time. I have a right to complain about that.\n  Mr. FRIST. I understand. I plead to the other side of the aisle, if \nwe could work together, the list--I am sure your list went on much \nlonger on important issues. But unless we get some sort of working \ntogether without slowing things down and dragging out even asbestos, \nwhere we can't debate, we can only have debate, we can't amend; we have \nto work together to move forward.\n  On the drug industry, again, I am not sure exactly what it is, but \nright now avian flu, if you look at a map, over the last 6 months, \nwhere 10 million birds have died, 20 million, then 100 million, and \nthen 200 million, it is moving our way. It has a 50-percent mortality \nrate today. If you get infected today--and probably a third of us would \nget infected because we have no natural immunologic response to that, \nunlike the regular flu--if it does continue to have a 50-percent \nmortality, we are in real trouble. We have no vaccines. The reason we \nhave no vaccines today, in large part, is because the liability system \nhas gotten out of whack. We had 26 manufacturing companies back in the \n1960s. We have three today. They can't produce a vaccine. It would take \nthem 13 months today. So the liability protections are only in the \nevent there is an emergency, an emergency, a life-threatening \nemergency, in event there is a bioterrorist attack or in the event \nthere is a pandemic. Today there are no protections given whatsoever. \nAnd also built in with those protections is a compensation program.\n  I came to the floor because, as this list goes on, if these are not \nat least elucidated, the American people are left with a one-sided \nview, and that is wrong. Again, I didn't come to the floor to go \nthrough the entire list, but notes started coming into my office about \nthe list itself.\n  I will close with a plea to the other side of the aisle. It is an \nelection year. It is a year where partisanship is going to come to the \nfloor and where things are going to be obstructed or slowed down. But \nthere has to be some things we can work together on. It might be stem \ncells. It may be health issues. It should be asbestos. Hopefully, it \nwill be lobbying reform next week. Maybe that will be the first time \nthis year we can show working together. Then we have border security. \nThe Democratic leader and I were talking about that before. That is \ngoing to be a tough issue for us, border security and enforcement, with \na lot of amendments on the floor. We have to work together, Democrat \nand Republican, right side of the aisle, left side of the aisle, to do \nthe Nation's business, to govern with meaningful solutions; otherwise, \nwe are going to be here all year doing nothing.\n  Again, the Democratic leader and I don't just talk on the floor, and \nwe need to keep our conversations going, as we do our best to govern \nwith meaningful solutions to the problems we face today.\n  Mr. REID. I would say that the left side or right side of the aisle \nis according to where you are standing in this building. This side of \nthe aisle takes no back seat to what we have tried to do with avian \nflu. We have pushed this very hard. We pushed it because we were told \nthat it is not a question of if, it is a question of when.\n  We understand the seriousness of this. That is why we worked so hard \nto get the administration to also recognize this.\n  The majority leader, I know he is a prominent physician, and that is \nwhat I stated in my statement here. In the DoD bill, people are \nconcerned about a provision that was placed in the bill without the \nopportunity to debate it that offers sweeping liability protections for \nthe drug industry without compensation for victims who are harmed by \nreckless wrongdoing.\n  This is not the time to debate this in its entirety. I mentioned this \nwith a number of other things. But I would not be doing my job if I did \nnot come and talk about how I feel, how we feel, representing what the \nminority feels about the needs to go to conference on the pension bill. \nThat is an obligation I have. I think I am right. But the fact that I \ndisagree with the majority doesn't mean that there is anything wrong \nwith me. I think we are right.\n  I had an obligation to come and talk about the debt limit. That is \nimportant that we talk about that. I believe I had a right and an \nobligation to come and talk about the situation dealing with stem \ncells. I think anyone that would read my statement about stem cells, \nthat wasn't a statement where I was\n\n[[Page S1671]]\n\nsaying let's draw a ring here and have somebody go in one corner and \nsomebody come out the other and start slugging. I think this is one of \nthe most important things that we need to do this year. I was pleading \nfor time to have it done.\n  As far as cooperation, that runs both ways. We are in the minority. \nWe understand that. But times change around here. Someday we will be in \nthe majority, and we will be back in the minority. That is one of great \nthings about our country. That is one of the great things about the \nSenate.\n  The Senate is here to protect individual Senators who represent \nStates. Sometimes these rules are cumbersome. I see on the floor the \ndistinguished junior Senator from Mississippi who was the majority \nleader and minority leader in years past. He has written a book about \nhow difficult it is. But it is the Senate. It has worked well for our \ncountry. I hope when the books are written about my tenure here that it \nwill be one where people will say: He tried to get along with people, \ntried to get some things done. I have no problem with the majority \nleader coming to the floor and saying: What did you say? Because he can \nlook at the record and see what I said. I don't mind staff running \nnotes to him saying things, parts of what I said. But there was nothing \nin any of my statements that should be cause for alarm, other than \nalarm that I believe there are certain things we need to do: \nSpecifically, debate on the debt limit; two, get a conference appointed \nfor the pensions; and get a time set so we can debate stem cells.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first of all, I have enjoyed being referred \nto as the junior Senator from Mississippi, which I am. It makes me feel \nso young. I am flattered by that description.\n  I tiptoe into these waters with some hesitancy and with a great deal \nof respect for our two leaders because I know working out these issues \nis not easy. You have personalities. You have individual Senators who \nhave interests or concerns. I have the greatest respect for both of \nthese men. I know how tough the job is. But my friends, if we don't get \ninto conference on the pensions, it is going to be a plague on both our \nhouses. I have talked to Senator Reid about this. I understand his \nproblems, and I know what Senator Frist, as the majority leader, is \ndealing with. But I also know that this issue is time-sensitive.\n  If we don't get into the conference pretty soon, we are not going to \nget an agreement before April 15. There is at least one airline that \nhas bet the whole company, frankly--their survival and bankruptcy--on \nus getting pension reform done. Do you think people are only worried \nabout health care? They are worried about retirement and they are \nworried about their pensions. Are they going to be there? Are they \nadequately funded? Who will pay for it? The taxpayer?\n  That is what is going to happen. Company after company will dump \ntheir pension plans on the PBGC, the Government entity that insures \nthese plans. They are going to be stuck with the bill. I hate to get \ninto this, but having been there before, I cannot help myself because I \ncare about the substance here.\n  I am pleading with our leaders to find a way to deal with it. The \nSenator from Nevada knows that the majority leader has to lead on these \nissues. He has to find a way to get us into conference, but it takes \ncooperation. The majority leader says 7 to 5. I think it is a little \nhigh. The last time we had a pension reform conference, we had 8 total, \nnot 12 Senators. But the Senator from Nevada says: No, no, no, it has \nto be 8 to 6. That troubles me because the majority leader came up with \na reasonable number, but the minority leader said it has to be 8 to 6 \nor we are not going to conference. We are at loggerheads, and we should \nnot be.\n  I have a novel idea. Let's go up to 9 to 7 or go down to 6 to 4.\n  Mr. REID. I will take it, 9 to 7. You will have a deal.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to work on that, but I don't think the \nnumbers make that much difference. This is a bipartisan issue. I cannot \ndo this for the leader or the leaders. But go down to 6 to 4 or go up--\nand, by the way, it won't make a lot of difference. We are sweating \nabout this. Sixteen Senators are going to be in a conference. For \nheaven's sake, that is a cattle call. I think that is too many.\n  I plead with our leaders to come up with an agreement. I have never \nseen this happen before--never. Not one time when I was majority leader \ndid the minority leader and I not come to an agreement on a number to \ngo to conference with.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to.\n  Mr. REID. That is what I said earlier. During my tenure as leader and \nassistant leader, I never remember this happening. That is what I said \nbefore you came here.\n  Mr. LOTT. Senator Daschle didn't say: No, you have to give me a \nspecific number or I won't go. At least you are showing movement. We \nneed to do this and we need to do it today. I am going to continue to \ntalk about this. I will remind people that we have a deadline, which is \nApril 15. And I remind everybody that the Senate passed this November \n16 by a vote of 97 to 2. The House passed it last year.\n  We have been fumbling around with this for 2 whole months. This \ninvolves retirement insecurity for millions of Americans. Chairman \nGrassley has done good work, along with Chairman Enzi and ranking \nmember Kennedy; he wants these conferees appointed. All of the Senators \ninvolved are flummoxed that we cannot find a way to come to agreement \non this subject. The House passed it 294 to 132 on December 15. And \nhere we are and we cannot get into conference. Is it complicated? Yes. \nCan it be worked out? Absolutely. Whom are we fooling? There will be \nthree or four people who are going to write this thing. The rest of us \nwill be there as spearholders. Why don't we get on with it.\n  I am concerned about this. I think we ought to be able to get it \nworked out. The majority leader is the majority leader. He does make \nthe final call on the numbers. You know, when we go to conference, does \nit need to be cooperative and collaborative? Yes. I cannot believe, \nwith all of the Senators on this side pushing and hoping for a \nconference, and the Senators on the minority side who are pushing for a \nconference, that we cannot get this done. It is all because one or two \nSenators think they have to be able to go to conference, or else. I \nwanted to be a conferee on the tax bill, and I should have been. But \nthe leader decided the number was 2 to 1, so those are the conferees. \nThat is the way it works. I understand that. I cannot be a conferee on \nevery bill.\n  I say to those who are demanding they be a conferee, we have to \nsupport our leaders. I want to make it clear that I am worried about \nthe legislation. I want to be helpful.\n  I realize it is presumptuous of me to talk about this. I am not here \nabout who is the majority or minority when it comes to substance. This \nis about people's lives. What are we doing? That is part of a pattern \nwhere all of a sudden everything is objected to. We look bad. I want to \nmake it clear that I am not talking about our majority leader. He is \ntrying to move things. It is similar to trying to move a ``dad-blame'' \nmountain, and only the good Lord can give you the power to do that.\n  I plead with our leaders to find a way to make this happen and do it \ntoday. Today. I think what we might have to do, if we cannot get an \nagreement--I urge our leader to begin the process to--however long it \ntakes, however many votes it takes--to make this happen. It can be \ndone. But it takes, again, an excruciating amount of time, similar to \nwhat we went through on the PATRIOT Act. What a supercilious, \nridiculous process we went through, with all those extra votes to get \nto a vote of 89 to 11 on a consensus bill.\n  Yes, it is a Senator's right to run the string out if they want, but \nis that good? Was anything achieved? Is the Senate better off and are \nthe American people better off? Absolutely not. I tell you, any of our \ncolleagues on the other side that think you win by blocking things and \nstopping things from happening, I can tell you it doesn't work. I have \ntried it both ways. The American people want us here to get results. \nWhen you get results, there is plenty of credit to go around on both \nsides. You know, if we don't act on the pension bill, within 6 weeks \nthere are going to be disasters. The blame is going to be in this \nChamber.\n\n[[Page S1672]]\n\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip is recognized.\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT ERIC LEE TOTH\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to pause for a moment \ntoday in loving memory and honor of Sergeant Eric Lee Toth.\n  Sergeant Toth of Edmonton, KY, served with the 623rd Field Artillery \nin the Kentucky Army National Guard. The 623rd frequently escorts \nsupply convoys throughout Iraq, a dangerous duty that often put them \nin, as one Kentucky National Guard general has termed it, ``the eye of \nthe storm.''\n  On March 30, 2005, Sergeant Toth and two other Kentucky Guard \nsoldiers were traveling in a Humvee on a supply route in Iraq, \nescorting a convoy of supply trucks from the southern end of the \ncountry to the north. One of the soldiers traveling with Sergeant Toth \nwas his brother-in-law.\n  Suddenly, at a point about 30 miles north of Baghdad, an explosive \ndevice hidden in a car went off. The other two soldiers in the Humvee \nwere injured; Sergeant Toth was killed. He had served his Nation as a \ncitizen-soldier for almost two years. He was 21 years old.\n  For his valorous service, Sergeant Toth was awarded the Bronze Star \nMedal, the Purple Heart and the Combat Action Badge. He had previously \nreceived both the Army Good Conduct Medal and the Armed Forces Reserve \nMedal. And he was awarded the Kentucky Distinguished Service Medal, the \nsecond-highest honor that the Commonwealth of Kentucky can bestow.\n  Like so many young Americans, Eric was inspired to enlist in the \nKentucky National Guard after the terrorist attacks of September 11, \n2001. He felt an unswerving duty to defend his country after seeing the \ndestruction on that horrible day, to help ensure that something similar \ndidn't happen again. ``Ever since 9-11 . . . that's what he thought he \nshould do,'' says his wife, Andrea.\n  Captain John H. Holmes Jr., Sergeant Toth's battery commander, \nrecalled that Eric had set his sights on becoming a member of the \nrespected Alpha Battery when he joined the 623rd Field Artillery of the \nKentucky National Guard. He wanted to serve in the same unit as his \nbrother-in-law, Sergeant Ricky Brooks. He looked to Ricky as a role \nmodel, and the two grew closer during their service in Iraq.\n  Eric knew that Alpha Battery would likely deploy to Iraq, but this \ncourageous young man did not shy away from his share of \nresponsibility--rather, he embraced it. Captain Holmes says that Eric \n``inspired every one of us to be better than we ever thought we could \nbe, and touched our lives indelibly.''\n  Sergeant Toth got the assignment he sought, and was deployed to Iraq \nwith the 623rd in January 2005. Missions to escort supply convoys \nlasted as much as 18 hours to go a mere 500 miles, and the soldiers \noften had to bridge language and cultural barriers to communicate with \nthe convoy truck drivers.\n  Eric was the gunner for his unit. Captain Holmes tells us that a \ngunner's responsibility is to be the ``eyes and ears for his officers \nand his fellow soldiers,'' and that Eric succeeded at that quite well. \nHis brother-in-law, Sergeant Brooks, calls Eric one of the best gunners \nhe ever knew, and recalled a previous mission when Eric had been \nalerted to the possible presence of the enemy. When Sergeant Brooks saw \nEric check his gun and equipment twice, he knew Sergeant Toth was ready \nand could be counted on in battle.\n  Born in Glasgow, located in south-central Kentucky not far from \nMammoth Cave, Eric Toth grew up as quite the young athlete. He was the \ncaptain of his football team at Metcalfe County High School. As a young \nman, Eric helped nurture others in the sport he loved by coaching \nlittle-league football in Edmonton, which is the county seat of \nMetcalfe County.\n  As a child, Eric minded his studies as well. Bennie Stephens, who is \nstill with the Metcalfe County public school system, taught both Eric \nand Ricky Brooks when each was in the fifth grade, and remembers them \nas good students who worked hard.\n  Eric also enjoyed a good game of volleyball, and took pleasure in \nhunting and fishing. He played basketball with Sergeant Brooks. He was \nan avid movie fan, and even while in Iraq, Eric purchased 28 movies to \nfill the downtime in between missions.\n  Sergeant Toth was laid to rest last year in Sulphur Springs Cemetery, \nin Edmonton. Mr. President, I was honored to be one of the many who \nwent to pay my respects that day to a courageous American hero. A lot \nof people love and miss Eric Toth, and they will remember his bravery, \nhis generosity of spirit, and his sacrifice.\n  Eric was blessed to have a large family and many friends. His wife, \nAndrea, is with us in the gallery today, and we thank her for sharing \nher memories of her husband with us. Eric will be forever treasured by \nhis father, Danny Toth, and his mother, Brenda Paronto, who says that \nEric ``loved his country and loved what he was doing.''\n\n  He is remembered as well by his half-sister, Debbie, his stepsister, \nTasha, his stepbrothers Derrick and Travis, and many more members of a \nlarge extended family.\n  Perhaps Eric's commander, Captain Holmes, summed it up best when he \nsaid Eric ``was always about trying and doing.'' I hope those who knew \nand loved Eric can take some measure of solace in the knowledge that \nEric lived with bravery, giving his life for the freedom of people he \nwould never meet, but who will forever benefit from his sacrifice.\n  This country owes a debt to Eric and the countless men and women who, \nlike him, offer up their bravery to the rest of us. I ask my colleagues \nto keep the family of Sergeant Eric Toth in their thoughts and prayers, \nas they will be in mine.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for as much time as I consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                      Managing America's Seaports\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there is a lot of discussion this week in \nthe Congress, in committees on which I serve and in other committees, \ndealing with the issue of the company that is owned by the United Arab \nEmirates, a Dubai company owned by a government called the UAE, \nmanaging six of America's major seaports. I wish to make a couple \ncomments about that.\n  First, I introduced legislation this week that would simply \ndisapprove the transaction. I don't think I need 45 days, and I don't \nneed 45 minutes to make a judgment that it doesn't make any sense for \nour country to have a company owned by the United Arab Emirates \nmanaging six of America's major seaports. It doesn't make sense to me, \nand I will explain why.\n  In a time when our country is severely threatened by terrorism--and \nwe read about it all the time that terrorists threaten this country--we \nunderstand that terrorists would love to commit another major act of \nterrorism inside the United States. Go to an airport this afternoon and \ntry to board an airplane. You will find they want you to take your belt \noff. They want you to take your shoes off. They want you to take your \nwristwatch off. And then as you get through the metal detector, you see \nthey have some 6-year-old spread-eagled against the wall, wanding that \n6-year-old, or perhaps a Catholic priest, because they set off the \nmetal detector.\n  We understand what is happening at airports. There is massive \nsecurity. We have all these folks who are trying to get to their \nairplane, and yet we have them lined up in all kinds of ways because of \nsecurity issues.\n  What about our seaports? We know our seaports are also a target for \nterrorists. We have over 5.7 million containers coming in on ships into \nour seaports.\n  The administration says it is concerned about a rogue nation or a \nterrorist group getting access to an intercontinental ballistic missile \nand putting a nuclear bomb on the tip of the missile and firing it at \nthis country at\n\n[[Page S1673]]\n\n14,000 or 18,000 miles an hour. So we are spending, I don't know, \nsomewhere around $10 billion this year to build an antiballistic \nmissile system. Some of us think that is not a very wise expenditure \nbecause it is one of the least likely threats. Instead of worrying \nabout the threat of an intercontinental ballistic missile coming at us \nfrom a rogue nation or a terrorist, a very unlikely threat, we should \nworry about a ship pulling up to a dock at 6 or 8 miles an hour with a \ncontainer loaded on board that ship that contains a weapon of mass \ndestruction, pulling up to a dock or a pier at one of America's major \ncities. Then we are not talking about 3,000 people dead; we are talking \nabout tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people killed. Yet \nthink of this: We only inspect about 4 or perhaps as much as 5 percent \nof all of those containers coming into our country.\n\n  We know that just after 9/11, when there was a lot of discussion \nabout this, there was a fellow who tried to ship himself to Canada, \nsomeone who they thought was a terrorist, who loaded himself into a \ncontainer and actually had a cot to sleep on and a water supply; he had \na radio connected to a GPS monitor, a whole series of things. He was \nshipping himself in a container to the country of Canada. They happened \nto find that person. The assumption was that he was going to find his \nway into Canada in a container and come into this country across our \nborder. We know the dangers that exist with these ships and the \ncontainers. Yet there is very little, frankly, very little seaport \nsecurity.\n  I went to a seaport once. We don't have seaports in my State, but I \ntoured a seaport and asked about security and asked about things, and I \nmentioned previously on the floor that I saw a container that had been \ntaken off a ship and was being opened.\n  I said: What is in the container? Why is that being opened?\n  They said: That is a refrigerated container; that is just one we \ndecided to open.\n  I asked: What is in it?\n  Frozen broccoli from Poland.\n  I said: How do you know what is in the middle of that container? I \nsee what you have pulled off the end of it and you cut open some bags \nand found some frozen broccoli. But how do you know what is in the \nmiddle of that container? Well, we really don't, is the answer, and \nthey inspect somewhere around 4 to 5 percent of those containers.\n  So with all of the potential threat at our seaports, we are now \nlearning that a company owned by the United Arab Emirates has been \ncleared by the administration to provide management and, yes, security, \nbecause security is a part of management, at six major seaports in our \ncountry.\n  My colleagues, a number of them, have described the United Arab \nEmirates. It is not my intention to offend this country. The \nadministration says they have been helpful to us with respect to the \nwar on terrorism. I don't know the specifics about that, but if they \nhave been helpful, we appreciate that. We do know, however, that two of \nthe hijackers who crashed into our World Trade Center and the Pentagon \non 9/11 were United Arab Emirates citizens. We know from the 9/11 \nCommission Report that the United Arab Emirates was a crossroads that \nhelped finance the terrorist operations. We know that the United Arab \nEmirates ports were crossroads through which Dr. Khan of Pakistan moved \nsubstantial amounts of nuclear knowledge and material to North Korea \nand Iran and other parts of the world, and that will pose very much \ndanger to us and to our children. So we know some things about the \nUnited Arab Emirates.\n  My colleague, Senator Hollings, whom I have described a few times on \nthe floor and who used to sit at the desk right behind me, my colleague \njust wrote an op-ed piece, and he described the United Arab Emirates. \nHe said that in some countries, women are allowed to vote. In the \nUnited Arab Emirates, neither men nor women are allowed to vote. There \nare a lot of questions about the United Arab Emirates.\n  Let me mention something from the 9/11 Commission Report as well, \nabout the United Arab Emirates. On page 137, it describes in 1999 the \nfact that we had found Osama bin Laden, presumably, knew where Osama \nbin Laden was, and he was near a hunting camp in the Afghan desert \nbeing used by visitors of a Gulf State from the United Arab Emirates. \nOn page 138, it describes how in 1999, once our intelligence had \ndecided they knew where Osama bin Laden was, they were going to launch \na military strike against him. Page 138 describes that on February 10, \n1999, the military was doing the targeting to hit the main camp with \ncruise missiles. No strike, however, was launched. Osama bin Laden then \ndisappeared.\n  The reason the strike was called off is that intelligence officials \nwere worried that a strike against bin Laden would kill an Emirate \nprince, somebody from the United Arab Emirates. Part of the Royal \nFamily was visiting with Osama bin Laden at the time, and our \nintelligence officials were worried that if they launched a strike \nagainst Osama bin Laden, they would kill someone from the Royal Family \nof the United Arab Emirates. This is on page 138 of the 9/11 Commission \nReport.\n  My point is very simple. The United Arab Emirates may very well have \nbeen helpful to us in the fight against terrorism in the last couple of \nyears, and if they are being helpful to us, good for them. This is not \nabout offending the United Arab Emirates by saying that we don't want a \ncompany owned by that country to manage American seaports. I don't wish \nto offend the UAE, but neither should we be offending common sense. A \nwhole reservoir of common sense would tell us that this country, given \nthe fact that we are the No. 1 target for terrorists, ought to be \nmanaging our own ports, our own major seaports, and ought to be \nproviding our own security and ensuring our own security.\n  If I might also make a couple of points. The Committee on Foreign \nInvestment of the United States, which is made up of somewhere around a \ndozen agencies within the administration, studied this proposed port \ndeal and said it was okay for the United Arab Emirates-owned company to \nmanage our major seaports. Well, on February 27 we learned that the \nCoast Guard expressed reservations about the deal in a secret report \nthat was made public this week, and here is what the report said. This \nis the Coast Guard. It says:\n\n       There are many intelligence gaps concerning the potential \n     for the UAE company's assets to support terrorist operations \n     that preclude an overall threat assessment of the potential \n     of the merger.\n\n  In fact, the Coast Guard referred to a large number of potential \nvulnerabilities, and then it listed them, and one of the intelligence \ngaps that the Coast Guard referred to was the fact that no one had \nchecked the backgrounds of the people in charge of the UAE-owned \ncompany.\n  So when the secret Coast Guard report was made public this week--I \nbelieve by Senator Collins, who was holding a hearing at the time--the \nadministration had the Coast Guard make another statement, and here is \nwhat the Coast Guard said on February 28:\n\n       Upon subsequent and further review, the Coast Guard and the \n     entire CFIUS panel believe that this transaction, when taking \n     into account strong security assurances by DP World does not \n     compromise U.S. security.\n\n  The Coast Guard obviously works for the President, and they made this \nstatement dutifully in line with the administration's interests. But it \nis interesting. The Coast Guard's statement does not say that anybody \nchecked the backgrounds of the officials of the UAE company. That was \nwhat the Coast Guard cited as one of the major vulnerabilities.\n  The highest ranking official in the Department of Homeland Security \nwho reviewed this port deal is Assistant Secretary Stewart Baker. \nAssistant Secretary Stewart Baker told The New York Times on February \n17 that the CFIUS review did not include any background checks on \nsenior managers of the company. In fact, the review didn't involve \ngathering any information from outside sources like the New York and \nNew Jersey Port Authority, because the committee kept the proposed \ntransaction secret. In fact, Baker said the committee's investigation \nlasted just a couple of months, beginning in November, ending in mid-\nJanuary, so there wouldn't have been time to do very thorough \nbackground checks anyway.\n\n[[Page S1674]]\n\n  So here is what we have. We have the Coast Guard saying in a secret \nmemorandum that there are real vulnerabilities here with respect to \npotential terrorism, and in that memorandum, they say one of the \nvulnerabilities is that no one had checked the backgrounds of the \npeople in charge of the UAE company. So then the Coast Guard, when this \nbecomes public, says: No, no, it is okay. We have pretty much been \nsatisfied. And then the Department of Homeland Security official, the \ntop official who did this, says: Well, no, we didn't check those \nbackgrounds.\n  Question: How could the Coast Guard be satisfied when the conditions \nweren't met, when they had just said previously that there was a \npotential threat here? They said, ``There are many intelligence gaps \nconcerning the potential for the UAE company's assets to support \nterrorist operations,'' and one of the bases for that is they hadn't \nchecked the backgrounds of the people in charge. And then the Coast \nGuard says: But that is OK, now we are in sync with the administration \non this. Then Homeland Security comes out and says: Well, we never did \ncheck the backgrounds of the people in charge.\n  This really gives you confidence that the transaction was properly \nvetted, doesn't it?\n  Let me just mention that in 2002, May of 2002, the U.S. Military \nSpecial Operations Command obtained a document produced by al-Qaida in \nwhich al-Qaida claimed to have infiltrated the United Arab Emirates. \nReferring to the UAE, the 2002 al-Qaida document, which was written in \nArabic, says: We have infiltrated your security, censorship, and \nmonetary agencies along with other agencies that should not be \nmentioned.\n  I have no idea whether there is any credibility here or not, but I do \nknow that two of the 9/11 hijackers were from the UAE and the financing \nfor the attacks flowed through UAE financial institutions. And it seems \npreposterous to me that the administration would just dismiss issues \nwhich were raised in a secret memorandum by the Coast Guard, even after \nthere is an admission that the conditions that resulted in that concern \nabout terrorism were never met.\n  The point is simple. This relates in many ways to the larger question \nof outsourcing, offshoring, contracting out the global economy. This \nglobal economy has galloped along. The rules, of course, have not kept \npace. We now discover that in this so-called global economy, there are \nthings which cause great concern. Among those would be deciding that \nAmerica's seaports, largest seaports should be managed by a state-owned \ncompany, a company owned by the United Arab Emirates. Does that make \nsense? Is the reaction of the American people so out of sync with \ncommon sense? I don't think so. I think the American people are in \nperfect sync with common sense, and the folks in the administration who \ndid CFIUS and the folks in the administration who are now defending \nthis are the ones who are out of sync with any common sense.\n  The President says: I have made up my mind. If the Congress passes \nlegislation and sends it to my desk, I am going to veto it because I \nwant the UAE company to be able to manage these ports. I say if you \nwant to veto it, then go right ahead, but I think this Congress should \npass legislation that says very simply that we don't want a state-owned \ncompany from the United Arab Emirates managing America's seaports. \nThere are, in fact, security issues, national security issues that \ntrump all of the other issues, and we don't believe that is \nappropriate. I have introduced legislation to do that, and we will see \nwhether in the coming days and weeks we will be able to pass that \nlegislation. I, frankly, think we will.\n  A colleague over in the House, Congressman Duncan, said something \ntoday that I believe is useful to repeat. He said:\n\n       People call this attitude protectionism. If that is what \n     they call it, then count me guilty of wanting to protect this \n     country's interests.\n\n  I always liked this so-called four-letter word, ``protection,'' the \nnotion of being a protectionist on international trade. What is wrong \nwith standing up for protecting this country's interests? Yes, economic \ninterests, national security interests. What is wrong with that? Does \nanybody really think it makes sense to be outsourcing and offshoring \nall of this?\n  I believe we have the most sophisticated economy in the world. We \nhave a wonderful education system. We have a lot happening in this \ncountry. And if we had no immigration restrictions at all and just had \nan open country, I tell you what, a fair part of the world would be \nheaded in our direction. So it is a great place. And we don't have the \nresources in this great place of ours to manage our own seaports at a \ntime when we see daily and weekly threats of terrorism against our \ncountry? We don't have the resources and we don't have the ingenuity \nand we don't have the capability to manage our seaports? What on Earth \nare they thinking about when they suggest that? Of course we do. It is \njust a matter of national will to decide that we want to stand up for \nthe economic interests of this country and protect the national \nsecurity interests of this country. That is what our responsibilities \nare.\n\n  I wish that I could, in this case, be supportive of the \nadministration and the folks who reviewed this from CFIUS. But the fact \nis, in carpenter's terms you would call it a half a bubble off plumb, \nmaybe a full bubble off plumb. This makes no sense at all. You are \ngoing to turn over our major seaports to a United Arab Emirates-owned \ncompany about which there are substantial questions about national \nsecurity. I said before, it is nuts. There is no other way of \ndescribing it. So count me as somebody who is going to try, in every \nway possible, to scuttle this approach.\n  The interesting little dance that is going on here, because everybody \nwants to look as though they have been able to win, is: Now we have \nasked, the company has actually asked our country to extend the 45-day \ninvestigation. You talk about Byzantine. The United Arab Emirates-owned \ncompany is asking the United States of America to extend its \ninvestigation because they cut it off prematurely? It is bizarre. That \nis the only way you can describe it. I don't need 45 days; I don't need \n45 minutes to figure out this doesn't make sense. That is why I \nintroduced the legislation I introduced.\n\n\n                           Contracting Fraud\n\n  Turning to another subject, and I will be brief, yesterday I \nintroduced legislation with 28 of my colleagues. I will ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Cantwell be added to the piece of legislation.\n  The bill we introduced yesterday is about accountability in \ncontracting. It is called the Honest Government and Accountability in \nContracting Act of 2006.\n  I have held seven hearings, chairing the Democratic Policy Committee, \non the issue of contracting. It has been all over the newspapers in the \nlast 4 or 5 years, the massive fraud, waste, and abuse in contracting. \nI will not go through all of it, but let me put a couple of things up.\n  This is Bunnatine Greenhouse, the highest ranking civilian official \nin the Corps of Engineers. She is in charge of all contracts in the \nCorps of Engineers, and virtually everything being done by contract in \nIraq is going through the Corps of Engineers. She, incidentally, has \nsince been demoted. The reason she has been demoted is this career \nofficial, who had great ratings and performance evaluations throughout \nher career, told the truth.\n\n       I can unequivocally state that the abuse related to the \n     contracts awarded to KBR [that is Halliburton, a subsidiary \n     of it] represents the most blatant and improper contract \n     abuse I have witnessed during the course of my professional \n     career.\n\n  Bunnatine Greenhouse, the highest ranking procurement official in the \nCorps of Engineers is paying for it with her job, but thank God we have \npeople with the courage to do this.\n  When you mention Halliburton, everyone thinks you are talking about \nthe Vice President because he used to run Halliburton. This is not \nabout the Vice President. This is about a company that got huge no-bid, \nsole-source contracts to do work in Iraq, and it is unbelievable--the \nwhistleblowers from Halliburton described the waste. I will give an \nexample. We had a witness who used to work for KBR--Halliburton. He \nused to buy things for them.\n  He held up two towels. He said, I was supposed to purchase hand \ntowels for the soldiers. Here is the towel I would\n\n[[Page S1675]]\n\nhave purchased. It would have cost $1.80 a towel, something like that. \nAnd here is the towel I did purchase. It cost triple that. Why? Because \nthe company said to me I want you to purchase the more expensive towel \nso it has the company name embroidered on the towel that goes to the \nsoldiers. Waste? Of course it is.\n  Mr. President, $85,000 trucks, brand new, were left on the side of \nthe road to be trashed because they had a flat tire; $85,000 trucks \nwere trashed and left to rot because they had a plugged fuel pump. Do \nyou think that is not happening? Listen to the whistleblowers or the \npeople who drove the trucks.\n  A guy named Rory, on behalf of Halliburton, runs a cafeteria and food \nservice. We know there is one allegation of one billing for 42,000 \nsoldiers being fed a day when in fact they were feeding only 14,000. \nRory said they missed it by about 5,000 in the place he was feeding \nthem, charging for 5,000 more than actually were eating. He said, By \nthe way, we were feeding the soldiers food that had expired date stamps \non it, and when we told our supervisors they said, No, no, feed it to \nthem; an expired date stamp doesn't matter. Feed them to the soldiers. \nHe also said the convoys bringing the food in would come under attack \nand our supervisors said you go through and pull out the bullets and \nshrapnel in the food, pull it out, and then we will feed the food to \nthe soldiers. And by the way, if they are good bullets, save them for \nthe supervisors for souvenirs.\n  Are these unusual circumstances? The answer is no. I could go on and \ntalk about fuel delivery and water contracts, but that is enough, just \nto say there is massive waste and fraud and abuse going on with respect \nto contracting in Iraq.\n  By the way, this fellow in this picture testified, this fellow \nwearing this white striped shirt. These are hundred-dollar bills \nwrapped in Saran wrap. This is the way they paid contractors in Iraq. \nHe said we told contractors in Iraq, when you come, bring a bag because \nwe pay in cash. He said, we used to throw these around like footballs \nin the office, hundred-dollar bills, wrapped. They had a bill vault \ndownstairs. So the contractors are told, bring a bag because we pay in \ncash. He said it was like the Wild West. Someone else said we do a \ncontract, the American taxpayers are going to pay to get a building air \nconditioned in Iraq, that goes to a subcontractor, it goes to a local \ncontractor, another little contractor, and pretty soon we pay for it. \nWe get a ceiling fan where we should have gotten an air conditioner. It \nis like the Wild West. Bring a bag and we give you cash.\n\n  Finally, a man named Mr. Custer and a man named Mr. Battles. ``Sixty \nMinutes'' did a recent program on them. They showed up with virtually \nno money. Eventually, within a very short period of time--nearly 2 \nyears--they got $100 million in contracts from the Federal Government. \nIt is pretty unbelievable.\n  I have a chart that describes what one of the airport managers said \nabout them.\n  This is the chart:\n\n       Custer Battles have shown themselves to be unresponsive, \n     uncooperative, incompetent, deceitful, manipulative and war \n     profiteers. Other than that, they are swell fellows.\n\n  From the Baghdad Airport, Director of Airport Security. The \nallegation is, they took the forklifts from the airport, that belonged \nto the airport, took them to a hangar, repainted them blue, and then \nsold them back to the Iraq Provisional Authority.\n  My point is there is substantial abuse going on in contracting.\n  We have introduced legislation that has a number of components. No. \n1, a piece of legislation that includes as its first section something \nSenator Leahy had offered in the last Congress: punishing war \nprofiteers with substantial penalties. Those who would profiteer in a \nwartime situation are despicable and they ought to bear substantial \npenalty.\n  The bill cracks down on substantial cheaters. It restores a Clinton \nadministration rule, a rule that was made during the Clinton \nadministration on suspension and debarment. If you are a contractor and \nyou have exhibited a pattern of overcharging the Federal Government or \nfailing to comply with the law, basically you have been somebody who \nhas cheated the Government and have a pattern of that, you are out. You \nare going to be debarred. You are not going to be able to bid again. \nWhen the present Bush administration took office they immediately \nrescinded that rule. We would restore that rule by law, requiring full \ndisclosure of contract abuses.\n  Section 103 provides for greater transparency in contracting. It \nwould require agencies to provide the chairmen and ranking members of \nthe committees in Congress all contractor reports that found contractor \nmisconduct, and put them on a Web site as well.\n  The bill would force real competition, no more no-bid, sole-source \ncontracts. It would also ban corporate cronyism in contracting. No more \ncircumstances where someone works in a certain area and then goes to \nthe private sector and gets contracts in the same area for which that \nperson worked in the government. It ends cronyism in key government \npositions.\n  This is pretty radical. We are daring to suggest that people who are \nbeing hired for key jobs ought to be qualified for them. FEMA, the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, used to be, I think, one of the \nstars of the Federal Government. My understanding is 7 of the 11 top \npositions in FEMA were filled by people who had no experience, just \ncronies. You want a job for Al or Ken or Vern or Mary? Stick them over \nthere. So 7 of 11 positions were filled by cronies with no experience.\n  Then take a look at what happened, see what happened when Katrina hit \nthe shores, the largest national disaster in our country's history, and \nyou see a FEMA that is completely incompetent.\n\n  The stories are unbelievable. We had a hearing about that. We had a \nguy who drove an 18-wheel truck. He was supposed to haul ice in this \n18-wheel truck for the Katrina victims, at FEMA's direction. He got a \nwhole truckload of ice and away he went to provide ice to the victims \nof Katrina. The problem is, he didn't quite get there. FEMA had him \ndrive around the country. He was sent to an airbase here and another \nplace there, and he finally, after sitting at a military base for a \nlong while--with hundreds of other trucks, by the way--he finally had \nto drive back to New York and offload his ice in New York. This is \nunbelievable.\n  By the way, I have asked the Department, FEMA agency, how did this \nhappen? How did you spend taxpayers' money to have ice run around this \ncountry that should have gone to the victims of Hurricane Katrina and \ninstead we end up paying tens of thousands of dollars and the ice never \ngets there?\n  I got a letter from FEMA this week which says: That wasn't our \nresponsibility. That was the Corps of Engineers. FEMA has since \ncorrected that with an e-mail that is disjointed, were they admit that \nthe responsibility was theirs. Their recent reputation for incompetence \nis pretty well deserved. That is something I am going to the bottom of.\n  My point is, we need to decide, if we are going to put people in key \npositions to do key jobs, it ought not be cronies, it ought to be \npeople who have some basic experience that would suggest they can do \nthose jobs.\n  Finally, we will strengthen whistleblower protections. People who \nhave the courage to blow the whistle on waste, fraud, and abuse ought \nnot be penalized, they ought to be applauded.\n  That is the legislation I introduced yesterday with 29 cosponsors. \nSenator Cantwell will be the 29th sponsor. I ask unanimous consent \nSenator Cantwell be added as a cosponsor of this legislation, which is \n2361.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This is not Republican or Democratic, conservative or \nliberal. It is about being smart and doing the right thing. We have had \na lot of circumstances in recent weeks and months where our country has \ndropped the ball. I mentioned the response to Katrina. I mentioned \ncontracting in Iraq and a range of things. I believe we must do better \nthan that.\n  Some of it stems from these big sole-source, no-bid contracts. That \nis too sweet a deal. What you need is competition. We do not want to \nhave this Government favoring one company versus another with sole-\nsource, no-bid contracts. That is an invitation for waste, in my \njudgment.\n\n[[Page S1676]]\n\n  I know we have a pretty substantial schedule. I know Senator Frist \nhas indicated his agenda, what he wants to bring to the floor of the \nSenate in the coming weeks and months. But let me say I hope we will \nhave time to deal with this issue of honest government and \naccountability in contracting. That is a piece of legislation that is \nurgently needed to be passed.\n  I also hope, in the near future, whether it is 45 days or whatever \nthe days, they are going to continue to review the question of whether \nthe United Arab Emirates should be managing America's ports. Whenever \nthat is done, my hope is we will have up-or-down votes here in the \nCongress about whether we think this makes any sense at all.\n  I agree with Congressman Hunter. Put me down on the side of wanting \nto protect this country's interests. I guarantee this: We will not be \nprotecting this country's interests to continue down this road of \noffshoring and outsourcing and deciding this great country of ours does \nnot have the capability to manage its own seaports. What are we \nthinking about? Of course, we have the capability. The question is, do \nwe have the national will and enough common sense, is there a reservoir \nof common sense to finally have us doing the right thing?\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            CHILD PREDATORS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak to my \ncolleagues about an issue that not a lot of people in this body think \nabout every day--a very large policy issue we talked about over the \ncourse of the morning--an issue that shocks me personally but is \nshocking America, and it is the topic of child sexual predators.\n  Sometime during the late hours of February 23, 2005, Jessica Marie \nLunsford disappeared from her grandparents' Citrus County, FL, home.\n  She was found dead 3 weeks later in a shallow, 4-foot-deep grave \nunder the back porch of John Couey's mobile home--just where he told \nauthorities she would be.\n  The little girl's body was sitting upright, her wrists bound with \nstereo wire, and plastic garbage bags wrapped her tiny, 9-year-old \nframe. In her arms was the stuffed purple dolphin that had gone missing \nwith her during the night.\n  Authorities believe after kidnapping and sexually assaulting little \nJessica, John Couey, a known sex offender, buried her alive.\n  This case--the Jessica Lunsford case--riveted and shocked the Nation. \nHow could someone perpetuate such horrors and against an innocent \nchild? How could the system have allowed a convicted sex offender to \nmove freely and unmonitored, with no warning to the neighbors of the \nmonster in their midst?\n  Every year, nearly 798,000 children are reported missing--over 58,000 \nof them are the victims of nonfamily abductions.\n  One in five girls and one in ten boys are sexually exploited before \nthey reach adulthood. Less than 35 percent of those childhood sexual \nassaults are reported to authorities.\n  To make matters worse, the Internet is pushing the boundaries of \nsexual exploitation, providing child predators with a new, anonymous \nhunting ground. The Department of Justice reports that one in five \nchildren as young as 10 years old receives solicitations online. For \nparents and for communities, it is time for all of us to wake up.\n  A recent Dateline NBC series called ``To Catch A Predator,'' vividly \ndemonstrated that many of these cyberstalkers are more eager to trap \ntheir young online victims into a real-world nightmare than at any time \nin the past.\n  Over the course of a 3-day sting operation in Riverside, CA, Dateline \nwas able to nab 50 Internet child sex predators. The men were caught on \nhidden camera arriving at a home where they believed a young teen, aged \n12 or 13, was waiting to meet them. The police were on hand to \napprehend the would-be molesters.\n  There is no stereotyped child predator. The men came from all walks \nof life, including a high school teacher, a rabbi, and a law \nenforcement official. Some had long criminal records that involved \nprevious sexual assault convictions.\n  The results were shocking, even to the experienced Dateline \nproducers. Just like the Lunsford case, the audacity of these men \nshould be a wake-up call to all of us that we must do more to protect \nour children from child sexual predators.\n  How many times have they gotten away with it in the past? How many \nmore are out there cruising cyberspace as I speak right now? How can we \nprotect children from falling into their clutches? There are ways, and \nthis body, the Senate, will address those ways.\n  On Wednesday, I discussed these questions with John Walsh of FOX's \n``America's Most Wanted,'' now a nationally renowned child advocate.\n  It was after the tragic kidnapping of his 6-year-old son Adam in 1981 \nthat Mr. Walsh devoted his life to protecting America's children.\n  His organization--the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren--single-handedly raised the issue of child abduction to \nnational prominence. And for that he should be congratulated. It has \nled to the recovery of countless children and defended the safety and \nwell-being of countless families across America.\n  In that meeting on Wednesday, he told me in his 24 years of advocacy, \nhe has not seen an issue more important and more pressing than creating \na national sex offenders registry.\n  He pointed out that when a neighbor down the street has a mean dog, \nparents know and they warn their children to stay away--to stay away \nfrom that yard, to stay away from that house. So, too, parents should \nhave the right to know that the neighbor down the street has a history \nof sexual violence so they can protect their children from harm.\n  Here in the Senate, we will act to fight child predators. I am \ncommitted to passing child predator legislation this year as part of a \nbroader crime-fighting package. I look forward to working with Chairman \nSpecter and the Judiciary Committee to develop this package and \naccomplish this goal.\n  We should consider provisions from the Children's Safety Act that I \ncosponsored with Senator Hatch and which Chairman Specter helped report \nout of the Judiciary Committee last year.\n  A number of ideas were included: Creating a national sex offenders \ndatabase searchable by zip code; requiring States to notify one another \nof the whereabouts of registered offenders; developing a stricter \ntracking system to monitor repeat violent offenders; requiring DNA \nfingerprinting of child sexual predators and developing a DNA database \nto help solve these crimes; imposing enhanced criminal penalties for \nviolent crimes against children under 12; and provisions that can \nreduce gang violence, strengthen court security, and prevent child \npornography.\n  We should consider the ideas under development by the distinguished \nJudiciary Committee chairman in the House, Chairman Sensenbrenner.\n  When serial rapist Joseph Duncan was caught at a Denny's last summer \nin Coeur d'Alene with one of his child victims, the only words he \nuttered to police were, ``I had fun. Get me a lawyer.'' His sick and \ntwisted sense of ``fun'' was allegedly kidnapping and sexually \nassaulting Shasta Groene, age 8, and her brother Dylan, age 9, \neventually murdering the little boy but not before tying up and beating \nto death their older brother, their mother, and their mother's \nboyfriend.\n  Joseph Duncan was a repeat offender with a 30-year history of sexual \nassault. He committed his first crime at age 12, preying on a 5-year-\nold boy. By the time he was 16, Duncan estimates that he had raped 13 \nyoung boys, 6 of whom he tied up, others he raped at gunpoint. By 17, \nmedical authorities deemed him a sexual psychopath.\n  After raping and torturing a 14-year-old boy, Duncan was sent to \nprison where he served 14 years before being released--only to attack \nmore innocent\n\n[[Page S1677]]\n\nchild victims. Shasta and Dylan's father said:\n\n       There's been so many times I've seen the news announce sex \n     offenders being released into the community. People need to \n     contact their Congressmen, their Senators, and even the \n     President. There's a lot more that can be done.\n\n  I would like to tell Mr. Groene that we are listening. We hear your \nplea and the pleas of so many other Americans who want to see these \nmonsters dealt with.\n  We are going to act. We will act. We must protect America's children, \nfamilies, and neighborhoods from these sick predators. Our children are \ndepending on us to keep them safe from the evils that lurk in the \nshadows.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor the \nachievements of the Peace Corps.\n  This year marks the 45th Anniversary of the Peace Corps. Over the \nlast 45 years, the Peace Corps has been one of the enduring symbols of \nAmerica abroad. The Peace Corps has helped create opportunities and \nhope for people throughout the developing world as it has projected a \npositive image of America.\n  In 1961, President John F. Kennedy established the Peace Corps to \npromote world peace and friendship. Since then, over 182,000 Peace \nCorps volunteers have served in 138 countries. These volunteers have \nprovided extensive assistance and expertise in agriculture production, \nbusiness development, education, healthcare, and resource \nconservation--making significant improvements in the lives of \nindividuals and communities around the world.\n  As we continue to face the challenges of the 21st Century, the \nmission of the Peace Corps is more vital than ever. Volunteers continue \nto offer support and development assistance to countries around the \nworld. They are finding common ways to address global challenges such \nas endemic poverty and HIV/AIDS.\n  Today, Peace Corps volunteers, including 50 from my State of \nNebraska, bring their communities an enhanced understanding of foreign \ncultures and traditions, building bridges of friendship between people \nthat transcend borders, language, and religion.\n  I congratulate the Peace Corps on its 45 years of achievement and \naccomplishment and thank the over 182,000 Peace Corps volunteers--\nincluding our Senate colleague Chris Dodd for their good work and \nimportant contributions to making a better world.\n  Thank you.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Peace \nCorps on its 45th Anniversary.\n  In his Presidential campaign in 1960, a great hero of mine, President \nJohn F. Kennedy, challenged a group of students at the University of \nMichigan to serve their country by volunteering their time and energies \nto citizens in developing countries. From those humble beginnings soon \nemerged the Peace Corps which, for the last 45 years, has been one of \nthe most valuable and unique institutions of American foreign policy.\n  Since its establishment in 1961, over 182,000 Peace Corps volunteers \nhave served in 138 countries throughout the world. Today, the Peace \nCorps remains as strong and popular as ever with the number of \nvolunteers in service at a 30-year high. Currently some 7,810 \nvolunteers, including 25 from my home State of Delaware, are working in \n75 countries across the globe.\n  These increased numbers of volunteers have done invaluable work in \nrecent years. Hundreds of Peace Corps volunteers, for instance, have \nbeen enlisted in the global fight against HIV/AIDS. The Peace Corps is \nactive in 9 of the 15 Emergency Plan countries identified in the \nPresident's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR. In addition, \nvolunteers have continued lending their expertise to traditional areas \nsuch as environmental conservation, education, food production, and \nhealth care.\n  Over the past year, the innovative Crisis Corps--which draws on \nformer Peace Corps volunteers for short-term emergency and humanitarian \nassistance--has allowed hundreds of volunteers to assist in tsunami \nrelief efforts in Sri Lanka and Thailand. And in recent months, the \nCrisis Corps was deployed to the gulf region in the wake of Hurricane \nKatrina--the first time Peace Corps volunteers have ever been called to \nserve on U.S. soil.\n  Through the goodwill and service of its volunteers, the Peace Corps \nalso plays a vital role in our public diplomacy efforts. Volunteers \ngive a human face to the term ``American,'' bringing personal knowledge \nof our ideals and attitudes to communities all over the world. In doing \nso, they help to erode the deep misconceptions of the United States \nthat exist in many cultures. Peace Corps volunteers are truly a top-\nnotch example of diplomacy through action.\n  Again, I congratulate the Peace Corps on its 45th anniversary, and \nconvey my deep gratitude to its thousands of current and former \nvolunteers for their service to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/03/senate-section/article/S1677-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1677-S1678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I today speak on a bill I introduced, and \nwhich the Senate passed last night, to extend the Education Flexibility \nPartnership Act of 1999, Ed-Flex. My State of North Carolina is one of \nten Ed-Flex states. As the citizens of North Carolina know well, gone \nare the days when an individual with just a high school diploma or GED \ncould make a good living in industries such as textiles and furniture. \nFor the future of North Carolina, it is imperative that we do all that \nwe can to assist all students, regardless of background, reach high \nacademic standards. Only through a strong public education system can \nwe secure a bright economic future for individual citizens and for our \ncommunities.\n  Ed-Flex is a program that allows the Secretary of Education to \ndelegate to states with strong assessment and accountability systems \nthe authority to waive certain Federal education requirements that may, \nin certain instances, impede local efforts to reform and improve \neducation. By allowing additional flexibility in their implementation \nof Federal programs, Ed-Flex is designed to help local districts and \ntheir schools implement the educational reforms needed to raise student \nacademic achievement.\n  The Ed-Flex waivers in North Carolina are helping local school \nsystems improve student achievement while meeting Federal No Child Left \nBehind requirements in a number of ways. Examples of how local schools \nand districts are using Ed-Flex to advance local reform strategies \ninclude: providing tutoring for low-achieving or at-risk students \nthrough coordinating Federal, state, and local services; developing \nmore inclusive parent involvement initiatives; collaborating and \nplanning with Head Start, developmental specialists, and faculty from \nlocal day care centers to facilitate a smoother transition and more \nappropriate placement of pre-K students; implementing a hands-on, \ninquiry-based science curriculum to promote critical thinking skills; \nproviding for ongoing literacy group instruction that allows students \nto move into and out of the groups, as necessary, during the school \nyear; and expanding afterschool science clubs and purchasing resources \nfor afterschool programs.\n  Ed-Flex was first enacted as a demonstration program in 1994 as part \nof Goals 2000: Educate America Act. Initially, the Secretary of \nEducation was authorized to designate six states as Ed-Flex \ndemonstration states. The 1996 amendments to the Goals 2000 legislation \nauthorized the granting of Ed-Flex\n\n[[Page S1678]]\n\nwaiver authority to six additional states. On April 29, 1999, the \nEducation Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 was signed into law, \nproviding all states that had rigorous assessment and accountability \nsystems the opportunity to participate. Because of North Carolina's \ncomprehensive assessment and statewide school accountability system, \nthe ABCs, North Carolina became an Ed-Flex state on December 19, 2000.\n  Ed-Flex has played a vital role in North Carolina's educational \nsystem by allowing local school districts to have the increased \nflexibility they need in the implementation of various Federal \neducation programs. I am proud of North Carolina's exceptional school \naccountability program. As a result of our strong accountability \nsafeguards, the Ed-Flex Program is helping our schools to meet the \ngoals of the No Child Left Behind Act. Continuing the Ed-Flex Program \nwill further enhance the efforts of North Carolina local districts and \nschools to ensure that all students achieve academic proficiency. I \nthank my colleagues for their support of this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/03/senate-section/article/S1678-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             AFRICAN UNION\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I wish to discuss the genocide in Darfur. \nWhile there have been many speeches given on this critical subject, I \nwant to take a moment to talk about a subject that has all too often \nbeen overlooked--the efforts of the African Union, AU.\n  At present, the Bush administration is helping to spearhead \ndiscussion on how to absorb the African Union force in Darfur into a \nlarger U.N. contingent with a far greater capacity to protect \ncivilians. I wholeheartedly agree with the administration that the \ncurrent formula for combating brutality in Darfur is insufficient. In \nfact, in December, Senator Brownback and I wrote an op-ed in the \nWashington Post advocating this very course of action.\n  At the same time, many government officials, and outside observers, \nhave given little regard to the efforts of the African Union Mission in \nSudan, AMIS.\n  We must start reversing this trend. I tip my hat to AMIS for its \nstrong efforts, under the most difficult of circumstances, over the \ncourse of the last 2 years.\n  The AU leadership, along with individual troop contributing \ncountries--such as Rwanda, Senegal, and Nigeria--made a decision to put \nAfrican lives on the line when the campaign of terror waged against \ncivilians was at its height. The AU leadership just as easily could \nhave said ``its too difficult, its too dangerous, this is somebody \nelse's problem.''\n  Instead, they took action.\n  In a geographically diverse and inhospitable terrain, the AU built \nits operations--the most complex in the organization's history--from \nscratch, at a time when thousands of Darfurian civilians were being \nethnically cleansed every month.\n  Although AMIS has just 5,000 troops and 2,000 observers and police \nspread out over a region the size of France, it has made a difference. \nCivilians on the ground in Darfur have reported that, where AU forces \nare present, they feel safer. An estimated 2 million civilians are now \nliving in camps. These civilians depend on humanitarian aid for their \nsurvival, and aidworkers report that their convoys would not be able to \nnavigate key areas without the invaluable escorts supplied by AMIS.\n  As security has deteriorated in Darfur over the last 4 months, \nlightly armed AMIS troops are increasingly the targets of assault, \nkidnapping, and murder.\n  Mr. President, has AMIS been a perfect mission? No. Is there room for \nimprovement? Yes. But, I know that those of us in the Senate who follow \nthis issue closely support what the AU is doing and want the AU to do \nmore of it.\n  In July, I traveled to the United Nations and met with \nrepresentatives of the AU and their member-states. There is no question \nthat it is a young organization in need of capacity-building. But, I \nsensed that there was great resolve to ensure AMIS succeeded.\n  Moving forward, I think it is important to recognize that the AMIS \nhas been an important first step for the AU. At the same time, I think \nthere is widespread recognition--belatedly in my view--that the \ngenocide in Darfur is an international, not only an African, issue.\n  I will use an analogy, albeit an imperfect one, with U.S. efforts in \nAfghanistan. While the United States is heavily involved in this \nnation, I believe that this is a situation with international \nramifications; a key reason that the international community should be \ndoing more to help stabilize this nation.\n  The same holds true for Darfur, where the challenges presented by a \nsavage conflict spilling across international borders outstrip the \nresources currently in place to effectively deal with it. The United \nNations and NATO should become more active.\n  This is not to take anything away from the efforts of the AU, who \nstepped in on their own to try to fill the security vacuum in Darfur. \nThe AU will be indispensable in the coming year at a time when security \nconditions are deteriorating, but before additional troops can be \ndeployed. As discussions progress about follow-on forces, it is clear \nthat those same African countries leading the current AU efforts in \nDarfur will be the essential core of any successor mission.\n  In my view, it is essential that the United States government take \nthe lead in rallying for AMIS the financial, military, and political \nsupport it needs to continue its essential work in Darfur and to \ntransform itself into the backbone of a larger, more mobile UN mission.\n  Again, I thank the AU for its efforts and believe now more than ever \nthat African leadership will be key to international success in Darfur.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/03/senate-section/article/S1678-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1678-S1679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL ROBERT L. SCOTT, JR.\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \nsorrow over the passing of a great American leader and one of my \npersonal heroes, BG Robert L. Scott, Jr. I first met General Scott in \n1993. I became an instant fan of this amazing man. We became good \nfriends sharing many hours of stories about his life and his love for \nAmerica. It was only 2 weeks ago that I spoke at the General Robert L. \nScott Heritage Society dinner. General Scott very kindly used to sign \ncopies of his book ``God Is My Co-Pilot'' for my military academy \ncadets. He never failed as a great ambassador and host to my wife \nJulie-Anne and her schoolchildren when she used to bring them to the \nAir Force Museum in Warner Robins, GA. The Museum of Aviation at Robins \nAir Force base has done a fine job capturing the life of this great man \nthat I would like to speak about today.\n  BG Robert L. Scott, Jr., world renowned World War II ``fighter ace'' \nand author of the 1943 book ``God Is My Co-Pilot,'' has gone to see his \nco-pilot. The spirited adventurer, who flew fighter missions with the \n``Flying Tigers'' in China, passed away quietly on February 27 at the \nage of 97. Known to his friends and family as ``Scotty,'' the retired \ngeneral lived his final two decades as the champion and cheerleader of \nthe Museum of Aviation in Warner Robins, GA.\n  General Scott's lifetime story and flying career is legendary. A West \nPoint graduate, he amassed over 33,000 flying hours in 60 years of \nflying. Official Army Air Force records credit him with 13 aerial \nvictories, but according to General Scott it was really 22, making him \none of the top Air Force ``aces'' of World War II.\n  Born on April 12, 1908, General Scott grew up in Macon, GA. He \ngraduated from Lanier High School in 1928. The summer between his \njunior and senior years of high school, he took a job as deck boy \naboard a Black Diamond Line freighter and sailed halfway around the \nworld. It was the beginning of a lifetime of adventure.\n  General Scott's lifelong ambition was to fly. At age 12, he flew a \nhome-built glider off the roof of a three story house in Macon, and \ncrashed landed amid the spikes of a Cherokee rose bush--the State \nflower of Georgia. As General Scott tells the story, ``Gliders were \nbuilt out of spruce, but I didn't have enough money, so I made mine out \nof knotty pine. I cleared the first Magnolia, but then the main wing \nstrut broke and I came down in Mrs. Napier's rose bushes. It's the only \nplane I ever crashed.''\n\n[[Page S1679]]\n\n  General Scott enlisted in the Georgia National Guard and finally \nreceived an appointment to West Point by President Hoover in 1928. Upon \ngraduation from West Point, he used the summer to sail to Europe. He \nbought a motorcycle in France, and motored across Europe and Asia \nturning around at Mt. Ararat. After returning from leave, he was \nassigned to the U.S. Army Flying Center at Randolph AFB, TX. He won his \nwings on October 17, 1933, and went off to his first assignment at \nMitchell Field, NY.\n  In 1934, President Roosevelt canceled commercial air mail contracts \nand gave the duty to the Air Corps. General Scott immediately \nvolunteered and flew airmail in an open cockpit plane through the \n``Hell Stretch''--as it was know then--from Newark, NJ, to Cleveland, \nOH. He then served a tour of duty at Albrook Field Panama. He became a \nflying instructor after that and advanced from lieutenant to lieutenant \ncolonel during the expansion program prior to World War II.\n  When World War II broke out, General Scott--at age 33--was running \nthe largest flight training academy in the country--Cal Aero Academy in \nCalifornia. To his dismay, he did not receive orders to go fight and \nwrote numerous letters begging to be assigned to a combat flying unit. \nHe was told he was too old to be a fighter pilot and he needed to stay \nin his job training younger pilots.\n  Finally one night, he received a call from the Pentagon. An \nintelligence officer asked him if he had ever flown a B-17. ``Scotty'' \nimmediately said yes even though he had never flown the four-engine \nbomber. His reply got him assigned to a secret Task Force Aquila to fly \nB-17s to China to bomb Japan. Flying days across the Atlantic, Africa, \nthe Middle East and finally to China, he received the news upon landing \nthat the mission was scrubbed because the Japanese had captured their \nplanned take-off bases in the Philippines.\n  He was assigned instead to fly Gooney Birds--C-47 transports--over \nthe Himalayas bringing fuel and supplies from India to combat bases in \nChina. Soon, General Scott, then a colonel, met GEN Claire Chennault, \ncommander of the American Volunteer Group in China known as the \n``Flying Tigers.'' General Scott convinced him to let him use a P-40 to \nfly escort missions for the transports and soon was flying daily combat \nmissions in addition to escort duty. In his first month of combat, he \nlogged 215 hours of flight time and soon became a double ``ace'' with \n13 confirmed aerial victories--he says it was really 22.\n  On July 4, 1942, at the request of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, \nGeneral Scott was given command of the 23 Fighter Group of the China \nAir Task Force, the Army Air Force unit activated with remnants of the \nFlying Tigers, later to become the 14th Air Force.\n  In January 1943, he was ordered back to the United States to make \npublic relations speeches to war plant personnel. He wrote the best \nseller, ``God Is My Co-Pilot,'' and served as technical advisor to \nWarner Brothers in making a movie based on the book. The World Premiere \nwas at the Grand Theater in Macon, GA, in 1945.\n  After the war, General Scott served in the Pentagon on a task force \nto win autonomy for the Air Force from the Army which occurred in \nSeptember of 1947. In that year he was given command of the Air Force's \nfirst jet fighter school at Williams Field, AZ. He then moved to Europe \nin 1950 to command the 36th Fighter Wing at Furstenfieldbruck, Germany. \nIn 1954, after graduating from the National War College he was promoted \nto brigadier general and assigned as Director of Information for the \nU.S. Air Force, retiring in 1957.\n  After retirement, he pursued his lifelong dream to walk the Great \nWall of China. Writing over 300 letters in 2 years to ask for official \npermission, General Scott signed on for a package tour to just get \ninside China. While there, he managed to get a visa and travel permit \nand in 93 days, with a 70-pound backpack including 1,200 oatmeal \ncookies he baked himself, he walked the 2,000 miles of the Great Wall \nto complete Marco Polo's trip that had fascinated him for 57 years. On \na 9,000 foot mountain overlooking Kunming, China--General Chennault's \nhome base in World War II--he left an engraved stone memorial to his \nformer boss: GENERAL CLAIRE LEE CHENNAULT. WE, YOUR MEN, HONOR YOU \nFOREVER.\n  In 1976, with special permission from General Gabriel, U.S. Air Force \nChief of Staff, he flew an F-16 ``Falcon'' fighter. Ironically, his \nfirst military airplane had also been Falcon, a Curtiss O-1G fabric \ncovered biplane.\n  In 1986, General Scott came to Warner Robins for the unveiling of an \nexhibit of his memorabilia at the Museum of Aviation. He was asked to \nstay and the next year moved to Warner Robins to become the head of the \nHeritage of Eagle Campaign which ultimately raised $2.5 million to \nbuild a 3-story Eagle Building at the museum.\n  In 1988, General Scott released his autobiography entitled ``The Day \nI Owned the Sky.'' That year, at age 82, he was cleared to fly in an \nAir National Guard F-15 Eagle from Dobbins Air Force Base in Marietta, \nGA. Two years later, he again flew the Eagle--this time at Robins Air \nForce Base in Warner Robins, GA. On April 2, 1997, in celebration of \nhis 89th birthday, General Scott flew his last flight in a B-1 bomber \nassigned to the 116th Bomb Wing at Robins Air Force Base. His flight \nlog closed with over 33,000 hours in the air--a record which few pilots \nhave ever reached.\n  General Scott leaves a daughter, Robin Fraser who lives in \nBakersfield, CA, a grandson, three granddaughters and several \ngrandchildren. Scott's wife of 38 years, Kitty Rix Green, of Fort \nValley, GA, died of cancer in 1972. General Scott will be greatly \nmissed by his family, his community, and his many friends over the \ncourse of his long and distinguished military and civilian career. He \nis a great American and I am extremely proud to call him a \nfriend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/03/senate-section/article/S1679-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING THE LATE ANNE BRUNSDALE\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to \nAnne Brunsdale, a Minnesota native and former chairwoman of the \nInternational Trade Commission who died of Alzheimer's disease on \nJanuary 20 at a nursing home in Denver. She was 82.\n  Ms. Brunsdale was born in Minneapolis and received a bachelor's \ndegree in political science in 1945 and a master's degree in Far \nEastern area studies in 1946 from the University of Minnesota. She \nreceived a master's degree in comparative government in 1949 from Yale \nUniversity.\n  In 1950, she moved to Washington to work for the CIA. Following the \nCIA, Anne was a resident fellow of the American Enterprise Institute \nfor Public Policy Research and Managing Editor of Regulation, a \nbimonthly magazine published by the institute, where she worked closely \nwith its two university-based editors, Antonin Scalia and Murray \nWeidenbaum. Under her guidance, Regulation became an influential \npublication in policy debates concerning government regulation of the \nenergy, transportation, and communications industries.\n  In 1985, President Reagan appointed Anne to the International Trade \nCommission where she served from 1986 to 1994, including a term as \nchairman from 1989 to 1990. She retired in 1994.\n  Anne was a much loved member of a group of friends made up mostly of \npolitical scientists and public intellectuals that were notable for \nbeing both high-powered and bipartisan.\n  Anne's survivors include a sister, 9 nieces and nephews, 17 great-\nnieces and nephews and 5 great-great nieces and nephews.\n  Mr. President, Anne Brunsdale will be remembered by friends and \nfamily with memorial services in Colorado and Minnesota. I extend my \nsympathy to them during this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/03/senate-section/article/S1679-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1679-S1680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         IN MEMORY OF JIM ROBB\n\n Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great man \nfrom Colorado, Jim Robb. A memorial celebration was held for him \nearlier this year and I ask for unanimous consent that this letter \ncelebrating his life be printed into the Record.\n  The letter follows.\n                                                 January 23, 2006.\n       Dear Friends: I wish I could be with you personally today \n     to honor Jim Robb.\n       Colorado lost a remarkable advocate with the death of Jim \n     Robb on February 20, 2005\n\n[[Page S1680]]\n\n     at age 69. Jim served Mesa County and the Western Slope as an \n     attorney, as a school board member, as a state representative \n     and as a federal magistrate judge. He served us ably and well \n     in all of these capacities, but it is in his work outside of \n     his career, his amazing dedication to doing all he could to \n     make his community a better place that keeps him in our \n     hearts and minds.\n       Jim had a vision for his community that is perhaps best \n     exemplified in his work on the Riverfront Trail, he could \n     look at that collection of junkyards and rotting tires and \n     see past it to a time when there would be a beautiful trail \n     along the Colorado River, running from Island Acres east of \n     Palisade to Corn Lake to Connected Lakes to Fruita. He had \n     the quiet ability to bring interested parties together to \n     work on a problem and find a solution without ever taking \n     credit for himself. His vision of a trail along the river \n     where others saw only junkyards has become a reality and the \n     State of Colorado has honored Jim Robb by renaming the \n     Colorado River State Park as the James M. Robb Colorado River \n     State Park.\n       Mesa County and Western Colorado are very blessed to have \n     benefited from a man with a vision, a man who knew how to get \n     things done by working quietly with all of the interested \n     groups, a very special man, whose love for the state of \n     Colorado, and Mesa County in particular lives on in the River \n     Front Trail he helped create, in the Old Spanish Trail he \n     worked to have declared a National Historic trail, in the \n     Kids Voting Program he envisioned and nurtured and in the \n     lives of those he left behind, most especially, his family, \n     his loving wife, children and grandchildren who continue his \n     legacy and were the light of his life. Those who were \n     privileged to know him are better people for it and our \n     community is a better community for his energetic proposals \n     for improvement. He was a great leader for the Western Slope \n     and for Colorado. And he was a good friend to me. We are \n     grateful for the life of James Montgomery Robb, and thank his \n     family for sharing him with us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Ken Salazar,\n     U.S. Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/03/senate-section/article/S1680-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Ms. COLLINS, from the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs, with an amendment in the nature of a \n     substitute:\n       S. 2128.

A bill to provide a cause of action for United States port \noperators with respect to the potential change of ownership of a \nterminal operator to a foreign entity, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on September 11, 2001, the \nlongshoremen who work on the docks in Newark, NJ, could see the flames \nand smoke from the World Trade Center. Many of those dock workers lost \na loved one or a friend that day. Of the three thousand people who \ndied, 700 were from New Jersey.\n  I have been to Port Newark many times before--I used to serve as a \nCommissioner of the Port Authority. This week I went back to Port \nNewark to tell those workers why I thought it was a bad idea to turn \ncontrol of their port over to the government of Dubai, the United Arab \nEmirates. I really didn't have to explain it to them. They understood \nwhy it is a bad idea--just as 70 percent of the American people \nunderstand.\n  Unfortunately, as of yesterday, a company owned by the government of\n\n[[Page S1681]]\n\nDubai now controls port operations in Newark--and five other major \nports in the United States. This is an outcome we have been trying to \nprevent. And if Congress had been given any warning, we would have \nprevented it.\n  Instead, the Bush Administration gave this deal a casual thumbs-up, \nwhen it deserved the highest scrutiny. Now the President is telling my \nconstituents in New Jersey--as well as residents of Philadelphia, \nBaltimore, South Florida and New Orleans--``don't worry.''\n  But that's not good enough.\n  By rubber stamping this deal, the Bush Administration sold out the \nFederal Government's ability to object to the deal. Any \n``investigation'' at this point is after-the-fact and all for show. You \ndon't buy a home before you look at it, and get it inspected. But \nthat's what the Bush Administration did in this case.\n  The people who work in our port, and those who live nearby, know \nbetter than anyone how important it is to keep our ports secure. That's \nwhy I am introducing legislation today that will empower our ports to \nterminate leases that pose a security threat to the port and the \nsurrounding community. My bill will give ports that power when the \ncompany that holds a lease is sold or taken over by a foreign company \nlike the Dubai-owned one in this case.\n  This is a valid approach. The Port Authority of New York and New \nJersey is already in court trying to invalidate the lease that was sold \nto Dubai Ports World. My bill would also encourage ports to do their \nown security assessment of transfers of ownership. It requires the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to assist our ports with those \nassessments.\n  We need to take this step to protect our constituents, because the \nBush Administration has left them high and dry. The Administration has \nbeen playing a shell game on this issue from the very beginning. First \nthey said no thorough investigation was needed, and approved the deal. \nThen came the public outcry. Now the Administration is supposedly \nconducting a ``thorough investigation.'' But it is a meaningless \ngesture--the deal was finalized already.\n  And before the so-called investigation even begins, President Bush \nhas already made up his mind. On Tuesday, President Bush said: ``My \nposition hasn't changed.'' So much for an objective investigation.\n  This is not a 45-day investigation. It's just a 45-day stalling \nperiod while the Administration hopes the American people will forget \nabout this problem. But we don't forget what happened on September 11--\nand we won't forget how the Administration tried to rubber-stamp this \ndeal.\n  My constituents are alarmed. And unfortunately, the Bush \nadministration hasn't displayed the competence that could restore \npublic confidence. We can't afford to wait 45 days while the \nAdministration stalls. The time to protect our constituents is now.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my bill, which will give local ports \nthe power to protect the American people.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2367\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Local Port Security Act of \n     2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FEDERAL CAUSE OF ACTION ESTABLISHED.\n\n       The owner of a United States port may file an action \n     seeking relief, including nullification of any contractual \n     obligation with any terminal operator within the port, in any \n     appropriate United States district court if a merger, \n     acquisition, or takeover transaction would result in a change \n     in the ownership of the terminal operator, and the new owner \n     would be a foreign controlled entity. Such relief may be \n     granted upon a showing by the owner of the port of a \n     demonstrated increase in the security risk to the port or the \n     port community as a result of such change in ownership.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to say a quick word about these \nnominees. What we just approved were six nominations to the Tennessee \nValley Authority Board of Directors. Nine years ago, I started working \non legislation to modernize and expand TVA's board of directors to \nbring it more in line with other corporations of similar size and scope \nand responsibility.\n  Just over a year ago, Congress passed my bill and this group of \nnominees is the first to the newly reformed TVA board. They are an \noutstanding group. All have substantial business and management \nexperience. All are leaders in their respective communities--just the \nkind of qualifications that we were looking for when we initially \ndrafted our reform modernization legislation. I commend the President \nfor nominating such a highly qualified group, and I look forward to \nworking with them on the many challenges facing TVA in the 21st \ncentury.\n  I thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for both \nfurthering this legislation along and passing it and going through the \nnomination process in a very respectable way.\n  These nominees--Dennis Bottorff, Robert Duncan, William Sansom, Susan \nRichardson Williams, Donald DePriest, and Howard Thrailkill--join two \nexisting current board members, Bill Baxter and Skila Harris. I guess \nthey are no longer nominees; they are on the TVA board.\n  I thank the Democratic leader and others for making this possible to \ndo today.\n  The nominations considered and confirmed en bloc are as follows:\n\n\n                       TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY\n\n       Dennis Bottorff, of Tennessee, to be a Member of the Board \n     of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority for a term \n     expiring May 18, 2011.\n       Robert M. Duncan, of Kentucky, to be a Member of the Board \n     of Director of the Tennessee Valley Authority for a term \n     expiring May 18, 2011.\n       William B. Sansom, of Tennessee, to be a Member of the \n     Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority for a \n     term expiring May 18, 2009.\n       Susan Richardson Williams, of Tennessee, to be a Member of \n     the Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority for \n     a term expiring May 18, 2007.\n       Donald R. DePriest, of Tennessee, to be a Member of the \n     Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority for a \n     term expiring May 18, 2009.\n       Howard A.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 357, H.R. 2830.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2830) to amend the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \n     reform the pension funding rules, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nat the desk, which is the text of S. 1783 as passed by the Senate, be \nagreed to, the bill, as amended, be read the third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and the Senate insist upon \nits amendment and request a conference with the House, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees at a ratio of 9 to 7.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2901) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The bill (H.R. 2830), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  The Presiding Officer appointed Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Lott, \nMs. Snowe, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Gregg, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Isakson, \nMr. Baucus, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nHarkin, and Ms. Mikulski conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this also is a major step forward, as \ncolleagues have been participating and watching the debate over the \ncourse of the day, to bring to conclusion another issue that has been \npending. But the fact we have been able to reach this resolution today \nadvances a very important issue--one that is time sensitive.\n  We had originally requested 7 to 5. As my colleagues know, the \nDemocratic leader insisted on an 8-to-6 ratio. The 9-to-7 ratio we \nagreed to does allow us to have equal representation from the Finance \nand HELP Committees. As I repeatedly insisted, it is important we not \nstack the deck in favor or against either committee. Through mutual \nagreement, we have reached that objective.\n  I do have to add, it is unfortunate it took so long and we had to \nhave so much discussion to get to conference on an issue so important \nto the 44 million Americans out there who right now are working in an \nuncertain environment as we address this defined benefits pension \nsystem.\n  Now is the time for our conferees to get to work, and I am confident \nthey will be able to produce a conference report that is satisfactory \nto both sides of the aisle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/03/senate-section/article/S1755-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
