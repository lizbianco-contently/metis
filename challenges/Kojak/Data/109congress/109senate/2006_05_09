Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration on the motion to proceed on S. 1955.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 417, a bill (S. 1955) to \n     amend title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \n     of 1974 and the Public Health Service Act to expand health \n     care access and reduce costs through the creation of small \n     business health plans and through modernization of the health \n     insurance marketplace, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time until \n10 a.m. shall be equally divided between the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. \nEnzi, and the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, or his designee.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am here this morning to ask this body to \nsupport the motion to proceed to the debate. All we are voting on is \nwhether we are going to get to debate, not whether we are going to have \nhealth insurance for small businesses. But if this vote does not get 60 \nvotes, we will not have the opportunity in this Congress to see whether \nwe can help out small businesses across this country.\n  The bill before us will provide for small businesses to be able to \njoin across State lines to negotiate against the insurance companies \nwith enough power to make a difference. This is something which the \nsmall businesses have been asking for for almost 15 years. In the last \n12 years, it has passed the House eight times but has never even gotten \nout of committee in the Senate until this year. The reason it got out \nof committee is because we have drastically changed the bill. We are \nnot talking about the old association health plans we had in the past. \nThis is one which has had some modifications that have been helped with \ninsurance companies and State insurance commissioners. It still keeps \nthe power of oversight and consumer protection in the hands of the \nState insurance commissioners, but it does allow the ability to unify \nthings so that we can get across State lines.\n  How is it doing? Well, the Washington Post says it went too far. The \nWall Street Journal says it didn't go far enough. So maybe we are \nsomewhere right there in the middle. But unless we get to debate this \nissue, we will never know until we can get through the motion to \nproceed and possibly 30 hours of still debating whether we are going to \ndebate before we ever get to a motion. So I am hoping that this morning \nwe can pass this motion to proceed.\n  I can't believe that any Senator here hasn't heard from enough small \nbusinessmen that he wouldn't allow us to proceed to the debate. I am \nhoping that following that motion to proceed to debate, we can limit \nthe hours of debating that particular motion and get on with the \nsubstance of trying to perfect a bill.\n  In my 9 years in the Senate, I have never seen a perfect bill. I am \nnot saying this is a perfect bill. I am saying it is one that has come \nout of compromise, long discussions, and has moved away from the point \nof huge objection on the Senate side to less objection on the Senate \nside. It is a bill that can be worked out, can be passed, and can have \na significant difference for\n\n[[Page S4164]]\n\nsmall companies across the United States.\n\n  Will it make a difference? There are several surveys that say it will \nmake a difference. I am saying that from the amount of advertising \nwhich was done before we even had the motion to proceed, there must be \na lot of big bucks in savings in this thing to have the kind of \nopposition we have already had on it. But we will never know unless we \nget the right to debate. So I am asking my colleagues to vote aye on \nthe motion to proceed so that we can proceed to a debate, sometime \nwithin the next 30 hours, hopefully.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to let me know when I \nhave 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. President, this should be a historic week. The Senate has the \nopportunity at last to have a debate on the basic questions of health \ncare. Senator Enzi has put forward a proposal that deserves debate and \nthe opportunity for amendment, and I commend him for his diligence in \nbringing forward his proposal. But after careful study and debate, I \nbelieve the Senate will conclude that the course laid out in this \nproposal is the wrong one for health care.\n  The legislation will make health care coverage less affordable and \nless accessible for millions of Americans. It will raise premiums for \nAmericans when they are older or when they fall ill. It will mean the \nend of laws to guarantee coverage for cancer, for diabetes, for mental \nhealth parity, and other essential services. It will undermine the laws \nthat protect consumers from fraud and abuse, and it will give no real \nhelp to the self-employed.\n  We have a better approach. The proposal offered by Senators Durbin \nand Lincoln will allow small businesses to band together to get the \nsame low rates offered to larger employers. It provides real help for \nsmall businesses with the high costs of health care through tax credits \nand reinsurance programs to defray the cost of the most expensive \nclaims.\n  When our debate concludes, I believe the Senate will agree with the \nover 200 organizations that have written letters of opposition to this \nlegislation. These organizations represent patients with diabetes and \ncancer and mental health needs. They represent older Americans, \nworkers, health care professionals, small businesses, and Americans in \nall walks of life. They represent the over 15,000 Americans who have \ncalled the Senate to ask this body to oppose legislation that will take \na step backward from our commitment to quality health care, and they \nrepresent the millions more who will be harmed if we do not reject the \nlegislation before us.\n  We have heard from Governors, insurance commissioners, and attorneys \ngeneral from Maine to Hawaii and from Florida to Alaska, and all of \nthem--all of them--have urged the Senate to reject this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the current legislation, but I hope \nthey will vote to proceed to consideration of this bill. The Senate has \nbeen denied the chance to take action on major health priorities for \ntoo long. Next week, seniors will be forced to pay a steep penalty if \nthey are unable to navigate through the tangle of confusing Medicare \nplans and options. The Senate ought to vote on Senator Nelson's \nproposal to let seniors make their choice without the threat of heavy \nfines if they do not meet this arbitrary deadline.\n  The Republican Medicare law also includes a provision so contrary to \ncommonsense that people hardly believe you when you tell them it was \nincluded. The legislation makes it illegal for Medicare to bargain for \ndiscounts on drugs for seniors. We have a proposal to end that shameful \nprohibition, and we should vote on that proposal.\n  On Medicaid, we should take action to end the cruel cuts imposed on \nthe poorest of our fellow citizens by the Deficit Reduction Act, which \npaid for tax cuts for the wealthy through health cuts for the poor.\n  We have been promised and promised that the Senate would vote on drug \nimportation, but the vote never comes. Senator Dorgan, Senator Snowe, \nSenator McCain, and I have a proposal that will allow safe importation \nof lower cost medicines from Canada and elsewhere. Surely, Health Week \nis the time for a vote.\n  Before the week is out, the Senate should see that the promise of \nstem cell research--stem cell research--is no longer denied to the \nmillions of patients and their families who look on with anger and \nbewilderment as the bill passed by the House languishes for month after \nmonth after month in the Senate. And we have failed year in and year \nout to fulfill the promise of this century of the life sciences by \nmaking quality care a right for every American. Let us at long last \ntake action to extend quality care to every American.\n  So I say to my colleagues: Vote for cloture on this motion. Vote for \na health care debate. Vote for a chance to go on record with your \nanswer to these important questions on Medicare, on Medicaid, on stem \ncell research, on drug importation, on coverage, and on many other \nhealth priorities. Let's have a debate, and let's let the Senate decide \nwhere it stands.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nhis encouragement on his side of the aisle to vote for the motion to \nproceed. I think that will get us into a debate that will make a \ndifference for the working people of America, the people up the street \nand across the street, the working families that are a part of small \nbusiness.\n  Today, there are 45 million people in the United States who are \nwithout health insurance in this country. Twenty-two million people own \nor work for small businesses or live in families that depend on small \nbusiness wages, and another 5 million are unemployed. Those are the 27 \nmillion people we are talking about whom this health care bill will be \nmaking decisions for in the next few days.\n  It is long past time for Congress to take some action. The American \npeople aren't going to accept excuses any longer. It has been a long \ntime getting to this debate. I am pleased that it sounds like we will \nbe able to have it. I welcome any amendments that are alternate \napproaches or improvements to this bill. I know what the complaints are \nout there, I know what the counters to those are, and I know what the \nconcerns are. It is very important that when we walk away from this \nweek, we walk away with a plan which will help the small business \npeople of the United States, the ones working for small businesses, the \nones owning them, and their families who need the help.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time? Each side has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will mention at this time some of the \norganizations. We will have a chance during the course of the debate to \nget into the reasons why. The American Academy of Pediatrics; the \nAmerican Cancer Society; the Diabetes Association; the Nurses \nAssociation; Families USA; the lists of Governors--and I will include \nthose--more than probably 15, 18 Governors; the attorneys general. I \nthink there are probably close to 40 of the attorneys general \nrepresenting States North, South, East, and West who have opposed this \nbill. The Insurance Commissioners of the States--a whole list of those. \nAt the appropriate time, I will include those in the Record.\n  I hope our colleagues will put their ear to the ground and find out \nwhat people are saying back home, what your cancer society, diabetes, \npediatric nurses and doctors are saying about this, what the attorneys \ngeneral are saying about this, and what those in the medical profession \nare saying about this. We think we have a better way to help small \nbusiness, and during the course of the debate, we will show how that \ncan be done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming has 56 seconds.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nlisting those 200 organizations. I have never done a count on them, and \nI am not familiar with quite that many; I am only familiar with about \n40 that have expressed some concern that I suspect will be taken care \nof in amendment if we can get to the amendment process.\n\n[[Page S4165]]\n\n  I would like to mention that there are over 200 business \norganizations that are looking forward to being able to unite these \npeople across State lines to get lower rates for their people. There \nare actually 80 million employees in those businesses, in those \norganizations. The realtors are going to be here with 9,000 people next \nweek, expecting that we will have already taken action. The National \nFederation of Independent Businesses is another big one that is \nsupporting this. I could mention a lot more. Even some of the \nassociations that have concerns about it want to be sure that this bill \npasses so their employees can be covered.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. By unanimous consent, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the standing rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 417, S. 1955, Health Insurance \n     Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act of 2005.\n         Bill Frist, Johnny Isakson, Sam Brownback, John Thune, \n           Thad Cochran, Wayne Allard, John Ensign, Richard \n           Shelby, Larry Craig, Ted Stevens, John McCain, Lamar \n           Alexander, Norm Coleman, Judd Gregg, Pat Roberts, Craig \n           Thomas, Richard Burr.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the postcloture \ndebate on the motion to proceed be divided as follows: From now until \n11 a.m. will be under majority control; from 11 to 11:30 will be under \nminority control; 11:30 to 12 will be under majority control; and noon \nto 12:30 will be under minority control.\n  The Senate will stand in recess from 12:30 to 2:15 p.m. I ask that \ntime count under the provisions of rule XXII. The time from 2:15 to \n2:30 will be equally divided between the majority and minority; from \n2:30 to 3 we begin majority control, with the next 30 minutes under \nminority control, and each 30 minutes rotating in this format until the \nhour of 5:30 p.m.\n  Before the Chair rules, we would like to make out a time certain to \nbegin consideration of the bill. In the interim, this unanimous consent \nallows the Senate to have an orderly debate for speakers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank virtually all Members in the Senate \nfor their help in getting the motion to proceed. That will allow us to \ndo 30 more hours of debate before we actually get into the substance of \nmaking any changes in the bill. I hope we can work out a unanimous \nconsent agreement that will shorten that time and get us into the meat \nof the debate. I will push for some rapid consideration of some \namendments so we can get this resolved for the small businessmen of \nthis country in short order.\n  I will address some of the charges made against this bill. I listened \nyesterday and the day before to the minority leader's speech to the \nSenate on Friday. I was surprised by several of the statements he made \nregarding this bill. If I had not already known that he was talking \nabout S. 1955, I would never have guessed it.\n  The first comment the minority leader made was that our bill \nthreatens the coverage of those who have insurance now and does nothing \nto extend coverage to those who need it. I make two points in response \nto that. First, it seems to me the status quo is what is truly \nthreatening the coverage of those who are insured now. Prices are going \nup dramatically. Small business has no leverage. No one can afford more \nof the same or more excuses from Washington.\n  Blocking an honest debate on this bill is a vote for more of the \nsame. It is a vote for health insurance costs continuing to rise \ndramatically, for more small businesses dropping coverage for their \nemployees, and for more uninsured American families. Year after year of \nmore of the same is what is truly threatening America's health care \nsecurity.\n  Second, this bill will indeed extend coverage to more people who need \nhealth insurance. If you do not believe me, listen to our nonpartisan \nCBO. The CBO says this bill will reduce health insurance costs for \nthree out of every four small businesses. The CBO also said the bill \nwill extend private health coverage insurance to 750,000 more people \nthan have it today.\n  Is that a comprehensive solution to the problems of health care and \nthe uninsured? Of course not. I understand this is not a comprehensive \nsolution to the problem of health care costs and the uninsured, but it \nis definitely a step in the right direction and a building block for \nthe future.\n  I have more comments about statements made about the bill in ads and \nin editorials, but at this point, I release the remainder of our time \nuntil 11 o'clock to the Senator from Missouri who has been working on \nthis in the House for years in a totally different version but has \nbrought his expertise, talent, and knowledge to this side of the \nbuilding. He has been a strong advocate for doing something for small \nbusinesses. He has been extremely cooperative in finding ways to do \nthings so we can have something for small businesses.\n  I relinquish the floor to the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Talent.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his \nkind words and his great work and his comments regarding my involvement \nwith the idea of small business health plans. What he said is true \nregarding my involvement. I am not the father of this idea, but I think \nI probably ``midwifed'' it years and years ago when I served in the \nHouse in 1997. It has passed the House on a regular basis ever since \nthen and, as the chairman knows, on a very strong bipartisan basis \nbecause the idea of small business health plans is fully within the \nmainstream of both parties' thinking which is one of the very powerful \narguments in favor of it.\n  The No. 1 issue facing small business today as a whole is not energy \ncosts, although certainly they are too high. It is not immigration, \nalthough that is definitely an issue. It is not taxes, although we all \nhear our share of complaints from small business people about that. It \nis the rising cost of health insurance and the number of\n\n[[Page S4166]]\n\npeople who do not have health insurance. That is largely a small \nbusiness problem.\n  There are 45.8 million Americans who are uninsured today, 4 million \nmore than 2001. That number has grown every year, in years of \nprosperity or recession. The vast majority of those uninsured people \nare working people. And most of those working people are people who \nwork for a small business. They work for a small business, they own a \nsmall business, or they are dependents of someone who works for or who \nowns a small business.\n  The smaller the business is, the worse the problem gets. Only 40 \npercent of businesses with 3 to 6 employees today have health insurance \nfor their employees and that number is down from 52 percent in 2004 and \n58 percent in 2002.\n  We are entitled to ask ourselves, Why? I have heard a lot of \nexplanations over the years. Why does small business have a problem \nproviding health insurance for its employees whereas bigger companies \ndon't? You would be surprised at the explanations offered. I had one \nwitness from the Government Accountability Office tell me that he did \nnot think employees of small business wanted health insurance. I have \nother people speculate that small employers did not care as much about \ntheir people who work for them as big companies do. That certainly will \ncome as a revelation to Senators that big corporate employers care more \nabout their employees than the small business owners and managers do--\nthe small business people who work on a daily basis with their \nemployees, the small business people who would like to get health \ninsurance themselves from the small business if they could figure out a \nway for the small business to provide that health care to the \nemployees.\n  It is not a question of the small business people caring enough. The \nproblem is, the cost and complexity of getting health insurance for a \nsmall business is greater than it is for a big business. It will \nsurprise no one who has common sense that it is harder to insure a \nsmall market, a small group, than a big group. The cost of insurance is \nless if you can spread it across a bigger pool of people. This has been \nstudied extensively, and that very commonsense conclusion has been \nvalidated.\n  I will go over some of the figures for the Senate. Health insurance \npremiums for small business people increased by 10.9 percent in 2001, \n12.9 in 2002, 13.9 in 2003, 11.2 percent in 2004, and 9.2 percent in \n2005.\n  The smallest firms have always seen bigger increases in premiums. \nWhy? Well, the SBA's Office of Advocacy has found that small businesses \ntypically spend much more than large businesses for the same benefits. \nNot that the benefit packages are different, not that small businesses \nare trying to buy more expensive benefit packages; they have to spend \nmore to get the same benefits because the administrative costs of some \nbenefits are almost 14 times more for the smallest firms than for their \nlargest counterparts.\n  According to the Government Accountability Office, from 20 to 25 \npercent of small employer premiums typically go toward expenses other \nthan benefits compared with about 10 percent for large employers. The \nsmall business people are paying more to get the same benefits because \nthey have higher overhead costs and higher administrative costs. They \ndo not enjoy the same economies of scale the big companies enjoy.\n  The American people know this. I have a lot of stories from Missouri \nI could tell. I do not have the time. But the American people are \nliving with this every day.\n  Jim Henderson is the president of Dynamic Sales in St. Louis. It is a \nthird-generation family business that sells welding accessories and \nother products. It is a small business. He has eight employees. Health \ninsurance has been a problem for 16 years for Jim. He spoke with his \ninsurance agent, who suggested raising the deductible to keep the \npremium the same, so he has raised the deductible. It has gone from \nzero to a $1,000 deductible in the last 10 years. So despite that huge \nincrease in the deductible, to this day, he experiences huge increases \neach time he tries to renew the policy. When he asked his carrier about \nthe enormous increases and why they are raising his premiums so much, \nthe carrier responded: Well, because we can.\n  Tammy Herbert is a certified optician from Farmington, MO. She is a \ncancer survivor. She had breast cancer. She is a single, working mom. \nShe is an inspiration when you talk to her. She told me because of her \nhistory of breast cancer, 2 years ago her employer's insurer canceled \nall the individual policies for her and her colleagues.\n  People talk about small business health plans resulting in cherry-\npicking. They ought to see what is happening today in the small group \nmarket.\n  Renee Kerckhoff is the second generation owner of Rudroff Heating & \nAir Conditioning, in Belton, MO. She can only afford to cover a small \nportion of employee insurance premiums--about $150 a person per month. \nAs a result, and despite her best efforts, her employees are having to \ndrop their health insurance because they cannot afford the copays and \nthe premiums they have to make and are going on public assistance.\n  These stories are happening all over Missouri and all over the \ncountry. Sometimes I will get with a group of people and ask them: \nLook, if you had a history of medical illness, and you had the choice \nof working for a big company or a small company, and all you cared \nabout was health insurance, and all you knew about the companies was \nthat one was a big Fortune 500 company and the other was a small \ncompany, which one would you work for? I have never had anybody raise \ntheir hand and say: I would work for the small company because the \nassumption is I am going to get better health insurance from the small \nbusiness.\n  They know, because it is a matter of common sense, insuring a large \npool of people is more efficient, more economical and, therefore, less \nexpensive than insuring a small group of people.\n  Just look at the people who are insured in the country. Virtually \neverybody who has health insurance, except for the employees of small \nbusiness people, have it as part of a big national pool. It may be \npublic, it may be private, but it is a big national pool. They work for \na big company. They are in a labor union. They are on Medicare or \nMedicaid or they are a Federal employee or a retired Federal employee \nor in the VA.\n  All these other organizations could insure on a small group basis if \nthey wanted to. The Federal Government could go out and take each \nsection of Federal employees in different cities and divide them all up \nand insure them in a small group. There is no law against that. \nMicrosoft could do the same thing. Hallmark in Missouri could. \nAnheuser-Busch in Missouri could. They could insure each little section \nif they wanted to. Well, they do not because it does not make any \nsense. It would cost them more money to do it. Yet small business \npeople have to do that every day.\n  So what is the answer? Well, there is a simple answer that is out \nthere. Everybody tries to make it more complicated than it is, but it \nis simple: Empower the small business people to do what the big \nbusiness people can already do. Allow them to pool together through \ntheir trade associations and get health insurance as part of a big, \nnational, voluntary, efficient, economical pool.\n  I give an example: I think it is the best way to describe it. Take a \nrestaurant owner such as my brother, who owns a little restaurant. It \nis kind of a tavern restaurant. It is a great place. It has great \nchicken sandwiches. And I highly recommend it to you if you get to \nMissouri. He does not have health insurance for his people. It is too \nexpensive. It is complex and foreboding for him. He and my sister-in-\nlaw run the business. They do not want to have to wrestle with big \ninsurance companies. They are afraid if something goes wrong, they \ncould get sued. He would like to have health insurance. Then he could \nget it through the business, too.\n  Now, what if the National Restaurant Association could contract with \nbig insurance companies? They could be his employee benefits section, \njust like big companies have an employee benefits section. By joining \nthe National Restaurant Association, he automatically would have the \nright to join the big pool. They would send him the papers. They would \nshow him the options he\n\n[[Page S4167]]\n\nhas, and he could decide how much he wants to pay. He could let his \nemployees pay the rest and join the pool. He could have health \ninsurance as part of a big pool. It would be must-offer, must-carry. \nThey would have to let him join the National Restaurant Association and \nwould have to offer the health insurance to him.\n  When I chaired the Small Business Committee in the House, we studied \nthis issue. And I have seen a lot of other studies since then. The best \nestimates I saw were that it would reduce premiums for small employers \nby 10 to 20 percent; a recent study came out and said 12 percent. There \nwould be a million fewer people uninsured.\n  It costs the taxpayers nothing. It is not a Government program. It is \nempowering small business people to do what big business people already \ncan do. I think the impact would be much greater than the studies have \nshown because right now the psychology of health insurance, if you are \na small business, is so negative. I think you would see whole segments \nof the economy, which traditionally have not provided health insurance \nto their employees, begin to provide health insurance. And the \nrestaurant business is one of them. It is one of the reasons the \nNational Restaurant Association is so strongly in favor of this \nconcept.\n\n  Now I have talked about this for almost 10 years. I lay it out for \npeople, and they say to me: Well, who would oppose this? I actually get \nthat question a lot: Who is opposed to it? And that is a good question. \nIt is fully within the mainstream of both parties' philosophy. It is \nempowering the little guy, just like farm co-ops. It passes the House \nwith a strong, bipartisan majority every year. And why shouldn't it?\n  What is the downside of it? The downside is: It does not work as well \nas we hope it is going to work. Not as many people go into it as we \nhope and believe will go into it.\n  It is not as though the taxpayers are going out on a limb. So who is \nopposed to it? Well, nobody will be surprised to hear that the big \ninsurance companies have opposed it, and they have come up with all \nsorts of excuses over the years. I am not going to go heavily into it \nbecause the chairman has worked very hard to get as much consensus as \nhe can get. But I will say this. I think they oppose it not because \nthey are afraid it will not work but because they believe it will work. \nAnd they control most of the small group market now. I do not have time \nto go through those figures. But the concentration of the small group \nmarket within the five largest carriers has grown and grown and grown. \nAnd small business health plans would be a powerful, new competitive \nforce in that market.\n  The State insurance commissioners have been concerned because these \nsmall business health plans would be national and they felt the State \nwould not be able to regulate it. In fairness, I have to say, I have \nnever agreed with that. Remember, the big companies already operate \nfree of State regulation. That has been the law for 30 years. And we \nhave not had any disasters as a result of that. I do not believe \nanything that has happened in the last 10 years or so is proof that we \ncan trust the big companies more than we can trust the small companies.\n  If I had to decide who was going to be free of State regulation, I \nthink I would rather have the small businesses free of that. And it is \nnot as though the market the States have regulated never has any \nproblems. There are a lot of insurance companies that go bankrupt, and \nthe States have to take them over.\n  But the good news is that the chairman has squared this circle. He \nhas worked out an arrangement for the regulation of small business \nhealth plans where many of the State regulations and much of the State \nregulatory authority will still apply. I am not saying the State \ninsurance commissioners are standing up for his bill, but I think it is \nsafe to say that many of their objections have been ameliorated, and \nthe chairman has made much progress on that front.\n  Folks who tend to be sincerely on the ideological extreme on health \ncare issues--and maybe ``extreme'' is the wrong word, but they want to \ngo one way or the other--have been lukewarm about small business health \nplans. There are some who wish to eliminate the employer system and \ntake the Federal tax deduction and pass it through to individuals and \nlet them go out and buy health insurance on their own, and there are \nothers who want a total Government solution. And this is not any one of \nthose things.\n  It is a substantial and important and meaningful but incremental \nchange in the world we are in. It makes things better for people on a \nday-to-day basis who are out struggling in the real world. Maybe it is \nnot the reform that any of the think tanks on the right or left would \ncome up with, but it makes a difference. It will help. There is little \nor no downside to it. We need to help the real people who are really \nhurting.\n  Finally--and this I understand entirely; I struggled with this myself \nin the years I had this bill--the groups that have worked to get \nvarious disease mandates in the States have been concerned. Because if \nyou worked hard to get a mandate so that mammogram screening is covered \nin your State as a matter of right, and small business health plans go \ninto a national pool, just like the big companies, if we do not do \nsomething, they would not be subject to those State mandates.\n  I have made a point in talking with these groups over the years \nsaying that, look, the big company plans, the big pools that exist out \nthere--the labor unions, the company plans, the Federal employee plans; \nall those sorts of things--they usually cover all those mandated \ncoverages, anyway, because most of them are pretty common sense.\n  Again, remember, if you have been sick, and you have a choice of \nworking for a big company that is not covered by the State mandates or \na little company that is, which do you think has the better health \ninsurance? The folks I have talked to over the years say: Well, we \nwould go with the big company.\n  But I think we are going to be able to square that circle as well. \nSenator Snowe is going to offer an amendment which will represent \nprogress in this area. It will provide that if 26 States cover a \nmandate, that mandate applies to small business health plans, and it is \nprotected in the States that have it. So this is progress. It is not \njust net progress; it is absolute progress for these various groups \nthat have sought these protections because they are going to have, if \nthat amendment passes--and, certainly, I am going to support it--they \nwill have protections on the Federal level for the first time for these \nvarious coverages.\n  So I am very hopeful they will take a look at this. I believe with \nthe amendment Senator Snowe is going to offer, the concerns they had \nnot only do not apply anymore, but actually they are going to be better \noff because for the first time we are going to have national pools set \nup under Federal law with certain basic patient protections and \ncoverages that are guaranteed. As I said, I do not think those would be \nnecessary because I think the pools would cover them, anyway. Most of \nthose are pretty common sense. But we can put them in the law and \nreassure everybody. And I think we can make the bill better if we do \nthat.\n  I see my time is running out, Mr. President.\n  So what is left? Why should we oppose this? I do not want to be \npresumptuous. I have lived with this bill for so long that maybe there \nare weaknesses I do not see. But this is something we can do for \npeople. It passes the House regularly. They like it over there. It has \na strong measure of bipartisanship, anyway. There is no real downside \nto it.\n  Let's debate the bill, and let's resolve that we are going to debate \nit with a view toward actually voting on it.\n  I hope nobody filibusters this bill. We can work out agreements about \ndebate, work out agreements about amendments, and have a chance to help \npeople. This is a problem. This is a case where people are hurting. I \nknow politics is important here; I know this is an election year; I \nknow all of that. But we can make a difference for real people on the \nground every day who are worried about losing their health insurance or \nwho do not have health insurance and are worried about getting sick. We \nought to do it.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding. It looks as though my time has \nexpired. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 minutes. Senator Kennedy \nis\n\n[[Page S4168]]\n\nnot here right now, but pursuant to previous agreement, I would like to \nbe notified when 15 minutes expires so I can conclude my remarks in the \n20 minutes.\n  I spoke yesterday about this legislation. I want to begin by saying \nto my friend from Wyoming, the chairman, I have a great deal of regard \nfor him. I have enjoyed working with him on the HELP Committee. We do a \nlot of work together. I have enjoyed that relationship. It is with a \nnote of sadness that I disagree with him about this bill. We had a \nlengthy markup. He was very patient to listen to all of our ideas and \nthe amendments we offered during the markup. I appreciated his \nwillingness to do so. But as happens from time to time, we have \ndisagreements. They are not personal. They are ideas on which we have a \ndifferent point of view. Today is one of those occasions. These remarks \nare in no way intended to denigrate the work of the chairman of the \ncommittee or those who agree with him.\n  There are those of us who believe strongly that this proposal would \ndo a lot more harm than good, that, in fact, the cure being proposed \nwith this legislation creates far more problems than presently exist, \nas bad as the present situation is. We know, as a matter of fact, that \nover the last 3 years, the premium cost for health care has risen: 9 \npercent in 2005, 11 percent in 2004, 14 percent in 2003. These costs \ncontinue to rise. A family of four today is paying about $11,000 in \npremiums for health care coverage. The problem is significant.\n  I regret in some ways--and this is not the fault of the chairman of \nthe committee--that we are not debating in a broader sense how we might \naddress the far more significant issue, as important as this one is, \nwhen we have 45 million fellow Americans with no health care coverage \nat all. I regret that we are not having a larger debate on that issue.\n  Secondly, I believe it is a legitimate issue to raise the issue of \nhow small business is dealt with when it comes to insurance. In the \nnext 2 days, we will offer a substitute to the proposal authored by the \nchairman of the committee, the Senator from Wyoming, that we believe \nwill deal far more thoroughly with the legitimate issues that smaller \nbusinesses face. In fact, we redefine small business to mean businesses \nnot with 50 employees or less but 100 employees or less, thereby \ncovering more small businesses than would be covered by the legislation \nbefore us.\n  The problems are huge in the area of health care. If you do surveys \nof the American public and ask them to identify what are the largest \nconcerns they have, if not the No. 1 issue--from time to time other \nissues may be more important to people--consistently year in and year \nout, people will tell you their great concern is about the fear of \nwatching a family member or themselves be hit with a major health care \ncrisis and not having the resources to pay for it, not being able to \nget the doctors, not being able to have the kind of care they would \nwant for their families because they cannot afford the premiums that \nwould provide them broader coverage, if they have any kind of coverage \nat all. They may not have any kind of health care. This is a major \nproblem. We ought to be spending a lot more time addressing this issue \nthan we are.\n  Having said that, let me talk about this proposal. I am deeply \nworried about it. It isn't just my concern. Many Governors, more than \nthree-quarters of the attorneys general of the States which we \nrepresent, not to mention the health insurance commissioners of many \nStates, have raised very serious concerns about this legislation. They \nare very worried about what this bill will do to their constituents, \nthe States that we represent as Senators.\n  Let me share a letter from the Connecticut Business and Industry \nAssociation. This association represents 5,000 small employers in my \nState. This is not an organization that is known for its liberal \ntendencies. Quite the contrary, it is a very conservative business \ngroup. Listen to what my business group that represents the small \nbusinesses of my State has to say about this bill.\n\n       We believe that in Connecticut federally certified AHPs \n     would destabilize the small business insurance marketplace, \n     erode carefully crafted consumer protections and raise \n     premium rates for small businesses with older workforces and \n     those that employ people with chronic illnesses or \n     disabilities.\n\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       Although the passage of AHP legislation would present us \n     with opportunities to expand our CBIA health connection's \n     product customer base as a regional offering, we do not \n     believe that the proposed legislation represents a sound \n     public policy for providing more affordable coverage or \n     access to health care benefits. The proposed legislation does \n     little to address the underlying causes of health care \n     inflation, which is the most important barrier to small \n     employers providing health care benefits.\n\n  That is a strong letter from an organization that represents 5,000 \nsmall employers in the State of Connecticut. They are worried about \nwhat this bill will do to smaller employers in my State in terms of \ntheir costs. They are deeply worried about this legislation and what it \nmay mean.\n  Let me also share with my colleagues a second chart. This was a chart \nthat was produced by Families USA, with estimates from the Agency for \nHealth Care Research and Quality, a medical expenditure panel, and from \nthe U.S. Census Bureau. It tells us the number of people that will be \nlosing State regulatory protections if this bill is passed. What we are \ndoing is shrinking the amount of benefits that can be offered. In my \nState, we offer a range of 30 different benefits--that was passed by my \nState legislature--that insurance companies must cover. If you are \ngoing to do business in my State, then you have to provide coverage for \nthese 30 areas that we believe are important.\n  I note this morning an editorial in the Wall Street Journal that \ncriticizes those of us who have raised issues about this bill. They say \nin one paragraph:\n\n       Some provider groups are opposed for nakedly self-interest \n     reasons since it would allow plans to bypass state \n     regulations mandating coverage for, say, chiropractors.\n\n  Chiropractors provide some decent services to people. But with all \ndue respect, I would suggest that it is a lot more than chiropractors \nwho get bypassed with this legislation. It is things such as diabetes, \ncancer screening, infant health care, mental health care, pregnancy, \nLyme disease, to mention a few. I know several of my colleagues have \nhad family members affected by Lyme disease. My State thinks that is an \nimportant area to provide coverage. This bill would eliminate coverage \nfor Lyme disease because this legislation would mandate that Federal \nlaw would supersede State law. Regardless of what your State thinks is \nimportant, this bill will decide what will be covered. Everything else \ngoes. That is an overreach, in my view. As a result, the analysis of \nthe legislation presented on this chart suggests that in the State of \nAlabama, 1.7 million people who would be adversely affected if this \nlegislation is passed. In Connecticut, more than a million people would \nlose benefits that the State legislature requires the insurance \nindustry to cover. In State after State, the numbers are at least in \nthe six-figure category. In California, 12 million people would be \nadversely affected, Kentucky over a million people, Kansas over a \nmillion people, Illinois almost 4 million people, and the like.\n  I will leave this chart so my colleagues will be able to see how many \npeople will be affected in their States, according to data collected by \nthose who have examined what it would mean to a Federal mandate that \ntells every State in the country: We don't care what you have done, we \ndon't care what benefits you think are important, this bill will tell \nyou what kind of coverage you are going to have.\n  We also prohibit the States by preempting their ratings rules, which \nis my second point. This legislation preempts the States from having \nrating rules that will actually determine what the difference in cost \nwould be between young and healthy workers and older, sicker workers, \nto make sure they are not going to price the product so beyond the \nreach of an older, less healthy person that it would be unaffordable. \nIt is de facto exclusion if you allow the insurance industry to set \nthat price by preempting the States from determining whether there \nought to be a cap on how much an insurance company can charge. By \nlimiting benefits and by preempting the States from determining rates \nand holding them down,\n\n[[Page S4169]]\n\nwe make it very difficult for literally millions of people to be \npositively affected by this legislation.\n  Those are the two major concerns we have. There are other areas that \nwe will certainly raise. I mentioned earlier in my State, more than a \nmillion people will lose access to cancer screening, well childcare, \ndiabetes supplies, alcoholism treatment, mental health care, the \ntreatment for Lyme disease, to mention some. The list goes on with my \nState.\n  In addition to seeing their benefits disappear, millions of Americans \nwill see their health insurance premiums skyrocket as well. This bill \npreempts State laws that currently protect older workers, those with \nserious illnesses such as diabetes, cancer, and heart disease, even \nexpectant mothers, from seeing their premiums increase. This bill will \nallow the insurance industry to charge people more based on the fact \nthat they are sick or pregnant or simply older.\n  I have many insurance companies in my State, as my colleagues know, \nthat do a wonderful job in many ways. But don't have any illusions \nabout this. They are going to be offering as few benefits as they can \nget away with and charge as much as they can. That is what they are in \nbusiness for. This is not the Vista Program or AmeriCorps. These are \nprivate companies. If we give them a green light to limit the benefits \nyou can provide and take the caps off what they can charge, then, \nobviously, they are going to take advantage of it. I am greatly \nconcerned, as the major business organization in my State warns. When \nthe Connecticut Business and Industry Association says this bill would \nhurt the businesses in my State, we ought to take note of it. This \norganization has a strong record of protecting the interests of smaller \nbusinesses.\n  It doesn't take an expert to predict what will happen. Insurance \ncompanies are going to offer plans with minimal or no benefits, hoping \nto attract young and healthy workers. Older, sicker people are going to \nbe left without a plan that meets their needs. Every analysis of this \nbill reaches the same conclusion.\n  Listen to what the Congressional Budget Office says. They found the \nbill ``would tend to reduce health insurance premiums for small firms \nwith workers who have relatively low expected costs for health care and \nincrease premiums for firms with workers who have relatively high \nexpected costs.\n  In other words, instead of attacking the real problem, the rising \ncost of health care, this legislation would simply shift costs to small \nbusinesses with older and less well workers.\n  In fact, another study commissioned by the supporters of this \nlegislation concluded this bill ``is not going to address the \nunderlying causes of high health insurance premiums, which are high \nhealth care costs.''\n  Again, Governors, State attorneys general, the State insurance \ncommissioners have all reached the same conclusion, as have an enormous \nnumber of groups representing health care providers and patients. All \nof them say the same thing. They all can't be wrong. When your \nGovernors, attorneys general of the States, insurance commissioners, \nnot to mention almost every single health care group in the country \nwarns about the passage of this bill, then we ought to take note of it. \nWhen you hear that you will have literally millions of people losing \nbenefits passed by State legislative bodies that require the insurance \nindustry to cover them, then we ought to take note of that as well.\n  I know my colleagues will be offering amendments to allow lifesaving \nstem cell research to go forward, to strengthen Medicaid, reduce \nprescription drug prices, and ensure access to mental health care. I \nlook forward to having an opportunity to debate those amendments, many \nof which I will be supporting. We should also consider an amendment to \nextend the Medicare prescription drug plan enrollment deadline which is \ncausing a huge problem. These are the kinds of issues that ought to be \npart of our debate today. Medicare beneficiaries have only until this \ncoming Monday, May 15, to enroll in a prescription drug plan, if they \nare to avoid financial penalty. Why don't we take that as an amendment \nand extend that time to allow people to come forward. As we are all \naware, for many of the Nation's 41 million Medicare beneficiaries, the \nnew prescription drug plan offers more confusion than assistance and, \nfrankly, extending that date would make sense.\n  I intend to offer an amendment to protect newborns and children from \nthe damage inflicted by this legislation. Right now, 25 states have \nenacted mandates requiring insurers to provide benefits to the children \nof their enrollee; 31 States require insurers to cover the cost of \nchildhood immunization.\n  I am going to ask my colleagues to support language that would see to \nit that newborns and children are protected in every State, instead of \nallowing the insurance industry to pick plans that would exclude child \nimmunization and well-child care.\n  This legislation would completely preempt these State laws, leaving \nbabies and children unprotected. That is a major step backward. \nInstead, families will be faced with health insurance that doesn't \ncover routine care for children. They might be forced to pay out of \npocket, drastically driving up health care costs, or to forego care \nentirely. My amendment would ensure that those State laws not be \npreempted by this Federal mandate that we are about to adopt.\n  I will also offer an amendment that would prevent health insurers \nfrom deciding how much to charge a person for health insurance based on \nhow healthy they are. That is something we have done across the country \nin State after State.\n  Many States, including my own, have laws preventing the insurance \nindustry from charging more based on health status. Unfortunately, this \nlegislation would remove those State protections. It would allow the \ninsurance industry to charge more based on health status. We ought to \nmake sure we don't allow that to occur in this bill.\n  Without these protections in place, it just makes good business sense \nfor an insurance company to increase premiums for people with diabetes, \nHIV/AIDS, cancer survivors, pregnant women, or anybody with health \nneeds that are outside of the ordinary. As a result, the people who \nneed insurance the most will find they would be the first to lose it.\n  Finally, I will offer an amendment to protect those patients that \nadmirably choose to participate in clinical trials from undue costs \nresulting from their routine care. Currently, 19 States, including my \nown State of Connecticut, have enacted mandates requiring insurers to \nprovide coverage for routine patient care costs while those patients \nare participating in potentially lifesaving clinical trials. But this \nlegislation, as crafted, would completely preempt these State laws, \nleaving patients without needed coverage for items such as blood work \nand physician visits. And this legislation would preempt States like \nmine that provide benefits for people who are willing to become part of \na clinical trial.\n  Clinical trials save lives. Just 50 years ago, less than one in four \nwomen with breast cancer survived for 5 years or more. Compare that to \ntoday when 96 percent of women with localized breast cancer reach the \n5-year mark. This legislation would create a powerful disincentive to \npatients weighing the option of whether to participate in a clinical \ntrial. Tragically, we know that only 3 percent of adults suffering from \ncancer participate in clinical trials. Compare this to the 60 percent \nof children with cancer that enroll in a trial.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of amendments we would offer to try \nto improve this piece of legislation. While I respect the intent of the \nauthors, the bottom line is that it would do great damage to the gains \nthat have been made in State after State across the country, by \ncontrolling the costs of premiums and seeing to it that benefits are \noffered to people out there. The States made these decisions, and the \ninsurance industry, if they want to do business in their States, should \ncomply.\n  This legislation would mean that the Federal Government would wipe \nout protection in State after State that has provided for the \nprotection of its people--listen to your Governors, your attorneys \ngeneral, your health commissioners, insurance commissioners; listen to \nthe groups out there that pay attention to this kind of legislation. \nListen to the business groups that have warned what this would do to \nsmaller businesses across the country.\n\n[[Page S4170]]\n\n  Mr. President, I hope that when the appropriate time comes, we will \neither adopt amendments that will improve the bill substantially or, \nmore important, adopt the substitute that will be offered by Senator \nLincoln of Arkansas and Senator Durbin, which would allow people to \nhave the same kind of benefits each and every one of us have as Members \nof Congress, as part of a Federal health benefit program here that \nallows for the pooling of people, that would cover 100 employees or \nless, far beyond what this bill would cover with 50 or less. It would \nnot mandate that benefits provided by States be eliminated, and it \nwould not preempt the States from setting caps on premiums when it \ncomes to older and sicker workers. That is the way to go.\n  If you really want to make a difference, why don't we adopt this \nalternative. That would be a major gain for smaller businesses and \npeople who work with them. I understand this is an important issue. \nSmall businesses could use help, but we are not helping them with this \nbill, with all due respect. We can help them if we take the right \nsteps.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt the alternative, or at least improve \nthe bill with the amendments we will be offering in the next few days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand it, we are rotating back \nand forth. Could the Chair tell us how much time we have on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes remain.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, Mr. President, I thank my friend from Connecticut \nfor an excellent presentation and summation of the principal concerns \nabout this legislation. I ask the Chair to let me know when there is 1 \nminute remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of our committee, \nSenator Enzi, for his diligence in the development of the legislation. \nIt is legislation that I cannot support. But the chairman of our \ncommittee has put his finger on an area of health policy, which is \nenormously important for us to consider, and that is the general kind \nof challenge that is out there for small businesses in this country. By \nand large, they pay two or three times higher premiums than many of the \nvery large businesses in their States, and they are also seeing a \nturmoil in the market.\n  More often than not, they are changing companies every year, or every \nother year, and increasing numbers of those small businesses have to \ndrop coverage. This is a real problem.\n  If the proposal that is before us, the Enzi bill, was only to deal \nwith that particular issue, it ought to be given focus and attention \nand full debate and support. But his bill goes far beyond that. \nFortunately, we have an alternative, as the closing remarks of my \nfriend and colleague from Connecticut pointed out, in the Durbin and \nLincoln legislation, which addresses the small business needs. It does \nit creatively and effectively, and it does it without threatening the \nhealth protections that are there for States. The message and word \nought to go out to all those who support the Durbin-Lincoln proposal \nthat workers in those small businesses will effectively have the same \nkind of health care coverage that we have in the Senate of the United \nStates. That has been certainly a goal of mine for all Americans in the \ntime I have been in the Senate, and it still is.\n  We have an opportunity for the small business community, and for the \nworkers in those companies of 100 or less, to provide for them the same \nthings that we have for the Members of the U.S. Congress and Senate. \nThat statement cannot be made by the Senator from Wyoming. His bill \ndoes not do that. It has all kinds of adverse impacts in terms of \nworkers and health care protections.\n  So as we start this debate, we ought to recognize that there is an \nalternative which we on this side strongly support which will focus and \ngive attention to the small business community. The other proposal by \nSenator Enzi does not do that.\n  Mr. President, I am going to take a few minutes, because that is all \nI have, to review what I think are the most dangerous aspects of this \nlegislation. The fact is, today, as has been pointed out, there are \nsome 85 million Americans who have protections that will be effectively \nlost with the Enzi proposal. Those are protections for screening on \ncancer, for help and assistance in terms of diabetes, for medicines. \nThere are different protections that are given to other diseases that \nare threatened, and it threatens American families. Those have been \ndiscussed in local communities and in States that are now providing \nthose protections; and effectively, under the Enzi bill, those will be \nprohibited. There are a number of groups.\n  First of all, this is what the State insurance commissioners say, and \nwhy they are important is because they have a responsibility in terms \nof protecting consumers. This is what they have pointed out, Mr. \nPresident:\n\n       Standardizing the rating laws among States will do little \n     or nothing to reduce health insurance costs.\n\n  And also:\n\n       S. 1955 will result in older and less healthy employees \n     being priced out of the market as a result of expanding the \n     rate bands.\n       Small New Jersey employers with older and sicker employees \n     would see a dramatic rise and increase under the Federal \n     approach, effectively driving them from the insurance market \n     and leaving them vulnerable citizens without adequate health \n     coverage.\n\n  They are talking about ratings. Insurance companies are going to be \nable to charge for the proposal that the Senator from Wyoming has \ntalked about. They are going to have a flexibility of up to 26 percent \ndifference--26 times the difference in terms of premiums. Do you \nunderstand that? If you are an older worker and have had sickness in \nyour family, you will pay a rating that will be up through the roof.\n  That is not true in Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, no matter how \nsick or young you are, you are still within a 3-point or 3 times rating \nincrease. That has worked very effectively. That is something that \nevery older worker, every family that has had some kind of health \nchallenges ought to recognize--that they, under the Enzi bill, could \nwell be priced out of the market.\n  This is what the attorneys general have said:\n\n       The Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization And \n     Affordability Act should be more appropriately labeled the \n     Health Insurance Cost Escalation Act.\n\n  That was the attorney general from Minnesota.\n  The attorney general of New York said:\n\n       This legislation is not the answer here. It eliminates many \n     of the protections that consumers enjoy, without addressing \n     the underlying problem of cost containment.\n\n  They are also eliminating protections, as we have mentioned, for \nbreast cancer and diabetes.\n  Another one by the attorneys general:\n\n       There are no legitimate grounds for exempting the type of \n     insurance plan for State laws that provide essential \n     safeguards for persons covered by insurance.\n\n  It is not just Democrats, but Democrats and Republicans; 41 out of \nthe 50 attorneys general charged with protecting consumers are saying \nthis bill doesn't get it.\n  Mr. President, this is very interesting by the New Hampshire Governor \non S. 1955:\n\n       In 2003, New Hampshire passed a law establishing rating \n     rules similar to those contemplated under S. 1955.\n\n  New Hampshire passed almost the identical bill that is now being \nconsidered in the Senate.\n\n       With the rules allowing insurance companies to discriminate \n     against businesses with sick workers, or based on geography, \n     this law sent small business health insurance costs \n     skyrocketing across New Hampshire. Small business could not \n     grow, could not hire new workers, and some considered ending \n     their health insurance plans altogether.\n\n  They have done it. It is rare around here when you have a new \nproposal that you have had experience with--and the State of New \nHampshire has it--and they ended up withdrawing that proposal.\n  Finally, we have the various patient groups. Here is the American \nDiabetes Association:\n\n       S. 1955 would result in millions of Americans with diabetes \n     losing their guarantee of diabetes coverage.\n\n  The Cancer Society said:\n\n       Passage of this legislation would represent a retreat in \n     this Nation's commitment to defeat cancer.\n\n\n[[Page S4171]]\n\n\n  The National Partnership for Women and Families said:\n\n       Instead of making health care more affordable for those who \n     need it most, S. 1955 would roll back the reforms adopted by \n     many States to require fair pricing.\n\n  We look forward on this side to debating these issues--the Durbin-\nLincoln proposal and the Enzi proposal--and we also look forward to \ndebating stem cell research, the real Medicare alternative in the \nprescription drug debate, the ability of Medicare to be able to \nnegotiate lower prices for our senior citizens, and drug \nimportation. If we are going to have a health care debate, let's make \nsure we are going to deal with many of the issues that people in our \ncountry want us to deal with.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as we wait on a couple of people to speak, I \nwould like to make a few comments on the comments that have been made. \nI do appreciate the spirit in which they have been made. I know there \nare amendments waiting to modify several of the things that have been \nsuggested, but my biggest concern is that there were some comments \nabout the Attorneys General of the United States and the insurance \ncommissioners who are against it, and even the Connecticut business \nassociations who are apparently saying they are against the bill.\n  But what I need to correct is the comments they are making are not on \nthis bill. What they are talking about is the bill that the House has \npassed eight separate times: the associated health plans bill. \nAssociated health plans are different than this bill. It would be nice \nif some of the people who are going national and public on this would \nactually check with us on some of their comments to see if they are \nremotely right.\n  We have put forward a solution which they said that 85 million people \nwould lose their benefits from. That would be just as ridiculous as me \nsaying that all 27 million people who are uninsured who work for small \nbusiness would be covered by this bill. Neither of those things is \ngoing to happen. There is a medium in there where there will be more \npeople who are insured. The difficult parts that were talked about \nconcerning things being taken away from people I am confident are not \ngoing to happen. There are a couple of reasons they are not going to \nhappen.\n  First of all, there are experiments across the country which in a \nsmall way have done what we are talking about in the small business \nhealth plans, and in those experiments, they have worked: Taking away \nthe mandates that States have and actually making a point of mandating \nthat we take away the mandates. Around here, ``mandates'' is a bad \nword. Mandates means you are forcing somebody to do something and you \nare not paying for it. You are saying you have to have this, and \nwhether you can afford it or not, we are going to make you do it. So \nyour choice is to take the mandate or drop your insurance.\n  When we are talking about these mandates, a lot of them we are \ntalking about are regular maintenance of your body, and we ought to be \nhaving everybody do those. It shouldn't matter whether they are covered \nby insurance or otherwise. In fact, in Wyoming, we have gone to great \nlengths to have more things done by public health for free. That means \nyour insurance doesn't have to pay for it and you don't have to pay \nyour insurance company for it and you don't have to pay your insurance \ncompany for the administration of that service. But you can get that \nservice. Then we have some other screenings that are covered in a very \nreasonable way. We have a program in Wyoming trying to get everybody to \nhave mammograms, and it is focused on Mother's Day, which is coming up \nthis next weekend: Get a mammography for your mom. Show that you care. \nAnd thousands of people in Wyoming do exactly that.\n  I will cover some of the other issues, but I see that Senator Hatch, \nthe Senator from Utah, has arrived and has some comments in this \nregard, and he has been a very diligent worker on all of the small \nbusiness problems. So I yield time to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished chairman who I \nthink has done a terrific job on this bill. I understand the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire needs about 3 minutes, so I \nask unanimous consent that he be given 3 minutes, and then the time be \nreturned to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I wish to speak to the legislation before \nus and in particular to address some of the remarks that were made \nearlier by Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts. He raised concerns about \nthe State of New Hampshire and suggested that this legislation would be \nbad for the State of New Hampshire and that the State of New Hampshire \nhad already enacted legislation identical to this. I think it is wrong \nfor someone to provide information that is not entirely accurate. I \nthink that is inaccurate, and it is not inaccurate in some very key \nareas.\n  First, the bands that were discussed that were enacted in the State \nof New Hampshire were much smaller than the rating bands contemplated \nin this legislation, and they did it in New Hampshire without any \ntransition period. Those are two very significant, specific differences \nbetween this legislation and what was attempted in New Hampshire.\n  Second, as with any legislation, it cuts both ways. There were some \nemployers that saw increases in their premiums 2 and 3 years ago that \nsome claimed were a result of the legislation in New Hampshire, but \nmany businesses--in fact, the NFIB would suggest the majority of \nbusinesses--in New Hampshire saw some great relief because they are the \nsmaller businesses that we are talking about, those who would be \nallowed to improve their negotiating position through the provisions in \nthis bill. Moreover, this isn't a debate about one State. This is a \ndebate about providing increased access--increased access--to plans \nthat are negotiated by associations, by the members of small businesses \nand, as a result, negotiating lower prices.\n  Finally, there was discussion about community rating and how \nobjectionable it is that there will be an ability to differentiate on \nprice based on a number of factors. I think the truth is, when you \nforce that kind of price control, you force adverse selection because \nif I tell you that you have to charge the exact same price to anyone, \nno matter what region, circumstance, or situation, then the insurer \nwill automatically market to the healthiest people because they won't \nwant to take on the additional costs associated with those who might \nhave significant needs that result in higher prices.\n  So if you go to price control, which is exactly what the other side \nis suggesting, forcing the same price for everyone no matter who is \ncovered, businesses will naturally--naturally--only market to those who \nare healthy and, as a result, reduce the accessibility and availability \nof health insurance to those who might need it most.\n  It is a dramatic, unintended consequence, and that is the exact \noutcome that will be the result of the policies that are being \nsuggested by the other side. We need to be accurate in what we \nrepresent. This is a good bill for small business and, as a result, it \nis an excellent bill for New Hampshire because in New Hampshire, small \nbusinesses make up over 95% of all firm with employees. If we want to \ndo something about the uninsured, the majority of whom are working as \nself-employed or for small businesses, we need to take up the exact \nkind of provisions that are in this bill: Increased access of health \ninsurance for those working in the smallest firms.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Senator Hatch is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1955, the Health \nInsurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act. This is a \ngood bill, with good intentions. The lack of health insurance, \nparticularly for employees of small businesses, is a significant \nproblem in Utah and throughout the Nation.\n  We cannot afford to sit by the sidelines and bemoan this problem, \ntaking little action while millions of American families suffer. The \nHouse of Representatives has acted and we should do the same.\n  Immediately upon its passage though, we were besieged by complaints \nabout House legislation, principal among them the complaint that it \noverrides State insurance law.\n\n[[Page S4172]]\n\n  I give the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman \nMike Enzi a lot of credit.\n  Chairman Enzi didn't sit idly by.\n  He studied the House bill, he held extensive hearings, and then he \ndrafted a compromise that resolved many of the concerns expressed about \nthe House bill. This was no easy job.\n  Immediately, the HELP Committee effort--a solid effort I might add--\nwas besieged by criticism. Much of this criticism I must hasten to add, \nis not valid.\n  ``It isn't going to cover cancer care,'' the naysayers decry.\n  ``It isn't going to cover diabetics and their supplies,'' they \nallege.\n  ``It isn't going to cover prenatal care or OB/GYN care for women,'' \nis a recent complaint.\n  ``It is going to run chiropractors, podiatrists and optometrists out \nof business,'' say hundreds of form letters that have flooded our \noffices.\n  The problem is, these complaints aren't even true. While the standard \nplan employees must be offered under this bill may not cover all those \nthings, S. 1955 clearly provides an alternative. Employees must be \noffered an enhanced plan, based on the coverage that public employees \nreceive in the five most populous States, if their employer's standard \nplan is not consistent with State law.\n  Most, if not all, of these services would be included in those \nenhanced plans that employers must offer under S. 1955.\n  But, let's talk about our basic goal here.\n  We want to provide affordable health insurance coverage to those who \ncurrently do not have coverage.\n  If we could afford to give them coverage for every possible illness, \ncondition, or procedure, if small businesses could afford to give them \ncoverage for every possible illness, condition or procedure, don't you \nthink it would have been done by now?\n  Of course it would.\n  That is the genius of the Enzi bill. It allows a basic level of \ncoverage--perhaps not every single service imaginable, but good solid \nhealth care insurance--and for those who want to pay more, there is a \nplan with more coverage.\n  In that way, the millions of Americans without health insurance will \nhave access to coverage.\n  You may ask yourself, ``Who doesn't have health insurance coverage?''\n  Today, over 45 million Americans do not have health insurance.\n  Over 25 percent of self-employed individuals are uninsured.\n  Over 30 percent of people who work for small businesses with fewer \nthan 25 employees are uninsured.\n  Over 20 percent of the people who work for small businesses with \nfewer than 100 employees are uninsured.\n  Something clearly needs to be done.\n  And that's why we are here, today, debating S. 1955.\n  I want to illustrate why passage of this legislation is necessary.\n  Ramona Rudert and her husband, Michael, have owned Professional \nAutomotive Equipment in North Salt Lake for 28 years. They have 12 \nemployees and they offer health insurance to them.\n  The Ruderts contribute $200 per month to their employees' health care \npremiums.\n  Their employees have to pay approximately $500 per month for family \ncoverage.\n  Their health insurance plan has a $1000 deductible.\n  So at least there is potential coverage. But here's the kicker: only \none of Professional Automotive Equipment's 12 employees decided to be \ncovered by their company's health policy, besides the Rudert family. \nThe rest of their employees cannot afford it.\n  The interesting twist about this story is that Ramona and Michael \nhave a daughter with juvenile diabetes. They recognize that the basic \nplan may not cover all the services their daughter needs.\n  But when asked why she supports S. 1955, Mrs. Rudert replied that she \nis ``always looking for ways to improve her employees' access to health \ncare'' and that while she has a daughter with Type 1 diabetes, her \ngreatest concern is about the affordability of insurance premiums for \nher employees.''\n  Passage of this bill is the top priority for Mr. and Mrs. Rudert, and \nthousands of Utah businesses. They recognize that affordability is a \nkey component to making that happen.\n  Let us not make perfect the enemy of the good.\n  It is an economic fact of life that a Federal requirement for small \nbusinesses to cover every small business employee for every possible \nhealth care-related service is neither appropriate nor affordable.\n  Those who decry this bill because it does not guarantee small \nbusiness employees a comprehensive plan, must be reminded that most \nemployees of small businesses do not have a choice today, if they are \nfortunate to have health insurance coverage. The legislation before the \nSenate will create new options for small businesses and, the potential \nfor more choices.\n  Today, smaller employers do not have the purchasing power of larger \nemployers. If they offer different types of health plans to their \nemployees, the administrative costs of offering these choices are much \nhigher for small employers.\n  But by leveraging their combined purchasing power, some local small \nbusiness associations are offering plans that give employers more \nchoice. I believe that similar models could be created regionally and \nnationally through S. 1955 through regional and national associations.\n  The goals of S. 1955 are simple. We want to create more affordable \nhealth insurance options through choice and competition.\n  And we want to end the decades-long deadlock and give real relief to \nAmerica's small businesses and working families.\n  Who can argue with that?\n  And small businesses support the freedom to band together across \nstate lines, even without self-funding. Insurance companies support the \ncreation of a level playing field with Small Business Health Plans.\n  Most important, according to a Mercer study released on March 7, \n2006, it is predicted that costs will go down 12 percent for small \nemployers and coverage of the working uninsured will go up 8 percent, \napproximately 1 million more working Americans.\n  An added benefit is that the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, \nbelieves that passage of S. 1955 will reduce net spending in the \nMedicaid Program. This is due to the enrollment in employer-sponsored \ninsurance plans of people, who under current law, would be covered by \nMedicaid.\n  CBO estimates that enacting S. 1955 would reduce direct spending for \nthe Federal share of Medicaid expenditures by $235 million over the \n2007-2011 period and $790 million over the 2007-2016 period. In \naddition, the bill would result in estimated Medicaid savings to States \ntotaling $180 million over the 2007-2011 period and $600 million over \nthe 2007-2016 period.\n  CBO estimates that by 2011, approximately 600,000 more people would \nhave health insurance coverage. The majority of these newly covered \nindividuals would be employees of small companies and their dependents.\n  S. 1955 has been endorsed by a host of organizations: The Small-\nBusiness Health Plan Coalition; the National Association of Realtors; \nthe Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness; the National Restaurant Association; the National Association \nof Manufacturers; the Associated Builders and Contractors; the National \nAssociation of Home Builders; the National Retail Federation; the \nAssociation Healthcare Coalition; the Textile Rental Services \nAssociation of America; the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers \nAssociation; the Precision Metalforming Association; the American \nCouncil of Engineering Council; Women Impacting Public Policy; National \nAssociation of Wholesaler-Distributors; Wendy's International which \nincludes Tim Hortons, Wendy's, Baja Fresh and Cafe Express; Cendant \nCorporation; American Institute of Architects; Federation of American \nHospitals; National Funeral Directors Association; HR Policy \nAssociation; Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association; and the \nSociety of American Florists.\n  Mr. President, that is an impressive list of supporters.\n  And I believe that the main reason that we have such an impressive \nlist is due to the leadership of the Chairman Mike Enzi.\n  He and his staff did something that the Senate has not been able to \ndo for\n\n[[Page S4173]]\n\nover a decade report small business health legislation out of the \nSenate HELP Committee.\n  For months, Chairman Enzi spearheaded meetings with the major \nstakeholders of this legislation the insurance companies, the small \nbusiness groups, and the insurance commissioners. These meetings \nproduced the bill that we are considering today.\n  Again, my colleagues may ask themselves, is this bill really needed? \nWill it truly make a difference?\n  Just last week a 42-year-old woman from Provo, Utah called my office. \nBoth she and her 9-year-old daughter are diabetics. And she had heard \nfrom the American Diabetes Association that S. 1955 would hurt their \nhealth coverage.\n  But as my staff explained the bill's important role in allowing small \nbusinesses to provide insurance for their employees, including \ndiabetics, she became very emotional. She recalled how, several years \nago, she had her own small business. And buying health care for her \nemployees was forcing her toward bankruptcy. So my constituent had to \ntake away their health insurance. This was extremely difficult for her \nbecause she herself had a chronic illness and fully understood the \nimplications. She ended up with an individual health insurance policy. \nAnd she found that for the same insurance coverage that she had had in \nher group insurance policy, she had to pay nearly twice as much.\n  This happened for two reasons. First, as an individual, she was not \neligible for the tax benefit that supports the cost of insurance paid \nthrough employers. And, second--because she had diabetes, a chronic \nillness, her insurance rating caused her to pay significantly more than \nsomeone without that disease. There was no risk pool for her to join.\n  Passage of S. 1955 could have prevented these problems.\n  I urge my colleagues to think about the health care needs of small \nbusiness employees in their states before voting on this legislation. \nThis legislation will improve their health care options. Today, they \nrarely have options when it comes to health insurance and when they do, \nit is extremely expensive.\n  Let me conclude by sharing the sentiments of Chris Kyler, the CEO of \nthe Utah Association of Realtors.\n\n       Small business owners in Utah are facing a growing crisis \n     with health care availability and affordability. Our \n     profession represents 17% of Utah's gross state product and \n     yet we're arguably the most uninsured working segment in our \n     state simply because we're small business people. As \n     productive contributors to the economy, as a younger, \n     healthier populous, we're supportive of S. 1955 because it \n     will provide us with the opportunity to purchase affordable \n     health insurance.\n\n  I believe that Mr. Kyler's sentiments sum up why the Senate needs to \npass this legislation as soon as possible. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation so that employees of small business will have \naccess to affordable health care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time to the \nSenator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, how much time will that be?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 9 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Enzi for yielding the time \nas well as for his leadership in bringing this legislation to the \nfloor, legislation that is so critical and vital to the future well-\nbeing of small businesses, I know in my State and across America.\n  As chair of the Small Business Committee, I know firsthand that this \ncrisis is real. It is an undue burden on entrepreneurs throughout this \ncountry, and it certainly didn't develop overnight. Now we have a \nsolution at hand, if we are all willing to forge the consensus \nnecessary to make it happen.\n  This issue is all the more critical when you consider the fact that \ntoday nearly 46 million Americans are uninsured. That is an increase of \nover 4 million people since 2001. According to the Employee Benefit \nResearch Institute, of the working uninsured, who make up 83 percent of \nour Nation's uninsured population, 60.6 percent either work for small \nbusiness with fewer than 100 employees or are self-employed.\n  There should be no doubt or question that the time has long since \ncome to pass this legislation that will at once assist our small \nbusinesses in accessing affordable health insurance for their employees \nand their families while assuring more of those employees can actually \nhave health insurance.\n  For this past decade, health insurance premiums have exploded at \ndouble-digit percentage levels and far outpaced inflation and wage \ngains, and Congress has failed to act. Study after study has confirmed \nbeyond a doubt that fewer and fewer small businesses are able to offer \nhealth insurance to their employees. Little has been done to alleviate \nthe problem. Quite simply, it has been an abrogation of responsibility.\n  As chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I have held hearings on this question. Small business \nowners in Maine and across America have consistently and repeatedly \nbegged Congress for relief. They need competition in the market. They \nneed to be able to offer this to their own employees and their \nfamilies.\n  That is why I originally introduced the Small Business Health \nFairness Act which would have allowed the creation of association \nhealth plans to offer uniform health plans across the country, allowing \nsmall businesses to leverage their purchasing power on a national \nbasis. This week, for the first time, thanks to the leadership of \nChairman Enzi in bringing this legislation to the floor from his \ncommittee, the full Senate will be trying to resolve many of the \nissues, many of the differences of positions and perspectives everybody \nhas on this question.\n  I thank the majority leader for making this legislation the key \ncomponent of Health Week in the Senate.\n  I also thank my friends on both sides of the political aisle, Senator \nByrd, who has cosponsored my initiative originally, Senator Talent, who \ninitiated this effort when he was chair of the Small Business Committee \nin the House, and the same is true for my predecessor, Senator Bond, \nwhen he was chair of the Small Business Committee, for helping to move \nthis issue to the pivotal point where we are today.\n  I also thank Senator Kerry as ranking member of the Small Business \nCommittee because we also modified my original bill, worked on another \nconsensus bill that would have been a modification based on regional \nassociation health plans. I thank him for his effort. Again, that was \nanother attempt to bridge these efforts across the aisle.\n  But I most especially recognize Senator Enzi's work and his \ncommitment in moving this bill, holding the hearings, trying to \nreconcile the differences.\n  This week is not about engaging in heated partisan debate to create \nissues for the upcoming election. What this should be all about is \nproviding solutions to small businesses and America's uninsured for the \nmuch needed relief they certainly deserve.\n  We are trying to do everything we can to resolve some of the issues. \nI know there are some concerns, as there were with my initial \nlegislation and as there is with Chairman Enzi's bill now before the \nSenate. A couple of those issues are, of course, preemption of mandated \nbenefits. I hope to be able to address that question with an amendment \nso, hopefully, we can reconcile some of the differences across party \nlines, across philosophical perspectives, so we can get the job done.\n  There are some concerns about the changes in community ratings. I \nknow that is a particular issue for my State as well. I understand the \nchairman will address that issue in his managers' amendment.\n  What we are all here about today is what can we do to address the \nunderlying concern that small businesses have across America. This is a \nsummary of their foremost concern--increasing health insurance costs \nfor themselves and for their employees and their families to the point, \nas I think we all recognize, small businesses are unable to offer this \ncrucial benefit at a time when they need to be competitive with larger \ncompanies because they cannot afford, they simply cannot afford to \nprovide health insurance.\n  If they can afford it, it is catastrophic coverage, it is a $5,000 or \n$10,000 or $15,000 deductible at best that\n\n[[Page S4174]]\n\nthey are able to offer. That is why I introduced the initial \nassociation health plans, to give fairness to the market, especially to \nthe small group markets such as the State of Maine. The State of Maine \nis a small group market and, guess what, there is no competition. No \ncompetition means higher prices. Higher prices means virtually no \nhealth insurance.\n  That is why I offered the association health plan. That is why \nChairman Enzi is doing what he is doing here today, to try to bridge \nthe differences so we can move and advance this process forward because \nit is good for all of America.\n  Small business is the engine that is driving the economy. Two-thirds \nof the job growth occurring in America today is emanating from small \nbusinesses. So it is important to ensure their well-being.\n  By offering the mechanisms that are proposed in Chairman Enzi's \nlegislation, the small business health insurance plan will help with \nuniformity as well. Because 50 States have 50 sets of administrative \nrules, regulations, and mandates, it is virtually impossible to have a \nuniform standard nationwide. This will allow small businesses to be \nbasically on par with Fortune 500 companies and unions. After all, no \none is ever complaining about Fortune 500 companies and unions' plans. \nIn fact, they are the most generous in America. So if they are good for \nFortune 500 companies, if they are good for unions, why can't they be \ngood for small businesses? That is what it is all about.\n  Now people say these associations will not design good plans. If you \nwant to attract members to the plan, if you want people to join your \nplan, obviously you are going to ensure that you design these plans \nwhich will be the most attractive to the greatest number of people who \njoin up in these associations. After all, it is in the interests of \nsmall businesses to have attractive plans for their employees because \nthey have to compete with large employers to get good employees, to get \nskilled employees. If they don't have this crucial and vital benefit, \nthey do not attract the kind of employees they need to make their \nbusiness successful. That is what it is all about.\n  I hope we can reconcile our differences through the amendment \nprocess, with what I hope to offer as amendments and what others will \noffer, that can lead us to our goal of addressing the fundamental \nquestion for small businesses in America that ultimately will help \nmitigate the problem of the uninsured that is ever growing in America \nas well.\n  As we engage in this debate this week, in the end I hope we can come \nto a conclusion with a reasonable compromise that will become law. That \nis what it is all about. I know people have differences of opinion. But \nI don't think there ought to be a difference of opinion in the final \nanalysis when we address all the issues--the ones that Chairman Enzi \naddressed to bridge the gap, the ones that my amendment will do, and \nothers might do--which will ultimately get us to the point of beginning \nto resolve this crisis.\n  The fact remains that we are seeing fewer and fewer small employers \nthat are providing health insurance for their employees.\n  If you look at this chart, only 47 percent of the smallest businesses \nin America--those with three to nine workers--offer health insurance. \nIt is on a declining trend--down to 52 percent, and down to 58 percent \nin 2002--in sharp contrast to the 98 percent of larger businesses with \n200 or more workers that are offering health insurance as a benefit.\n  For small businesses, things are trending in the wrong direction. \nThen you look at the small group marketplaces in States such as Maine, \nwhich is what this essentially is all about. As we learned from the \nGovernment Accountability Office study that Senator Talent and I \nrequested, Blue Cross-Blue Shield is actually consolidating their \nmarket share in a number of States across the country. In fact, 44 \npercent are in group markets.\n  I hope we can begin to reconcile these differences and do what I \nthink this Congress can do for the first time that we have had the \nopportunity to do. Let us not deny small businesses and their employees \nthis one chance to do it. Time has long since passed for action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before she leaves the floor, I want to \nexpress my thanks to the distinguished Senator from Maine for working \nso closely with me on health care issues. I expect that before long \nSenator Snowe and I will be offering our bipartisan amendment to lift \nthe restriction on Medicare that bars Medicare from bargaining to hold \ndown health care costs. Senator Snowe and I have worked on this for \nover 3 years. We recently got 54 votes in the Senate to win passage of \nthis bipartisan effort. I thank her for all the good work she is doing \nin the health care field and look forward to when she offers our \nbipartisan amendment before too long and to prosecuting this cause on \nbehalf of senior citizens and taxpayers alike.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, no other health policy in America is \nmore objectionable to the people of this country than preventing \nMedicare from bargaining to hold down health care costs.\n  This restriction that bars Medicare from bargaining to hold down \nhealth costs simply defies common sense. The restriction that bars \nMedicare from bargaining to hold down health costs is contrary to what \ngoes on in the private sector of this country every single day. It \ncertainly is contrary to the needs of this program and the taxpayers of \nthis country when we see the Federal budget deficit exploding every \ntime we turn around.\n  It seems to me that to have Medicare actually barred from bargaining \nto hold down prescription costs simply defies the sensible approaches \nthat we have always taken in holding down health costs. That approach \nis to use your bargaining power and the capacity to argue on behalf of \nlarge numbers of people. That is using marketplace forces to really \nmake a difference.\n  The way Medicare is buying prescription drugs under this program is \nlike somebody going to Costco and buying toilet paper one roll at a \ntime. Nobody would ever go shopping that way. Certainly when steel \ncompanies, auto companies, any major manufacturing concerns first sit \ndown with a vendor, they ask: What kind of deal will you give me on the \nbasis of the large volume of this product that I am going to be \npurchasing? Not Medicare. Medicare won't do what everyone else does all \nacross this country every single day.\n  It is especially important that Medicare use this bargaining power, \ngiven what the American Association of Retired Persons has found \nrecently in a report they released to us on the cost of prescription \ndrugs. The AARP released a report in February of 2006 that found brand \nname medications most commonly used by older people rose almost twice \nthe rate of inflation in other areas of health care.\n  So here is a chance to actually save money for senior citizens and \ntaxpayers. We can especially expect to see savings when you have \nsingle-source drugs for which there is absolutely no competition. There \nare concrete cases where the Federal Government says we are not going \nto allow price controls, we are not going to allow the establishment of \na one-size-fits-all formulary, but we are going to say that the \nGovernment is going to be able to bargain, and that approach will make \na real difference.\n\n  I know some colleagues think any effort by the Government to allow \nbargaining to hold down the cost of medicine will lead to price \ncontrols. The amendment which Senator Snowe and I expect to file before \nlong is very clear. It does not permit price setting or the creation of \na formulary. All it says is the Federal Government, and in effect the \nseniors of this country, would be able to go into the market and use \ntheir clout just like any other big purchaser could to hold down the \ncost of medicine using marketplace forces.\n  As colleagues consider this particular approach I hope--I know the \ndistinguished President of the Senate has a great interest in \npharmaceuticals and prescription drugs--that colleagues will look at \nwhat Senator Snowe and I advocate. In that amendment, on page 3, lines \n2 through 8 make it clear that we are opposed to price controls. We \nhave continually tried to address this. We are not in favor of price \ncontrols. We are not in favor of establishing a one-size-fits-all \nformulary or instituting a uniform price structure of any kind. All we \nare saying is that the Federal Government ought to have a\n\n[[Page S4175]]\n\nchance to do some hard-nosed bargaining the way everybody else does to \nhold down the cost of prescription drugs.\n  Secretary Tommy Thompson, former Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, said that the one power he wanted as he left office and was \ndenied by the Congress was the opportunity to negotiate when necessary \nto hold down the cost of prescription drugs.\n  This amendment would ensure that the prescription drug benefit is \nsustainable without interfering with marketplace forces and would \nsimply say that the Federal Government could leverage the marketplace \njust as any other big buyer of a product does.\n  To date, millions of seniors have enrolled in this program and, of \ncourse, they are realizing some savings on their prescription drugs. We \nare glad to see that, but it has come about primarily through the \ninfusion of taxpayer money.\n  What I and Senator Snowe would like to do is bring about some \nsavings--not just by pouring more and more taxpayer money into this \nprogram but by using marketplace forces to protect the interests of \nseniors and our taxpayers.\n  Prohibiting Medicare from negotiating for drug prices was an \noverreach. I know of no other industry in the United States that has \npower like this. We don't see any other industry that does business \nwith the Federal Government in which discussions and negotiations with \nthe Federal Government is specifically barred. Everybody else has to \nsit down across the table from the Government representing the \ninterests of our taxpayers and get into the nuts and bolts of \nnegotiating the best deal for a particular group of Americans. We need \nto end this special treatment, this favoritism, this unwarranted \npreference that only the prescription drug industry has and give our \nGovernment the bargaining power that is needed so that seniors and \ntaxpayers can be protected through marketplace forces.\n  Some who are opposed to what Senator Snowe and I want to do have said \nthat we are already seeing some negotiations. Of course, that is true. \nHaving voted for this program and wanting to see it work--I have welts \non my back to show for that--I am pleased that we are seeing some \ndiscussion among health plans and others. But I think we will see a \nwhole lot more opportunity to contain costs and contain them through \nmarketplace forces if we untie the hands of the Secretary, as the \nprevious Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy Thompson, sought \nto do. I believe we ought to take every possible step to save every \npossible nickel to protect seniors and taxpayers, and lifting this \nabsurd restriction on Medicare bargaining power will do just that.\n  I cannot for the life of me conceive of a rational reason Medicare \nshould not have the same power to negotiate just the way other smart \nshoppers do across this country. Every smart shopper in the private \nsector--every single one--wants the kind of opportunity that I and \nSenator Snowe are advocating.\n  I don't know of any private entity, whether it is a timber company in \nmy home State or a big auto company or anybody else who doesn't sit \ndown across the bargaining table and ask, what are we going to do to \nwork something out that reflects the fact that I am going to be buying \na lot of something? Why shouldn't Medicare, if it believes it is \nwarranted, have that authority in effect as a standby?\n  Senator Snowe and I have been crystal clear in saying that there is a \ndifference between negotiating and bargaining and price controls and \nuniform formularies. We would say to our colleagues: Look at our \nproposal just as we did in the one that received 54 votes recently. We \nspell it out. We lay it out on page 3 of our amendment, lines 2 through \n8. We stipulate no price controls, no uniform formulary, no particular \nkind of one-size-fits-all price structure in any way.\n  I would like to, along with Senator Snowe, offer a market-based, \ncomprehensive cost containment to help hold down the cost of \nprescription drugs in our country.\n  I am glad we are discussing Medicare this week. I think it is high \ntime. I tell colleagues that no other health policy in America is more \nobjectionable than the one that prevents Medicare from bargaining to \nhold down health care costs. It is time to inject some common sense \ninto the Medicare drug benefit. Giving Medicare bargaining power to \nmillions of senior citizens through Medicare is economics 101. If it is \nimportant to the seniors of this country, it is important to taxpayers.\n  We expect to bring a bipartisan proposal to the floor of the Senate \nthis week. We all know we could sure use some bipartisanship around \nhere at this critical time. I hope colleagues will, as they did a few \nweeks ago, show strong bipartisan support for our proposal. If we are \nserious about reining in health costs, and the American people say it \nis at the top of their agenda, you have to lift this restriction that \nbars Medicare from bargaining. We expect to be filing the bipartisan \nSnowe-Wyden amendment before long.\n\n  We hope, as we did on the last occasion when we voted on this, we \nwill have a strong majority in the Senate in support of a commonsense, \npractical way to protect senior citizens who are buying prescription \ndrugs and are taxpayers at the same time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oregon for his \nincredible leadership on something that makes so much sense, \nnegotiating group prices under Medicare.\n  Why in the world wouldn't we want to get the best price? Taxpayers \nwant us to get the best price. Seniors want us to get the best price. \nThe disabled want us to get the best price. Why in the world wouldn't \nwe want to do everything possible to have a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit that offers the very best prices so we can offer as much \ncoverage as possible? One of the things we know, the gap in coverage is \npartly because we are paying so much for the whole plan. We could give \npeople more coverage and spread it out differently if we were, in fact, \nnegotiating group prices.\n  I thank my colleague who has come to the Senate floor on so many \noccasions. He always makes so much sense. I know the people in Oregon \nare proud of what he has done.\n  To add to the discussion on Medicare, I am pleased we have Health \nWeek. Even though I will speak at some later time in terms of the \nconcerns I have about the underlying bill, we all chose to vote to \nproceed to debate on health care because there is nothing more \nimportant to the people we represent, whether it is the manufacturers I \nrepresent who are having to compete in a global economy and figure how \nto do that while paying so much of the cost of health care or whether \nit is small businesses, self-employed people who cannot find coverage \nat affordable prices, whether it is our seniors or whether it is women \nand children who need care.\n  We have a serious issue when we spend twice as much on health care in \nthis country than any other country and still have 46 million people \nwith no insurance, 80 percent of them working.\n  This is an important debate. Part of that debate, I believe because \nof the timing, needs to be to address what is happening with Medicare \nprescription drug coverage. Unfortunately, we are 6 days away from a \nMedicare prescription drug deadline. Right now, 6 days from now, folks \nare going to be penalized if they have not signed up for a Medicare \nprescription drug plan, even though they are having to wade through a \nlot of information and misinformation in order to be able to figure out \nwhat to do, if anything.\n  I am sure my colleagues have received as many calls as I have \nreceived, thousands of calls and letters from people all across \nMichigan about the trouble they are having related to this Medicare \nprescription drug program--calls from pharmacists trying to help people \nfigure what to do, spending hours on the phone, being put on hold, \nunfortunately, receiving inaccurate information too much of the time. \nWe know there are serious issues that have come about because the \nGovernment has not gotten its act together, as we should, to be able to \npresent them to people in a way they can understand and make sure it \nworks for seniors and disabled.\n  We know choosing a plan is extremely challenging and confusing. We \nhave an obligation on our end to do something about that, not wait 6 \ndays and penalize people because they have not signed up for a plan \nthat they may not be able to figure out.\n\n[[Page S4176]]\n\n  This is not because people are not bright. In Michigan alone there \nare at least 79 different plans to choose from. Each plan has a \ndifferent premium, a different copay, covers different medicines. Under \nthe current law, as I indicated before, anyone who does not go through \nthese 79 plans, or whatever number they have in their State, by next \nMonday will find themselves paying a lifetime penalty, more for \nprescription drugs than they would if they signed up before then.\n  A decision about something that is so fundamental to a person's \nhealth as their medicine should not be rushed. We should not be scaring \nseniors into picking a plan that may not work for them because of a \npenalty they will receive after next Monday. Unfortunately, that is \nexactly what is happening.\n  Unfortunately, I continue to believe the ``D'' in Medicare Part D \nstands for disaster. That does not mean some people are not getting \nhelped. We want people to be helped. We want people who have not \notherwise had help to be able to receive it. That is a very important \npoint in this process because the administration has been talking about \nthe 29.7 million seniors who are now covered, seniors and disabled who \nnow have drug coverage under Part D.\n  But what they are not saying, of the 29 million, 20 million already \nhad coverage. They were covered under Medicaid, they were covered under \nprivate insurance, under a Medicare HMO. We are talking about less than \n30 percent of those who have not had any help with their medicine, less \nthan 30 percent, have actually signed up so far.\n  Is it because they do not want help? Of course not. It is because \nthey are having challenges getting through the bureaucracy and trying \nto figure out what works for them and what does not work for them?\n  I will share a story of a woman who called me yesterday. This \nexemplifies the thousands of calls and stories I receive in Michigan. A \nmember of my staff spoke with Shirley Campbell from Midland, MI, \nyesterday, not far from my hometown. Shirley told my staff about the \nexperience she and her sister had enrolling in Part D. First, they had \na terrible time getting through to the so-called ``help'' line.\n  By the way, the Government Accountability Office says almost 60 \npercent of the time folks trying to get through to the 1-800 Medicare \nnumber are getting incomplete or inaccurate information. That is \nstunning. We have to get our act together before we penalize people for \nnot signing up for a program.\n  She kept trying. Shirley kept trying. Once she got through, in \nresponse to her question, she was told, ``I can't answer that question \nbecause the site is down.'' She did not give up. She called back the \nnext week and she called back the following week. Each time she had the \nsame experience. She could not get an answer to her question because \n``the site is down.'' This is the administration's idea of a ``help'' \nline? It is not much help.\n  Because Shirley could not get the information she needed from the \nadministration, she called several plans and asked them all to send her \ntheir information. Imagine how big that mailbox was. Then she and her \nsister sat down and spent more than 10 hours sifting through all the \ninformation they had received. They narrowed it down to six plans and \nbegan a thorough analysis.\n  What did they find? From the six plans, all of the plans would cost \nShirley more than she is currently paying for the medications necessary \nfor her rheumatoid arthritis. Six plans she narrowed it down to, and \nall of them would cost her more than what she is currently paying. \nShirley currently does not have any coverage. Yet she would end up \npaying more under any of the six plans she studied.\n  Think of that. We are trying to help people who do not have coverage, \nand less than 30 percent of the folks who have signed up have been \npeople who did not have help before. Maybe it is because they were like \nShirley, when they tried to find someone to help them, they found out \nthey would be paying even more under this privatized scheme that has \nbeen set up than they are currently paying.\n  She also told my staff that most of the plans would have cost her \ntwice as much as she is now paying. But she ended up choosing a plan \nthat would cost her more than what she is currently paying, even though \nshe currently does not have any coverage. She says she signed up \nbecause she was worried about the looming May 15 enrollment deadline \nand the prospect of paying a penalty for the rest of her life.\n  What sense does this make? Folks are seeing the clock count, 6 days \naway, until the May 15 deadline and penalty. And Shirley is so worried \nabout what that means down the road, the cost she would be paying and a \nlifetime penalty, she signs up for a plan that costs her more than she \nis currently paying. I don't believe Shirley or any senior should be \nrushed into a premature decision because of an arbitrarily determined \ndeadline. That is all this is. There is nothing magical about May 15, \nnothing at all.\n  Shirley worked in middle management all her life. She had the ability \nto spend hours and hours wading through the plan, the brochures, the \npaperwork. In the end, she had to make a decision that leaves her worse \noff than she is today.\n  Shirley wrapped up her experience of choosing a Part D plan by \nsaying, ``I never in a million years would have done anything like this \nto my staff.''\n  She then asked my health legislative assistant to deliver the message \nto me that the Medicare Part D Program needs to be fixed. Amen. I could \nnot agree more with Shirley.\n  This is Health Week. This is the time to fix it. The first thing we \nneed to do to fix it is to give folks more time.\n  I am proud to be joining Senator Bill Nelson on legislation to extend \nthe deadline to the end of the year. If given the opportunity, and I \nhope we will have the opportunity, we intend to offer that as an \namendment, as we proceed with Health Week. People should not be \npenalized because the Government cannot get its act together. People \nshould not be penalized when almost 60 percent of the time when they \ncall a hotline they cannot get the information they need, it is \ninaccurate or incomplete. That is not their fault.\n  The whole point of this was to make sure we were helping people who \nwere choosing between food and medicine, people who were choosing \nbetween medicine and paying the rent, the electric bill or gas prices \nright now. If that is not happening, why are we moving full steam ahead \nwith some arbitrary deadline? Six days from now, folks are going to be \npenalized because the Government has been slow to get its act together, \nand they will be permanently penalized by paying more.\n  Less than 30 percent of the people who do not currently get help \npaying for their medicines have actually signed up. That should say \nsomething. It should either say, it is not a good deal, and they found \nout they would be paying more, and they said forget it or it says to us \nthat maybe we need to go back to the drawing board and make sure the \nright information, in the right way, is given out to people so they can \nmake the best decision for themselves.\n  I am also extremely concerned that in my home State of Michigan only \n22 percent of the 256,000 seniors eligible for low-income help, only 22 \npercent of those whom we said we wanted to help the most by waiving the \npremium and the copay, only 22 percent have signed up to get that extra \nhelp.\n  Unfortunately, our low-income seniors are caught twice because they \nhave to pick a plan. They have to, similar to Shirley, wade through all \nkinds of plans. Then they have to sign up separately to be able to get \nlow-income help.\n  I am pleased the administration has said they will allow low-income \nseniors to be able to sign up after May 15. I appreciate that. That is \na good start. Unfortunately, the penalty is not waived. Our lowest \nincome seniors, even though they may be able to sign up in June, July, \nand August--and that is a good thing and I appreciate the \nadministration doing that--I urge them to waive that penalty. It makes \nno sense if you allow people to sign up for extra help and then take it \naway through a penalty for signing up late.\n  The final issue is our poorest seniors, our lowest income seniors in \nMichigan and individuals making less than $14,700 a year, our lowest \nincome seniors or the disabled, in too many instances are actually \npaying more under this plan than they were before. Why? Because they \nwere on Medicaid before for the low-income health care. In Michigan, \nthat meant paying a $1\n\n[[Page S4177]]\n\ncopay for a prescription, and that has doubled, tripled or gone higher. \nThis also makes no sense.\n  On top of that, those who were in Medicaid, our lowest income \nseniors, many in nursing homes, were automatically enrolled sometime in \nthe last few months, into a plan, regardless of whether it covered the \nmedicines. We have said to the lowest income seniors, many of them in \nnursing homes, you are signed up for a plan, and you have to go figure \nout whether it even helps you and how you are going to get out of it if \nit doesn't help you. And, by the way, you are going to pay more.\n\n  We can do better than this. I believe No. 1 is to stop the 6-day \ncount. No. 1, we have to give folks more time to wade through all of \nthis, to figure out what is going on, and we have to give some more \ntime to the Government to get its act together. The administration is \ndoing a disservice to people by the way this has been handled. Giving \nmore time will allow that to happen.\n  I am also very hopeful we are going to come back and come together \nand give people the one choice they really want. People do not want 70 \nplans. They are not saying: Oh, please, give me a whole bunch of \ninsurance papers to wade through. Give me increased premiums. Give me \nall kinds of deadlines to deal with. What they said was: I need help \nwith my medicine.\n  We are blessed in this country to have more medicine available as a \npart of the way we allow ourselves to live healthier lives, longer \nlives, to be able to treat cancers, to be able to treat other chronic \nillnesses. Medicines are available now. But they are not available if \nthey are not affordable. We can do better.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful at some point we are going to come back \nto this floor and give people the choice they want: A real Medicare \nbenefit through Medicare, with a reasonable copay and premium, where \nyou sign up and you can go to your local pharmacy, and Medicare \nnegotiates good prices. That is what we ought to be doing.\n  In the meantime, let's stop the countdown to May 15.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/09/senate-section/article/S4163-7", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4163-S4177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETPLACE MODERNIZATION AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF \n                        2006--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration on the motion to proceed on S. 1955.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 417, a bill (S. 1955) to \n     amend title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \n     of 1974 and the Public Health Service Act to expand health \n     care access and reduce costs through the creation of small \n     business health plans and through modernization of the health \n     insurance marketplace, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time until \n10 a.m. shall be equally divided between the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. \nEnzi, and the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, or his designee.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am here this morning to ask this body to \nsupport the motion to proceed to the debate. All we are voting on is \nwhether we are going to get to debate, not whether we are going to have \nhealth insurance for small businesses. But if this vote does not get 60 \nvotes, we will not have the opportunity in this Congress to see whether \nwe can help out small businesses across this country.\n  The bill before us will provide for small businesses to be able to \njoin across State lines to negotiate against the insurance companies \nwith enough power to make a difference. This is something which the \nsmall businesses have been asking for for almost 15 years. In the last \n12 years, it has passed the House eight times but has never even gotten \nout of committee in the Senate until this year. The reason it got out \nof committee is because we have drastically changed the bill. We are \nnot talking about the old association health plans we had in the past. \nThis is one which has had some modifications that have been helped with \ninsurance companies and State insurance commissioners. It still keeps \nthe power of oversight and consumer protection in the hands of the \nState insurance commissioners, but it does allow the ability to unify \nthings so that we can get across State lines.\n  How is it doing? Well, the Washington Post says it went too far. The \nWall Street Journal says it didn't go far enough. So maybe we are \nsomewhere right there in the middle. But unless we get to debate this \nissue, we will never know until we can get through the motion to \nproceed and possibly 30 hours of still debating whether we are going to \ndebate before we ever get to a motion. So I am hoping that this morning \nwe can pass this motion to proceed.\n  I can't believe that any Senator here hasn't heard from enough small \nbusinessmen that he wouldn't allow us to proceed to the debate. I am \nhoping that following that motion to proceed to debate, we can limit \nthe hours of debating that particular motion and get on with the \nsubstance of trying to perfect a bill.\n  In my 9 years in the Senate, I have never seen a perfect bill. I am \nnot saying this is a perfect bill. I am saying it is one that has come \nout of compromise, long discussions, and has moved away from the point \nof huge objection on the Senate side to less objection on the Senate \nside. It is a bill that can be worked out, can be passed, and can have \na significant difference for\n\n[[Page S4164]]\n\nsmall companies across the United States.\n\n  Will it make a difference? There are several surveys that say it will \nmake a difference. I am saying that from the amount of advertising \nwhich was done before we even had the motion to proceed, there must be \na lot of big bucks in savings in this thing to have the kind of \nopposition we have already had on it. But we will never know unless we \nget the right to debate. So I am asking my colleagues to vote aye on \nthe motion to proceed so that we can proceed to a debate, sometime \nwithin the next 30 hours, hopefully.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to let me know when I \nhave 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. President, this should be a historic week. The Senate has the \nopportunity at last to have a debate on the basic questions of health \ncare. Senator Enzi has put forward a proposal that deserves debate and \nthe opportunity for amendment, and I commend him for his diligence in \nbringing forward his proposal. But after careful study and debate, I \nbelieve the Senate will conclude that the course laid out in this \nproposal is the wrong one for health care.\n  The legislation will make health care coverage less affordable and \nless accessible for millions of Americans. It will raise premiums for \nAmericans when they are older or when they fall ill. It will mean the \nend of laws to guarantee coverage for cancer, for diabetes, for mental \nhealth parity, and other essential services. It will undermine the laws \nthat protect consumers from fraud and abuse, and it will give no real \nhelp to the self-employed.\n  We have a better approach. The proposal offered by Senators Durbin \nand Lincoln will allow small businesses to band together to get the \nsame low rates offered to larger employers. It provides real help for \nsmall businesses with the high costs of health care through tax credits \nand reinsurance programs to defray the cost of the most expensive \nclaims.\n  When our debate concludes, I believe the Senate will agree with the \nover 200 organizations that have written letters of opposition to this \nlegislation. These organizations represent patients with diabetes and \ncancer and mental health needs. They represent older Americans, \nworkers, health care professionals, small businesses, and Americans in \nall walks of life. They represent the over 15,000 Americans who have \ncalled the Senate to ask this body to oppose legislation that will take \na step backward from our commitment to quality health care, and they \nrepresent the millions more who will be harmed if we do not reject the \nlegislation before us.\n  We have heard from Governors, insurance commissioners, and attorneys \ngeneral from Maine to Hawaii and from Florida to Alaska, and all of \nthem--all of them--have urged the Senate to reject this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the current legislation, but I hope \nthey will vote to proceed to consideration of this bill. The Senate has \nbeen denied the chance to take action on major health priorities for \ntoo long. Next week, seniors will be forced to pay a steep penalty if \nthey are unable to navigate through the tangle of confusing Medicare \nplans and options. The Senate ought to vote on Senator Nelson's \nproposal to let seniors make their choice without the threat of heavy \nfines if they do not meet this arbitrary deadline.\n  The Republican Medicare law also includes a provision so contrary to \ncommonsense that people hardly believe you when you tell them it was \nincluded. The legislation makes it illegal for Medicare to bargain for \ndiscounts on drugs for seniors. We have a proposal to end that shameful \nprohibition, and we should vote on that proposal.\n  On Medicaid, we should take action to end the cruel cuts imposed on \nthe poorest of our fellow citizens by the Deficit Reduction Act, which \npaid for tax cuts for the wealthy through health cuts for the poor.\n  We have been promised and promised that the Senate would vote on drug \nimportation, but the vote never comes. Senator Dorgan, Senator Snowe, \nSenator McCain, and I have a proposal that will allow safe importation \nof lower cost medicines from Canada and elsewhere. Surely, Health Week \nis the time for a vote.\n  Before the week is out, the Senate should see that the promise of \nstem cell research--stem cell research--is no longer denied to the \nmillions of patients and their families who look on with anger and \nbewilderment as the bill passed by the House languishes for month after \nmonth after month in the Senate. And we have failed year in and year \nout to fulfill the promise of this century of the life sciences by \nmaking quality care a right for every American. Let us at long last \ntake action to extend quality care to every American.\n  So I say to my colleagues: Vote for cloture on this motion. Vote for \na health care debate. Vote for a chance to go on record with your \nanswer to these important questions on Medicare, on Medicaid, on stem \ncell research, on drug importation, on coverage, and on many other \nhealth priorities. Let's have a debate, and let's let the Senate decide \nwhere it stands.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nhis encouragement on his side of the aisle to vote for the motion to \nproceed. I think that will get us into a debate that will make a \ndifference for the working people of America, the people up the street \nand across the street, the working families that are a part of small \nbusiness.\n  Today, there are 45 million people in the United States who are \nwithout health insurance in this country. Twenty-two million people own \nor work for small businesses or live in families that depend on small \nbusiness wages, and another 5 million are unemployed. Those are the 27 \nmillion people we are talking about whom this health care bill will be \nmaking decisions for in the next few days.\n  It is long past time for Congress to take some action. The American \npeople aren't going to accept excuses any longer. It has been a long \ntime getting to this debate. I am pleased that it sounds like we will \nbe able to have it. I welcome any amendments that are alternate \napproaches or improvements to this bill. I know what the complaints are \nout there, I know what the counters to those are, and I know what the \nconcerns are. It is very important that when we walk away from this \nweek, we walk away with a plan which will help the small business \npeople of the United States, the ones working for small businesses, the \nones owning them, and their families who need the help.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time? Each side has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will mention at this time some of the \norganizations. We will have a chance during the course of the debate to \nget into the reasons why. The American Academy of Pediatrics; the \nAmerican Cancer Society; the Diabetes Association; the Nurses \nAssociation; Families USA; the lists of Governors--and I will include \nthose--more than probably 15, 18 Governors; the attorneys general. I \nthink there are probably close to 40 of the attorneys general \nrepresenting States North, South, East, and West who have opposed this \nbill. The Insurance Commissioners of the States--a whole list of those. \nAt the appropriate time, I will include those in the Record.\n  I hope our colleagues will put their ear to the ground and find out \nwhat people are saying back home, what your cancer society, diabetes, \npediatric nurses and doctors are saying about this, what the attorneys \ngeneral are saying about this, and what those in the medical profession \nare saying about this. We think we have a better way to help small \nbusiness, and during the course of the debate, we will show how that \ncan be done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming has 56 seconds.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nlisting those 200 organizations. I have never done a count on them, and \nI am not familiar with quite that many; I am only familiar with about \n40 that have expressed some concern that I suspect will be taken care \nof in amendment if we can get to the amendment process.\n\n[[Page S4165]]\n\n  I would like to mention that there are over 200 business \norganizations that are looking forward to being able to unite these \npeople across State lines to get lower rates for their people. There \nare actually 80 million employees in those businesses, in those \norganizations. The realtors are going to be here with 9,000 people next \nweek, expecting that we will have already taken action. The National \nFederation of Independent Businesses is another big one that is \nsupporting this. I could mention a lot more. Even some of the \nassociations that have concerns about it want to be sure that this bill \npasses so their employees can be covered.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. By unanimous consent, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the standing rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 417, S. 1955, Health Insurance \n     Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act of 2005.\n         Bill Frist, Johnny Isakson, Sam Brownback, John Thune, \n           Thad Cochran, Wayne Allard, John Ensign, Richard \n           Shelby, Larry Craig, Ted Stevens, John McCain, Lamar \n           Alexander, Norm Coleman, Judd Gregg, Pat Roberts, Craig \n           Thomas, Richard Burr.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

On this vote, the yeas are 96, the nays are 2. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the postcloture \ndebate on the motion to proceed be divided as follows: From now until \n11 a.m. will be under majority control; from 11 to 11:30 will be under \nminority control; 11:30 to 12 will be under majority control; and noon \nto 12:30 will be under minority control.\n  The Senate will stand in recess from 12:30 to 2:15 p.m. I ask that \ntime count under the provisions of rule XXII. The time from 2:15 to \n2:30 will be equally divided between the majority and minority; from \n2:30 to 3 we begin majority control, with the next 30 minutes under \nminority control, and each 30 minutes rotating in this format until the \nhour of 5:30 p.m.\n  Before the Chair rules, we would like to make out a time certain to \nbegin consideration of the bill. In the interim, this unanimous consent \nallows the Senate to have an orderly debate for speakers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank virtually all Members in the Senate \nfor their help in getting the motion to proceed. That will allow us to \ndo 30 more hours of debate before we actually get into the substance of \nmaking any changes in the bill. I hope we can work out a unanimous \nconsent agreement that will shorten that time and get us into the meat \nof the debate. I will push for some rapid consideration of some \namendments so we can get this resolved for the small businessmen of \nthis country in short order.\n  I will address some of the charges made against this bill. I listened \nyesterday and the day before to the minority leader's speech to the \nSenate on Friday. I was surprised by several of the statements he made \nregarding this bill. If I had not already known that he was talking \nabout S. 1955, I would never have guessed it.\n  The first comment the minority leader made was that our bill \nthreatens the coverage of those who have insurance now and does nothing \nto extend coverage to those who need it. I make two points in response \nto that. First, it seems to me the status quo is what is truly \nthreatening the coverage of those who are insured now. Prices are going \nup dramatically. Small business has no leverage. No one can afford more \nof the same or more excuses from Washington.\n  Blocking an honest debate on this bill is a vote for more of the \nsame. It is a vote for health insurance costs continuing to rise \ndramatically, for more small businesses dropping coverage for their \nemployees, and for more uninsured American families. Year after year of \nmore of the same is what is truly threatening America's health care \nsecurity.\n  Second, this bill will indeed extend coverage to more people who need \nhealth insurance. If you do not believe me, listen to our nonpartisan \nCBO. The CBO says this bill will reduce health insurance costs for \nthree out of every four small businesses. The CBO also said the bill \nwill extend private health coverage insurance to 750,000 more people \nthan have it today.\n  Is that a comprehensive solution to the problems of health care and \nthe uninsured? Of course not. I understand this is not a comprehensive \nsolution to the problem of health care costs and the uninsured, but it \nis definitely a step in the right direction and a building block for \nthe future.\n  I have more comments about statements made about the bill in ads and \nin editorials, but at this point, I release the remainder of our time \nuntil 11 o'clock to the Senator from Missouri who has been working on \nthis in the House for years in a totally different version but has \nbrought his expertise, talent, and knowledge to this side of the \nbuilding. He has been a strong advocate for doing something for small \nbusinesses. He has been extremely cooperative in finding ways to do \nthings so we can have something for small businesses.\n  I relinquish the floor to the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Talent.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his \nkind words and his great work and his comments regarding my involvement \nwith the idea of small business health plans. What he said is true \nregarding my involvement. I am not the father of this idea, but I think \nI probably ``midwifed'' it years and years ago when I served in the \nHouse in 1997. It has passed the House on a regular basis ever since \nthen and, as the chairman knows, on a very strong bipartisan basis \nbecause the idea of small business health plans is fully within the \nmainstream of both parties' thinking which is one of the very powerful \narguments in favor of it.\n  The No. 1 issue facing small business today as a whole is not energy \ncosts, although certainly they are too high. It is not immigration, \nalthough that is definitely an issue. It is not taxes, although we all \nhear our share of complaints from small business people about that. It \nis the rising cost of health insurance and the number of\n\n[[Page S4166]]\n\npeople who do not have health insurance. That is largely a small \nbusiness problem.\n  There are 45.8 million Americans who are uninsured today, 4 million \nmore than 2001. That number has grown every year, in years of \nprosperity or recession. The vast majority of those uninsured people \nare working people. And most of those working people are people who \nwork for a small business. They work for a small business, they own a \nsmall business, or they are dependents of someone who works for or who \nowns a small business.\n  The smaller the business is, the worse the problem gets. Only 40 \npercent of businesses with 3 to 6 employees today have health insurance \nfor their employees and that number is down from 52 percent in 2004 and \n58 percent in 2002.\n  We are entitled to ask ourselves, Why? I have heard a lot of \nexplanations over the years. Why does small business have a problem \nproviding health insurance for its employees whereas bigger companies \ndon't? You would be surprised at the explanations offered. I had one \nwitness from the Government Accountability Office tell me that he did \nnot think employees of small business wanted health insurance. I have \nother people speculate that small employers did not care as much about \ntheir people who work for them as big companies do. That certainly will \ncome as a revelation to Senators that big corporate employers care more \nabout their employees than the small business owners and managers do--\nthe small business people who work on a daily basis with their \nemployees, the small business people who would like to get health \ninsurance themselves from the small business if they could figure out a \nway for the small business to provide that health care to the \nemployees.\n  It is not a question of the small business people caring enough. The \nproblem is, the cost and complexity of getting health insurance for a \nsmall business is greater than it is for a big business. It will \nsurprise no one who has common sense that it is harder to insure a \nsmall market, a small group, than a big group. The cost of insurance is \nless if you can spread it across a bigger pool of people. This has been \nstudied extensively, and that very commonsense conclusion has been \nvalidated.\n  I will go over some of the figures for the Senate. Health insurance \npremiums for small business people increased by 10.9 percent in 2001, \n12.9 in 2002, 13.9 in 2003, 11.2 percent in 2004, and 9.2 percent in \n2005.\n  The smallest firms have always seen bigger increases in premiums. \nWhy? Well, the SBA's Office of Advocacy has found that small businesses \ntypically spend much more than large businesses for the same benefits. \nNot that the benefit packages are different, not that small businesses \nare trying to buy more expensive benefit packages; they have to spend \nmore to get the same benefits because the administrative costs of some \nbenefits are almost 14 times more for the smallest firms than for their \nlargest counterparts.\n  According to the Government Accountability Office, from 20 to 25 \npercent of small employer premiums typically go toward expenses other \nthan benefits compared with about 10 percent for large employers. The \nsmall business people are paying more to get the same benefits because \nthey have higher overhead costs and higher administrative costs. They \ndo not enjoy the same economies of scale the big companies enjoy.\n  The American people know this. I have a lot of stories from Missouri \nI could tell. I do not have the time. But the American people are \nliving with this every day.\n  Jim Henderson is the president of Dynamic Sales in St. Louis. It is a \nthird-generation family business that sells welding accessories and \nother products. It is a small business. He has eight employees. Health \ninsurance has been a problem for 16 years for Jim. He spoke with his \ninsurance agent, who suggested raising the deductible to keep the \npremium the same, so he has raised the deductible. It has gone from \nzero to a $1,000 deductible in the last 10 years. So despite that huge \nincrease in the deductible, to this day, he experiences huge increases \neach time he tries to renew the policy. When he asked his carrier about \nthe enormous increases and why they are raising his premiums so much, \nthe carrier responded: Well, because we can.\n  Tammy Herbert is a certified optician from Farmington, MO. She is a \ncancer survivor. She had breast cancer. She is a single, working mom. \nShe is an inspiration when you talk to her. She told me because of her \nhistory of breast cancer, 2 years ago her employer's insurer canceled \nall the individual policies for her and her colleagues.\n  People talk about small business health plans resulting in cherry-\npicking. They ought to see what is happening today in the small group \nmarket.\n  Renee Kerckhoff is the second generation owner of Rudroff Heating & \nAir Conditioning, in Belton, MO. She can only afford to cover a small \nportion of employee insurance premiums--about $150 a person per month. \nAs a result, and despite her best efforts, her employees are having to \ndrop their health insurance because they cannot afford the copays and \nthe premiums they have to make and are going on public assistance.\n  These stories are happening all over Missouri and all over the \ncountry. Sometimes I will get with a group of people and ask them: \nLook, if you had a history of medical illness, and you had the choice \nof working for a big company or a small company, and all you cared \nabout was health insurance, and all you knew about the companies was \nthat one was a big Fortune 500 company and the other was a small \ncompany, which one would you work for? I have never had anybody raise \ntheir hand and say: I would work for the small company because the \nassumption is I am going to get better health insurance from the small \nbusiness.\n  They know, because it is a matter of common sense, insuring a large \npool of people is more efficient, more economical and, therefore, less \nexpensive than insuring a small group of people.\n  Just look at the people who are insured in the country. Virtually \neverybody who has health insurance, except for the employees of small \nbusiness people, have it as part of a big national pool. It may be \npublic, it may be private, but it is a big national pool. They work for \na big company. They are in a labor union. They are on Medicare or \nMedicaid or they are a Federal employee or a retired Federal employee \nor in the VA.\n  All these other organizations could insure on a small group basis if \nthey wanted to. The Federal Government could go out and take each \nsection of Federal employees in different cities and divide them all up \nand insure them in a small group. There is no law against that. \nMicrosoft could do the same thing. Hallmark in Missouri could. \nAnheuser-Busch in Missouri could. They could insure each little section \nif they wanted to. Well, they do not because it does not make any \nsense. It would cost them more money to do it. Yet small business \npeople have to do that every day.\n  So what is the answer? Well, there is a simple answer that is out \nthere. Everybody tries to make it more complicated than it is, but it \nis simple: Empower the small business people to do what the big \nbusiness people can already do. Allow them to pool together through \ntheir trade associations and get health insurance as part of a big, \nnational, voluntary, efficient, economical pool.\n  I give an example: I think it is the best way to describe it. Take a \nrestaurant owner such as my brother, who owns a little restaurant. It \nis kind of a tavern restaurant. It is a great place. It has great \nchicken sandwiches. And I highly recommend it to you if you get to \nMissouri. He does not have health insurance for his people. It is too \nexpensive. It is complex and foreboding for him. He and my sister-in-\nlaw run the business. They do not want to have to wrestle with big \ninsurance companies. They are afraid if something goes wrong, they \ncould get sued. He would like to have health insurance. Then he could \nget it through the business, too.\n  Now, what if the National Restaurant Association could contract with \nbig insurance companies? They could be his employee benefits section, \njust like big companies have an employee benefits section. By joining \nthe National Restaurant Association, he automatically would have the \nright to join the big pool. They would send him the papers. They would \nshow him the options he\n\n[[Page S4167]]\n\nhas, and he could decide how much he wants to pay. He could let his \nemployees pay the rest and join the pool. He could have health \ninsurance as part of a big pool. It would be must-offer, must-carry. \nThey would have to let him join the National Restaurant Association and \nwould have to offer the health insurance to him.\n  When I chaired the Small Business Committee in the House, we studied \nthis issue. And I have seen a lot of other studies since then. The best \nestimates I saw were that it would reduce premiums for small employers \nby 10 to 20 percent; a recent study came out and said 12 percent. There \nwould be a million fewer people uninsured.\n  It costs the taxpayers nothing. It is not a Government program. It is \nempowering small business people to do what big business people already \ncan do. I think the impact would be much greater than the studies have \nshown because right now the psychology of health insurance, if you are \na small business, is so negative. I think you would see whole segments \nof the economy, which traditionally have not provided health insurance \nto their employees, begin to provide health insurance. And the \nrestaurant business is one of them. It is one of the reasons the \nNational Restaurant Association is so strongly in favor of this \nconcept.\n\n  Now I have talked about this for almost 10 years. I lay it out for \npeople, and they say to me: Well, who would oppose this? I actually get \nthat question a lot: Who is opposed to it? And that is a good question. \nIt is fully within the mainstream of both parties' philosophy. It is \nempowering the little guy, just like farm co-ops. It passes the House \nwith a strong, bipartisan majority every year. And why shouldn't it?\n  What is the downside of it? The downside is: It does not work as well \nas we hope it is going to work. Not as many people go into it as we \nhope and believe will go into it.\n  It is not as though the taxpayers are going out on a limb. So who is \nopposed to it? Well, nobody will be surprised to hear that the big \ninsurance companies have opposed it, and they have come up with all \nsorts of excuses over the years. I am not going to go heavily into it \nbecause the chairman has worked very hard to get as much consensus as \nhe can get. But I will say this. I think they oppose it not because \nthey are afraid it will not work but because they believe it will work. \nAnd they control most of the small group market now. I do not have time \nto go through those figures. But the concentration of the small group \nmarket within the five largest carriers has grown and grown and grown. \nAnd small business health plans would be a powerful, new competitive \nforce in that market.\n  The State insurance commissioners have been concerned because these \nsmall business health plans would be national and they felt the State \nwould not be able to regulate it. In fairness, I have to say, I have \nnever agreed with that. Remember, the big companies already operate \nfree of State regulation. That has been the law for 30 years. And we \nhave not had any disasters as a result of that. I do not believe \nanything that has happened in the last 10 years or so is proof that we \ncan trust the big companies more than we can trust the small companies.\n  If I had to decide who was going to be free of State regulation, I \nthink I would rather have the small businesses free of that. And it is \nnot as though the market the States have regulated never has any \nproblems. There are a lot of insurance companies that go bankrupt, and \nthe States have to take them over.\n  But the good news is that the chairman has squared this circle. He \nhas worked out an arrangement for the regulation of small business \nhealth plans where many of the State regulations and much of the State \nregulatory authority will still apply. I am not saying the State \ninsurance commissioners are standing up for his bill, but I think it is \nsafe to say that many of their objections have been ameliorated, and \nthe chairman has made much progress on that front.\n  Folks who tend to be sincerely on the ideological extreme on health \ncare issues--and maybe ``extreme'' is the wrong word, but they want to \ngo one way or the other--have been lukewarm about small business health \nplans. There are some who wish to eliminate the employer system and \ntake the Federal tax deduction and pass it through to individuals and \nlet them go out and buy health insurance on their own, and there are \nothers who want a total Government solution. And this is not any one of \nthose things.\n  It is a substantial and important and meaningful but incremental \nchange in the world we are in. It makes things better for people on a \nday-to-day basis who are out struggling in the real world. Maybe it is \nnot the reform that any of the think tanks on the right or left would \ncome up with, but it makes a difference. It will help. There is little \nor no downside to it. We need to help the real people who are really \nhurting.\n  Finally--and this I understand entirely; I struggled with this myself \nin the years I had this bill--the groups that have worked to get \nvarious disease mandates in the States have been concerned. Because if \nyou worked hard to get a mandate so that mammogram screening is covered \nin your State as a matter of right, and small business health plans go \ninto a national pool, just like the big companies, if we do not do \nsomething, they would not be subject to those State mandates.\n  I have made a point in talking with these groups over the years \nsaying that, look, the big company plans, the big pools that exist out \nthere--the labor unions, the company plans, the Federal employee plans; \nall those sorts of things--they usually cover all those mandated \ncoverages, anyway, because most of them are pretty common sense.\n  Again, remember, if you have been sick, and you have a choice of \nworking for a big company that is not covered by the State mandates or \na little company that is, which do you think has the better health \ninsurance? The folks I have talked to over the years say: Well, we \nwould go with the big company.\n  But I think we are going to be able to square that circle as well. \nSenator Snowe is going to offer an amendment which will represent \nprogress in this area. It will provide that if 26 States cover a \nmandate, that mandate applies to small business health plans, and it is \nprotected in the States that have it. So this is progress. It is not \njust net progress; it is absolute progress for these various groups \nthat have sought these protections because they are going to have, if \nthat amendment passes--and, certainly, I am going to support it--they \nwill have protections on the Federal level for the first time for these \nvarious coverages.\n  So I am very hopeful they will take a look at this. I believe with \nthe amendment Senator Snowe is going to offer, the concerns they had \nnot only do not apply anymore, but actually they are going to be better \noff because for the first time we are going to have national pools set \nup under Federal law with certain basic patient protections and \ncoverages that are guaranteed. As I said, I do not think those would be \nnecessary because I think the pools would cover them, anyway. Most of \nthose are pretty common sense. But we can put them in the law and \nreassure everybody. And I think we can make the bill better if we do \nthat.\n  I see my time is running out, Mr. President.\n  So what is left? Why should we oppose this? I do not want to be \npresumptuous. I have lived with this bill for so long that maybe there \nare weaknesses I do not see. But this is something we can do for \npeople. It passes the House regularly. They like it over there. It has \na strong measure of bipartisanship, anyway. There is no real downside \nto it.\n  Let's debate the bill, and let's resolve that we are going to debate \nit with a view toward actually voting on it.\n  I hope nobody filibusters this bill. We can work out agreements about \ndebate, work out agreements about amendments, and have a chance to help \npeople. This is a problem. This is a case where people are hurting. I \nknow politics is important here; I know this is an election year; I \nknow all of that. But we can make a difference for real people on the \nground every day who are worried about losing their health insurance or \nwho do not have health insurance and are worried about getting sick. We \nought to do it.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding. It looks as though my time has \nexpired. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 minutes. Senator Kennedy \nis\n\n[[Page S4168]]\n\nnot here right now, but pursuant to previous agreement, I would like to \nbe notified when 15 minutes expires so I can conclude my remarks in the \n20 minutes.\n  I spoke yesterday about this legislation. I want to begin by saying \nto my friend from Wyoming, the chairman, I have a great deal of regard \nfor him. I have enjoyed working with him on the HELP Committee. We do a \nlot of work together. I have enjoyed that relationship. It is with a \nnote of sadness that I disagree with him about this bill. We had a \nlengthy markup. He was very patient to listen to all of our ideas and \nthe amendments we offered during the markup. I appreciated his \nwillingness to do so. But as happens from time to time, we have \ndisagreements. They are not personal. They are ideas on which we have a \ndifferent point of view. Today is one of those occasions. These remarks \nare in no way intended to denigrate the work of the chairman of the \ncommittee or those who agree with him.\n  There are those of us who believe strongly that this proposal would \ndo a lot more harm than good, that, in fact, the cure being proposed \nwith this legislation creates far more problems than presently exist, \nas bad as the present situation is. We know, as a matter of fact, that \nover the last 3 years, the premium cost for health care has risen: 9 \npercent in 2005, 11 percent in 2004, 14 percent in 2003. These costs \ncontinue to rise. A family of four today is paying about $11,000 in \npremiums for health care coverage. The problem is significant.\n  I regret in some ways--and this is not the fault of the chairman of \nthe committee--that we are not debating in a broader sense how we might \naddress the far more significant issue, as important as this one is, \nwhen we have 45 million fellow Americans with no health care coverage \nat all. I regret that we are not having a larger debate on that issue.\n  Secondly, I believe it is a legitimate issue to raise the issue of \nhow small business is dealt with when it comes to insurance. In the \nnext 2 days, we will offer a substitute to the proposal authored by the \nchairman of the committee, the Senator from Wyoming, that we believe \nwill deal far more thoroughly with the legitimate issues that smaller \nbusinesses face. In fact, we redefine small business to mean businesses \nnot with 50 employees or less but 100 employees or less, thereby \ncovering more small businesses than would be covered by the legislation \nbefore us.\n  The problems are huge in the area of health care. If you do surveys \nof the American public and ask them to identify what are the largest \nconcerns they have, if not the No. 1 issue--from time to time other \nissues may be more important to people--consistently year in and year \nout, people will tell you their great concern is about the fear of \nwatching a family member or themselves be hit with a major health care \ncrisis and not having the resources to pay for it, not being able to \nget the doctors, not being able to have the kind of care they would \nwant for their families because they cannot afford the premiums that \nwould provide them broader coverage, if they have any kind of coverage \nat all. They may not have any kind of health care. This is a major \nproblem. We ought to be spending a lot more time addressing this issue \nthan we are.\n  Having said that, let me talk about this proposal. I am deeply \nworried about it. It isn't just my concern. Many Governors, more than \nthree-quarters of the attorneys general of the States which we \nrepresent, not to mention the health insurance commissioners of many \nStates, have raised very serious concerns about this legislation. They \nare very worried about what this bill will do to their constituents, \nthe States that we represent as Senators.\n  Let me share a letter from the Connecticut Business and Industry \nAssociation. This association represents 5,000 small employers in my \nState. This is not an organization that is known for its liberal \ntendencies. Quite the contrary, it is a very conservative business \ngroup. Listen to what my business group that represents the small \nbusinesses of my State has to say about this bill.\n\n       We believe that in Connecticut federally certified AHPs \n     would destabilize the small business insurance marketplace, \n     erode carefully crafted consumer protections and raise \n     premium rates for small businesses with older workforces and \n     those that employ people with chronic illnesses or \n     disabilities.\n\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       Although the passage of AHP legislation would present us \n     with opportunities to expand our CBIA health connection's \n     product customer base as a regional offering, we do not \n     believe that the proposed legislation represents a sound \n     public policy for providing more affordable coverage or \n     access to health care benefits. The proposed legislation does \n     little to address the underlying causes of health care \n     inflation, which is the most important barrier to small \n     employers providing health care benefits.\n\n  That is a strong letter from an organization that represents 5,000 \nsmall employers in the State of Connecticut. They are worried about \nwhat this bill will do to smaller employers in my State in terms of \ntheir costs. They are deeply worried about this legislation and what it \nmay mean.\n  Let me also share with my colleagues a second chart. This was a chart \nthat was produced by Families USA, with estimates from the Agency for \nHealth Care Research and Quality, a medical expenditure panel, and from \nthe U.S. Census Bureau. It tells us the number of people that will be \nlosing State regulatory protections if this bill is passed. What we are \ndoing is shrinking the amount of benefits that can be offered. In my \nState, we offer a range of 30 different benefits--that was passed by my \nState legislature--that insurance companies must cover. If you are \ngoing to do business in my State, then you have to provide coverage for \nthese 30 areas that we believe are important.\n  I note this morning an editorial in the Wall Street Journal that \ncriticizes those of us who have raised issues about this bill. They say \nin one paragraph:\n\n       Some provider groups are opposed for nakedly self-interest \n     reasons since it would allow plans to bypass state \n     regulations mandating coverage for, say, chiropractors.\n\n  Chiropractors provide some decent services to people. But with all \ndue respect, I would suggest that it is a lot more than chiropractors \nwho get bypassed with this legislation. It is things such as diabetes, \ncancer screening, infant health care, mental health care, pregnancy, \nLyme disease, to mention a few. I know several of my colleagues have \nhad family members affected by Lyme disease. My State thinks that is an \nimportant area to provide coverage. This bill would eliminate coverage \nfor Lyme disease because this legislation would mandate that Federal \nlaw would supersede State law. Regardless of what your State thinks is \nimportant, this bill will decide what will be covered. Everything else \ngoes. That is an overreach, in my view. As a result, the analysis of \nthe legislation presented on this chart suggests that in the State of \nAlabama, 1.7 million people who would be adversely affected if this \nlegislation is passed. In Connecticut, more than a million people would \nlose benefits that the State legislature requires the insurance \nindustry to cover. In State after State, the numbers are at least in \nthe six-figure category. In California, 12 million people would be \nadversely affected, Kentucky over a million people, Kansas over a \nmillion people, Illinois almost 4 million people, and the like.\n  I will leave this chart so my colleagues will be able to see how many \npeople will be affected in their States, according to data collected by \nthose who have examined what it would mean to a Federal mandate that \ntells every State in the country: We don't care what you have done, we \ndon't care what benefits you think are important, this bill will tell \nyou what kind of coverage you are going to have.\n  We also prohibit the States by preempting their ratings rules, which \nis my second point. This legislation preempts the States from having \nrating rules that will actually determine what the difference in cost \nwould be between young and healthy workers and older, sicker workers, \nto make sure they are not going to price the product so beyond the \nreach of an older, less healthy person that it would be unaffordable. \nIt is de facto exclusion if you allow the insurance industry to set \nthat price by preempting the States from determining whether there \nought to be a cap on how much an insurance company can charge. By \nlimiting benefits and by preempting the States from determining rates \nand holding them down,\n\n[[Page S4169]]\n\nwe make it very difficult for literally millions of people to be \npositively affected by this legislation.\n  Those are the two major concerns we have. There are other areas that \nwe will certainly raise. I mentioned earlier in my State, more than a \nmillion people will lose access to cancer screening, well childcare, \ndiabetes supplies, alcoholism treatment, mental health care, the \ntreatment for Lyme disease, to mention some. The list goes on with my \nState.\n  In addition to seeing their benefits disappear, millions of Americans \nwill see their health insurance premiums skyrocket as well. This bill \npreempts State laws that currently protect older workers, those with \nserious illnesses such as diabetes, cancer, and heart disease, even \nexpectant mothers, from seeing their premiums increase. This bill will \nallow the insurance industry to charge people more based on the fact \nthat they are sick or pregnant or simply older.\n  I have many insurance companies in my State, as my colleagues know, \nthat do a wonderful job in many ways. But don't have any illusions \nabout this. They are going to be offering as few benefits as they can \nget away with and charge as much as they can. That is what they are in \nbusiness for. This is not the Vista Program or AmeriCorps. These are \nprivate companies. If we give them a green light to limit the benefits \nyou can provide and take the caps off what they can charge, then, \nobviously, they are going to take advantage of it. I am greatly \nconcerned, as the major business organization in my State warns. When \nthe Connecticut Business and Industry Association says this bill would \nhurt the businesses in my State, we ought to take note of it. This \norganization has a strong record of protecting the interests of smaller \nbusinesses.\n  It doesn't take an expert to predict what will happen. Insurance \ncompanies are going to offer plans with minimal or no benefits, hoping \nto attract young and healthy workers. Older, sicker people are going to \nbe left without a plan that meets their needs. Every analysis of this \nbill reaches the same conclusion.\n  Listen to what the Congressional Budget Office says. They found the \nbill ``would tend to reduce health insurance premiums for small firms \nwith workers who have relatively low expected costs for health care and \nincrease premiums for firms with workers who have relatively high \nexpected costs.\n  In other words, instead of attacking the real problem, the rising \ncost of health care, this legislation would simply shift costs to small \nbusinesses with older and less well workers.\n  In fact, another study commissioned by the supporters of this \nlegislation concluded this bill ``is not going to address the \nunderlying causes of high health insurance premiums, which are high \nhealth care costs.''\n  Again, Governors, State attorneys general, the State insurance \ncommissioners have all reached the same conclusion, as have an enormous \nnumber of groups representing health care providers and patients. All \nof them say the same thing. They all can't be wrong. When your \nGovernors, attorneys general of the States, insurance commissioners, \nnot to mention almost every single health care group in the country \nwarns about the passage of this bill, then we ought to take note of it. \nWhen you hear that you will have literally millions of people losing \nbenefits passed by State legislative bodies that require the insurance \nindustry to cover them, then we ought to take note of that as well.\n  I know my colleagues will be offering amendments to allow lifesaving \nstem cell research to go forward, to strengthen Medicaid, reduce \nprescription drug prices, and ensure access to mental health care. I \nlook forward to having an opportunity to debate those amendments, many \nof which I will be supporting. We should also consider an amendment to \nextend the Medicare prescription drug plan enrollment deadline which is \ncausing a huge problem. These are the kinds of issues that ought to be \npart of our debate today. Medicare beneficiaries have only until this \ncoming Monday, May 15, to enroll in a prescription drug plan, if they \nare to avoid financial penalty. Why don't we take that as an amendment \nand extend that time to allow people to come forward. As we are all \naware, for many of the Nation's 41 million Medicare beneficiaries, the \nnew prescription drug plan offers more confusion than assistance and, \nfrankly, extending that date would make sense.\n  I intend to offer an amendment to protect newborns and children from \nthe damage inflicted by this legislation. Right now, 25 states have \nenacted mandates requiring insurers to provide benefits to the children \nof their enrollee; 31 States require insurers to cover the cost of \nchildhood immunization.\n  I am going to ask my colleagues to support language that would see to \nit that newborns and children are protected in every State, instead of \nallowing the insurance industry to pick plans that would exclude child \nimmunization and well-child care.\n  This legislation would completely preempt these State laws, leaving \nbabies and children unprotected. That is a major step backward. \nInstead, families will be faced with health insurance that doesn't \ncover routine care for children. They might be forced to pay out of \npocket, drastically driving up health care costs, or to forego care \nentirely. My amendment would ensure that those State laws not be \npreempted by this Federal mandate that we are about to adopt.\n  I will also offer an amendment that would prevent health insurers \nfrom deciding how much to charge a person for health insurance based on \nhow healthy they are. That is something we have done across the country \nin State after State.\n  Many States, including my own, have laws preventing the insurance \nindustry from charging more based on health status. Unfortunately, this \nlegislation would remove those State protections. It would allow the \ninsurance industry to charge more based on health status. We ought to \nmake sure we don't allow that to occur in this bill.\n  Without these protections in place, it just makes good business sense \nfor an insurance company to increase premiums for people with diabetes, \nHIV/AIDS, cancer survivors, pregnant women, or anybody with health \nneeds that are outside of the ordinary. As a result, the people who \nneed insurance the most will find they would be the first to lose it.\n  Finally, I will offer an amendment to protect those patients that \nadmirably choose to participate in clinical trials from undue costs \nresulting from their routine care. Currently, 19 States, including my \nown State of Connecticut, have enacted mandates requiring insurers to \nprovide coverage for routine patient care costs while those patients \nare participating in potentially lifesaving clinical trials. But this \nlegislation, as crafted, would completely preempt these State laws, \nleaving patients without needed coverage for items such as blood work \nand physician visits. And this legislation would preempt States like \nmine that provide benefits for people who are willing to become part of \na clinical trial.\n  Clinical trials save lives. Just 50 years ago, less than one in four \nwomen with breast cancer survived for 5 years or more. Compare that to \ntoday when 96 percent of women with localized breast cancer reach the \n5-year mark. This legislation would create a powerful disincentive to \npatients weighing the option of whether to participate in a clinical \ntrial. Tragically, we know that only 3 percent of adults suffering from \ncancer participate in clinical trials. Compare this to the 60 percent \nof children with cancer that enroll in a trial.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of amendments we would offer to try \nto improve this piece of legislation. While I respect the intent of the \nauthors, the bottom line is that it would do great damage to the gains \nthat have been made in State after State across the country, by \ncontrolling the costs of premiums and seeing to it that benefits are \noffered to people out there. The States made these decisions, and the \ninsurance industry, if they want to do business in their States, should \ncomply.\n  This legislation would mean that the Federal Government would wipe \nout protection in State after State that has provided for the \nprotection of its people--listen to your Governors, your attorneys \ngeneral, your health commissioners, insurance commissioners; listen to \nthe groups out there that pay attention to this kind of legislation. \nListen to the business groups that have warned what this would do to \nsmaller businesses across the country.\n\n[[Page S4170]]\n\n  Mr. President, I hope that when the appropriate time comes, we will \neither adopt amendments that will improve the bill substantially or, \nmore important, adopt the substitute that will be offered by Senator \nLincoln of Arkansas and Senator Durbin, which would allow people to \nhave the same kind of benefits each and every one of us have as Members \nof Congress, as part of a Federal health benefit program here that \nallows for the pooling of people, that would cover 100 employees or \nless, far beyond what this bill would cover with 50 or less. It would \nnot mandate that benefits provided by States be eliminated, and it \nwould not preempt the States from setting caps on premiums when it \ncomes to older and sicker workers. That is the way to go.\n  If you really want to make a difference, why don't we adopt this \nalternative. That would be a major gain for smaller businesses and \npeople who work with them. I understand this is an important issue. \nSmall businesses could use help, but we are not helping them with this \nbill, with all due respect. We can help them if we take the right \nsteps.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt the alternative, or at least improve \nthe bill with the amendments we will be offering in the next few days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand it, we are rotating back \nand forth. Could the Chair tell us how much time we have on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes remain.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, Mr. President, I thank my friend from Connecticut \nfor an excellent presentation and summation of the principal concerns \nabout this legislation. I ask the Chair to let me know when there is 1 \nminute remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of our committee, \nSenator Enzi, for his diligence in the development of the legislation. \nIt is legislation that I cannot support. But the chairman of our \ncommittee has put his finger on an area of health policy, which is \nenormously important for us to consider, and that is the general kind \nof challenge that is out there for small businesses in this country. By \nand large, they pay two or three times higher premiums than many of the \nvery large businesses in their States, and they are also seeing a \nturmoil in the market.\n  More often than not, they are changing companies every year, or every \nother year, and increasing numbers of those small businesses have to \ndrop coverage. This is a real problem.\n  If the proposal that is before us, the Enzi bill, was only to deal \nwith that particular issue, it ought to be given focus and attention \nand full debate and support. But his bill goes far beyond that. \nFortunately, we have an alternative, as the closing remarks of my \nfriend and colleague from Connecticut pointed out, in the Durbin and \nLincoln legislation, which addresses the small business needs. It does \nit creatively and effectively, and it does it without threatening the \nhealth protections that are there for States. The message and word \nought to go out to all those who support the Durbin-Lincoln proposal \nthat workers in those small businesses will effectively have the same \nkind of health care coverage that we have in the Senate of the United \nStates. That has been certainly a goal of mine for all Americans in the \ntime I have been in the Senate, and it still is.\n  We have an opportunity for the small business community, and for the \nworkers in those companies of 100 or less, to provide for them the same \nthings that we have for the Members of the U.S. Congress and Senate. \nThat statement cannot be made by the Senator from Wyoming. His bill \ndoes not do that. It has all kinds of adverse impacts in terms of \nworkers and health care protections.\n  So as we start this debate, we ought to recognize that there is an \nalternative which we on this side strongly support which will focus and \ngive attention to the small business community. The other proposal by \nSenator Enzi does not do that.\n  Mr. President, I am going to take a few minutes, because that is all \nI have, to review what I think are the most dangerous aspects of this \nlegislation. The fact is, today, as has been pointed out, there are \nsome 85 million Americans who have protections that will be effectively \nlost with the Enzi proposal. Those are protections for screening on \ncancer, for help and assistance in terms of diabetes, for medicines. \nThere are different protections that are given to other diseases that \nare threatened, and it threatens American families. Those have been \ndiscussed in local communities and in States that are now providing \nthose protections; and effectively, under the Enzi bill, those will be \nprohibited. There are a number of groups.\n  First of all, this is what the State insurance commissioners say, and \nwhy they are important is because they have a responsibility in terms \nof protecting consumers. This is what they have pointed out, Mr. \nPresident:\n\n       Standardizing the rating laws among States will do little \n     or nothing to reduce health insurance costs.\n\n  And also:\n\n       S. 1955 will result in older and less healthy employees \n     being priced out of the market as a result of expanding the \n     rate bands.\n       Small New Jersey employers with older and sicker employees \n     would see a dramatic rise and increase under the Federal \n     approach, effectively driving them from the insurance market \n     and leaving them vulnerable citizens without adequate health \n     coverage.\n\n  They are talking about ratings. Insurance companies are going to be \nable to charge for the proposal that the Senator from Wyoming has \ntalked about. They are going to have a flexibility of up to 26 percent \ndifference--26 times the difference in terms of premiums. Do you \nunderstand that? If you are an older worker and have had sickness in \nyour family, you will pay a rating that will be up through the roof.\n  That is not true in Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, no matter how \nsick or young you are, you are still within a 3-point or 3 times rating \nincrease. That has worked very effectively. That is something that \nevery older worker, every family that has had some kind of health \nchallenges ought to recognize--that they, under the Enzi bill, could \nwell be priced out of the market.\n  This is what the attorneys general have said:\n\n       The Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization And \n     Affordability Act should be more appropriately labeled the \n     Health Insurance Cost Escalation Act.\n\n  That was the attorney general from Minnesota.\n  The attorney general of New York said:\n\n       This legislation is not the answer here. It eliminates many \n     of the protections that consumers enjoy, without addressing \n     the underlying problem of cost containment.\n\n  They are also eliminating protections, as we have mentioned, for \nbreast cancer and diabetes.\n  Another one by the attorneys general:\n\n       There are no legitimate grounds for exempting the type of \n     insurance plan for State laws that provide essential \n     safeguards for persons covered by insurance.\n\n  It is not just Democrats, but Democrats and Republicans; 41 out of \nthe 50 attorneys general charged with protecting consumers are saying \nthis bill doesn't get it.\n  Mr. President, this is very interesting by the New Hampshire Governor \non S. 1955:\n\n       In 2003, New Hampshire passed a law establishing rating \n     rules similar to those contemplated under S. 1955.\n\n  New Hampshire passed almost the identical bill that is now being \nconsidered in the Senate.\n\n       With the rules allowing insurance companies to discriminate \n     against businesses with sick workers, or based on geography, \n     this law sent small business health insurance costs \n     skyrocketing across New Hampshire. Small business could not \n     grow, could not hire new workers, and some considered ending \n     their health insurance plans altogether.\n\n  They have done it. It is rare around here when you have a new \nproposal that you have had experience with--and the State of New \nHampshire has it--and they ended up withdrawing that proposal.\n  Finally, we have the various patient groups. Here is the American \nDiabetes Association:\n\n       S. 1955 would result in millions of Americans with diabetes \n     losing their guarantee of diabetes coverage.\n\n  The Cancer Society said:\n\n       Passage of this legislation would represent a retreat in \n     this Nation's commitment to defeat cancer.\n\n\n[[Page S4171]]\n\n\n  The National Partnership for Women and Families said:\n\n       Instead of making health care more affordable for those who \n     need it most, S. 1955 would roll back the reforms adopted by \n     many States to require fair pricing.\n\n  We look forward on this side to debating these issues--the Durbin-\nLincoln proposal and the Enzi proposal--and we also look forward to \ndebating stem cell research, the real Medicare alternative in the \nprescription drug debate, the ability of Medicare to be able to \nnegotiate lower prices for our senior citizens, and drug \nimportation. If we are going to have a health care debate, let's make \nsure we are going to deal with many of the issues that people in our \ncountry want us to deal with.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as we wait on a couple of people to speak, I \nwould like to make a few comments on the comments that have been made. \nI do appreciate the spirit in which they have been made. I know there \nare amendments waiting to modify several of the things that have been \nsuggested, but my biggest concern is that there were some comments \nabout the Attorneys General of the United States and the insurance \ncommissioners who are against it, and even the Connecticut business \nassociations who are apparently saying they are against the bill.\n  But what I need to correct is the comments they are making are not on \nthis bill. What they are talking about is the bill that the House has \npassed eight separate times: the associated health plans bill. \nAssociated health plans are different than this bill. It would be nice \nif some of the people who are going national and public on this would \nactually check with us on some of their comments to see if they are \nremotely right.\n  We have put forward a solution which they said that 85 million people \nwould lose their benefits from. That would be just as ridiculous as me \nsaying that all 27 million people who are uninsured who work for small \nbusiness would be covered by this bill. Neither of those things is \ngoing to happen. There is a medium in there where there will be more \npeople who are insured. The difficult parts that were talked about \nconcerning things being taken away from people I am confident are not \ngoing to happen. There are a couple of reasons they are not going to \nhappen.\n  First of all, there are experiments across the country which in a \nsmall way have done what we are talking about in the small business \nhealth plans, and in those experiments, they have worked: Taking away \nthe mandates that States have and actually making a point of mandating \nthat we take away the mandates. Around here, ``mandates'' is a bad \nword. Mandates means you are forcing somebody to do something and you \nare not paying for it. You are saying you have to have this, and \nwhether you can afford it or not, we are going to make you do it. So \nyour choice is to take the mandate or drop your insurance.\n  When we are talking about these mandates, a lot of them we are \ntalking about are regular maintenance of your body, and we ought to be \nhaving everybody do those. It shouldn't matter whether they are covered \nby insurance or otherwise. In fact, in Wyoming, we have gone to great \nlengths to have more things done by public health for free. That means \nyour insurance doesn't have to pay for it and you don't have to pay \nyour insurance company for it and you don't have to pay your insurance \ncompany for the administration of that service. But you can get that \nservice. Then we have some other screenings that are covered in a very \nreasonable way. We have a program in Wyoming trying to get everybody to \nhave mammograms, and it is focused on Mother's Day, which is coming up \nthis next weekend: Get a mammography for your mom. Show that you care. \nAnd thousands of people in Wyoming do exactly that.\n  I will cover some of the other issues, but I see that Senator Hatch, \nthe Senator from Utah, has arrived and has some comments in this \nregard, and he has been a very diligent worker on all of the small \nbusiness problems. So I yield time to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished chairman who I \nthink has done a terrific job on this bill. I understand the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire needs about 3 minutes, so I \nask unanimous consent that he be given 3 minutes, and then the time be \nreturned to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I wish to speak to the legislation before \nus and in particular to address some of the remarks that were made \nearlier by Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts. He raised concerns about \nthe State of New Hampshire and suggested that this legislation would be \nbad for the State of New Hampshire and that the State of New Hampshire \nhad already enacted legislation identical to this. I think it is wrong \nfor someone to provide information that is not entirely accurate. I \nthink that is inaccurate, and it is not inaccurate in some very key \nareas.\n  First, the bands that were discussed that were enacted in the State \nof New Hampshire were much smaller than the rating bands contemplated \nin this legislation, and they did it in New Hampshire without any \ntransition period. Those are two very significant, specific differences \nbetween this legislation and what was attempted in New Hampshire.\n  Second, as with any legislation, it cuts both ways. There were some \nemployers that saw increases in their premiums 2 and 3 years ago that \nsome claimed were a result of the legislation in New Hampshire, but \nmany businesses--in fact, the NFIB would suggest the majority of \nbusinesses--in New Hampshire saw some great relief because they are the \nsmaller businesses that we are talking about, those who would be \nallowed to improve their negotiating position through the provisions in \nthis bill. Moreover, this isn't a debate about one State. This is a \ndebate about providing increased access--increased access--to plans \nthat are negotiated by associations, by the members of small businesses \nand, as a result, negotiating lower prices.\n  Finally, there was discussion about community rating and how \nobjectionable it is that there will be an ability to differentiate on \nprice based on a number of factors. I think the truth is, when you \nforce that kind of price control, you force adverse selection because \nif I tell you that you have to charge the exact same price to anyone, \nno matter what region, circumstance, or situation, then the insurer \nwill automatically market to the healthiest people because they won't \nwant to take on the additional costs associated with those who might \nhave significant needs that result in higher prices.\n  So if you go to price control, which is exactly what the other side \nis suggesting, forcing the same price for everyone no matter who is \ncovered, businesses will naturally--naturally--only market to those who \nare healthy and, as a result, reduce the accessibility and availability \nof health insurance to those who might need it most.\n  It is a dramatic, unintended consequence, and that is the exact \noutcome that will be the result of the policies that are being \nsuggested by the other side. We need to be accurate in what we \nrepresent. This is a good bill for small business and, as a result, it \nis an excellent bill for New Hampshire because in New Hampshire, small \nbusinesses make up over 95% of all firm with employees. If we want to \ndo something about the uninsured, the majority of whom are working as \nself-employed or for small businesses, we need to take up the exact \nkind of provisions that are in this bill: Increased access of health \ninsurance for those working in the smallest firms.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Senator Hatch is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1955, the Health \nInsurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act. This is a \ngood bill, with good intentions. The lack of health insurance, \nparticularly for employees of small businesses, is a significant \nproblem in Utah and throughout the Nation.\n  We cannot afford to sit by the sidelines and bemoan this problem, \ntaking little action while millions of American families suffer. The \nHouse of Representatives has acted and we should do the same.\n  Immediately upon its passage though, we were besieged by complaints \nabout House legislation, principal among them the complaint that it \noverrides State insurance law.\n\n[[Page S4172]]\n\n  I give the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman \nMike Enzi a lot of credit.\n  Chairman Enzi didn't sit idly by.\n  He studied the House bill, he held extensive hearings, and then he \ndrafted a compromise that resolved many of the concerns expressed about \nthe House bill. This was no easy job.\n  Immediately, the HELP Committee effort--a solid effort I might add--\nwas besieged by criticism. Much of this criticism I must hasten to add, \nis not valid.\n  ``It isn't going to cover cancer care,'' the naysayers decry.\n  ``It isn't going to cover diabetics and their supplies,'' they \nallege.\n  ``It isn't going to cover prenatal care or OB/GYN care for women,'' \nis a recent complaint.\n  ``It is going to run chiropractors, podiatrists and optometrists out \nof business,'' say hundreds of form letters that have flooded our \noffices.\n  The problem is, these complaints aren't even true. While the standard \nplan employees must be offered under this bill may not cover all those \nthings, S. 1955 clearly provides an alternative. Employees must be \noffered an enhanced plan, based on the coverage that public employees \nreceive in the five most populous States, if their employer's standard \nplan is not consistent with State law.\n  Most, if not all, of these services would be included in those \nenhanced plans that employers must offer under S. 1955.\n  But, let's talk about our basic goal here.\n  We want to provide affordable health insurance coverage to those who \ncurrently do not have coverage.\n  If we could afford to give them coverage for every possible illness, \ncondition, or procedure, if small businesses could afford to give them \ncoverage for every possible illness, condition or procedure, don't you \nthink it would have been done by now?\n  Of course it would.\n  That is the genius of the Enzi bill. It allows a basic level of \ncoverage--perhaps not every single service imaginable, but good solid \nhealth care insurance--and for those who want to pay more, there is a \nplan with more coverage.\n  In that way, the millions of Americans without health insurance will \nhave access to coverage.\n  You may ask yourself, ``Who doesn't have health insurance coverage?''\n  Today, over 45 million Americans do not have health insurance.\n  Over 25 percent of self-employed individuals are uninsured.\n  Over 30 percent of people who work for small businesses with fewer \nthan 25 employees are uninsured.\n  Over 20 percent of the people who work for small businesses with \nfewer than 100 employees are uninsured.\n  Something clearly needs to be done.\n  And that's why we are here, today, debating S. 1955.\n  I want to illustrate why passage of this legislation is necessary.\n  Ramona Rudert and her husband, Michael, have owned Professional \nAutomotive Equipment in North Salt Lake for 28 years. They have 12 \nemployees and they offer health insurance to them.\n  The Ruderts contribute $200 per month to their employees' health care \npremiums.\n  Their employees have to pay approximately $500 per month for family \ncoverage.\n  Their health insurance plan has a $1000 deductible.\n  So at least there is potential coverage. But here's the kicker: only \none of Professional Automotive Equipment's 12 employees decided to be \ncovered by their company's health policy, besides the Rudert family. \nThe rest of their employees cannot afford it.\n  The interesting twist about this story is that Ramona and Michael \nhave a daughter with juvenile diabetes. They recognize that the basic \nplan may not cover all the services their daughter needs.\n  But when asked why she supports S. 1955, Mrs. Rudert replied that she \nis ``always looking for ways to improve her employees' access to health \ncare'' and that while she has a daughter with Type 1 diabetes, her \ngreatest concern is about the affordability of insurance premiums for \nher employees.''\n  Passage of this bill is the top priority for Mr. and Mrs. Rudert, and \nthousands of Utah businesses. They recognize that affordability is a \nkey component to making that happen.\n  Let us not make perfect the enemy of the good.\n  It is an economic fact of life that a Federal requirement for small \nbusinesses to cover every small business employee for every possible \nhealth care-related service is neither appropriate nor affordable.\n  Those who decry this bill because it does not guarantee small \nbusiness employees a comprehensive plan, must be reminded that most \nemployees of small businesses do not have a choice today, if they are \nfortunate to have health insurance coverage. The legislation before the \nSenate will create new options for small businesses and, the potential \nfor more choices.\n  Today, smaller employers do not have the purchasing power of larger \nemployers. If they offer different types of health plans to their \nemployees, the administrative costs of offering these choices are much \nhigher for small employers.\n  But by leveraging their combined purchasing power, some local small \nbusiness associations are offering plans that give employers more \nchoice. I believe that similar models could be created regionally and \nnationally through S. 1955 through regional and national associations.\n  The goals of S. 1955 are simple. We want to create more affordable \nhealth insurance options through choice and competition.\n  And we want to end the decades-long deadlock and give real relief to \nAmerica's small businesses and working families.\n  Who can argue with that?\n  And small businesses support the freedom to band together across \nstate lines, even without self-funding. Insurance companies support the \ncreation of a level playing field with Small Business Health Plans.\n  Most important, according to a Mercer study released on March 7, \n2006, it is predicted that costs will go down 12 percent for small \nemployers and coverage of the working uninsured will go up 8 percent, \napproximately 1 million more working Americans.\n  An added benefit is that the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, \nbelieves that passage of S. 1955 will reduce net spending in the \nMedicaid Program. This is due to the enrollment in employer-sponsored \ninsurance plans of people, who under current law, would be covered by \nMedicaid.\n  CBO estimates that enacting S. 1955 would reduce direct spending for \nthe Federal share of Medicaid expenditures by $235 million over the \n2007-2011 period and $790 million over the 2007-2016 period. In \naddition, the bill would result in estimated Medicaid savings to States \ntotaling $180 million over the 2007-2011 period and $600 million over \nthe 2007-2016 period.\n  CBO estimates that by 2011, approximately 600,000 more people would \nhave health insurance coverage. The majority of these newly covered \nindividuals would be employees of small companies and their dependents.\n  S. 1955 has been endorsed by a host of organizations: The Small-\nBusiness Health Plan Coalition; the National Association of Realtors; \nthe Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness; the National Restaurant Association; the National Association \nof Manufacturers; the Associated Builders and Contractors; the National \nAssociation of Home Builders; the National Retail Federation; the \nAssociation Healthcare Coalition; the Textile Rental Services \nAssociation of America; the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers \nAssociation; the Precision Metalforming Association; the American \nCouncil of Engineering Council; Women Impacting Public Policy; National \nAssociation of Wholesaler-Distributors; Wendy's International which \nincludes Tim Hortons, Wendy's, Baja Fresh and Cafe Express; Cendant \nCorporation; American Institute of Architects; Federation of American \nHospitals; National Funeral Directors Association; HR Policy \nAssociation; Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association; and the \nSociety of American Florists.\n  Mr. President, that is an impressive list of supporters.\n  And I believe that the main reason that we have such an impressive \nlist is due to the leadership of the Chairman Mike Enzi.\n  He and his staff did something that the Senate has not been able to \ndo for\n\n[[Page S4173]]\n\nover a decade report small business health legislation out of the \nSenate HELP Committee.\n  For months, Chairman Enzi spearheaded meetings with the major \nstakeholders of this legislation the insurance companies, the small \nbusiness groups, and the insurance commissioners. These meetings \nproduced the bill that we are considering today.\n  Again, my colleagues may ask themselves, is this bill really needed? \nWill it truly make a difference?\n  Just last week a 42-year-old woman from Provo, Utah called my office. \nBoth she and her 9-year-old daughter are diabetics. And she had heard \nfrom the American Diabetes Association that S. 1955 would hurt their \nhealth coverage.\n  But as my staff explained the bill's important role in allowing small \nbusinesses to provide insurance for their employees, including \ndiabetics, she became very emotional. She recalled how, several years \nago, she had her own small business. And buying health care for her \nemployees was forcing her toward bankruptcy. So my constituent had to \ntake away their health insurance. This was extremely difficult for her \nbecause she herself had a chronic illness and fully understood the \nimplications. She ended up with an individual health insurance policy. \nAnd she found that for the same insurance coverage that she had had in \nher group insurance policy, she had to pay nearly twice as much.\n  This happened for two reasons. First, as an individual, she was not \neligible for the tax benefit that supports the cost of insurance paid \nthrough employers. And, second--because she had diabetes, a chronic \nillness, her insurance rating caused her to pay significantly more than \nsomeone without that disease. There was no risk pool for her to join.\n  Passage of S. 1955 could have prevented these problems.\n  I urge my colleagues to think about the health care needs of small \nbusiness employees in their states before voting on this legislation. \nThis legislation will improve their health care options. Today, they \nrarely have options when it comes to health insurance and when they do, \nit is extremely expensive.\n  Let me conclude by sharing the sentiments of Chris Kyler, the CEO of \nthe Utah Association of Realtors.\n\n       Small business owners in Utah are facing a growing crisis \n     with health care availability and affordability. Our \n     profession represents 17% of Utah's gross state product and \n     yet we're arguably the most uninsured working segment in our \n     state simply because we're small business people. As \n     productive contributors to the economy, as a younger, \n     healthier populous, we're supportive of S. 1955 because it \n     will provide us with the opportunity to purchase affordable \n     health insurance.\n\n  I believe that Mr. Kyler's sentiments sum up why the Senate needs to \npass this legislation as soon as possible. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation so that employees of small business will have \naccess to affordable health care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time to the \nSenator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, how much time will that be?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 9 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Enzi for yielding the time \nas well as for his leadership in bringing this legislation to the \nfloor, legislation that is so critical and vital to the future well-\nbeing of small businesses, I know in my State and across America.\n  As chair of the Small Business Committee, I know firsthand that this \ncrisis is real. It is an undue burden on entrepreneurs throughout this \ncountry, and it certainly didn't develop overnight. Now we have a \nsolution at hand, if we are all willing to forge the consensus \nnecessary to make it happen.\n  This issue is all the more critical when you consider the fact that \ntoday nearly 46 million Americans are uninsured. That is an increase of \nover 4 million people since 2001. According to the Employee Benefit \nResearch Institute, of the working uninsured, who make up 83 percent of \nour Nation's uninsured population, 60.6 percent either work for small \nbusiness with fewer than 100 employees or are self-employed.\n  There should be no doubt or question that the time has long since \ncome to pass this legislation that will at once assist our small \nbusinesses in accessing affordable health insurance for their employees \nand their families while assuring more of those employees can actually \nhave health insurance.\n  For this past decade, health insurance premiums have exploded at \ndouble-digit percentage levels and far outpaced inflation and wage \ngains, and Congress has failed to act. Study after study has confirmed \nbeyond a doubt that fewer and fewer small businesses are able to offer \nhealth insurance to their employees. Little has been done to alleviate \nthe problem. Quite simply, it has been an abrogation of responsibility.\n  As chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I have held hearings on this question. Small business \nowners in Maine and across America have consistently and repeatedly \nbegged Congress for relief. They need competition in the market. They \nneed to be able to offer this to their own employees and their \nfamilies.\n  That is why I originally introduced the Small Business Health \nFairness Act which would have allowed the creation of association \nhealth plans to offer uniform health plans across the country, allowing \nsmall businesses to leverage their purchasing power on a national \nbasis. This week, for the first time, thanks to the leadership of \nChairman Enzi in bringing this legislation to the floor from his \ncommittee, the full Senate will be trying to resolve many of the \nissues, many of the differences of positions and perspectives everybody \nhas on this question.\n  I thank the majority leader for making this legislation the key \ncomponent of Health Week in the Senate.\n  I also thank my friends on both sides of the political aisle, Senator \nByrd, who has cosponsored my initiative originally, Senator Talent, who \ninitiated this effort when he was chair of the Small Business Committee \nin the House, and the same is true for my predecessor, Senator Bond, \nwhen he was chair of the Small Business Committee, for helping to move \nthis issue to the pivotal point where we are today.\n  I also thank Senator Kerry as ranking member of the Small Business \nCommittee because we also modified my original bill, worked on another \nconsensus bill that would have been a modification based on regional \nassociation health plans. I thank him for his effort. Again, that was \nanother attempt to bridge these efforts across the aisle.\n  But I most especially recognize Senator Enzi's work and his \ncommitment in moving this bill, holding the hearings, trying to \nreconcile the differences.\n  This week is not about engaging in heated partisan debate to create \nissues for the upcoming election. What this should be all about is \nproviding solutions to small businesses and America's uninsured for the \nmuch needed relief they certainly deserve.\n  We are trying to do everything we can to resolve some of the issues. \nI know there are some concerns, as there were with my initial \nlegislation and as there is with Chairman Enzi's bill now before the \nSenate. A couple of those issues are, of course, preemption of mandated \nbenefits. I hope to be able to address that question with an amendment \nso, hopefully, we can reconcile some of the differences across party \nlines, across philosophical perspectives, so we can get the job done.\n  There are some concerns about the changes in community ratings. I \nknow that is a particular issue for my State as well. I understand the \nchairman will address that issue in his managers' amendment.\n  What we are all here about today is what can we do to address the \nunderlying concern that small businesses have across America. This is a \nsummary of their foremost concern--increasing health insurance costs \nfor themselves and for their employees and their families to the point, \nas I think we all recognize, small businesses are unable to offer this \ncrucial benefit at a time when they need to be competitive with larger \ncompanies because they cannot afford, they simply cannot afford to \nprovide health insurance.\n  If they can afford it, it is catastrophic coverage, it is a $5,000 or \n$10,000 or $15,000 deductible at best that\n\n[[Page S4174]]\n\nthey are able to offer. That is why I introduced the initial \nassociation health plans, to give fairness to the market, especially to \nthe small group markets such as the State of Maine. The State of Maine \nis a small group market and, guess what, there is no competition. No \ncompetition means higher prices. Higher prices means virtually no \nhealth insurance.\n  That is why I offered the association health plan. That is why \nChairman Enzi is doing what he is doing here today, to try to bridge \nthe differences so we can move and advance this process forward because \nit is good for all of America.\n  Small business is the engine that is driving the economy. Two-thirds \nof the job growth occurring in America today is emanating from small \nbusinesses. So it is important to ensure their well-being.\n  By offering the mechanisms that are proposed in Chairman Enzi's \nlegislation, the small business health insurance plan will help with \nuniformity as well. Because 50 States have 50 sets of administrative \nrules, regulations, and mandates, it is virtually impossible to have a \nuniform standard nationwide. This will allow small businesses to be \nbasically on par with Fortune 500 companies and unions. After all, no \none is ever complaining about Fortune 500 companies and unions' plans. \nIn fact, they are the most generous in America. So if they are good for \nFortune 500 companies, if they are good for unions, why can't they be \ngood for small businesses? That is what it is all about.\n  Now people say these associations will not design good plans. If you \nwant to attract members to the plan, if you want people to join your \nplan, obviously you are going to ensure that you design these plans \nwhich will be the most attractive to the greatest number of people who \njoin up in these associations. After all, it is in the interests of \nsmall businesses to have attractive plans for their employees because \nthey have to compete with large employers to get good employees, to get \nskilled employees. If they don't have this crucial and vital benefit, \nthey do not attract the kind of employees they need to make their \nbusiness successful. That is what it is all about.\n  I hope we can reconcile our differences through the amendment \nprocess, with what I hope to offer as amendments and what others will \noffer, that can lead us to our goal of addressing the fundamental \nquestion for small businesses in America that ultimately will help \nmitigate the problem of the uninsured that is ever growing in America \nas well.\n  As we engage in this debate this week, in the end I hope we can come \nto a conclusion with a reasonable compromise that will become law. That \nis what it is all about. I know people have differences of opinion. But \nI don't think there ought to be a difference of opinion in the final \nanalysis when we address all the issues--the ones that Chairman Enzi \naddressed to bridge the gap, the ones that my amendment will do, and \nothers might do--which will ultimately get us to the point of beginning \nto resolve this crisis.\n  The fact remains that we are seeing fewer and fewer small employers \nthat are providing health insurance for their employees.\n  If you look at this chart, only 47 percent of the smallest businesses \nin America--those with three to nine workers--offer health insurance. \nIt is on a declining trend--down to 52 percent, and down to 58 percent \nin 2002--in sharp contrast to the 98 percent of larger businesses with \n200 or more workers that are offering health insurance as a benefit.\n  For small businesses, things are trending in the wrong direction. \nThen you look at the small group marketplaces in States such as Maine, \nwhich is what this essentially is all about. As we learned from the \nGovernment Accountability Office study that Senator Talent and I \nrequested, Blue Cross-Blue Shield is actually consolidating their \nmarket share in a number of States across the country. In fact, 44 \npercent are in group markets.\n  I hope we can begin to reconcile these differences and do what I \nthink this Congress can do for the first time that we have had the \nopportunity to do. Let us not deny small businesses and their employees \nthis one chance to do it. Time has long since passed for action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before she leaves the floor, I want to \nexpress my thanks to the distinguished Senator from Maine for working \nso closely with me on health care issues. I expect that before long \nSenator Snowe and I will be offering our bipartisan amendment to lift \nthe restriction on Medicare that bars Medicare from bargaining to hold \ndown health care costs. Senator Snowe and I have worked on this for \nover 3 years. We recently got 54 votes in the Senate to win passage of \nthis bipartisan effort. I thank her for all the good work she is doing \nin the health care field and look forward to when she offers our \nbipartisan amendment before too long and to prosecuting this cause on \nbehalf of senior citizens and taxpayers alike.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, no other health policy in America is \nmore objectionable to the people of this country than preventing \nMedicare from bargaining to hold down health care costs.\n  This restriction that bars Medicare from bargaining to hold down \nhealth costs simply defies common sense. The restriction that bars \nMedicare from bargaining to hold down health costs is contrary to what \ngoes on in the private sector of this country every single day. It \ncertainly is contrary to the needs of this program and the taxpayers of \nthis country when we see the Federal budget deficit exploding every \ntime we turn around.\n  It seems to me that to have Medicare actually barred from bargaining \nto hold down prescription costs simply defies the sensible approaches \nthat we have always taken in holding down health costs. That approach \nis to use your bargaining power and the capacity to argue on behalf of \nlarge numbers of people. That is using marketplace forces to really \nmake a difference.\n  The way Medicare is buying prescription drugs under this program is \nlike somebody going to Costco and buying toilet paper one roll at a \ntime. Nobody would ever go shopping that way. Certainly when steel \ncompanies, auto companies, any major manufacturing concerns first sit \ndown with a vendor, they ask: What kind of deal will you give me on the \nbasis of the large volume of this product that I am going to be \npurchasing? Not Medicare. Medicare won't do what everyone else does all \nacross this country every single day.\n  It is especially important that Medicare use this bargaining power, \ngiven what the American Association of Retired Persons has found \nrecently in a report they released to us on the cost of prescription \ndrugs. The AARP released a report in February of 2006 that found brand \nname medications most commonly used by older people rose almost twice \nthe rate of inflation in other areas of health care.\n  So here is a chance to actually save money for senior citizens and \ntaxpayers. We can especially expect to see savings when you have \nsingle-source drugs for which there is absolutely no competition. There \nare concrete cases where the Federal Government says we are not going \nto allow price controls, we are not going to allow the establishment of \na one-size-fits-all formulary, but we are going to say that the \nGovernment is going to be able to bargain, and that approach will make \na real difference.\n\n  I know some colleagues think any effort by the Government to allow \nbargaining to hold down the cost of medicine will lead to price \ncontrols. The amendment which Senator Snowe and I expect to file before \nlong is very clear. It does not permit price setting or the creation of \na formulary. All it says is the Federal Government, and in effect the \nseniors of this country, would be able to go into the market and use \ntheir clout just like any other big purchaser could to hold down the \ncost of medicine using marketplace forces.\n  As colleagues consider this particular approach I hope--I know the \ndistinguished President of the Senate has a great interest in \npharmaceuticals and prescription drugs--that colleagues will look at \nwhat Senator Snowe and I advocate. In that amendment, on page 3, lines \n2 through 8 make it clear that we are opposed to price controls. We \nhave continually tried to address this. We are not in favor of price \ncontrols. We are not in favor of establishing a one-size-fits-all \nformulary or instituting a uniform price structure of any kind. All we \nare saying is that the Federal Government ought to have a\n\n[[Page S4175]]\n\nchance to do some hard-nosed bargaining the way everybody else does to \nhold down the cost of prescription drugs.\n  Secretary Tommy Thompson, former Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, said that the one power he wanted as he left office and was \ndenied by the Congress was the opportunity to negotiate when necessary \nto hold down the cost of prescription drugs.\n  This amendment would ensure that the prescription drug benefit is \nsustainable without interfering with marketplace forces and would \nsimply say that the Federal Government could leverage the marketplace \njust as any other big buyer of a product does.\n  To date, millions of seniors have enrolled in this program and, of \ncourse, they are realizing some savings on their prescription drugs. We \nare glad to see that, but it has come about primarily through the \ninfusion of taxpayer money.\n  What I and Senator Snowe would like to do is bring about some \nsavings--not just by pouring more and more taxpayer money into this \nprogram but by using marketplace forces to protect the interests of \nseniors and our taxpayers.\n  Prohibiting Medicare from negotiating for drug prices was an \noverreach. I know of no other industry in the United States that has \npower like this. We don't see any other industry that does business \nwith the Federal Government in which discussions and negotiations with \nthe Federal Government is specifically barred. Everybody else has to \nsit down across the table from the Government representing the \ninterests of our taxpayers and get into the nuts and bolts of \nnegotiating the best deal for a particular group of Americans. We need \nto end this special treatment, this favoritism, this unwarranted \npreference that only the prescription drug industry has and give our \nGovernment the bargaining power that is needed so that seniors and \ntaxpayers can be protected through marketplace forces.\n  Some who are opposed to what Senator Snowe and I want to do have said \nthat we are already seeing some negotiations. Of course, that is true. \nHaving voted for this program and wanting to see it work--I have welts \non my back to show for that--I am pleased that we are seeing some \ndiscussion among health plans and others. But I think we will see a \nwhole lot more opportunity to contain costs and contain them through \nmarketplace forces if we untie the hands of the Secretary, as the \nprevious Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy Thompson, sought \nto do. I believe we ought to take every possible step to save every \npossible nickel to protect seniors and taxpayers, and lifting this \nabsurd restriction on Medicare bargaining power will do just that.\n  I cannot for the life of me conceive of a rational reason Medicare \nshould not have the same power to negotiate just the way other smart \nshoppers do across this country. Every smart shopper in the private \nsector--every single one--wants the kind of opportunity that I and \nSenator Snowe are advocating.\n  I don't know of any private entity, whether it is a timber company in \nmy home State or a big auto company or anybody else who doesn't sit \ndown across the bargaining table and ask, what are we going to do to \nwork something out that reflects the fact that I am going to be buying \na lot of something? Why shouldn't Medicare, if it believes it is \nwarranted, have that authority in effect as a standby?\n  Senator Snowe and I have been crystal clear in saying that there is a \ndifference between negotiating and bargaining and price controls and \nuniform formularies. We would say to our colleagues: Look at our \nproposal just as we did in the one that received 54 votes recently. We \nspell it out. We lay it out on page 3 of our amendment, lines 2 through \n8. We stipulate no price controls, no uniform formulary, no particular \nkind of one-size-fits-all price structure in any way.\n  I would like to, along with Senator Snowe, offer a market-based, \ncomprehensive cost containment to help hold down the cost of \nprescription drugs in our country.\n  I am glad we are discussing Medicare this week. I think it is high \ntime. I tell colleagues that no other health policy in America is more \nobjectionable than the one that prevents Medicare from bargaining to \nhold down health care costs. It is time to inject some common sense \ninto the Medicare drug benefit. Giving Medicare bargaining power to \nmillions of senior citizens through Medicare is economics 101. If it is \nimportant to the seniors of this country, it is important to taxpayers.\n  We expect to bring a bipartisan proposal to the floor of the Senate \nthis week. We all know we could sure use some bipartisanship around \nhere at this critical time. I hope colleagues will, as they did a few \nweeks ago, show strong bipartisan support for our proposal. If we are \nserious about reining in health costs, and the American people say it \nis at the top of their agenda, you have to lift this restriction that \nbars Medicare from bargaining. We expect to be filing the bipartisan \nSnowe-Wyden amendment before long.\n\n  We hope, as we did on the last occasion when we voted on this, we \nwill have a strong majority in the Senate in support of a commonsense, \npractical way to protect senior citizens who are buying prescription \ndrugs and are taxpayers at the same time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oregon for his \nincredible leadership on something that makes so much sense, \nnegotiating group prices under Medicare.\n  Why in the world wouldn't we want to get the best price? Taxpayers \nwant us to get the best price. Seniors want us to get the best price. \nThe disabled want us to get the best price. Why in the world wouldn't \nwe want to do everything possible to have a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit that offers the very best prices so we can offer as much \ncoverage as possible? One of the things we know, the gap in coverage is \npartly because we are paying so much for the whole plan. We could give \npeople more coverage and spread it out differently if we were, in fact, \nnegotiating group prices.\n  I thank my colleague who has come to the Senate floor on so many \noccasions. He always makes so much sense. I know the people in Oregon \nare proud of what he has done.\n  To add to the discussion on Medicare, I am pleased we have Health \nWeek. Even though I will speak at some later time in terms of the \nconcerns I have about the underlying bill, we all chose to vote to \nproceed to debate on health care because there is nothing more \nimportant to the people we represent, whether it is the manufacturers I \nrepresent who are having to compete in a global economy and figure how \nto do that while paying so much of the cost of health care or whether \nit is small businesses, self-employed people who cannot find coverage \nat affordable prices, whether it is our seniors or whether it is women \nand children who need care.\n  We have a serious issue when we spend twice as much on health care in \nthis country than any other country and still have 46 million people \nwith no insurance, 80 percent of them working.\n  This is an important debate. Part of that debate, I believe because \nof the timing, needs to be to address what is happening with Medicare \nprescription drug coverage. Unfortunately, we are 6 days away from a \nMedicare prescription drug deadline. Right now, 6 days from now, folks \nare going to be penalized if they have not signed up for a Medicare \nprescription drug plan, even though they are having to wade through a \nlot of information and misinformation in order to be able to figure out \nwhat to do, if anything.\n  I am sure my colleagues have received as many calls as I have \nreceived, thousands of calls and letters from people all across \nMichigan about the trouble they are having related to this Medicare \nprescription drug program--calls from pharmacists trying to help people \nfigure what to do, spending hours on the phone, being put on hold, \nunfortunately, receiving inaccurate information too much of the time. \nWe know there are serious issues that have come about because the \nGovernment has not gotten its act together, as we should, to be able to \npresent them to people in a way they can understand and make sure it \nworks for seniors and disabled.\n  We know choosing a plan is extremely challenging and confusing. We \nhave an obligation on our end to do something about that, not wait 6 \ndays and penalize people because they have not signed up for a plan \nthat they may not be able to figure out.\n\n[[Page S4176]]\n\n  This is not because people are not bright. In Michigan alone there \nare at least 79 different plans to choose from. Each plan has a \ndifferent premium, a different copay, covers different medicines. Under \nthe current law, as I indicated before, anyone who does not go through \nthese 79 plans, or whatever number they have in their State, by next \nMonday will find themselves paying a lifetime penalty, more for \nprescription drugs than they would if they signed up before then.\n  A decision about something that is so fundamental to a person's \nhealth as their medicine should not be rushed. We should not be scaring \nseniors into picking a plan that may not work for them because of a \npenalty they will receive after next Monday. Unfortunately, that is \nexactly what is happening.\n  Unfortunately, I continue to believe the ``D'' in Medicare Part D \nstands for disaster. That does not mean some people are not getting \nhelped. We want people to be helped. We want people who have not \notherwise had help to be able to receive it. That is a very important \npoint in this process because the administration has been talking about \nthe 29.7 million seniors who are now covered, seniors and disabled who \nnow have drug coverage under Part D.\n  But what they are not saying, of the 29 million, 20 million already \nhad coverage. They were covered under Medicaid, they were covered under \nprivate insurance, under a Medicare HMO. We are talking about less than \n30 percent of those who have not had any help with their medicine, less \nthan 30 percent, have actually signed up so far.\n  Is it because they do not want help? Of course not. It is because \nthey are having challenges getting through the bureaucracy and trying \nto figure out what works for them and what does not work for them?\n  I will share a story of a woman who called me yesterday. This \nexemplifies the thousands of calls and stories I receive in Michigan. A \nmember of my staff spoke with Shirley Campbell from Midland, MI, \nyesterday, not far from my hometown. Shirley told my staff about the \nexperience she and her sister had enrolling in Part D. First, they had \na terrible time getting through to the so-called ``help'' line.\n  By the way, the Government Accountability Office says almost 60 \npercent of the time folks trying to get through to the 1-800 Medicare \nnumber are getting incomplete or inaccurate information. That is \nstunning. We have to get our act together before we penalize people for \nnot signing up for a program.\n  She kept trying. Shirley kept trying. Once she got through, in \nresponse to her question, she was told, ``I can't answer that question \nbecause the site is down.'' She did not give up. She called back the \nnext week and she called back the following week. Each time she had the \nsame experience. She could not get an answer to her question because \n``the site is down.'' This is the administration's idea of a ``help'' \nline? It is not much help.\n  Because Shirley could not get the information she needed from the \nadministration, she called several plans and asked them all to send her \ntheir information. Imagine how big that mailbox was. Then she and her \nsister sat down and spent more than 10 hours sifting through all the \ninformation they had received. They narrowed it down to six plans and \nbegan a thorough analysis.\n  What did they find? From the six plans, all of the plans would cost \nShirley more than she is currently paying for the medications necessary \nfor her rheumatoid arthritis. Six plans she narrowed it down to, and \nall of them would cost her more than what she is currently paying. \nShirley currently does not have any coverage. Yet she would end up \npaying more under any of the six plans she studied.\n  Think of that. We are trying to help people who do not have coverage, \nand less than 30 percent of the folks who have signed up have been \npeople who did not have help before. Maybe it is because they were like \nShirley, when they tried to find someone to help them, they found out \nthey would be paying even more under this privatized scheme that has \nbeen set up than they are currently paying.\n  She also told my staff that most of the plans would have cost her \ntwice as much as she is now paying. But she ended up choosing a plan \nthat would cost her more than what she is currently paying, even though \nshe currently does not have any coverage. She says she signed up \nbecause she was worried about the looming May 15 enrollment deadline \nand the prospect of paying a penalty for the rest of her life.\n  What sense does this make? Folks are seeing the clock count, 6 days \naway, until the May 15 deadline and penalty. And Shirley is so worried \nabout what that means down the road, the cost she would be paying and a \nlifetime penalty, she signs up for a plan that costs her more than she \nis currently paying. I don't believe Shirley or any senior should be \nrushed into a premature decision because of an arbitrarily determined \ndeadline. That is all this is. There is nothing magical about May 15, \nnothing at all.\n  Shirley worked in middle management all her life. She had the ability \nto spend hours and hours wading through the plan, the brochures, the \npaperwork. In the end, she had to make a decision that leaves her worse \noff than she is today.\n  Shirley wrapped up her experience of choosing a Part D plan by \nsaying, ``I never in a million years would have done anything like this \nto my staff.''\n  She then asked my health legislative assistant to deliver the message \nto me that the Medicare Part D Program needs to be fixed. Amen. I could \nnot agree more with Shirley.\n  This is Health Week. This is the time to fix it. The first thing we \nneed to do to fix it is to give folks more time.\n  I am proud to be joining Senator Bill Nelson on legislation to extend \nthe deadline to the end of the year. If given the opportunity, and I \nhope we will have the opportunity, we intend to offer that as an \namendment, as we proceed with Health Week. People should not be \npenalized because the Government cannot get its act together. People \nshould not be penalized when almost 60 percent of the time when they \ncall a hotline they cannot get the information they need, it is \ninaccurate or incomplete. That is not their fault.\n  The whole point of this was to make sure we were helping people who \nwere choosing between food and medicine, people who were choosing \nbetween medicine and paying the rent, the electric bill or gas prices \nright now. If that is not happening, why are we moving full steam ahead \nwith some arbitrary deadline? Six days from now, folks are going to be \npenalized because the Government has been slow to get its act together, \nand they will be permanently penalized by paying more.\n  Less than 30 percent of the people who do not currently get help \npaying for their medicines have actually signed up. That should say \nsomething. It should either say, it is not a good deal, and they found \nout they would be paying more, and they said forget it or it says to us \nthat maybe we need to go back to the drawing board and make sure the \nright information, in the right way, is given out to people so they can \nmake the best decision for themselves.\n  I am also extremely concerned that in my home State of Michigan only \n22 percent of the 256,000 seniors eligible for low-income help, only 22 \npercent of those whom we said we wanted to help the most by waiving the \npremium and the copay, only 22 percent have signed up to get that extra \nhelp.\n  Unfortunately, our low-income seniors are caught twice because they \nhave to pick a plan. They have to, similar to Shirley, wade through all \nkinds of plans. Then they have to sign up separately to be able to get \nlow-income help.\n  I am pleased the administration has said they will allow low-income \nseniors to be able to sign up after May 15. I appreciate that. That is \na good start. Unfortunately, the penalty is not waived. Our lowest \nincome seniors, even though they may be able to sign up in June, July, \nand August--and that is a good thing and I appreciate the \nadministration doing that--I urge them to waive that penalty. It makes \nno sense if you allow people to sign up for extra help and then take it \naway through a penalty for signing up late.\n  The final issue is our poorest seniors, our lowest income seniors in \nMichigan and individuals making less than $14,700 a year, our lowest \nincome seniors or the disabled, in too many instances are actually \npaying more under this plan than they were before. Why? Because they \nwere on Medicaid before for the low-income health care. In Michigan, \nthat meant paying a $1\n\n[[Page S4177]]\n\ncopay for a prescription, and that has doubled, tripled or gone higher. \nThis also makes no sense.\n  On top of that, those who were in Medicaid, our lowest income \nseniors, many in nursing homes, were automatically enrolled sometime in \nthe last few months, into a plan, regardless of whether it covered the \nmedicines. We have said to the lowest income seniors, many of them in \nnursing homes, you are signed up for a plan, and you have to go figure \nout whether it even helps you and how you are going to get out of it if \nit doesn't help you. And, by the way, you are going to pay more.\n\n  We can do better than this. I believe No. 1 is to stop the 6-day \ncount. No. 1, we have to give folks more time to wade through all of \nthis, to figure out what is going on, and we have to give some more \ntime to the Government to get its act together. The administration is \ndoing a disservice to people by the way this has been handled. Giving \nmore time will allow that to happen.\n  I am also very hopeful we are going to come back and come together \nand give people the one choice they really want. People do not want 70 \nplans. They are not saying: Oh, please, give me a whole bunch of \ninsurance papers to wade through. Give me increased premiums. Give me \nall kinds of deadlines to deal with. What they said was: I need help \nwith my medicine.\n  We are blessed in this country to have more medicine available as a \npart of the way we allow ourselves to live healthier lives, longer \nlives, to be able to treat cancers, to be able to treat other chronic \nillnesses. Medicines are available now. But they are not available if \nthey are not affordable. We can do better.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful at some point we are going to come back \nto this floor and give people the choice they want: A real Medicare \nbenefit through Medicare, with a reasonable copay and premium, where \nyou sign up and you can go to your local pharmacy, and Medicare \nnegotiates good prices. That is what we ought to be doing.\n  In the meantime, let's stop the countdown to May 15.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/09/senate-section/article/S4177-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is \nnot enough time in the debate to say it all at one time.\n  Last night, this body had the opportunity to vote on proceeding to \nchanges to the liability crisis that exists in health care today, but \nthe minority denied us the ability to move forward. They denied the \nability of the American people to hear an honest debate, to consider \nthoughtful amendments, and then to judge up or down on the content of \nthe legislation.\n  They had two opportunities: liability that was reform for all medical \nprofessionals; and, then, liability that was only changed for those who \nare OB/GYNs--that next generation of medical professionals who are \ngoing to deliver our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren, that \nprofession that is going to regenerate the population of this country \nand, in fact, is suffering today because of the high rate of liability \ncosts for the premiums they have to have.\n  Now we are here. We are in debate--30 hours of debate--to see if we \ncan proceed on a bill to bring small business group health insurance \nreforms into law, to enable small businesses in America to be able to \nprice insurance for their employees in the same way large corporations \nare able to produce products for their employees.\n  Today, small businesses' choice is between nothing and nothing. It is \nnot something and something. It is nothing and nothing. And what will \nwe do? We will debate, for 30 hours, whether we should proceed. Some \ndon't believe this is important enough or, if it is important enough, \nthat there ought to be all sorts of changes to it that are unrelated to \nthese millions of Americans for whom their employer cannot afford to \nprovide health care. Why? Because they are not big. The marketplace \ndiscriminates because they are small.\n  Let me give you some statistics about North Carolina. In North \nCarolina, 98 percent of firms with employees are small businesses. \nNinety-eight percent of my employers are shut out of the ability to \nnegotiate a reasonable cost of health care for their employees. Because \nof that, their employees have a choice between nothing and nothing.\n  We will have 30 hours of debate to see if we are going to proceed in \nthis body to provide something versus nothing--not something and \nsomething. How can anybody object to providing a choice of something \nfor those who do not have an option today?\n  Additionally, in North Carolina, we have 1.3 million uninsured \nindividuals. And 898,000--almost 900,000--North Carolinians are \nuninsured individuals in families or on their own with one full-time \nworker. Those are all individuals who potentially could be covered \nunder an individual or a family plan.\n  Of the 1.3 million who are uninsured in North Carolina, 900,000 could \nbe affected with this one piece of legislation in the Senate. But for \nthe next 30 hours, we will debate whether we proceed or never get to \nthe process of an up-or-down vote; in other words, it is a choice as to \nwhether we keep them with nothing and nothing and the uninsured numbers \nstay at 1.3 million or, in fact, we are going to provide something for \nNorth Carolina--900,000 people who today have nothing provided for \nthem.\n  Later today, I am going to come to this floor, and I am going to read \nfor my colleagues real letters, handwritten letters--handwritten \nletters--from people who live in North Carolina, whose choice is \nnothing and nothing. These are individuals who have the same health \nneeds, individuals who would like to have health insurance but whose \nemployers cannot afford it today, who want the opportunity in employer-\nbased health care, but because of the way the system is designed today, \nit is not achievable because it is not affordable for them.\n  We are here today and tomorrow, and we ought to be here as long as it \ntakes to make sure Americans at all levels have choices between \nsomething and something. These 30 hours will determine, in fact, \nwhether this historic institution will provide that for the American \npeople or we will walk away; whereby, once again, the American people \nwill be denied because some in this body do not believe there is a \nresponsibility to move to a point where there is an up-or-down vote. \nTruly, people can look and say: You have my future in your hands. My \nhealth security is in the hands of the Senate, the Members of the \nSenate, and whether they are going to, in fact, respond to that.\n  Well, I think people in North Carolina desperately want choice. I \nthink they desperately want this bill. They want their employers to \nhave the opportunity to be able to look at health insurance and to find \nit affordable. Why? Because that is their security. That is their \nability to have coverage.\n  My hope today is that the outcome of this legislation will not be a \nquick death such as last night with medical liability reform. We all \nagree health care is too expensive. We disagree on what the solutions \nare. But to end up with nothing, to deny the ability to move forward, \nto deny the ability for the American people's voice to be heard through \nthe amendment process on this floor is disgraceful.\n  My hope is after these 30 hours we will proceed, we will have a \nrobust debate on the amendments, and, at the end of the day, the \nAmerican people will have an opportunity for an up-or-down vote in the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today we are here in the middle of what \nis being called Health Week in the Senate. But rather than debating \nimportant lifesaving, life-enhancing\n\n[[Page S4178]]\n\nlegislation that has bipartisan support and could actually deliver hope \nand promise to millions of Americans, the Republican leadership in the \nSenate has, instead, decided to continue their political posturing, \nbusiness-as-usual approach to governing.\n  It is no wonder the American people have become disillusioned with \nthe leadership in Washington. Instead of debating and passing stem cell \nlegislation that will end suffering and extend lives, we are again \nfocusing on a partisan proposal to limit patient options, even when \nthey are harmed, for example, through medical malpractice.\n  Instead of passing stem cell legislation that will provide new \ntreatments and cures for debilitating diseases, such as Alzheimer's, \njuvenile diabetes, spinal cord injuries or cancer, we are debating a \nbill that would actually eliminate--eliminate--the health coverage that \nmany States currently provide to cover some of these very diseases, \nthat will cherry-pick, pitting the healthy versus older workers or \nthose who have some chronic disease or illness. And where there is no \ninsurance regulation, prices go up, insurance companies pick the \nhealthy, and they discriminate against older workers and those who are \nless healthy.\n  And they can deny coverage that States have thought important to have \nto meet the challenges of their individual States, sometimes very \nuniquely so.\n  So instead of wasting an entire week debating legislation that I \nbelieve ultimately has no chance of passing, we owe it to the American \npeople--to the millions of Americans and their families suffering from \nlife-altering disabilities and diseases--to demonstrate our Nation's \nfull commitment to finding a cure and doing all we can to help their \nhopes and dreams come true.\n  It has been almost 1 year since the House of Representatives passed \nthe Stem Cell Enhancement Act, and yet the Senate still has not passed \nthis vital legislation. I rise to urge the majority leader to do the \nsame and bring this important legislation to a vote in the Senate.\n  I was fortunate to have had the opportunity to vote in favor of the \nbill as a Member of the House, where we had broad bipartisan support \nfor the proposal. I believe that same bipartisan support exists in the \nSenate, which makes it even more difficult to understand why we cannot \ncome together and do something meaningful for those who are suffering.\n  My support of stem cell research is partially a reflection of my home \nState's commitment to innovation and discovery. In 2004, New Jersey \nbecame the second State in the Nation to enact a law that specifically \npermits embryonic stem cell research. We know that embryonic stem cells \nhave the unique ability to develop into virtually every cell and tissue \nin the body. And we know that numerous frozen embryos in fertility \nclinics remain unused by couples at the completion of their fertility \ntreatments. Why shouldn't they be allowed to donate those embryos to \nFederal research to save lives? We allow people to donate organs to \nsave lives. Why couldn't a couple, if they so chose, donate their \nfrozen embryos instead of simply discarding them?\n  The great State of New Jersey offers more scientists, engineers, and \ntechnicians per capita than any other State, and I am proud to \nrepresent the innovation and research taking place in New Jersey. Our \nState is not only known as the Garden State but also as America's \n``Medicine Chest.'' But for our State and our country to continue to \ncompete globally with health care breakthroughs, it is going to take \nmore than private and State support. It is going to take the support of \nour Nation. It is going to take leadership that looks beyond politics.\n  But, to me, similar to countless Americans and New Jerseyans, this \nissue is about more than our ability to compete as a nation. The \npromise of stem cell research is painfully personal. It means hope and \npromise--hope that people such as my mother who suffer from advanced \nAlzheimer's disease might one day be cured from the loneliness and \nconfusion caused by this horrible disease and the promise that future \ngenerations of families will not have to see their loved ones enter \ninto a world of dementia that robs them of the best years of their \nlives.\n  We hold the key to unlock that door. It is shameful that we have let \npartisan politics stand in the way of medical progress. We owe it to \nour parents, to our children, and our grandchildren to unlock that \ndoor.\n  Diabetes, Alzheimer's, cancer, Parkinson's--none of these diseases \nboast a party affiliation. And we cannot let ours keep us from doing \nwhat is right.\n  Today we have an opportunity to do what is right. But it is clear to \nme that the majority will again let that opportunity pass them by. I \nwill continue to fight, along with many of my colleagues, to see that \nthis bipartisan bill is debated on the Senate floor and becomes law. We \ncan no longer afford to delay this bill when it holds the key to curing \nsome of the most devastating and debilitating diseases of our day. As \nthe bill waits in the wings of the Capitol, children and adults alike \nwait for the cure they have been praying for.\n  This is Health Week. What could better demonstrate our commitment to \nthe health of this country than full Federal support for embryonic stem \ncell research? This bill has the potential to make a profound and \npositive impact on the health of millions of Americans. All we need is \nthe leadership to bring the bill to the floor for a vote for the \nhumanity of our Nation and for the mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, \nsons, and daughters across this country who are suffering or watching a \nloved one suffer.\n\n  This bill means so much more than ending restrictions placed on stem \ncell research. This bill means hope and promise to countless Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, like many of my colleagues, I rise today \nin support of S. 1955, the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization \nAct. As a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, I am proud to have worked on this legislation and to lend my \nsupport as a cosponsor.\n  First and foremost, I thank Chairman Enzi and Senator Ben Nelson, who \nhave worked so hard on this legislation. The chairman and Senator \nNelson did what many thought was impossible: they got the health \ninsurers, State insurance commissioners, and the small business \ncommunity to sit down together and work to find a compromise for small \nbusinesses. After over 10 years of deadlock, the Senate is finally \nconsidering a solution that will provide real relief to small \nbusinesses. This is truly a milestone. It has been said before, I am \nsure many times, that the House has passed this eight times, and we \nhave yet to find a solution. Now is the time.\n  Like many rural States, the Kansas economy is built on thousands of \nsmall businesses. Whether it is the farm implement store or the local \npharmacy, the beauty salon or the downtown coffee shop, these small \nbusinesses and their employees are the backbone of our communities. \nThey are what we are all about. But one nagging problem for virtually \nevery small business owner is the high cost of providing health \ninsurance. Most small businesses can't even afford to offer health \ninsurance to their employees, forcing many to go without health \ncoverage.\n  In Kansas, only about 41 percent--not even 50 percent, not even \nhalf--of our small businesses offer any health insurance coverage. This \nis in stark contrast to the 97 percent of our larger businesses that \noffer health insurance to their employees. Without such health \ninsurance coverage, employees are vulnerable to huge health care debts \nof their own, and it is harder for small employers to attract a good \nworker. I have literally heard from hundreds of Kansas small business \nowners and entrepreneurs, local Chamber of Commerce members over the \nyears who say they are forced to choose between staying in business or \nproviding the health care they deserve to their hard-working employees.\n  Take for example Kimberly Smith of Andover, KS. Kimberly has three \nchildren, including a 3-year-old with a mild heart condition. She is \nself-employed. She is a realtor. She is a good realtor. Like many, she \ndoes not have access to affordable health insurance. Because of this, \nKimberly and her family have been forced to go without health insurance \ncoverage, and now she must pay all of her medical costs out of her \npocket.\n\n[[Page S4179]]\n\n  Denise Breason from Lawrence, KS, is also facing the same crunch to \nfind affordable health care. Even though Denise is a hard-working small \nbusiness employee, she has been without health insurance for over a \nyear and a half and had to stop taking all of her medications because \nshe could no longer afford them without health insurance.\n  Denise Hulse and her husband went without health insurance for their \nfamily for years. They prayed their children would remain healthy so \nthey would not have to make a visit to the doctor or the emergency \nroom. In the end, her husband was forced to let his small business go \nand take a low-paying job, just because it came with health insurance. \nTo quote Denise:\n\n       It is sometimes very hard just making it in the small \n     business community, and very few small business owners are \n     rich enough to be able to afford the high costs of health \n     insurance for their families.\n\n  Another small business owner in Kansas told me he is paying over \n$2,000 a month each month in premiums alone for health insurance for \nhis family. This is more than his house payment, more than his utility \nbills and grocery expenses, all combined.\n  These stories go on and on, not limited to my home State of Kansas. I \nheard these stories when I had the privilege of serving in the House of \nRepresentatives. Eight times we approached this issue. Eight times we \npassed a bill. Now it is our turn in the Senate, and it is long \noverdue. I hear these stories from small business owners and employees \nacross the country. Small businesses all share one main concern: \nfinding affordable health care insurance.\n  This is why I am asking my colleagues today to support and pass the \nHealth Insurance Marketplace Modernization Act. The real question is, \nDo we take it up? Do we vote for cloture? Or do we let the House pass \nthe bill the ninth time while we sit in the Senate and do nothing for \nthose who cannot afford health insurance? I cannot imagine us doing \nthat at this particular time.\n  This legislation allows small businesses to pool together through an \nassociation and offer health insurance. Everything has to have an \nacronym in Washington. This one does, too. It is SBHP. I won't venture \ninto what that acronym will be called, but it stands for small business \nhealth care plan. It is going to give small businesses an affordable \nchoice for health care.\n  The legislation is built on the fact that small businesses, unlike \nlarge companies such as Microsoft or others, or unions, do not have the \npower to negotiate affordable prices for health care.\n  The concept of small business pooling together is not new. I \nsupported legislation when I served in the House. In fact, the \nassociation health plan legislation has passed the House numerous times \nover the years without any action in the Senate. Now we finally have a \nsolution that will provide meaningful relief to small businesses across \nKansas and the country. We all know small businesses face many \npressures in running the businesses. I believe we must enact \ncommonsense policies to overcome these hurdles. We should allow the \nlocal farm implement dealer to pool together with other dealers in \nKansas and across the Nation to purchase affordable care.\n  Kimberly Smith should no longer have to worry about finding \naffordable health insurance for her children. Denise Breason should not \nhave to stop taking her medications just because she works for a small \nbusiness and cannot afford her care. Denise Hulse and her husband \nshould not have been forced to let go of their small business, their \ndream they loved, just to find affordable health coverage. Instead, we \nneed to find these hard-working folks affordable options that allow \nthem to continue to contribute to our small communities, rural and \nsmalltown America. This is why I support the legislation.\n  As I stand before my colleagues today, I know there have been strong \nconcerns expressed about this and previous association plan proposals. \nHowever, the small business health plans that are created under this \nbill have the necessary protections in place to address these concerns. \nI would like my colleagues who have concerns to please pay attention.\n  The small business health plans will be regulated by the States, not \nthe Federal Government. The small business plans will have to play by \nthe same set of rules as other small group health plans. They must \npurchase their insurance through the regular insurance market. They \ncannot self-insure. Finally, the SBHPs may offer coverage that varies \nfrom State benefit mandates, but they must also offer an alternative \nplan that provides comprehensive coverage. This gives the consumer a \nchoice in choosing a health plan that best fits their needs, and that \nis the key.\n  I have heard concerns from organizations and individuals who fear \nthis bill will take away their coverage for cancer screenings, mental \nhealth benefits, or any other mandates required by State law. However, \nI stress that this is simply not true. Small business, under this bill, \nwill have access to a more comprehensive plan which will cover \nscreenings, mental health services, or numerous other benefits. \nHowever, it is up to the small businesses to decide whether such a \ncomprehensive plan is right for them.\n  The purpose of this language is to give small businesses the option \nof choosing comprehensive benefits but not requiring them to buy such a \nrich package or a package they cannot afford. Simply put, this \nlegislation trusts small businesses to choose a health care plan that \nbest fits their needs and puts these small businesses, not health \ninsurers or the Government, in the driver's seat when choosing their \nhealth care coverage. If a small employer wants to choose a more \naffordable plan for himself, his family, and his employees, he should \nhave that option. Under this legislation, he has that option. However, \nhe should not be forced by law to buy benefits that may be beyond what \nhe can afford or beyond what he and his employees really need.\n  I want to put the problem of mandating coverage in perspective. While \nsmall employers want to provide affordable health insurance for their \nemployees, expensive and burdensome benefit mandates make doing so very \ndifficult. Small firms and self-employed people have almost no leverage \nwith insurance companies. In addition, they have to deal with an \nenormous array of State-level health insurance regulations. I don't \nthink you read them; I think you weigh them. All of the benefit \nmandates, all of these regulations add to the cost and the complexity \nof the coverage.\n  In contrast, however, big businesses generally don't have to deal \nwith burdensome regulations. Federal law lets large companies, such as \nMicrosoft and GM, and unions bypass expensive State benefit mandates to \nprovide affordable comprehensive coverage for their workers. I ask my \ncolleagues, why shouldn't small businesses be able to enjoy these same \nopportunities?\n  Today, there are more than 1,800 State mandates, making it nearly \nimpossible for associations to offer uniform and affordable benefit \npackages on a regional or national basis. Taken together, these benefit \nmandates create a confusing web, an unfunded mandate that prices many \nAmericans out of the health insurance market. The Congressional Budget \nOffice and the Government Accountability Office and others have found \nthat State-imposed benefit mandates raise the cost of health insurance \nanywhere from 5 to 22 percent. In addition, CBO estimates that every 1-\npercent increase in insurance costs results in 200,000 to 300,000 more \nuninsured Americans. In reality, benefit mandates represent an unfunded \nmandate on employers because insurance companies simply pass the cost \nof each mandate along. When the cost goes up, the coverage goes down. \nYou have more uninsured.\n  The legislation we are debating today simply provides an opportunity \nfor a small business health plan to relax these burdensome mandates to \noffer affordable health insurance to small businesses on a regional or \nnational basis, just like the big businesses and unions currently do. \nWe should not be forcing small businesses to choose between staying in \nbusiness or offering health insurance to their employees. Boy, that is \na Hobson's choice. Instead, we need to give them more affordable health \ninsurance choices and be willing to trust them to choose the option \nthat makes the most sense for themselves, their families, their \nemployees, and the future of their businesses.\n\n[[Page S4180]]\n\n  I know this bill is not perfect. Seldom do we or the other body pass \na bill that is perfect. I have long said that we usually achieve the \nbest possible bill, but sometimes must settle for the best bill \npossible.\n  I appreciate the concerns that have been expressed with this \nlegislation. However, I express to my colleagues that I think this bill \nis the best opportunity we have for easing the burden on our small \nbusinesses and allowing them to finally offer affordable health care \ninsurance to their employees. I am proud to support this legislation. I \nurge my colleagues to do the same and vote for cloture. Eight times in \nthe House, zero in the Senate. That should not be a moment of pride for \nthis body. Let us vote for cloture and let us support this bill.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to associate myself with the remarks \nof the Senator from Kansas, and especially with the efforts of the \nSenator from Wyoming who brought this bill to the floor of the Senate. \nThis is a very significant piece of legislation in our efforts to try \nto make sure more Americans have the opportunity to get fair, \naffordable, and good health care insurance. It is a piece of \nlegislation about people. It is directed at people who work in what is \ntermed ``small business.'' That is the person who works as a cook in a \nlocal family restaurant or a person who works as a mechanic in a garage \nor a person who runs a mom-and-pop real estate agency.\n  Literally, there are tens of thousands, millions of these small \nentrepreneurial centers throughout this country. Most of these folks \ndon't make a great deal of money. They work very hard. They are taking \ncare of their families. One of their biggest concerns is whether they \ncan get health insurance so if somebody should get sick who works with \nthem or should somebody in their family get sick, they will be able to \nhave adequate care. But too many of them are not able to afford health \ninsurance. Approximately 22 million people who are in these small \nbusinesses, these small retail businesses, small manufacturing \nbusinesses, small entrepreneurial shops, don't have insurance. Another \n5 million people, who are sole proprietors and work by themselves, do \nnot have a number of employees working with them, also don't have \ninsurance. That is 27 million people who fall into this category. So \nSenator Enzi has brought forward a bill to try to address that problem. \nIt is going to try to make it possible for these people who work so \nhard and who would like to have insurance policies that are affordable \nto get them. By allowing them to band together in trade groups, so \nrealtors can come together, as well as automobile dealers, garage \nowners, restaurant associations, and hotel associations can come \ntogether and form a large enough group so that they can create enough \nof a mass of interest and buying power so that they can go out and \npurchase insurance. That is something they cannot do today as \nindividuals. This bill allows them to do that.\n  It is hard to understand how anybody could oppose this concept. But \npeople do oppose it, and I think most of the opposition comes from \nfolks who either misunderstand the bill or who are using the bill as a \nway to energize their constituencies with information that is at the \nmargin of believable, to be kind. The biggest opposition today to this \nbill, other than insurance companies who might see this as a \ncompetitor, comes from these groups that represent various different \ndiseases and have compelling stories to tell about their diseases. They \nhave gone to the State legislatures and they have gotten them to put in \nplace what is known as mandates so any policy sold in that State has to \ncover that disease.\n  As was pointed out by the Senator from Kansas, every time that \nhappens that increases the cost of the insurance in that State. For \nevery 1 percent increase in the cost of insurance--and some of these \nspecific mandates are expensive enough so they by themselves represent \na 1-percent increase in insurance premiums. But there are 200,000 to \n300,000 people who cannot afford insurance because the insurance bills \ngo up and 200,000 or 300,000 people fall off the rolls.\n  What this bill tries to do is address the issue of the person who has \nfallen off the rolls, the person who hasn't been able to get the \ninsurance, by giving them an option that they can buy, which they feel \nis adequate to their needs--it may not have a specific mandate in it \nbecause maybe they don't need those mandates to be covered, but at \nleast it gives them the basic coverage they need in order to get \nthrough their health insurance risks.\n  The flip side of this coin, which isn't talked about much but which \nis fairly obvious, is that these people have no insurance at all. When \nthese mandate groups argue, if you pass this bill, you are going to \nundermine the capacity of people to get insurance for this disease \ngroup, that is a totally misleading presentation because the people \nthis is focused on don't have insurance to begin with. You cannot take \nsomething away from somebody who doesn't have it. If a person doesn't \nhave an insurance policy, he doesn't have the mandates that the \ninsurance policy requires.\n  If a cook working in a restaurant or a garage attendant working at a \ngas station or a realtor working in a small mom-and-pop real estate \nagency doesn't have any health insurance, you cannot take away from \nthem mandated coverage for health insurance because they don't have it \nto begin with.\n  What this bill tries to do is allow that individual to participate in \na group where they will have health insurance as an option. And if they \nhave that option of health insurance, without mandates, they also have \nto have--that group, that restaurant, that real estate agency, that \ngarage the option to purchase a fully mandated policy. In other words, \nit is a policy that is, for lack of better terms, a higher option \npolicy, where you have everything covered. It has to track the five \nStates in this country which have the most mandates on their insured. \nSo the bill is balanced in that area of mandates.\n\n  A second opposition to this bill has been the fact that it moves from \ncommunity rating to a banding system. What does that mean? It \nessentially means that on a community rating you basically force \neverybody to be rated the same, no matter their health risk or age \ngroup or occupation. With a rating system, you adjust marginally for \nwhat health experience it may be or what age it is. Adjustments can be \nmade, but they are limited by the State. If you have a community-rated \nsystem, you inevitably have a much higher cost going in for a lot of \nthose people who are banding together in groups, who maybe don't have \nas much risk as others. But if you have a rating system, some people \nare going to be lower in insurance costs and some people will be \nhigher. They are going to be within a relatively narrow band.\n  So this bill allows these policies to be offered with a rating \nsystem, with a band. In New Hampshire--and this has been referred to on \nthe floor by the Senator from Massachusetts--they had a very bad \nexperience because, regrettably, New Hampshire did it the wrong way. We \nhad a community rating system and then we went to a band rating system \nbecause we recognized that was better policy. I congratulate the State \nfor that, but they didn't go to it correctly. They went sort of cold \nturkey. The practical effect was that one day people got one type of \nbill, and the next day they got a different type of bill. For some \npeople it went up, for some people it went down, and it was a rather \nstartling event for them. We looked at that experience in committee and \nsaid we don't want to emulate what happened in New Hampshire. We want \nto make this a much more responsible approach. We put into place a \nglidepath, 5-year phasing, so there will be plenty of time to adjust \nand to be able to handle this.\n  That type of opposition to this bill, clearly, in my opinion, has \nbeen addressed. It has been addressed specifically because of the New \nHampshire experience. So it is a misrepresentation to say that \ncontinues to be a major issue with this bill. As a practical matter, \nthere are about 85 million people in this country who work in small \nbusinesses. That is a huge number. They deserve the opportunity to have \nthis type of insurance made available to them. They should have the \nsame opportunity as big businesses--the IBMs,\n\n[[Page S4181]]\n\nthe Microsofts, the major manufacturers--in our country, if for no \nother reason than they happen to be the engine of economic activity in \nthis country. Most of the new jobs are created by small businesses, the \nmoms and pops who are willing to build that restaurant, take on that \nexciting opportunity, start small and grow. When they do that, they \nought to have the opportunity to also have an insurance option \navailable. But many of them don't because it is not affordable, because \nof the way the States work the system, and because of that these small \ngroups, as individuals, have no buying power. So this bill has \naddressed that need.\n  It is not the answer. This isn't a magic wand, but it is another \nopportunity put on, let's say, the cafeteria line of insurance that \ngives a small businessperson the chance to go down that cafeteria line \nand say: Yes, this plan works for the five people who work for me, and \nI am going to buy into the plan because I can afford it. Today, most \npeople who walk down that cafeteria line, if they are small \nbusinesspeople, don't choose anything because they cannot afford the \nprice of anything, or many of them are in that capacity, that 22 \nmillion. This will take a fairly significant number of those folks and \ngive them the opportunity to purchase health insurance.\n  So it will take people from a noninsurance status to an insured \nstatus, from a situation where if they get sick, they don't know how \nthey are going to pay for it, to a situation where if they get sick, \nthey will have coverage. It is very important financially to most \npeople and, obviously, it is important psychologically to everybody. So \nit is a good bill, something we should support.\n  I do think much of the opposition to it is misguided because it \ndoesn't recognize that the basic goal is to take people who don't have \ninsurance today and get them insurance. Therefore, the arguments around \nmandates are irrelevant to that group of people and the argument of \ncommunity rating as I think we will address.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Wyoming for bringing this bill \nforward. I look forward to working with him on this bill.\n  I want to speak on another matter briefly because there is a lot \ngoing on that is very good in this country relative to the economy, and \nit is not being highlighted.\n  Today, there was an editorial in the New York Times that said we \nshould not extend the tax cuts put into place in 2003. They say those \ntax cuts should not be extended in the areas of capital gains and \ndividends. That argument is good in 1930s economics. It is the old left \ntheory of tax policy, which is that you increase revenues by constantly \nincreasing taxes on people. It has been proven wrong this year, last \nyear, and the year before. It was proven wrong by John Kennedy when he \nput in place the first tax cut. It was proven wrong by Ronald Reagan \nwhen he put in place the tax cut of 1980. And it has been proven wrong \nagain.\n\n  In fact, in the first 6 months of this year, tax revenues jumped 11 \npercent, $134 billion, and a large percentage of that is the increase \nin tax revenues from capital gains and the fact that we have reduced \nthe rate on capital gains which causes people to free up assets. Over \nthe last 3 years, revenues have jumped dramatically--in fact, last year \nby 14 percent, and the year before by 7 percent, and next year they are \nprojected to jump again. Why is that? It is because we are seeing an \neconomic boom which has created 5.3 million new jobs since those tax \ncuts were put into place. There have been more jobs added in the United \nStates in that period than Europe and Japan combined have created. And \nthose jobs have led to economic activity and, in turn, have led to \nrevenues to the Federal Government.\n  Revenues to the Federal Government are dramatically increasing \nbecause the economy is growing, and the economy is growing because the \nburden on those people who go out and are willing to take risks through \ncapital investment, dividend activity, through income tax activity--\nthose people are taking risks and creating economic activity and, as a \nresult, creating jobs which, in turn, create taxpayers, which, in turn, \nincreases the Federal revenues.\n  The numbers don't lie. They are huge, significant, and they confirm, \nonce again, that John Kennedy was right, Ronald Reagan was right, and \nGeorge Bush was right. By making tax rates fair, especially on capital \nformation, you energize economic activity and, in turn, you create \nmassive increases in Federal revenues. Regrettably, I must say the New \nYork Times is wrong.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am so happy to come to the floor today \nbecause the Senate is finally debating how we can help small businesses \nacross our country afford health care for their employees. Just as \nSenator Gregg has mentioned how important it is to provide benefits to \ngroups who want to invest, and to individuals and companies who want to \ninvest and grow the economy, so too it is critically important that we \nprovide small businesses the ability to invest in themselves. That is \nwhat I want to talk about today.\n\n  Small businesses are critical to this country. They are critical to \nrural States such as mine in Arkansas, but they are the engine of our \neconomy in this great Nation. They are the No. 1 employers. That is why \nit is so important that we get this right, that we provide them with a \ntool that will allow them to reinvest in themselves and their employees \nand their communities, so that we can keep that engine going.\n  I applaud my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, for all he has \ndone in bringing about this debate. He has worked hard and genuinely on \nthis issue, and I appreciate very much what he has put into this. He \nhas helped us make sure this is not a debate about whether this is a \ncritical issue.\n  This reminds me of something I was taught by my father who said: If \nit is worth doing, it is worth doing right. It is worth doing \ncorrectly. That is what we are here to talk about today.\n  I believe very strongly that our small businesses are so important to \nus--our self-employed individuals in this country have the greatest \nspirit in the world--and it is so important that we should not offer \nthem a second-rate opportunity. We should offer them the same \nopportunity we have as Federal employees and Members of Congress: The \nopportunity to build a pool that will offer them greater access, \ngreater choice at a lower cost, by pooling all of themselves together \nacross this great country, while maintaining the quality, which is what \nwe do for ourselves. We maintain the quality of the product of the \nhealth insurance we receive or have access to as Federal employees and \nMembers of Congress, and we should do no less for the small businesses \nand the self-employed individuals in this great country.\n  So I hope, as we continue this debate, we will remember those hard-\nworking American families who are depending on us not just to do \nsomething, but to do what is right and fair, and offering what we see \nas fair tax policy and offering what we see as fair access to the same \nquality product of health care and health insurance that we as Members \nof Congress get.\n  The small business health care crisis is undoubtedly one of the \nissues I hear the most about when I return home to Arkansas. In fact, \nin every community in our Nation, as well as millions of working \nfamilies across this country, we are seeing the difficulty of having \naccess to quality health care and health insurance and the ability to \npay for that.\n  There are approximately 46 million Americans currently without health \ninsurance, including 456,000 Arkansans whom I am responsible for in \nterms of producing a product that is worthy of those individuals. Small \nbusinesses are the No. 1 source of our jobs in Arkansas. Yet only 26 \npercent of the businesses with fewer than 50 employees offer health \ninsurance coverage. Workers at these businesses, which again are the \nengine of our economy, are most likely to be uninsured. In fact, 20 \npercent of working-age adults are uninsured in Arkansas. This number is \nalarming, and addressing this problem should be a national priority, \nand we should approach it as if we are going to do the best job that we \nare capable of doing. That is why we are here today, to talk about \nthat.\n  Mr. President, 224 major organizations are opposed to the proposal \nthat\n\n[[Page S4182]]\n\nSenator Enzi has brought before us. Two hundred-and-twenty-four is a \nhuge number: everywhere from diabetes to mental illness to hospital \nfederations. These individuals understand how important the years have \nbeen in allowing State insurance commissioners to be able to set \nmandates in order to cover what is important to individuals in their \nStates, and what is important to small businesses and everyone in those \nStates. Those States have the right and the ability to figure out what \nis important to them, and the majority of them have agreed on many of \nthese major issues.\n  Those who lack health insurance do not get access to timely and \nappropriate health care. We know that, and we see it. We see it in the \ncost of Medicare when people don't get health care for 20 or 25 years \nwhen they are in the working marketplace as a small business owner or \nemployee, and then they become more costly to us when they hit Medicare \nage because they haven't received the screenings, the timely visits to \nthe doctor, and they haven't been getting the kind of health care they \ntruly need. They have less access to these important screenings. They \ndon't have access to the state-of-the-art technology that exists or \nprescription drugs, which is another piece of what can help keep down \nthe cost of health care.\n  Working families need help with this problem. The Institute of \nMedicine has reported that 18,000 people die each year because they are \nuninsured. The fact is, being insured does matter. It makes a big \ndifference. It makes a difference in our health care costs. It makes a \ndifference in whether you are going to survive--longevity, the ability \nto care for your family. It makes a big difference. We have reached a \njuncture where we are going to debate how we deal with those who are \nuninsured, whether we are going to give them substandard coverage or \nwhether we are going to give them the coverage that we have.\n\n  Again, I commend my colleagues, Senator Enzi from Wyoming and Senator \nNelson from Nebraska, for their leadership. I appreciate their hard \nwork on this issue. But I do disagree, because I believe that the devil \nis in the details on this issue, and I am deeply concerned about the \nvery harsh and unintended consequences that will occur if S. 1955 were \nto become law.\n  Senator Durbin and myself have been working together for several \nyears to come up with what we believe is a better health care plan for \nAmerica's small businesses. What we have done is looked to a 40-year-\nold tested delivery system, and it is the one that we ourselves use. It \nis a Federal plan that takes the best of what Government can do and \ncombines it with the best of what private industry can do. The private \nmarketplace and the competition that it can create allows the \nGovernment to pool all of its Federal employees and use that pool as a \nnegotiating tool to bring us greater choice at a lower cost.\n  About 3 years ago, I suppose it was, my staff and I were discussing \nthe way we could help small businesses, and I thought about the way my \nSenate office operates. It operates much like a small business in my \nhome State and here. As I looked at my employees, I saw that I had two \nemployees, one with 26 years with the Federal Government, another with \n30 years with the Federal Government. I had two women who had delivered \nbabies and were on maternity leave. I had some, such as myself, with \nsmall children and a husband that is on my plan, and then I had a host \nof young, healthy staffers who were single. But I had a whole array of \ndifferent individuals who needed a tailor-made insurance plan for their \nneeds. While there are similarities in our Senate office and small \nbusinesses, there are also some obvious differences. One of the most \nglaring contrasts is access to affordable and quality health care. I \nsaw what my office went through and realized that is what small \nbusinesses are going through. I knew we could do better. I knew we \ncould take the plan of what we have and apply it to small businesses.\n  Last year, more than 8 million people were banded together in the \nFederal employees purchasing pool, and that gave us choices among 10 \nnational health insurance plans and a variety of local insurance plans, \nand a total of 278 private insurance plans from the private \nmarketplace. Not government-run--not government-run health care at \nall--but health care from the private industry, health insurance from \nthe private industry that was created by competition of the multiple \nFederal employees across the country. It offered us greater access, \ngreater choices at a lower cost.\n  So I am here to ask this question: Why don't we try to give small \nbusinesses access to that same type of private health insurance option \nthat Members of Congress and Federal employees enjoy today? Rather than \nreinvent the wheel, why don't we create a program for small businesses \nthat is based on our Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan, through the \nFEHBP, by pooling them, the small businesses, together in one \nnationwide pool. That is exactly what Senator Durbin and I have \nproposed in our Small Employers Health Benefit Program. By pooling \nsmall businesses across America into one risk and purchasing pool \nsimilar to the FEHBP, our program will allow employers to reap the \nbenefit of group purchasing power and streamline administrative costs \nas well as access to more plan choices. The SEHBP, as we have \nintroduced, lowers costs for small businesses in two key ways: It pools \nthem into one national pool across the country, therefore spreading the \nrisk between the healthy and the sick, the young, the old, those who \nlive and work in the remotest parts of this great land and those who \nwork in the most urban areas. Second, our plan significantly lowers \nadministrative costs for small businesses.\n  Two economists have estimated that SEHBP would save small businesses \nbetween 27 and 37 percent annually, even if they don't take advantage \nof the tax cut that we offset costs with by insuring lower income \nworkers. We provide a tax cut to small businesses, and for the life of \nme, I can't figure out why those on the other side of the aisle, for \nthe first time I have ever noticed, will fight a tax cut for small \nbusinesses. Providing small business a tax cut to be able to engage in \nwhat is such an important tool in getting themselves and their \nemployees insured makes good sense. What a great investment.\n  Senator Gregg was talking about balancing all of that and the \neconomy. What a great way to balance what corporate America gets and \ntheir ability to deduct health insurance costs that they have and small \nbusiness getting a tax cut for investing in their employees and health \nbenefits for them. Under our bill, employers will receive an annual tax \ncredit for contributions made on behalf of their workers who make \n$25,000 per year or less. And if the employer contributes 60 percent or \nmore to the health insurance premium of an employee making $25,000 or \nless, the employer will receive a 25-percent tax credit. And the tax \ncredits increase with the number of people covered and the proportion \nof premium the employer chooses to cover. Also, the employer receives a \nbonus tax credit for signing up in the first year of the program, \nbecause we know from the example of the Federal employees that the more \nemployees who are in the pool, the greater advantage to everyone \nconcerned. Small businesses will save thousands of dollars--even more--\nunder our plan.\n  Segmenting the market into different association pools, as S. 1955 \ndoes under Senator Enzi's bill, will not achieve these savings that \nwould be created by instituting one large pool with all of those small \nbusinesses and self-employed individuals. Each association will be \nadministering to a separate group with a different administrative \nstructure and different costs, obviously. More funds would be going to \nadministrative costs as opposed to serving the people with a quality \nhealth plan. Our SEHBP would have one administrative structure and \ncould pool approximately 53 million workers together, therefore \nbalancing the risk of sick and healthy, young and old, rural and urban, \nfor affordable rates for everybody. Why wouldn't we want to make our \npool as big as it possibly could be, as we do with the Federal workers?\n  I believe our plan takes a real moderate and balanced approach that \ncombines the best of what Government can do with the best of what the \nprivate sector can do, and preserving important coverage for preventive \nhealth\n\n[[Page S4183]]\n\ncare treatment such as diabetes supplies, mammograms, prostate \nscreening, maternity and well-baby care, immunization, things that \nStates themselves have decided are important enough to mandate coverage \nfor and ensure that the people of their State are going to get the safe \nand important coverage of illnesses that are critical to them in their \nState.\n  Like the FEHB Plan, our program does not promote Government-run \nhealth care, but it harnesses the power of market competition to bring \ndown health insurance costs using a proven Government negotiator in the \nOffice of Personnel Management, OPM, which is the negotiator for our \nplan. We, once a year, as Federal employees, can choose among 270-plus \nplans. We are able to actually benefit from that proven Government \nnegotiator and the harnessing of that power.\n  Our legislation, S. 2510, has been endorsed by many organizations--\nthe National Association of Women Business Owners, Small Business \nMajority, the American Medical Society, the American Diabetes \nAssociation, the National Mental Health Association, the Cancer \nSociety, and many more that have realized how important it is to use a \nproven example, a proven structure that maintains quality but helps by \npooling and bringing down those costs.\n  The Mental Health Liaison Group, representing over 35 national mental \nhealth organizations, wrote to us and said about our bill:\n\n       S. 2510 does not sacrifice quality of coverage for \n     affordability or allow the offering of second class health \n     insurance to small businesses. Within the FEHBP program, \n     small business owners, employees and their family members \n     would be covered by all the consumer protections in their \n     home states--including hard-won state mental health parity \n     laws and mandated benefit laws.\n\n  The American Academy of Pediatrics, writing to us on behalf of over \n60,000 primary care pediatricians and pediatric specialists, wrote:\n\n       Through the benefits of pooling small businesses and \n     providing tax cuts to small employers, small pediatric \n     practices will be assisted in the health insurance market \n     without sacrificing health care services for children.\n\n  The American Diabetes Association wrote to us and said:\n\n       While other proposals seeking to provide health benefits \n     for small businesses . . . have exempted or eliminated \n     coverage for important diabetes care protections, [our bill,] \n     S. 2510, will allow individuals with diabetes to receive the \n     important health care coverage they require to remain healthy \n     and productive members of the workforce.\n\n  This is not just about quality of life, although many of us believe \nthat is very important. We as Members of Congress enjoy a quality of \nlife because of the very healthy health insurance program we are \noffered. We want our small businesses that are vital to our economy to \nenjoy that same opportunity. But it is also about economics. It is \nabout making sure we keep our workforce, particularly our small \nbusinesses and their workforce, healthy and thriving and productive and \nin the workplace. It is about making sure America's working individuals \nand working families get the health care they need before they reach \n65. When they hit 65 in the Medicare Program, then they are going to be \nmore costly to Government because they are not going to have gotten the \nhealth care they needed and deserved in their working years.\n  I believe our plan is better in so many ways. I am proud we are \nhaving this debate, and I hope so many people will realize we can do \nbetter. We can do better and make sure we truly elevate small \nbusinesses and self-employed people to the same level we hold \nourselves, in providing them the access to the same quality type of \nhealth care.\n  Our SEHBP bill offers tax cuts for small employers. Senator Enzi's \nbill does not. SEHBP relies on a proven program. It is based on the \nsuccessful Federal Employees Health Benefit Program which has \nefficiently and effectively provided extensive benefit choices at \naffordable prices to Members of Congress and Federal employees for \ndecades. For decades, we have had a proven program out there that \nproves you can harness the competitive nature of the marketplace, and \nwith the oversight of Government and the State mandates, you can \nactually provide that quality of health insurance at a lower cost. By \npooling small businesses together and allowing OPM to negotiate with \nprivate health insurance companies on their behalf, they, too, could \nhave access to this wide variety.\n  On the other hand, Senator Enzi and Senator Nelson's bill establishes \na new set of responsibilities at the U.S. Department of Labor, to \nadminister an untried and an untested program. We don't reinvent the \nwheel. What we do is use what already exists. To invent a new section \nof the Department of Labor to administer Senator Enzi's bill is going \nto take time and money. We are not going to know how it needs to be \nadministered through the Department of Labor. They have never done it \nbefore. Even the Department of Labor employees currently enjoy benefits \nfrom the health insurance program that is negotiated by the Office of \nPersonnel Management. So it is hard to believe they are going to want \nto go to another system.\n  SEHBP offers individual self-employed workers the same access to \nhealth insurance that is offered to group businesses. SEHBP defines \nsmall businesses as groups of 1 to 100, so an individual self-employed \nperson will be treated exactly as a business with 2 or more people. Any \nbusiness with 1 to 100 employees is eligible to participate in what we \nare trying to do.\n  Under Senator Enzi's bill, the self-employed people are not pooled \nwith the small businesses, unless they are mandated by State law. And \nthere are not that many State laws that actually mandate that. But the \nself-employed people in 36 States, including Arkansas, will not have \naccess to the same negotiated rates of businesses with 2 or more \npeople. They will be pulled out of that pool and rated on their own. \nThat means, if they are younger women of childbearing years or perhaps \nthey are older workers at 50 or 55 and are diabetic, they will be rated \ncompletely separate from the pool, which means they will be segregated \nand treated differently. They don't get to enjoy the benefit of a \nlarger risk pool which could bring down their costs and offer them \ngreater choice.\n  Our bill also ensures access to health care specialists. Many States \nhave passed laws requiring insurers to cover certain health care \nproviders, including dentists or psychologists or chiropractors. All \nthree of these and many more are required by our State of Arkansas law. \nI know the people of my State enjoy the assurance they have of knowing \nthat their State regulator, their State insurance commissioner, is \nlooking out for their needs. They can do that better on a State level. \nThat is why we have always left those types of regulatory issues up to \nour State--because they know and can work.\n  Can you imagine being a small business, or better yet an employee of \na small business, having to call some big, huge, Federal bureaucratic \noffice to request or to complain or to have your concerns heard about \nwhat is not covered under your insurance plan? No, they call the State \ninsurance commissioner today, and that is the way it should be. The \nState insurance commissioner can then respond to the concerns of their \nconstituency and has done so very well over many years.\n\n  The coverage for diabetes supplies, mammography, and other important \nscreenings are mandated by State law which would be preempted by what \nSenator Enzi is trying to do. Many States have passed laws requiring \nhealth insurance companies to cover these benefits because insurers \nsimply were not doing it. It did not happen because the insurance \ncommissioners just decided on a whim to do it; it is because the \ninsurers were not covering it. Why do we have to go back and relearn \nthat lesson?\n  For 40 years, the Federal Government has used the effectiveness of \nthe pool of the 8 million Federal employees and been able to enjoy the \nprotections that are there, guided by State insurance commissioners.\n  Our bill also prevents unfair rating on gender and health status. \nUnder our bill, health insurers will be prohibited from ratings based \non health status--whether you happen to be diabetic, whether you happen \nto have eating disorders--your gender, or the type of industry in which \nthe employees are working. Under Senator Enzi's rules, that will be all \npreempted, even for the 15 States that don't allow ratings on these \nfactors.\n  Our bill also frees employers to focus on running their businesses. \nThey don't\n\n[[Page S4184]]\n\nhave to go and negotiate these plans through their association or with \ntheir association. They are going to get sent a booklet just as we do, \nonce a year, to review all that is available to them, and choices, and \nthen figure out what is best for them. My employees--each of them picks \nsomething different. I pick coverage for a family with children. Some \nof them pick a PPO or an HMO. Some of them pick all different kinds of \nState plans and others that are offered to them in that process.\n  Mr. CARPER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, how much time is left on our side during \nthis period of debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CARPER. How much longer does the Senator expect to speak?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. How about if I just go ahead and yield to the Senator \nfrom Delaware because as a former Governor, he has some incredible \nstories to tell, and I think they really add to this debate. I will \nsimply say to my colleagues that I hope they follow this debate very \nclosely and certainly appreciate how important this is to the working \nfamilies of all of our States.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank my colleague for yielding. I ask if she would \nstay on the floor.\n  I commend Senator Lincoln for actually coming up with this idea. It \nis an idea for which she and Senator Durbin share credit. When you \nthink of some of our options, the options basically are do nothing, \nmaintain the status quo, continue to make the cost of insurance very \nsteep and rising for small businesses or to adopt the proposal of our \ncolleagues, Senator Enzi and Senator Nelson, whom I believe are two of \nthe most thoughtful Members of the Senate. They have worked hard to try \nto make a not very good idea--the original association health plan--a \nbetter idea. But between doing nothing and the modified HP legislation \nfrom Senators Enzi and Nelson is a third way. The third way has already \nbeen outlined here by Senator Lincoln.\n  I wish to ask my colleagues to think about it. I don't care whether \nit is a Democratic idea or Republican idea. It is actually an \nopportunity to take the best from what the Government, the public \nsector, can bring and to take maybe the best the private sector can \nbring.\n  One of the common values that are shared by the Enzi-Nelson \nlegislation and the Lincoln-Durbin legislation is the notion that we \nhave a lot of smaller employers, they have a lot of employees, and \ntogether is there some way we could pool their purchasing power? Maybe \nwe could increase the number of health insurance options available to \nthem and maybe we could bring down the cost of those options. They \npropose to do it in one particular way which, as Senator Lincoln \npointed out, has a number of problems, one of which affects us \nnegatively in Delaware.\n  We have had a very high rate of cancer mortality. Finally, we have \nbrought it down over the last 10 years or so, in part by having \nmandatory cancer screening--mammography, for cervical cancer, prostate \nscreening, for colorectal cancers--and that has helped to bring down \nour cancer mortality rate. From the top in the country, we have finally \nnow dropped to the top five. We are moving in the right direction. I \nwill talk about that tomorrow, and I will even bring some charts to \nrival the chart of my colleague, I hope.\n  But I suggest to my colleagues, think about this. We have all these \ndisparate Federal agencies across the country. Collectively, we have a \ncouple of million employees, family members, and retirees, and all we \ndo through the Federal health benefit plan is we pool our collective \npurchasing power. It doesn't matter if you work for the VA or Homeland \nSecurity or some other Federal agency--EPA--basically we could come \ntogether and use our collective might to negotiate better rates and, \nfrankly, better coverage than would otherwise be the case if we were \njust negotiating for ourselves. We do it all through the Office of \nPersonnel Management.\n  What Senator Lincoln is suggesting is it works great for us, provides \nreasonably good coverage for Federal employees, including us as U.S. \nSenators. We have to pay our portion. It is not that we get it for \nfree. We have to pay our share. But it works pretty darn well. She has \ncome up with a way where we take that Government idea and transpose it \nand transfer it to the private sector. She would have the Office of \nPersonnel Management effectively provide the service or play the role \nin the private sector that it currently plays in the public sector, to \nallow a lot of employees, whether you work for the local hardware store \nor restaurant or small manufacturer or technology company, to say: We \nwould like our employees to be able to pull together from Arkansas, \nfrom Delaware, even from Minnesota, in order to get a chance to buy \nbetter insurance products, have more variety, and bring down our costs \nto our small business employees.\n  It has worked. It is proven. It is time tested, and I believe it is \nworth trying. The worst thing that I think could happen, coming out of \nthis week, is for us to do nothing.\n  It is a big problem. It is a big problem for small employers, and it \nis a big problem for large employers. It is a big problem for America.\n  I think what would be the worst thing that could happen, and what \nwould basically ensure that we do nothing is for our Republican friends \nto basically allow no amendments to the Enzi-Nelson legislation. I \nthink that would be awful. That would be a huge mistake. It would \npretty much basically ensure we end up not getting this bill done or \nsome variation and not even having a chance for debate and vote on the \nLincoln-Durbin legislation. We can do better than that.\n  Frankly, the Senate deserves a lot better than that.\n  I say to my colleague from Arkansas, who has been good enough to \nrelinquish her time, I thank her on behalf of all us for pointing out a \ndifferent course, a third way in this regard. I thank her.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Minority time has expired.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I ask unanimous consent to continue until other Members arrive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I will be glad to yield the floor when others are ready to speak.\n  I would like to add that the experience of many of our colleagues, \nwhether they are former insurance commissioners, former Governors and \nothers, brings to this table the understanding what the American people \nwant, what our working families want. I think the debate is that small \nbusinesses definitely want more affordable health care. They also want \nto make sure that what they are providing for themselves and their \nfamilies and their employees is quality service, quality coverage. That \nis what they deserve. That is what they want.\n  Even for those who feel so young and invincible, we also know that \nthey may be one car accident or one diagnosis away from needing more \ncomprehensive health insurance for the rest of their lives.\n  That is why we want to make sure--as I said in the beginning--that \nwhatever we do is right, that we don't move forward on something that \nis going to be less productive and in the long run, unfortunately, put \nmore people at risk.\n  My goal is to help small businesses while not jeopardizing the \nquality of health care for the 68 million Americans in State-regulated \ngroup plans that are already out there. We don't want to do harm there.\n  The fact is if we move forward on what Senator Enzi wants to do, \nwhich is preempting those State regulations and State mandates, we \ncould do tremendous harm for those who are currently insured and the \n16.5 million Americans with individual health insurance coverage who \nwould probably lose some quality of coverage which they have.\n  If it is good enough for Federal employees, and if it good enough for \nMembers of Congress, I think it should be good enough for millions of \nsmall business employees who are the economic backbone of communities \nthroughout this Nation.\n  I applaud my colleagues for coming to the floor for this debate, and \nI hope we will have a serious debate so we can\n\n[[Page S4185]]\n\nmove forward and actually do what is right for the American people.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield once again?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Yes, absolutely.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, we do not often think of the Federal \nGovernment in the way we are trying to harness market forces and \ncompetition and put them to work. We try to hold down Federal outlays. \nThat is what we do with respect to the Federal. It is literally what we \ndo with respect to the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan. What we \nare trying to do, with respect to what the Senator has outlined, is \nharness market forces and competition and put them to work for small \nbusinesses as well.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, reclaiming our time, I didn't realize they \nwould be allowed to use part of it.\n  It would be helpful if the other side would actually share the \ndetails of their amendment with us so that we can take a look at it. \nThe details of our bill have been through the committee, out here, and \nhad hearings. We don't know what is going to be in there. The last time \nI looked at it, there was, I think, $9 billion of cost in it each year, \nand the huge bureaucracy that would be built up. I make that request to \nthe other side--that we sure would like to take a look at their bill. \nIt is hard to do until we have a copy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                 Cape Wind Facility in Nantucket Sound\n\n  Mr. President, I am here to discuss the provision in the Coast Guard \nand Maritime Transportation Act of 2006 and the provision which allows \nthe State of Massachusetts to have a say in the siting of a 24-square-\nmile, 130-wind turbine energy facility.\n  I have a chart I want to use and describe.\n  First, let me say why the Senator from Alaska is involved in this \nissue. What I am trying to say is that this is a tremendous precedent.\n  We have a series of areas of various States where there is a gap in \nState jurisdiction and where Federal waters are adjacent to and \nsometimes almost surrounding State waters. That is particularly true in \nmy State. With the Cook Inlet on either side of Kalgin Island, there \nare gaps of Federal waters surrounded by the mainland of Alaska going \ndown the inlet.\n  The Minerals Management Service tells us there are roughly 2.5 \nmillion acres of Federal waters going down that inlet that could be \nused for projects such as I am going to discuss today.\n  A similar situation exists with Chandeleur Island, LA; the Channel \nIslands in California; the Farallon Islands in California; the Hawaiian \nIslands in many instances; and in Puerto Rico.\n  What I am here to talk about is the precedent that would be \nestablished by locating this facility in Nantucket Sound, less than 2 \nmiles beyond the State of Massachusetts' jurisdiction.\n  If we look at this chart, you can see very clearly the area with the \ndarkest color on the chart, which is the proposed site of this power \nfacility. It is 9 miles from one part of Massachusetts, 13.8 miles from \nthe other side, and 6 miles from the other direction.\n  When you look at the situation, we realize the State has jurisdiction \nover at least 3 miles in that area.\n  This is very close to the area of Massachusetts where people have a \nright to be concerned over this project. Before the Federal Government \nclaimed ownership of this area, there was a judicial dispute over which \ngovernment had jurisdiction over it. I am informed that the State of \nMassachusetts had established a marine park in this area. As a matter \nof fact, it was listed as part of a proposed marine sanctuary, even in \nthe Federal listings. It is now the proposed site for the largest and \nmost expansive offshore wind energy project ever undertaken in the \nworld.\n  This facility would include turbines that stand 417 feet tall.\n  This is a chart that describes it. Those windmills would be 417 feet \ntall, taller than the Statue of Liberty. The one little point at the \nbottom shows a 30-foot sailboat. You can see the size of it. People \nsail their boats that size on Nantucket Bay, and the Great Point \nLighthouse is supposed to keep sailors and mariners warned about the \narea. It is only 73 feet tall.\n  When you look this area, it is 24 miles across, more than half the \nsize of Boston Harbor itself. It is going to be the site of this \nenormous facility.\n  As I said, it is larger than any similar kind of wind energy project \nin the world.\n  It is a very small area of Federal jurisdiction, completely \nsurrounded by the mainland and islands of Massachusetts.\n  Some in the media have insinuated that by including this provision in \nthe Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act, I am doing it as an \nold friend to Senator Ted Kennedy. He is an old friend. It is true that \nSenator Kennedy and the Governor of Massachusetts support the provision \nin the Coast Guard bill, but this is my amendment. They have agreed \nwith me. I didn't seek their agreement. It is not an issue based on \nfriendship or on past favors or future favors. It is strictly a \nprovision based upon my long-held belief that States should have the \nfinal say on projects which will directly impact their lands, \nresources, and constituents.\n  Some in the press have claimed this provision is embedded in \n``obscure legislation to be passed in the dead of the night.'' We hear \nthis all the time. But the Coast Guard authorization bill is hardly \nobscure legislation, and there is nothing secretive about this bill.\n  The version of this bill that passed the House of Representatives \nincluded a provision related to offshore wind farms. It was in the \nHouse-passed bill to start with. The House and the Senate, in a \nbicameral, bipartisan group of Members of a conference committee, \ndiscussed and negotiated language to provide the State of Massachusetts \na greater voice in the siting of this windmill farm in Nantucket Sound.\n  This bicameral, bipartisan group also negotiated language requiring \nthe Coast Guard to assess the potential navigational impacts of the \nproposed offshore powerplant.\n  This is the normal legislative process for passing legislation of \nthis type through the Congress.\n  Again, let me point out this chart. I don't live in this area, but I \nhave studied it very well. This is the path the ferries take coming out \nof these areas and going through this sound, and it is the path which \nthe commercial traffic, steamships, and cargo ships use going into that \nport.\n  As a consequence of this location, this line demonstrates the State's \njurisdiction and how close it is to the State's jurisdiction. As a \nmatter of fact, the area that is has been lined shows the previous plan \nwhich would have gone partially into the State's jurisdiction. The \nproject was amended, so it does not touch the State waters or State \njurisdiction areas at all.\n  It is this area of solid brown on this chart.\n  By the way, this is the very shallow portion of this area. There is \nno question about it. Nantucket Island is out here. But there are \nequally shallow portions outside of the sound that could have been \nused. But, of course, it is deeper going in there, and that access to \nthis interior part of this sound I think is strictly a financial \ndecision.\n  At the heart of the debate on the issue is States' rights. The fact \nis this project will be located entirely in the sound--in this small \ndoughnut hole of the Federal water surrounded by islands and mainland \nof the State of Massachusetts.\n  The debate over this project is similar to the fights those of us in \nAlaska have been engaged in for decades. Our State lands are surrounded \nby Federal lands, and we often don't have any decision regarding the \ndevelopment of our resources or projects which will be located in our \nState.\n  This is one of those situations where Congress ought to listen to the \nGovernor. They ought to listen to the senior Senator, in my opinion.\n  Those in Massachusetts have raised legitimate concerns about the \nimpact of this wind farm and what its impact will be on maritime \nnavigation, aviation, and radar installations critical to our homeland \nsecurity.\n  This proposed site is an area already known for its treacherous \nflight conditions, and this facility could make those conditions much \nworse. According to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, \nthis facility will be located in the flight path of thousands\n\n[[Page S4186]]\n\nof small planes. Both the Barnstable and Nantucket Airport Commissions \nare opposed to the construction of this facility, as are the major \nferry lines that operate in Nantucket Sound.\n  As the chart I have described shows, ferry routes pass within a mile \nof the proposed location for this project on two sides. The 24-square-\nmile footprint for this facility is nearly half the size of Boston \nHarbor, a 471-foot wind farm.\n  Again, those windmills are larger than this building. Those windmills \nare larger than the Capitol.\n  You have to get the specter of this size being built in the center of \nthis sound. It is a 24-square-mile footprint for this facility. As I \nhave said, it is half the size of Boston Harbor and has shipping and \nferry channels bordering on three sides.\n  There is not a single local fishing group from Massachusetts that \nsupports this project, I am informed. It would effectively close a 24-\nmile-square-mile footprint of many kinds of fishing that has taken \nplace in this sound for generations. Horseshoe Shoal, where the \nfacility will be built, is one of the most productive fishing grounds \nin the area. That means this area produces offspring. This is where the \nfish spawn.\n\n  The impact of the shoal will be significant. The piling for each one \nof these windmills--there are 130 of them--are 16 feet in diameter and \nwill be bored down into the shoal to a depth of about 80 feet. This \nproductive area will be littered with 130 drilled holes. Each piling \nwill occupy 2 acres of productive fishing ground. Navigating in and \naround 130 turbines will make fishing and fishing reproduction in this \narea nearly impossible.\n  In addition, these turbines will make Coast Guard search and rescue \nmissions much more difficult in this area, already known for severe \nweather and sea conditions in parts of the year.\n  Those in Massachusetts raise another important point. Developing a \nwind farm of this size and scale offshore has never been done before, \nlet alone in an environment as extreme as the waters of the North \nAtlantic.\n  To put this challenge in perspective, it helps to compare the \nMassachusetts project to the wind farm currently operating in Palm \nSprings, CA. I know a little bit about this. I have gone into that town \nseveral times by air. That facility stands 150 feet at the tallest \npoint. The blades are half the length of a football field, but they are \none-third of this size. Even on dry land and a relatively calm desert \nclimate, the Palm Springs wind farm has been plagued by serious \nmaintenance complications. Many of the turbines require constant \nmaintenance and repair.\n  Put that in the Massachusetts Sound. They require maintenance and \nrepair constantly. This Massachusetts project would require maintenance \nand repair to take place in icy waters of Nantucket Sound. The size of \nthe windmills for this facility would dwarf the existing land-based \nwind projects. The windmills in Nantucket Sound would stand nearly \nthree times as tall as those in Palm Springs, with wind blades over a \nfootball field in length. Just the blade is a football field in length.\n  Now, given the legitimate issues raised by the people of \nMassachusetts and their representative, I believe it is only fair to \nallow the State to have an equal voice in the debate over the siting of \nthis project. Nantucket Sound, as I have said, is not the only place \nwhere a project of this kind can be built. In Europe, deepwater wind \nenergy technologies are currently being developed as far out as 15 \nmiles in 138 feet of water. Placing wind energy facilities further from \ntheir shore reduces their impact on maritime navigation.\n  If this 24-square-mile wind farm is built further away from shore, \nthere would be a number of benefits. It would be removed from boating, \nfishing, ferrying, shipping channels, reducing the risk of collision \nand reducing the potential impact on the navigation which we have asked \nthe Coast Guard to look into.\n  I do support America's use of alternative energy sources, including \nwind farms and wind power. I have supported wind projects in the past \nduring my time as chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations. \nOur committee appropriated over $105 million for wind projects in \nfiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2006. There was even one in my State \naround Kotzebue.\n  It is the right of a State to determine if this type of project is \nconsistent with its efforts to protect its resources. I believe \nCongress should defer to the judgment of the Massachusetts \ncongressional delegation, the Governor of Massachusetts, and the people \nof Massachusetts on this matter. States should have a say in the \nactivities taking place in the waters adjacent to their shores. This \nlocation, in particular, deserves special consideration due to the \ngeographic peculiarities of the region.\n  California blocked oil platforms, Oregon and Washington blocked them \nbefore they were even built.\n  We now have a dispute before the Congress over a potential \ndevelopment of gas resources 170 miles off the State of Florida. This \nis 3 miles. This is within a sound that is one of the--I have only been \nthere two or three times, but it is a place if you ever go to it you \nwould not forget. It is not a place that deserves to have this impact. \nThe residents of Massachusetts will have to live with the impact of \nthis project. They must have a greater role in determining the fate of \nthis treasured area.\n  This bill, H.R. 889, as agreed to by the conference committee, \nrightly awards the State of Massachusetts this greater authority in the \ndecisions regarding this project. So I am here today to urge the House \nand the Senate to listen to the people of Massachusetts and \nparticularly to listen to their senior Senator.\n  I am pleased to yield whatever time I have remaining. I think I have \nonly another 10 minutes or so. I yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  I think we have 30 minutes on this side and 30 minutes on that side, \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 14 minutes remaining on the majority \nside.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is there time on the Democratic side for the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We are rotating back and forth. I am happy to work that \nout.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We will work that out.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We will stay on the subject matter.\n  Mr. ENZI. We had some latitude here to allow 20 minutes on this and \nwe were 5 minutes late from that one.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I talked too long.\n  Mr. ENZI. And Senator Thune does not have the time for his speech.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I cannot yield, but if the Senator from \nMassachusetts requests time and wants to use the Democratic time for \nthat, we have 14 minutes on the majority side I would like to use to \ntalk about the small business health plan. But if the Senator from \nMassachusetts wants to use Democratic time, that is fine.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask to be yielded 8 minutes on the Democratic time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, the \nSenator from Alaska.\n  I hope to have an opportunity to get into this in greater detail than \nI will for the few minutes I have this afternoon.\n  There are certain points I want to make. That is, the waters around \nthe area described by the Senator from Alaska, the Nantucket-Martha's \nVineyard-Cape Cod area, has been designated a state ocean sanctuary and \nit is an unreplaceable asset to the people of Massachusetts. Up to \n1986, it was generally recognized to be under the jurisdiction of the \nCommonwealth. In the 1970s, Massachusetts was concerned about potential \ndevelopment threats and made the entire area a protected state ocean \nsanctuary--where no structures could be built on the seabed and where \nno offshore electricity generation facilities could be constructed.\n  The legislation was passed easily through the State House. And the \nspecific part of Nantucket Sound that is no longer protected by the \nstate laws, because of a Supreme Court decision, is under consideration \nfor national marine sanctuary status.\n  My second point, Mr. President, is that I am for wind energy. We all \nknow we need it to meet our future needs, and we've seen the successes \nthat onshore wind energy farms can be. We ought to have offshore wind \nenergy, but we need to get it right.\n\n[[Page S4187]]\n\n  The problem in Massachusetts is that we have a developer who's \nbasically staked a claim to 24 square miles of Nantucket Sound back \nwhen there were no rules on offshore wind development, and then got the \nproject written into the new law so the new rules won't apply to this \nproject.\n  And the practical effect is that there will be no competition for the \ndeveloper and that his application is being reviewed and processed \nbefore the Department of the Interior can even complete a national \npolicy.\n  In the Energy bill, section 388 says:\n\n        . . . the Secretary shall issue a lease, easement or \n     right-of-way under paragraph (1) on a competitive basis \n     unless the Secretary after public notice of a proposed lease, \n     easement or right-of-way that there is no competitive \n     interest.\n\n  The next provision says:\n\n       Nothing in the amendment made by subsection (a) requires \n     the resubmittal of any document that was previously submitted \n     or the reauthorization of any action that was previously \n     authorized with respect to a project for which, before the \n     date of enactment of this Act--\n       (1) an offshore test facility has been constructed;\n\n  Well, where in the country was there a project that had an offshore \ntest facility?--only in Nantucket Sound. So this was a real special \ninterest provision.\n  Because of this ``savings provision,'' the developers are pushing \nInterior to complete this review before the rules of the game are even \nestablished and before the ocean is zoned.\n  So while Interior is setting a uniform program--and deciding which \nsites should be used--this project is on the fast track. The developer \nand the developer alone picked the site.\n  And this is a serious problem. Look at what the EPA said about this \nproject's draft environmental impact statement. They called it \n``inadequate.'' That's from the EPA, the agency charged with protecting \nthe environment.\n  And the EPA wasn't alone. Look at what the US Geological Survey said \nabout Cape Wind's draft environmental impact statement:\n\n        . . . the DEIS is at best incomplete, and too often \n     inaccurate and misleading.\n\n  Inadequate--Incomplete--and too often inaccurate and/or misleading. \nDoes this sound like project that should be on the fast track?\n  But because they've been written into the law, the interests of our \nstate have been basically submerged to a special interest developer.\n  They complain about the provision in this bill that Senator Stevens \nnegotiated with the House. He's right. He's trying to at least bring \nthis back up for review under the sunlight and ensure that the \ninterests of the state for safety and for environmental protection \naren't run roughshod over.\n  The project's developer is the one that got the special interest \nlegislation. This Coast Guard provision is designed to check that and \npreserve the public interest.\n  The provision Senator Stevens crafted tries to remedy an injustice \nthe developer created, and at least let the people of our State be \nheard.\n  We wish this provision wasn't necessary, and it wouldn't be if the \ndeveloper was content with following the rules that apply to everyone \nelse.\n  That would have been satisfactory, but no, we are denied that equal \ntreatment. We are prohibited from that. That is not right.\n  Our State went out and created the Cape and Islands Ocean Sanctuary \nas a protected area. Then the Supreme Court cut a hole in those \nprotections, and now the interests of the State to preserve the \nfisheries and environment of the whole region is being undermined. It \nis being handed off to private interests. It's not right. We deserve to \nhave at least a little fairness in this.\n  I will not take the time to list the various national marine \nsanctuaries, including the Channel Islands, all the Florida Keys, and \nother national treasures, like Stellwagen Bank outside of Boston, which \nI am so happy we have protected into the future.\n  The law says you can't build energy facilities in those sanctuaries \nand we shouldn't--and Nantucket Sound is just as important as those.\n  For 400 years the Sound was considered Massachusetts waters, and it \nwas a protected by the people of our state.\n  In preparation for the 1986 Supreme Court decision that would specify \nthat this narrow area would be carved out as Federal land, we took \nspecial care to get on the national marine sanctuary site evaluation \nlist. We didn't want to take any chances then, and we're still on the \nlist. At a minimum, no industrial project should be built there until \nwe can resolve that status.\n  And now we have a developer who wants complete control over 24 miles \nin the middle of the Sound, even though no government agency has zoned \nit for energy development yet.\n  We know that the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy called for a \ncomprehensive siting policy, and that Interior is now working on it. We \nendorse that approach completely, but this developer is undermining \nthat.\n  And the American people should know just what this developer is \ngetting for this no-bid, no-compete contract. There will be at least \n$28 million a year in federal tax benefits available to the developer \nthat's $280 million over 10 years.\n  And in Massachusetts, the developer will be eligible for between $37 \nmillion and $82 million a year in price subsidies under the renewable \nenergy credit program. That's $370 million to $820 million in price \nsubsidies over 10 years.\n  Then there's the fact that the company will be able to write off the \n$800 million cost of this project off in just 5 years.\n  This is a boondoggle, and it's an outrage the developer's getting a \nno-bid contract to a public resource. We've seen what no-bid contracts \ncan do, Mr. President.\n  Who pays when we talk about subsidies? It comes out of the taxpayers' \npockets when we talk about subsidies.\n  It is a great deal for this developer. It is a great deal for his \ninvestors. It is a great deal for the venture capitalists. They will \nget so much money they will not be able to count it. But it shouldn't \nbe done without the voice, without the consideration, and without the \ninterest of the State, let alone the many groups that oppose this \nproject and fear that it will undermine the safety, environment, and \neconomic interests of the region for years to come.\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska for his hard work on this bill and \nthis provision.\n  Let me ask the Senator--and I know the time is up--I understand if \nthis proposal were for an LNG facility in Nantucket Sound, the Governor \nof Massachusetts would have the same authority under the Deepwater Port \nAct that we're seeking here for this project. Am I correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is right.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We need LNG and we need more energy sources, but if they \nhad decided here to do an LNG on this site, the Governor would have a \nvoice in that, am I correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I believe the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So this idea about having a voice on this makes a good \ndeal of sense.\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes remains.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, if necessary, that \nI have a couple of additional minutes beyond that. I believe the other \nside was granted a little bit of extra time when they were addressing \nthis issue as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator will have an \nadditional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, last week the Robert Wood Johnson \nFoundation sponsored ``Cover the Uninsured'' week, a call for this \ncountry to wake up and address a huge and growing problem in our \nNation. In 2004, approximately 19.1 percent of nonelderly Americans did \nnot have health insurance. That number is growing.\n  Why do we have this problem in one of the wealthiest nations in the \nworld? It is because nearly one-half of the 45 million uninsured \nindividuals in the United States are either employees of small firms or \nfamily members of small business employees.\n  The primary reason cited by small businesses themselves for not \noffering health benefits is simply the high cost of health insurance. \nWe can do something about that beginning today. We\n\n[[Page S4188]]\n\nalso have this problem because Congress has repeatedly failed to do its \njob in the past. We can also do something about that, beginning today.\n  Today the Senate voted on a motion to proceed to S. 1955, which is a \nbipartisan bill addressing the issue of the working uninsured. This \nlegislation allows the creation of small business health plans to help \nlower the cost of health care for small business owners and their \nemployees.\n  Our colleagues on the other side have also offered some legislation \ntoday to address this issue. Senators Durbin and Lincoln have talked \nabout their particular proposal, which is a Government approach. In \nfact, they say it saves money, but it shifts the costs over to the \ntaxpayers, to the tune of $73 billion over a 10-year period. Why would \nwe ask for taxpayers to foot the bill before we have allowed the small \nbusinesses of this country to take advantage of a market-based approach \nand to use the market forces that exist out there in a way that would \ndrive health care costs down for them and their employees? It is very \nsimply a difference of philosophy.\n  Our philosophy--the approach contemplated under S. 1955--deals with a \nmarket-based solution to this issue. The proposal, S. 2510, by our \ncolleagues on the other side is a Federal Government solution to this \nissue, at a great cost, I might add, to the taxpayers of $73 billion \nover a 10-year period.\n  S. 1955, the Enzi bill, which, as I said earlier, we were able to \nmove to proceed to today, would lower the cost of care for employers \nand employees. In addition, the Congressional Budget Office estimates \nS. 1955 would reduce net Federal spending for Medicaid by about $790 \nmillion over the next 10 years. It would also save the States of this \ncountry about $600 million in the cost of Medicaid over a 10-year \nperiod. That is in addition, as I said, to the savings that would be \nachieved for small businesses.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has analyzed this particular piece of \nlegislation and concluded it would save somewhere between 2 and 3 \npercent for small firms in this country on the cost of their health \ninsurance. What is significant about this, as well, in contrast to the \nproposal by our colleagues on the other side, which would cost an \nadditional $73 billion over the course of the next 10 years, is the \nCongressional Budget Office said that the Enzi bill, S. 1955, would \nincrease tax revenues coming into the Government by $3.3 billion over \n10 years because lower spending on health insurance would increase the \nshare of employee compensation paid in taxable wages and salaries \nversus tax-excluded health benefits. In other words, lower spending on \nhealth insurance would translate into higher wages and salaries and \nactually would also generate more revenue for the Federal Government \nrather than less, which is what would happen under the proposal by the \nDemocrats, which would cost the taxpayers $73 billion, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, over a 10-year period.\n  So I believe it is important we move forward and we vote to send S. \n1955 out of the Senate to conference with the House. As a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives, I voted for the creation of small business \nhealth plans numerous times. In fact, that particular proposal has been \nvoted on no fewer than eight times in the House of Representatives.\n  Every time I voted when I was a Member of the House, and every time \nit has been passed by the House of Representatives, it has come to the \nSenate and has been unable to be voted on because it has been \nfilibustered, obstructed by the other side. I would say, that is in \nspite of the fact that if it were allowed an up-or-down vote in the \nSenate, I believe there would be a decisive bipartisan majority in \nfavor of this legislation.\n  Unfortunately, due to obstructionism, the Senate, until today, has \nnever voted on legislation creating small business health plans. As a \nCongressman and now Senator, I have listened to many accusations about \nthe harm that S. 1955 or similar legislation would do if it were \nenacted.\n  What harm would be caused by decreasing the cost of health care for \nsmall employers by 12 percent and increasing the coverage of the \nworking uninsured by 8 percent? Lower cost and more coverage for those \nwho are currently uninsured: That is not harm. That is exactly what we \nought to be accomplishing here by enacting legislation that would make \nhealth care coverage more affordable and more available to more \nAmericans.\n  South Dakota has an estimated 72,949 small businesses as of 2004, \nwhich is an increase of 2.4 percent from the previous year in 2003. \nSouth Dakota also had an estimated 90,000 uninsured individuals or 12 \npercent of our population in the year 2004. Fifty-two percent of South \nDakotans had employer-based health insurance, 8 percent below the \nnational average.\n  Small businesses are the backbone of South Dakota's, as well as our \nNation's, economy. It is time these businesses were placed on a level \nplaying field and allowed to pool together to purchase health \ninsurance, like large employers and unions.\n  I have heard from many provider groups in my State of South Dakota \nconcerned about coverage for their specific services. S. 1955 allows \nsmall business health plans to offer a basic benefit plan that would be \nexempt from State mandates as long as the small business health plan \nalso offers an enhanced benefits option that includes at least those \ncovered benefits and providers that are covered by a State employee \nhealth benefit plan in one of the five most populated States in this \ncountry.\n\n  According to the Council for Affordable Health Insurance, all of \nthese States--all of these States--require coverage for alcoholism, \nbreast reconstruction, diabetes self-management, diabetic supplies, \nemergency services, mammograms, mastectomy stays, maternity stays, \ngeneral mental health, chiropractors, optometrists, podiatrists, \npsychologists, and social workers.\n  Small business owners want to give their employees the best health \ncoverage possible under their budgets to recruit and retrain their \nworkforce. Facts suggest self-insured large company health plans, \ncurrently exempt from State mandates, generally cover services \nimportant to their employees.\n  This legislation would create new options for small businesses and \nthe potential for a choice in health plans for their employees. Today, \nonly 10 percent of firms with 50 or fewer employees offer their \nworkforce a choice of more than one health plan. Lowering the \nadministrative costs of health insurance plans will give small firms \nnew and better coverage choices for their workers.\n  Additionally, the GAO found that the added cost of mandates to a \ntypical plan is between 5 and 22 percent. CBO estimates that every 1-\npercent increase in insurance costs results in 200,000 to 300,000 more \nuninsured Americans. When the cost of health insurance goes up, \ncoverage and access go down.\n  The concept behind S. 1955 is very simple: to provide health \ninsurance to small businesses that is both affordable and accessible. \nSmall businesses not only in my State of South Dakota but across the \nNation have been fighting for the creation of small business health \nplans for over 10 years. It is high time that the obstruction end in \nthe Senate, that the Senate step aside and allow an up-and-down vote on \nthis very important legislation.\n  As I said before, it is legislation that, if you look at just the \nCongressional Budget Office findings, would cover nearly a million more \npeople, would allow three out of every four small business employees to \npay lower premiums than they currently pay under current law, and would \nsee small firms' premium costs decline by 2 to 3 percent. The average \ndecrease per firm would likely be greater, since the CBO estimate is a \ntotal that factors in the costs of other benefits added by firms in \nresponse to the reduction in premiums.\n  It would also allow annual spending on employer-sponsored health \ninsurance to be reduced by about $2 billion in a 5-year period. As I \nsaid earlier, it would increase Federal tax revenues by $3.3 billion \nover 10 years because lower spending on health insurance would increase \nthe share of employee compensation paid in taxable wages and salaries \nversus tax-excluded health benefits--more coverage; lower costs; more \nrevenue to the Federal Treasury, not less. The alternative offered by \nour colleagues on the other side, as I said earlier, comes at a high \ncost to the taxpayers: $73 billion over a 5-year period.\n\n[[Page S4189]]\n\n  We can do better. We can allow the market forces of this country to \nbe used. We can take a market-based approach to this issue and do \nsomething that has been done a long time ago, something that has, as I \nsaid, been voted on repeatedly in the House of Representatives, never \nto have been voted on here in the Senate, because it has been blocked.\n  It is high time for the small businesses of this country, for their \nemployees, for families who lack coverage today, to have another tool \nat their disposal, a tool that takes into account and takes full \nadvantage of market forces, by allowing small businesses to group \ntogether to leverage their size, to drive down the rates they pay for \nhealth insurance and, thereby, cover more of their employees.\n  That, again, is in stark contrast to the model and the proposal that \nis being offered by our colleagues on the other side, which consists of \na government-based solution, that comes at a very high cost to the \ntaxpayers, that calls for more bureaucracy and redtape, and does \nnothing in the end to bring down the cost of health care for small \nbusinesses in this country.\n  It is long overdue. I hope, as we have the chance to debate this now \nin the Senate, once that debate is concluded, we will be able to \nproceed to a vote because the one thing that has always been missed \nhere in the Senate, despite action on eight different occasions in the \nHouse, is an actual up-and-down vote in the Senate that would allow the \nSenate to speak on the issue of whether we want to do something \nmeaningful to reduce the cost of health care for small businesses in \nthis country, to provide more coverage for those who are currently \nuninsured, and also to do something that would reduce the cost to the \nGovernment, the cost of Medicaid, as well as the other costs that are \nassociated, as I said earlier, by increasing the amount that would come \ninto the Treasury.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 4:30 is controlled by the \nminority.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, here we are on day 2 of Health Week, and \nthere are still no plans to bring up H.R. 810, the stem cell research \nbill.\n  This bill was passed by the House of Representatives 351 days ago--\nalmost a year ago now--with still no action here in the Senate. Yet the \nmajority of Senators are for it. I do not understand how in the world \nwe can have a Health Week in the Senate and not vote on the American \npublic's No. 1 health research priority: lifting the President's \nrestriction on embryonic stem cell research.\n  That seems to be what we are doing. We are wasting our time on bills \nthat everyone knows are not going to pass. We are passing up a golden \nopportunity to promote one of the most promising areas of research in \nour lifetimes.\n  Most people by now have heard of the enormous potential of embryonic \nstem cells. These cells have the remarkable ability to turn into every \nother type of cell in the human body--brain cells that could replace \nthose lost in Parkinson's disease, islet cells to replace those lost in \ntype 1 diabetes, and on and on. Adult stem cells don't have that power, \nonly embryonic stem cells. That is why the world's best scientists \nthink embryonic stem cell research has so much promise to save lives \nand ease human suffering. It is also why they are so frustrated by the \nPresident's arbitrary restrictions on stem cell research.\n\n  Under the President's guidelines, Federal funding can be used for \nresearch only on those stem cell lines that were created before August \n9, 2001, at 9 p.m. Where did that date come from? Out of thin air? If \nthe stem cell lines were created at 8:30 p.m., they are fine, they are \nmoral, they are OK. If they were created at 9:30 p.m., all of a sudden \nthey missed the cutoff. It is totally arbitrary.\n  Shortly after the President announced his policy, he said 78 stem \ncell lines were eligible under his guidelines. It turns out that only \n22 are. In fact, it is even worse. Only a handful of those are even \nhealthy enough and readily available. More importantly, all of the 22 \nlines that are available have been contaminated by mouse cells. They \nhave been grown in a mouse feeder cell environment. It is unlikely they \nwill ever be used for any kind of human intervention, which is supposed \nto be the whole point of the research anyway.\n  Dozens more stem cell lines have been created since August 9, 2001. \nThey are healthier. Many have never been contaminated with mouse cells. \nBut thanks to President Bush, they are off limits to our best \nscientists.\n  Yet opponents of H.R. 810 sometimes argue that embryonic stem cell \nresearch has no potential. Last week, Senator Brownback presented a \nlist of diseases that are being treated with adult stem cells and asked \nwhy that hasn't happened yet with embryonic stem cells. Let me address \nthat directly. Scientists have been doing research on adult stem cells \nfor over 30 years. There are no arbitrary restrictions on research with \nadult stem cells. Scientists and private companies don't have to be \nskittish about doing this research. They don't have to worry that all \nof a sudden the Federal Government is going to ban it or limit it.\n  Let's compare that situation with human embryonic stem cells. \nScientists didn't even know how to derive them until 1998. The first \nFederal grant for these stem cells wasn't awarded until 2002. Even now, \nonly a tiny fraction of the total Federal budget for stem cell research \nis used for embryonic stem cells. The vast majority goes for adult stem \ncell research, and every scientist who enters this field is taking a \nrisk that Congress will pass a law to shut down the lab. They also risk \nthat they won't get any 1 of the 22 lines contaminated by mouse feeder \ncells which they will then not be able to use for human therapy. So it \nis no wonder that more diseases are being treated today with adult stem \ncells. Adult stem cell research had a 30-year head start. Meanwhile, \nscientists have been studying embryonic stem cells for just 5 years \nwith one arm tied behind their back.\n  The fact is, it doesn't matter what I think about the potential of \nembryonic stem cell research. It doesn't matter what Senator Brownback \nthinks either. What matters is what the scientists think. And I defy \nanyone to find a single reputable biomedical scientist whose doesn't \nbelieve we should pursue embryonic stem cell research.\n  I have a letter from Dr. J. Michael Bishop who won the Nobel Prize in \nmedicine in 1989. He writes:\n\n       The vast majority of the biomedical research community \n     believes that human embryonic stem cells are likely to be the \n     source of key discoveries related to many debilitating \n     diseases. . . . In fact, some of the strongest advocates for \n     human embryonic stem cell research are those scientists who \n     have devoted their careers to the study of adult stem cells.\n\n  A letter from Dr. Alfred G. Gilman, who won the Nobel Prize for \nmedicine in 1994:\n\n       It has become obvious, however, that the number of stem \n     cell lines actually available under current policy is too \n     small and is controlled by a limited monopoly, which has made \n     it significantly more difficult and expensive for research to \n     be conducted. These limits have hindered the important search \n     for new understanding and treatment of devastating diseases.\n\n  I have similar letters from Dr. Ferid Murad, who won the Nobel Prize \nfor medicine in 1998; Dr. Arthur Kornberg, who won the Nobel Prize in \nmedicine in 1959; and dozens more of our Nation's top researchers--all \nof whom believe in the potential of embryonic stem cell research. I ask \nmy friend from Kansas, in response to his speech of late last week: Are \nthere any Nobel Prize winners in medicine who oppose embryonic stem \ncell research? Name one.\n  In fact, I challenge him further: Are there any reputable biomedical \nresearchers at all who think we should be studying adult stem cells \nonly and not embryonic stem cells? Name one.\n  I don't think he will find one. Every scientist I have spoken to says \nstem cell research should not be an either/or endeavor. We should not \nbe talking about stem cell research or embryonic stem cell research. We \nshould study both. We should open all doors in the pursuit of therapies \nthat can save lives and ease human suffering. The breakthroughs are \ncoming, but they take time. To clamp down on embryonic stem cell \nresearch before it even has a chance to start shows a total lack of \nunderstanding about how science\n\n[[Page S4190]]\n\nworks. More importantly, it denies hope to millions of Americans who \nsuffer from Parkinson's, ALS, juvenile diabetes, spinal cord injuries, \nand dozens of other terrible diseases and conditions.\n\n  We are rapidly approaching the 1-year anniversary of the vote in the \nHouse on H.R. 810. It has been 351 days since the House passed it on a \nstrong bipartisan vote. If the Senate were allowed to vote on H.R. 810, \nwe would win here, too. We have the votes. We would pass this bill and \nsend it on to the President. Regrettably, however, the Republican \nleadership has not let that happen. So here we are, we are going \nthrough this farce--it is farcical--comedy, gimmickry of a so-called \nHealth Week without taking up the American public's No. 1 health \nresearch priority.\n  It is Tuesday. Health Week lasts for 3 more days. We could pass H.R. \n810 in a matter of hours. I urge the majority leader, take up the bill. \nLet the Senate have a quantified amount of time to debate it. We will \npass it, and we will give millions of Americans who are suffering from \ndiseases the hope they deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I say to my \ncolleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, how much I appreciate his \nleadership in the area of health care. His analysis of where we stand \non the stem cell issue is so appropriate, and he is so right. Here we \nhave a whole area of scientific research that is waiting to take off. \nWe have States, such as mine and others, that are taking the lead \ninstead of following the lead of the Federal Government.\n  I say to my friend, does he ever remember a time in history when this \ncountry was plagued by disease that the Federal Government didn't step \nto the plate, whether there was a Republican President or a Democratic \nPresident? Isn't it shocking that as we face these epidemics of \nAlzheimer's and Parkinson's and cancer and heart disease and all the \nothers my friend mentioned, isn't it amazing--I am sure it is to him as \nwell as to me--that we have a lack of leadership in Washington?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to the Senator from California, it is not just \namazing, it is shameful. It is shameful what is happening now with the \nlack of support for biomedical research, especially embryonic stem cell \nresearch. As I said, every Nobel Prize winner in medicine, all the \nreputable scientists say we should be on it and we should be on it \nstrongly. Yet the President, through this arbitrary cutoff, is denying \nthis for scientists, denying it to people who are suffering. I say to \nmy friend from California, God bless California. They took the lead out \nthere. Her State has taken the lead. They are forging ahead. Other \nStates are following their lead. If only we could get the Federal \nGovernment to follow their lead.\n  Mrs. BOXER. As my friend pointed out in his statement, we have the \nvotes for stem cell research, even with the President's opposition. If \nwe asked for a show of hands in any roomful of people: Have you been \ntouched by cancer, have you not personally or someone you know been \ntouched by heart disease, by stroke, by Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, \nparalysis, all these things, we know how many hands would go up.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Juvenile diabetes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is clearly one. And I have met with juvenile \ndiabetics. I have met with the children, the parents and the families. \nThey are counting on us. Here we are in Health Week, as my friend \npoints out. We have the votes. Yet what do they bring up? A bill that \nis actually going to take away health care from people, the Enzi bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Exactly. I appreciate my colleague from California. She \nis right on target. I know my friend from California, the distinguished \nSenator, has been in the forefront of fighting for the things that will \nhelp people have better lives, especially in health care, and to ease \nthe pain and suffering of people, especially juvenile diabetics.\n  As the Senator knows, the families tell us that perhaps one of the \nfirst therapies that could come from embryonic stem cell research would \nbe for these kids suffering from juvenile diabetes. What a great day \nthat would be.\n  I thank the Senator for her comments and strong leadership in all the \nareas of health care, and I thank California, through her, for the \nleadership they have shown.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am very proud of my State.\n  In my State the gentleman who took the lead in putting the stem cell \nresearch initiative on the ballot has a child with juvenile diabetes. \nWatching that child suffer and struggle motivated him. He ignited this \nwonderful movement in our State. Shockingly, here we are in Health Week \nand this thing is nowhere to be seen. It is another example of why we \nneed change around this place. I thank my friend.\n  This Health Week Republican style is really fascinating when you look \nat the bills that have come before us. The first two bills would have \nhurt patients who were injured by malpractice, patients who might have \nbeen made infertile or harmed in many ways. Those two bills took away \nthe rights of patients.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent to speak another 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent to suggest a quorum call.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent agreement, we \nare alternating every 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the precedents of the Senate, the \nSenator must control at least 10 minutes in order to suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that at 5 o'clock I be given the \nfloor for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the Senator's \nside controls the time at that time. So if they want to give the \nSenator the 10 minutes, there would be no objection to that. It would \ncome out of the Democratic time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, first, I apologize for the confusion over \nthe unanimous consent that we had. It was designed early this morning \nto make sure each side had an opportunity to have an equal amount of \nsay on the 30 hours that we are working on in order to actually get to \namendments on this bill. Now that we have had cloture and everybody has \nagreed, or almost everybody, that we needed to proceed on the bill, we \nare talking about an issue that is huge to small businesses out there \nand wanting to find some kind of solution. We even suggested that \nperhaps they would like to reduce the number of hours of debate about \nthe right to proceed so that we could actually get to offering \namendments. But we have a 30-hour time requirement. That could be \nreduced by unanimous consent, or even eliminated by unanimous consent. \nBut it has not been, so we will try to keep on a half-hour rotating \nbasis so that as many people as possible can have something to say on \nthe bill.\n  I am going to take a few minutes at this point to talk about this \nissue. We have been talking about health care. One advantage of having \nthis 30 hours is to have some additional health care debate. I need to \ntalk a little bit about prescription drugs Part D. That is not part of \nthe motion to proceed, but it has been talked about a number of times \non the Senate floor today. There are some confusing things out there \nfor seniors that I would like to clear up.\n  I have been taking the last two recesses to travel across Wyoming and \nhold meetings with senior citizens to explain the prescription drug \nplan to get them signed up so they can get the benefit. There is some \nconfusion out there. When we were designing the plan, we were worried \nthat there would not be any plan interested in our small population in \nWyoming. We have less than 500,000 people in our State. Our biggest \ncity has 52,000 people. So we have a little bit of trouble finding a \nbig enough pool for anything and to encourage interest. So I asked that \nthere be kind of a Federal backup plan on it, and that was put in the \nbill.\n  But when the time came around for companies to offer plans in \nWyoming, obviously, they were even excited about 500,000 people because \nwe had 41\n\n[[Page S4191]]\n\nplans respond. That is competition. That competition brought the prices \ndown by 25 percent before the people even applied for the benefit. A \nhuge decrease in cost; that is cost by competition. The downside is \nthat 41 plans create confusion. If you have ever tried to buy insurance \nand talk to a number of different insurance salesmen, every package is \ndesigned slightly different to make it a little bit more confusing so \nthat their plan looks better, but it is also harder for you to make \ncomparisons.\n  There is an easy way to make comparisons. Medicare saw that coming \nand set up a computer analyzation so that all you have to know is what \nyour prescriptions are and what the doses are. You can put them in over \nthe Internet or you can talk to somebody live by an 800 number or there \nare a lot of volunteers across America who are helping to get this \ninformation out. It lets Medicare do the math. They will present you \nwith three or four plans that meet your prescription, your doses, and \nyour criteria for where you want to buy it. You can look at these line \nby line. All the lines match up and you can compare them and find the \nbest one for you. It has been a tremendous help.\n  My mother asked me to help her on her decision. There are kids across \nthe United States--kids like me--who need to be helping their moms on \nthese kinds of decisions. I was happy to do it because it gave me an \nopportunity to try out the telephone method, the Internet method, and I \ntalked to a number of volunteers and the local pharmacist. We owe the \nlocal pharmacist a great deal of thanks for the way this is working and \nthe difficulties that they have had doing a new program. We have not \nhad a big change in the program in decades. When we first had Medicare, \nthere were problems. They got worked out. When we started this one, \nthere were problems, and I think they have mostly been worked out.\n  Occasionally, at these hearings, somebody was having a problem. A \nhour and a half was the longest it took us to straighten out any \nproblem for anybody. I ran this process and came up with these four \nbest at the least cost for my mom.\n  One of the things that people raise in those sections is they say: I \ndon't need any drugs so I should not have to do this. I should not have \nto pay a penalty later.\n  The way insurance works is that you buy into the plan usually before \nyou get sick. You pay a premium and when you get sick, then you have \nthe coverage for the things that can happen to you in the future.\n  Medicare prescription Part D is completely different because you can \nalready have a huge medical problem and a lot of prescriptions and you \ncan sign up for this now and have a maximum guaranteed cost. I know of \npeople who are actually saving thousands of dollars because they signed \nup. If you don't have anything the matter with you and you don't want \nto buy into a big plan, you run the evaluation and you can find a small \nplan you can buy into.\n\n  One in Wyoming is $1.87 a month. What if the $1.87 a month doesn't \ncover me if I have something really bad happen to me? Well, every \nNovember 15 to December 31 you can change your mind. You can change \nyour company, and they cannot stop you. Tell me where else insurance \nworks like that. Every November 15 to December 31, you can change your \nmind and sign up for a plan that has new kinds of benefits for you that \nmatch new illnesses that you might have.\n  This is working for the people who have paid attention. It is easy to \nhave Medicare do the math. So everybody out there who hasn't signed up \nneeds to talk to the volunteers, probably at their senior citizen \ncenter or call the 1-800 number or get on the Medicare Internet site \nand have that plan figured out for you. It takes a few minutes and you \ncan be set so that you, first of all, won't have any penalties, but, \nsecondly, you will have some tremendous benefits as you need the \nmedication. It has made a huge difference.\n  Some people have talked about negotiating the price. When I was doing \nthese hearings, I had some difficulty with people who showed up and \nsaid: You know, there are some medications I really want to have, that \nI am supposed to have, and I cannot get them. Well, when I checked, \nthose were the veterans, and the veterans' prices are negotiated, and \nwhen they negotiate prices, they pick a similar drug and get the best \nprice by kind of fixing the price on it and driving the price down \nthrough this bidding war. But it eliminates medications. Yes, there are \nmedications you can take. It may not be the medication your doctor \nthinks is absolutely the best. But that is what happens with negotiated \nprices.\n  So what we relied on in the Medicare prescription Part D was \ncompetition, and competition has happened. Prices came down 25 percent, \nand then people who signed up for the program who are using medications \nfound out that they are also saving another 25 percent as the least \namount, or 37 percent as the average amount, and some people are \ngetting 83 percent--I say some people. I know some people who are \ngetting several thousand times more than what they are paying in \nbecause they are into the catastrophic care. I wasn't even listing the \ncatastrophic care.\n  The important thing is that we need to tell people and help people to \nsign up by May 15. It is a tremendous benefit. We have had more people \nsign up than we had anticipated signing up. That means, again, a bigger \nmarket; that means lower costs. So it works for all of us when people \nsign up. Remember, there are plans out there. If they have them for \n$1.87 a month in Wyoming, I bet they have that at $1.87 or less every \nplace in the country. Look at those if you are not using any \nmedication.\n  So that is what competition does. That is the purpose of the bill \nthat we are talking about and that we have actually had the motion to \nproceed on, not the ones that fall under other committees' \njurisdictions, such as Medicare or stem cells or some of the other \nthings that have been talked about here. Those are things that \nactually--this falls under the jurisdiction of the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee. We took the bill through committee that \nhas never been through the Senate before. The House passed a bill that \nis considerably more liberal and difficult than the one that we passed. \nThey passed it eight times over there in a very bipartisan way. If we \nhave the same Democratic Senators over here vote for it that had \nDemocrats in the House vote for it, we will pass this bill easily. Even \nif there is a filibuster, we will pass it because it is a concept that \nsmall businesses have been asking for. This is the first opportunity we \nhave had to provide it for them.\n  We did it by being very conservative in the approach and going to a \nsituation where we could work across State borders, so that \nassociations could build a big enough pool that they could effectively \nwork with their insurance companies to get these multiple competition \nbids. We are certain that it will work. One of the reasons we are \ncertain that it will work is because it has been tried within States. \nBut those who have tried it within States have found that it works very \nwell, and they know it would work even better if they could go across \nState borders. So even those who are doing it are asking to do it on a \nwider scale than what they have been. For a lot of the States that have \nless population, yes, they want to be able to do it at all. They don't \nhave big enough pools within their States to do it, so they want to be \nable to go across the State borders.\n  I want to discuss a little bit why we need to pass S. 1955 and allow \nfor the creation of these small business health plans. First of all, \nthe concept of allowing small businesses to join together to find \nbetter prices for health insurance is not new, as I mentioned. Many \norganizations have offered nationwide health plans to members in the \npast. But States continued to add mandated benefits and other \nregulations to their insurance markets during the 1980s and 1990s, and \nthe administrative hassles and costs associated with the mandates and \nregulations became too much of a burden for existing plans that could \nno longer offer an affordable benefit on a national basis. So they \ndiscontinued the plans.\n  The Associated Builders and Contractors organization, known as ABC, \nis an unfortunate example of this problem. Their insurance carrier \nrefused to continue doing business with the ABC insurance trust in the \nlate 1990s because\n\n[[Page S4192]]\n\nthe panoply of 50 different State regulations and excessive benefit \nmandates made it impractical and unattractive for the insurance company \nto continue the program. ABC was unable to find another carrier to pick \nup their business.\n  This chart kind of shows how health care costs have gone. I don't \nthink there is any argument on either side of the aisle that this is \nwhat has happened. There has been a rapid escalation, and compared to \nwhat it used to be, there has been a rapid escalation for a long time, \noddly enough. We are up to a national average cost per employee of \nabout $8,000 a year. That doesn't include the part the individuals are \npaying, which brings it up to about $11,000 a year. That is the amount \nwe have been talking about on both sides of the aisle today.\n  What is truly unfortunate is that workers at ABC's member companies \nwere benefiting from this program, and the companies were saving money \non their health care expenses. The health plan sponsored by ABC for \nnearly 45 years had total administrative expenses of about 13 cents for \nevery dollar in premium. These costs included all marketing \nadministration, insurance company risk, claim payment expenses, and \nState premium taxes. Compare this to the small business employers who \npurchase coverage directly from an insurance company. The total \nexpenses for most small businesses today can approach 35 cents for \nevery dollar of premium. So saving nearly 25 cents on a dollar is real \nmoney, especially in today's health insurance prices.\n  The other benefit to ABC's member companies and employees is that any \nprofit generated by their health plan stays in the plan. This also \nhelped keep costs down. So the idea isn't new, and it has worked \nbefore.\n\n  But Congress needs to act before small business organizations can \nresurrect their defunct programs and before other organizations can \nstart new ones. Congress considered fixing this problem during debate \nover the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in 1996--\nit is better known as HIPAA--but the small business affordability \nprovisions in the House bill were dropped during the conference between \nthe House and the Senate in the final bill. As a result, HIPAA only \naddressed access to health insurance and not affordability. So now \neveryone has access to health insurance policies, but the policies \nthemselves are unaffordable to many. When I became chairman of the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions last year, I \nannounced that I would bring a health insurance affordability bill \nbefore the committee so we could finish the job we started 10 years \nago--in other words, to make it possible for all Americans to have \naccess to a health insurance policy that is affordable.\n  Many were skeptical then, and some may still be skeptical now, but \nthe time for more of the same is over. America's working families want \nchange, and they are tired of excuses from Congress.\n  Small businesses and working families are demanding relief from high \nhealth insurance costs. And it is no wonder. This year, employers are \npaying twice what they were paying in the year 2000 for health \ninsurance. That is correct. What businesses paid for health insurance \nhas doubled over the past 6 years. That is a pace we can't keep up.\n  This cost squeeze hurts small businesses the most. The highest rates \nof uninsured workers can be found in businesses with 25 or fewer \nworkers. Only 60 percent of the Nation's businesses are offering health \ninsurance these days, down from nearly 75 percent just 5 years ago.\n  Small businesses and working families are stuck on the escalator of \nrising health insurance costs, with no end in sight. And in a tight \nlabor market, small business owners don't want to jump off this fast-\nmoving escalator because dropping health insurance puts them at a major \ndisadvantage in competing for the best workers. We need to give them a \nsafe place to get off this escalator of rising costs, somewhere where \nit is more affordable for themselves and working families, and the \nsmall business health plan will give them that option.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, the chairman has brought a carefully crafted \npiece of legislation to the Senate floor, one that took a tremendous \namount of skill to negotiate and one that has incredible support--more \nsupport when the bill passed out of committee than it does today. Why? \nBecause people now fear it might become law. People fear this might \npass, and they never believed it would. What does it do? It brings \nadditional competition to the marketplace, but more importantly, it \nbrings health care coverage to Americans who have no coverage today.\n  Why are we here today, on Tuesday afternoon at almost 5 o'clock? \nBecause the Senate is in a 30-hour debate about whether we are going to \nbe willing or able to proceed. We are not even on the bill yet; we are \nin a procedural mode which requires us to have a vote to proceed to \nconsider whether we are going to have a debate on this bill, S. 1955, a \nbill that changes the choices of the uninsured population in America.\n  The choices they have today are nothing and nothing. Under any \nscenario, you would have unanimous support to change that. But there \nare actually people who are against that up here, but not across the \ncountry. As a matter of fact, in this poll done by Public Opinion \nStrategies in March of this year, over 80 percent of the people polled \noverwhelmingly support small business health plans; in other words, \nthey support this legislation--the effort to bring new choices of \nproducts that are affordable to small businesses, to employers, and, \nmore importantly, to the employees they hire.\n  In North Carolina, we have 671,000 small businesses. Ninety-eight \npercent of firms with employees are small businesses in North Carolina. \nDon't let anybody come to the floor and tell you that this bill does \nnot have an effect except on a select group of people. It may be a \nselect group of people, but it is 98 percent of the employers of North \nCarolina. Women-owned small businesses have increased 24 percent in \nNorth Carolina since 1997, Hispanic-owned small businesses have \nincreased 24 percent since the same date, Black-owned small businesses \nhave increased 31 percent since 1997, and Asian-owned small businesses \nhave increased 74 percent since 1997. These are companies which benefit \nfrom this legislation. These are companies which today can't afford the \npremium costs of health insurance; therefore, their employee base goes \nwithout. They are in that category of uninsured that so many people \ncome and talk about on this floor, but they talk about uninsured \nwithout the solution as to how to cover them.\n  This is a population which in some cases today is on Medicaid. They \nwork full-time. Their income level qualifies them for Medicaid. And \nwhat would be the incentive for them to get off of Medicaid? It would \nbe if their employer has the option to offer them health care the way \nthe majority of America is now provided health care: through their \nemployer. But we are here in 30 hours of debate trying to decide \nwhether we are going to allow Members to come to the floor and debate a \nbill and offer amendments which will allow us to switch from nothing \nand nothing to nothing and something, which will allow us to inject \nsomething, some ray of hope into the millions of Americans who don't \nhave coverage today.\n  Let me read a few letters. I think it is always helpful to hear from \npeople whom this affects, the human face behind the issues that \nsometimes we lose on this floor simply because we don't want to talk \nabout names or pictures.\n  This is a woman from Sunbury, NC. She wrote me in mid-April of this \nyear. I am just going to read some pieces. She says:\n\n       Support SBHP legislation, S. 1955. I feel that this is very \n     important because I haven't had health insurance in many \n     years, because my employer doesn't have access to affordable \n     insurance to offer us.\n\n  Some suggest on this Senate floor that is not the case, that \neverybody has the opportunity to have health insurance. ``I haven't had \nhealth insurance in many years.'' Why? ``Because my employer can't \nafford what is available.''\n  Another letter received in April of this year from a young lady in \nElizabeth City, NC:\n\n       Please support Senate bill 1955, the Health Insurance \n     Marketplace Modernization and\n\n[[Page S4193]]\n\n     Affordability Act. My employer cannot afford health insurance \n     for their employees. My husband works for Ford. They are \n     closing his plant soon. We will have no insurance unless my \n     employer offers it. I have premature twins. They were born 3 \n     months early. It costs me $2,000 a month to feed them. That \n     does not include any doctor's appointments we have to go to. \n     I feel that this is a great bill.\n\n  What is America looking for? They are looking for hope. They are \nlooking for us to produce a product out of this institution that \nactually fulfills their needs. I don't know how it can be any clearer.\n\n       It is not offered to me today, because my employer can't \n     afford the options that are in our marketplace.\n\n  What do we do? We create new options that are affordable. That is, in \nfact, what the chairman is trying to do with this bill.\n  Here is a third letter, also from Elizabeth City but a different \nbusiness. It says:\n\n       Small businesses need help with insurance--\n\n  In big bold letters--\n\n       I am now paying $986 per month for my wife and myself. This \n     is for only 60 percent coverage and a $2,500 deductible. I \n     know people with group insurance who are paying $600 a month \n     for 80 percent coverage and a $250 deductible. Many of those \n     have dental insurance as well. My policy provides none. \n     Please vote for this bill. Allow small businesses to have \n     coverage equal to employers of other companies.\n\n  That is all we are doing. We are using the scale of what people who \nhave a tremendous amount of employees can do, and that is they can go \nto insurance carriers and they can negotiate for products based upon \nthe volume of their employees. But how does a small business owner do \nthat when he has five or six or seven employees? Well, it is real \nsimple. We allow them to band together. We allow them to band together \ninto a common association, and we allow that association to then market \ntheir entire association based upon the volume.\n  Another letter that I received on April 6 says:\n\n       As a small business owner, it is important to enable some \n     economy of scale in allowing franchises to obtain more \n     affordable health care coverage.\n\n  The last one I am going to read is quite unique.\n\n       As a professional photographer, I have seen firsthand the \n     difficulty that my fellow professional photographers face \n     when attempting to purchase health insurance on their own. S. \n     1955 would allow photographers and other independent business \n     owners to band together across State lines and purchase \n     health insurance. Having this as an option and choice will \n     improve our access to quality health care and help control \n     costs through competition.\n\n  These letters are from people on the front lines. They are from \nemployees whose employers can't offer coverage today because it is not \naffordable. They are from individuals who own businesses and would like \nto offer coverage to their employees. They are even from photographers, \npeople whose lives are in their hands every day in a camera, but they \ncannot afford the individual costs of health insurance in today's \nmarketplace.\n  In North Carolina, we have 1.3 million uninsured North Carolinians. \nOf that 1.3 million, almost 900,000 uninsured individuals are in \nfamilies or are on their own where one person at least works full-time. \nWith the passage of this bill, 900,000 of the 1.3 million uninsured in \nNorth Carolina could potentially be offered health insurance. We can \nnarrow it down from 1.3 million to 400,000 individuals who are \nuninsured in North Carolina with the passage of one simple bill, or at \nleast they would have the option to be able to purchase it for once. \nNinety-one percent of workers in large firms of 1,000 employees or more \nhave health insurance, yet 66 percent of workers in small businesses \ndefined as 10 employees or fewer have health insurance. Well, if you \nremember the North Carolina numbers, I said 98 percent of firms with \nemployees were small businesses. Think of the millions of Americans who \nare going to be touched by the passage of this one piece of legislation \nthat provides them choice. Where today their choice is between nothing \nand nothing, tomorrow their choice is between nothing and something.\n  Why are we here? We are here for 30 hours of debate--not debate on \nthe bill, not debate about the amendments, debate about whether we are \ngoing to move forward. We do that at a time when--I just went back and \ndid a quick calculation on the back of my calendar--we have 76 \nlegislative days left between now and adjournment. That is assuming we \nhave productive days on Fridays and Mondays, and as the chairman knows, \nFridays and Mondays are not always productive in the Halls of Congress. \nPeople are either slow to get here or quick to leave. If you take out \nFridays and Mondays, we are down to 45 days. But we are going to spend \n30 hours trying to decide whether we are going to move forward to \ndebate this bill, and we will spend another 30 hours after we file \ncloture on the bill to get to a point where we can have an up-or-down \nvote, if, in fact, we get that far.\n  Last night, we voted on two medical liability bills--medical \nliability that covers the entire medical professional world--and last \nnight, we were denied the ability to proceed and to debate the \nlegislation, much less amend it. The second bill is legislation in \nwhich--and I think the American people would be shocked at this--we \nwere denied the ability to move forward to debate or amend legislation \nthat limited the liability to OB/GYNs in America, a specialty we are \nlosing specialists out of every day, where every year people aren't \ncontinuing to practice. But we will spend 30 hours debating whether we \nproceed to debate not necessarily the merits of the bill--and my hope \nis that the chairman will be successful, and I will be beside him \narguing every step of the way, because without this, these Americans \ndon't have hope of a choice of anything other than nothing and nothing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, my understanding is that Senator Dorgan \nhad time at 5 o'clock set aside, so if he wishes to take it now, then I \nwill wait until his conclusion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of Senator Dorgan's \nremarks I be permitted to speak at that time. Since it is controlled by \nthe Democrats, I can make that request by myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota will be \nrecognized, and at such time as he completes his statement, the Senator \nfrom California will be recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. That is assuming it comes within the 30-minute parameters?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have listened to some of the debate \ntoday. It has been very interesting. The last speaker spoke about \nchoice and choices. I want to talk about choices in health care a bit. \nThis is Health Week, we are told. It is an opportunity, for a change, \nat long last to talk about some health care issues on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  The intent, I believe, of the chairman who brings this bill to the \nfloor is that we should speak only about and address only the issues \ndealing with small business health plans. However, he knows and I know \nthere are many other health issues that have been long delayed by this \nChamber and that need to be debated. I intend to offer a number of \namendments. They are in order under the rules of the Senate. They are \namendments that deal explicitly with health care issues.\n  The issue before the Senate is not unimportant. The question of \nrising health care costs is very significant to everybody--individuals, \nbusinesses, governments. Everyone who is a consumer has to deal with \nincreased costs of health care and we should, indeed, address the issue \nof health care costs for business associations and for small \nbusinesses. There is no question about that. I wish to be a part of the \ngroup that works on that in a bipartisan way, in a way that expands \nopportunity, not narrows opportunity; in a way that expands coverage, \nnot narrows coverage; in a way that covers everyone, not just a few. I \ndo not agree that we should make health care unaffordable for the older \nand sicker and then make profit out of insuring people who are younger \nand healthier. That is not the right way to do this.\n  But having said all of that, let me describe some other things that \nhave been long delayed on the floor of the Senate that need to be \naddressed. Let me talk about the first one. It is the\n\n[[Page S4194]]\n\nissue of reimportation of prescription drugs. A bipartisan piece of \nlegislation has been long ago introduced and discussed here on the \nfloor of the Senate, and we have not had the opportunity to vote on it.\n  The reimportation of prescription drugs, why is that important? \nBecause the American people are charged the highest prices in the world \nfor prescription drugs; it is not even close--the highest prices in the \nworld. Consumers in every other country are paying lower prices. Try to \nbuy Lipitor and if you buy it in the United States you pay a higher \nprice than in any country in the world--France, Germany, England, you \nname it. You pay the highest prices in the United States. Why should \nU.S. consumers be charged the highest prices?\n  With consent, I want to show a couple of things on the floor of the \nSenate. Let me show, if I might, two bottles of Lipitor. I ask consent \nto show these on the floor of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. As you can see, they look identical: identical labels, \nidentical pills in the same bottle made by the same company--shipped to \ntwo different places. One is shipped to Canada and one is shipped to \nthe United States. The difference? One is half the price of the other. \nGuess which. It is the Canadian consumer who gets the benefit of paying \nhalf the price for the identical prescription drug.\n  Let me also show a couple of containers of Prevacid. This is a drug \nthat is widely used for ulcers. Once again, as you can see, it is \nessentially the same bottle, same pill, made by the same company, made \nin an FDA-approved plant and shipped to two different locations, one to \nCanada and one to the United States. The difference? This one costs \ntwice as much. Who buys this one? The U.S. consumer; twice as much for \nthe same pill.\n  An old fellow sitting on a hay bale in North Dakota at a farm meeting \nsaid, my wife has been fighting breast cancer for 3 years. She took \nTamoxifen for breast cancer. Every 3 months we drove to Canada to get \nTamoxifen because it was the only way we could afford it, and we paid \nabout 80 percent less than it would have cost us to buy that \nprescription drug to treat her breast cancer. We paid 80 percent less \nby driving to Canada to get it.\n\n  The fact is, they allow a small amount of drugs to come across the \nborder for personal use. But other than that, a U.S. consumer cannot \naccess an FDA-approved prescription drug nor can a U.S. pharmacist \naccess that same FDA-approved prescription drug. That is unbelievable. \nWe have a bipartisan group of Members of the Senate who say consumers \nought to be able to purchase FDA prescription drugs by reimporting them \nfrom other countries. That would put downward pressure on prescription \ndrug prices in this country. A bipartisan group of Senators wants to do \nthat, but we are prevented from doing it by current law. We want to \nchange the law.\n  Yet we are prevented from changing the law because the majority \nleader won't bring this legislation to the floor of the Senate. This is \nsomething we can offer as an amendment to the bill on the floor. It is \nwell within the rules of the Senate, it deals with health care, and I \nam serving notice now that this is an amendment we will offer and vote \non during the conduct of this discussion, providing we are allowed to \noffer amendments. I am hearing rumors that perhaps the majority leader \nwill decide to fill the tree legislatively and allow no amendments. If \nthat is the case, it will be a long week, but my hope is he will not do \nthat. If amendments are allowed, I will offer this amendment and will \nget a vote.\n  Let me go back to about midnight on the night of March 11, 2004. That \nis a little over 2 years ago--midnight. The reason I remember it was \nmidnight, I was sitting right back here and I reached an agreement with \nthe majority leader, Senator Frist. Here is what Senator Frist \nannounced that evening after our negotiations, and after which I agreed \nto release the name of Dr. Mark McClellan to be promoted from the head \nof FDA to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. As a result \nof that, Senator Frist came to the floor and put this in the Record.\n\n       I announce for the information of my colleagues that, with \n     consultation with the chairman of the Senate Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, Pensions, Senator Dorgan, Senator \n     Stabenow, Senator McCain, Senator Cochran, and other \n     interested Senators, the Senate will begin a process for \n     developing proposals that would allow for the safe \n     reimportation of FDA-approved prescription drugs.\n\n  Two years later, nothing: No vote on the floor of the Senate, \nnothing. My colleague, Senator Vitter, sent a letter around a year ago. \nIt says:\n\n        . . . in the context of the Lester Crawford FDA \n     nomination, I obtained an agreement with Majority Leader \n     Frist regarding drug importation legislation. . . .The Senate \n     will probably hold some floor vote on a reimportation \n     amendment soon, probably on the Agriculture Appropriations \n     bill. Should that vote demonstrate that reimportation has 60-\n     vote support on the floor, then Leader Frist will be open to \n     and work in good faith toward a floor debate and vote on a \n     reimportation bill. . . .\n\n  What happened as a result of that? Nothing. No action, no votes, \nnothing.\n  This bill on the floor of the Senate is amendable. This bipartisan \namendment deals with health care. It has been long delayed--and no \nmore. I intend to offer this amendment this week.\n  Finally, at long last, perhaps the American consumers will no longer \nbe charged the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs \nbecause they will be able to access FDA-approved drugs by reimporting \nthem from virtually any other country in which the consumers are paying \na lesser price for the identical prescription drug. That is unfair to \nthe American people. The only reason we have not changed it yet is \nthere are, regrettably, a few people in this Chamber who have blocked \nthat opportunity, I assume on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry. \nBut that blocking is about done. This week this bill is open for \namendment. I intend to come and offer this as an amendment.\n  That is one.\n  Let me talk for a moment about another issue, once again long \npromised here to the Senate. We are told we are going to have an \nopportunity to do this--again and again and again--and we are not. We \ndon't get the opportunity. It is called stem cell research. It is \ncontroversial; there is no question about that. I understand the \ncontroversy. But is it important? Yes, it is. We have all these people \nwho talk about life. This is about life. This is about life-giving \nmedical research, to find ways to unlock the mysteries and to cure some \nof the worst diseases known to people: Alzheimer's, diabetes, cancer, \nheart disease, Parkinson's. There is an unbelievable opportunity for \nmedical research to unlock the cures for some of these diseases. But we \nneed to proceed with stem cell research.\n  We have been long promised the opportunity to have a vote on stem \ncell research on the floor of the Senate, and guess what. No such vote. \nOn May 24, almost 1 year ago, the House of Representatives passed a \nbill on stem cell research. We are still waiting to have a vote on that \nhere on the floor of the Senate--once again, a bill with bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Let me describe, if I might, the importance of this in the eyes of a \nyoung woman. I met with this young girl about 2 weeks ago. It is not \nthe first time I met her. She is a young lady, Camille Johnson, 13 \nyears old, diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 4. She is the one in \nthe middle, playing the clarinet. She has had some very serious health \nproblems, some very serious problems in her young life. She would like \nvery much to live her life without diabetes. She would like diabetes to \nbe cured for her and millions of others.\n  In 2002, scientists at Stanford University used special chemicals to \nwhat is called transform undifferentiated embryonic stem cells of mice \ninto cell masses that resemble islets found in the mouse pancreas. When \nthis tissue is transplanted into the diabetic mice, it produces insulin \nin response to high glucose levels in animals. Wouldn't it be wonderful \nif, through this stem cell research, we cure diabetes; if we could tell \nthis young woman your life is not going to be a life of diabetes. We \ncan cure that disease.\n\n  I have been involved in political campaigns recently and have been \ntold by opponents that my proposal and my position on stem cell \nresearch is one that\n\n[[Page S4195]]\n\nmurders embryos. Nothing could be further from the truth, nothing at \nall. Do you know there are 1 million people living among us, walking, \nbreathing, talking--1 million people who were conceived through in \nvitro fertilization? One million people. When that in vitro \nfertilization takes place, the uniting of a sperm and an egg in a petri \ndish, more than a single embryo is created. A number of embryos are \ncreated in that process. Some are implanted into the uterus of a woman \nand some become a human being. Some are cryogenically frozen and stored \nin the event they should be used again if this did not result in a \npregnancy.\n  There are some 400,000 of those embryos frozen at in vitro clinics \nright now, 400,000 of them, and 8,000 to 11,000 are discarded, thrown \naway, every year. They become hospital waste.\n  Should some perhaps be used for stem cell research with the hope of \nsaving lives? The answer clearly is yes. This is not about murdering an \nembryo. If in fact this is the murder of an embryo, then the discarding \nof the embryos at the in vitro fertilization clinic, 8,000 to 11,000 a \nyear, is also murder.\n  We had one person testify at the Commerce Committee a couple of years \nago who said those 1 million people who are here as a result of in \nvitro fertilization should not be here; it was wrong to create these \npeople. Tell that to the parents who had those children; the childless \nparents who, through in vitro fertilization, discovered the miracle of \nhaving a child.\n  The question of stem cell research is not about murdering an embryo, \nit is about an opportunity to cure some of the dreaded diseases.\n  The other issue--and the reason I am talking about this is this is a \nbig issue that we are not allowed to vote on in the Senate. This, too, \nshould be an amendment on this bill. This, too, during Health Week is a \nvery important issue dealing with health.\n  The other side of this research is something called somatic cell \nnuclear transfer. Simply it is this: Let us assume a patient takes a \nskin cell from their own earlobe and that skin cell from their earlobe \nis then put in an evacuated egg and stimulated to become a blastocyst \nof a couple of hundred cells.\n  That blastocyst now has predictor cells. They use the predictor cells \nfor heart muscle, to inject back into the heart muscle to grow a \nstronger heart, to repair a heart attack.\n  Some would say you have destroyed or murdered an embryo. There is no \nfertilized egg. There is only the skin cell from the person who had the \nheart attack whose cell is now being used, through somatic cell nuclear \ntransfer, to save that person's life. This is about lifesaving. Yet we \nhave so many here who said: Let's not worry about these diseases. Let's \nshut off this research because we think it is about murdering embryos.\n  That is not what this is about. It is about this young girl and \nwhether we decide we want this young girl to live her life as a \ndiabetic, a life filled with hope at this point that Congress will \nfinally do the right thing.\n  The House of Representatives did it. The Senate needs to vote on it. \nPerhaps this week is as good a week as any. We have been promised. A \nyear ago we were promised, just like drug reimportation. This Chamber \nis full of promises, but we never quite get to vote on important \nissues.\n  I am not suggesting that when I talk about stem cell research that \nthere are not ethical considerations, without serious concerns and \nserious issues to which we should be attentive. We should. I don't \ndismiss all the other concerns. But I do say this: If you have lost a \nchild, if you have lost a loved one, and you have watched someone die \nfrom Parkinson's or cancer or heart disease, if you have been through \nthat and then say to yourself: But I want to shut down promising \nresearch that could potentially cure diseases, then you have not been \nthrough it the way a number of people in this Chamber have been through \nit. I think it is so important for us to do the right thing and to \ncontinue this breathtaking research that can save lives.\n  There are so many other issues. There are just a couple of minutes \nremaining. Then I will yield the time to my colleague from California.\n  We passed recently in the Senate a piece of legislation that provides \nprescription drug benefits to senior citizens. But we did nothing to \nput downward pressure on drug prices. There is a special provision in \nthe bill which my colleagues, Senators Wyden and Snowe, were talking \nabout earlier today, that actually prevents the Federal Government from \nnegotiating for lower prices with the pharmaceutical industry. That is \nunbelievably ignorant. A provision like that is unbelievably ignorant, \nand it ought to be repealed.\n  All we need is a vote on that on the Senate floor. That, too, is a \nhealth issue. There is no excuse for this Congress to say: By the way, \nthe Federal Government cannot negotiate for a lower price. We already \ndo it in the VA. We end up with far lower prices as a result of the \nnegotiations.\n  In this case, with this bill, there is a provision that says: Don't \nyou dare negotiate. It would be against the law for you to try to get \nlower prices and reduce Government spending. That, too, is a health \nissue. That, too, will be in order this week.\n  I hope very much that we will have a vote on that. Yes, the \nunderlying bill is important. We ought to find a bipartisan way to fix \nit. No, it doesn't work the way it is. It will restrict choice, in my \njudgement, increase prices for some, and make others completely \nuninsurable. We ought to fix it in a bipartisan way.\n  But on the other three issues--reimportation of prescription drugs, \nstem cell research, repeal the law that prevents negotiation of lower \nprices with the pharmaceutical industry to save taxpayers money--\nshouldn't we do all three of those? We ought to do all three of those \nthis afternoon, right now. We have been blocked for far too long.\n  If there is, in fact, an amendable vehicle--and I hope it will be; we \nwill know that tomorrow morning--then I have just described three \namendments that I believe should be offered, and when offered I believe \nwill be approved in the coming days. If not, if this is a charade, and \ntomorrow we discover there is a legislative approach called ``filling \nthe tree,'' which is simply setting up a little blocking device to say \nwe are not going to allow anybody to offer anything, then I think the \nSenate will have sent a very strong message that this isn't Health \nWeek. This is a week in which you want to trot out a little proposal of \nyour own and avoid votes on serious issues that we should be taking in \nthe Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Dorgan's remarks. I \nhave been on the floor of the Senate a lot today waiting to get the \ntime, and I have been fortunate to hear many colleagues. I thank him \nfor very succinctly pointing out that in a real health care week you \nwouldn't close your eyes to hope--hope that we are going to find cures \nfor the terrible diseases that plague our families--Parkinson's, \nAlzheimer's, diabetes, spinal cord injuries, stroke, heart attack, you \njust name them. The fact is, we know stem cell research is promising. \nWe know a lot of States have gotten out ahead of the Federal Government \nbecause this President and this Congress have restricted the number of \nstem cell lines we can fund research on. And many of those stem cell \nlines are, frankly, no good at all because they have been impacted by \nmice cells. And they lack the diversity needed for robust research.\n  I have talked to leaders in this field. I am not a scientist. I was \neducated in economics. But I have spoken to leading scientists, among \nwhom is a gentleman named Dr. Peterson who worked at USFC in San \nFrancisco. He is one of the leading pioneers in stem cell research who \nleft to go to England because this President and this Congress put up a \nbig stop sign in front of stem cell research. It is tragic.\n  Our families need the hope of a cure. How many of us have met with \nthese youngsters who have juvenile diabetes, and we have seen how \ndifficult their lives are and how they suffer, even with the strides \nthat have been made in this area. They are still in great danger.\n  Health Week is here. We have a vehicle, as Senator Dorgan calls it, \nthe Enzi bill, which tries to deal with the health insurance problems \nthat small businesses face. I am going to talk about a better \nalternative to the Enzi\n\n[[Page S4196]]\n\nbill that will really do something. But we also have a chance to raise \nthese issues during the debate on the Enzi bill.\n  We have bipartisan support for drug importation from countries such \nas Canada, where drugs are sold at half the price of what drug \ncompanies charge in the U.S. We have bipartisan support for stem cell \nresearch, fixing the Medicare prescription drug issue so we could \nactually say to Medicare: You have the ability and the right just as \nthe VA has to negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies for lower \nprices. But I have to say Health Care Week Republican style is really \nInsurance Company Week.\n\n  If you look at the bills that have been brought before us, they all \nhelp the insurance companies. They don't help average Americans. They \ndo not help us.\n  The first two bills said we are going to restrict the right of \npatients--whether they are very wealthy, whether they are middle \nincome, whether they are poor--we are going to stop them from \nrecovering damages if they are harmed by medical malpractice.\n  I was very pleased that the Senate chose not to limit debate on those \ntwo bills which would have taken away the rights of patients while \ngiving a gift to the insurance companies. And hopefully we can change \nthe Enzi bill.\n  I don't like bills that take away benefits from my people in \nCalifornia. I don't like bills that take away benefits from all \nAmericans. That is why the Enzi bill is a bad bill. It does just that. \nI will go through with you the list of benefits that are taken away.\n  Mr. President, the Republicans bring us Health Care Week. They bring \nus the Enzi bill. What they do not tell us and you don't find out until \nyou look is that all the States' protections that have been put into \nplace will be wiped out upon passage of the Enzi bill.\n  Those are harsh words. What do I mean? What benefits will be taken \naway from my people in California? According to the report put together \nby Families U.S.A, ``The Enzi Bill, Bad Medicine for America,'' those \nbenefits include AIDS vaccines, alcoholism treatment, blood lead \nscreening. You know that is important because if you don't screen kids \nfor lead in their blood they could have learning disabilities--bone \ndensity screening. We know about osteoporosis. In California we \nguarantee that your insurance will pay for that; no guarantee in the \nEnzi bill whatsoever. As a matter of fact, the Enzi bill overrides all \nof this--cervical cancer screening, clinical trials, colorectal \nscreening, contraceptives, diabetic supplies and education.\n  We just talked about how it is so important for diabetics to have \ntheir meds--drug abuse treatment, emergency services, home health care, \nhospice care, infertility treatment, mammography screening, maternity \ncare, mental health parity.\n  In my State, if you have a mental health problem and you need help, \nyour insurance coverage will cover your treatment, just the same as if \nyou had a physical problem. We know it works. The list goes on--\nmetabolic disorders, minimal mastectomy, off-label drug use. In \nCalifornia, we have a law that says you can't kick a woman out of a \nhospital the same day she has a mastectomy. What, you may say? This \nhappens? It does--off-label drug use, orthotics, prosthetics, prostate \ncancer screening. We know that prostate cancer is a scourge--\nreconstructive surgery, second medical surgery opinion.\n  If somebody tells you you need serious surgery, you can get a second \nopinion in California. That is covered--special footwear, telemedicine, \nwell child care, so that we prevent diseases. That is my State.\n  Every single State in the Union gets overridden, whether it is \nAlabama, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho.\n  I know my friend from Georgia would be interested because he is \nsitting in the Chair. These are the things that your State offers. It \nprotects your consumers. It is as long a list as California, I am proud \nto say--alcoholism treatment, ambulatory surgery, bone density \nscreening, bone marrow transplants are covered in the State of Georgia. \nCervical cancer screening, contraceptives, dental anesthesia, diabetic \nsupplies, drug abuse treatment, emergency services, heart transplants \nare covered in Georgia. Infertility treatment, mammography screening, \nmental health parity, minimal mastectomy stay, morbid obesity care--\nwhich is very important now with the obesity epidemic--off-label drug \nuse, ovarian cancer screening, telemedicine, and well child care. \nGeorgia has a very inclusive and wonderful list of guaranteed \nprotections for people.\n  In the State of Georgia there are 2.347 million people affected by \nthis who would not have those guarantees under the Enzi plan. The Enzi \nplan essentially says to insurance companies: You can choose. You have \nto offer one plan. What do they call that plan? One premium plan. You \nhave to offer one premium plan based on a state plan of their choosing, \nbut there is no guarantee at all that what is in that premium plan is \nwhat is in the Georgia plan or the California plan or the North Dakota \nplan.\n  The fact is, all of the work that has been done in our States--and I \nfind it somewhat amusing given this is a Republican debate, that the \nRepublican bill preempts the States. What is wrong with this picture? I \nthought our Republican friends loved decisionmaking at the State \nlevel. No, not here in the Senate. They would prefer the insurance \ncompanies decide it rather than the States.\n\n  This is why I call my colleagues' attention to a study done on the \nimpact on all the States, with letters compiled from attorneys general \nfrom many of the States and Governors.\n  From Oregon, they register their opposition, first their benefits are \nnot guaranteed any longer. In addition, they are very worried about \nwhat happens to premiums. The Enzi bill disadvantages older people. As \nfar as the research I have done, it disadvantages women. It certainly \ndisadvantages people who come in with a preexisting condition such as \nhigh blood pressure. That includes a lot of Americans.\n  The bottom line is, the Enzi bill, the star rollout production of the \nRepublican Health Care Week, will make null and void all protections \nthat our States have given their citizens and replace them with some \nkind of riverboat gamble where insurers will choose some plan, from \nsome State, and apply it to my State. I don't want a so-called premium \nplan from another State.\n  Here is a good example. In Connecticut, there is a terrible epidemic \nof Lyme disease. A tick bites your body and it can make a person very \nill. We have some of that in California, but we do not have as much per \ncapita as Connecticut. In Connecticut, the State legislature and the \nGovernor say insurers have to cover Lyme disease because it is an \nepidemic in the State. In other States, it may not be necessary. \nHowever, we will wipe that Connecticut requirement off the books, and \nwe will say, through the Enzi bill, insurance companies are going to \ndecide.\n  Something is wrong. This is not Health Care Week, this is ``insurance \ncompany week.'' That is not good for consumers.\n  My own State has built a comprehensive State health insurance system \nthat encourages affordable and equitable coverage for all, while \nensuring consumers are protected and guaranteed benefits. The Enzi bill \ntakes away a State's power to regulate health insurance. It is a gift \nto the insurers, as I said. It preempts benefits, as I said. It also is \ngoing to lead to way higher premiums for all in America who are covered \nby health insurance.\n  Insurance companies, not the States, will now decide what benefits \nthe consumers. That is why we have letter after letter after letter \nfrom Governors, from attorneys general, warning us not to pass the Enzi \nbill.\n  There appears to be no limits on the cost shares an insurer can \ncharge nor are there requirements that plans treat consumers equitably \nor offer comprehensive coverage.\n  As I said, if you are a little older--maybe you have high blood \npressure, maybe you have some other health problems--you are in \ntrouble. You are not going to have an affordable plan and you will lose \nthe benefits you have. You may be priced out of the market. It will be \ncatastrophic.\n  We have serious problems with the Enzi bill. Here is the great news. \nThere is a wonderful alternative out there, the Durbin-Lincoln bill, of \nwhich I am a cosponsor. I thank my friends for working so hard on this.\n  As I go around my State, people nod in agreement with the Durbin-\nLincoln bill's premise. Senators have very good\n\n[[Page S4197]]\n\nhealth insurance. We pay half of the premium and the Government matches \nthe other half. There is a Federal Employee Health Benefits Program. \nThere are basic benefits required and private companies come in and \noffer various plans. People such as me and my employees can choose from \na broad array of plans. It works beautifully.\n  I ask unanimous consent, at 5:45, the Senator from Oregon, Senator \nMurray, be recognized for 15 minutes, until 6 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Senators Durbin and Lincoln take this Federal plan and \nopen it up to small businesses with 100 employees down to a single \nself-employed person.\n  This plan will work because there will be a huge pool set up. \nEveryone can buy into it from any business in this country with less \nthan 100 employees. It would be a very diverse pool of people. They \nwill be insured. The pricing is going to be very fair and reasonable. \nThe plan will be administered in the same way our Federal benefits are \nadministered.\n  I heard Senator Thune say: That is a government plan. No, it isn't. \nIt is a plan that is administered by the Federal Employees Health \nBenefit Plan, but it is coverage provided by private insurers. Because \nthe administrative costs are kept so low, this is going to be very \naffordable and will solve the problem.\n  And guess what. This alternative, the Durbin-Lincoln alternative, \ndoes not take away the protections States have given all who live in \nthose States. If you are in California, you still get the benefits. By \nlaw, you are protected. If you live in Washington State, you will get \nthose benefits. The alternative that the Democrats are behind will cost \nless. It will protect benefits. It will work beautifully.\n  I say to my colleagues, if it is good enough for you, it ought to be \ngood enough for small businesses and their employees. This bill is a \nwonderful and practical alternative.\n  In my concluding 6 or 7 minutes, I will say that this so-called \nHealth Care Week is a major disappointment, unless we find out tomorrow \nwe can amend the Enzi bill. If we can amend Enzi and pass stem cell \nresearch and prescription drug reimportation, if we can make sure there \nis hope for patients with Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart condition, \nstroke, cancer because we move ahead with science, then Health Care \nWeek will have mattered. If we can offer the Durbin-Lincoln substitute, \nit will not preempt the protections of State law as the Enzi bill does. \nThe Enzi bill has more opposition than any bill I remember. AARP is \nagainst it. The Cancer Foundation is against it. There are 224 \norganizations against it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record those \norganizations opposed to the Enzi bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered

Mr. President, this bill is going to hurt American health \ncare by cancelling out all the hard-won State protections and by \nraising premiums so high they will price consumers out of the market. \nThat is why across the board there is opposition. I have not seen this \nmany organizations come out against a bill.\n  By the way, this bill, when it was first presented, sounded \nreasonable. It was only when we looked at the small print that we \nrealized how dangerous it is.\n  Instead of working on this misguided bill, we could have done the \nalternative, we could have done the stem cell, we could have fixed the \nMedicare prescription drugs, we could have allowed drug importation.\n  If we didn't want to do real health care reform, there are a lot of \nother things we could have done, such as raise the minimum wage. We \ncould have finished the job on immigration reform, strengthening the \nenforcement at the border and stopping illegal immigration, but getting \npeople on a path and out of the shadows.\n  What about Superfund sites? We have some of the most polluted sites \nin the country still awaiting cleanup. We have one in four people in \nAmerica, including 10 million children, living within 4 miles of a \nSuperfund site.\n  What about debating the war Iraq? That is on everyone's mind. There \nis still no exit strategy. There is still no plan. We see suffering on \nthe ground there every single day.\n  We have issues with a potential nuclear Iran. We should debate that. \nIn Afghanistan, the situation is deteriorating and we have all but \nforgotten about it. We have not followed the recommendations of the 9/\n11 Commission to this date. We have failed fiscal policies. We have \ndebt as far as the eye can see. We ought to debate pay-as-you-go. If \nMembers want to spend money, they should show how they going to pay for \nit instead of putting the burden on the backs of America's children.\n  There are many other things we could do, but since we are on Health \nCare Week, let's fix our health care system. Let's not pass a bill that \nwill not help people with serious diseases or fix the problems with the \nMedicare prescription drug program.\n  We have so much work to do and this Enzi bill is masquerading as a \nbill that will help our citizens. When we read the fine print, we find \nout it is only going to make matters worse.\n  I am proud to yield the floor to my friend from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the next \nDemocratic speakers in order be Senator Dayton, Senator Durbin, and \nSenator Akaka.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, at this hour, families are struggling \nwith health care. Seniors are facing a critical deadline for drug \ncoverage. Businesses are grappling with the high cost of insurance. And \npatients are being denied the cutting-edge research that could save \ntheir lives. Those are critical issues. And what is the Senate doing? \nWe are dealing with a distraction instead of real solutions to make \nhealth care affordable, more accessible, and more innovative.\n\n  I am on the Senate floor this evening to talk about what we should be \ndoing to help families and businesses and communities meet their health \ncare needs. I also want to talk this evening about why the Republican \nproposal, S. 1955, could do more harm than good.\n  This is a bill which takes a good idea--pooling the risk in health \ninsurance--and distorts it with a plan that will raise the cost of \nhealth care, strip away patient protections, and hurt many of our small \nbusinesses. But do not take my word for it. Attorneys general from 41 \nStates, including my own, have written to outline the serious problems \nwith the Republican bill. I have heard from doctors with the Washington \nState Medical Association and from my own Governor about the damage \nthis bill will inflict on patients and on our economy.\n  Simply put, this proposal is a distraction. Instead of dealing with \nreal solutions to real problems, the Republican leadership is wasting \ntime on one narrow proposal that is only going to make things worse. We \ncan do better. The truth is that patients and seniors, doctors and \nnurses, and all of our communities deserve better.\n  If we were serious about reducing the cost of health care, helping to \nimprove access, and driving innovation, we would be talking about the \ncritical issues that the Republican leadership is trying to avoid. We \nshould be focusing on everything from the Medicare drug program, to \nstem cell research, to community health care. Frankly, we do not have a \nday to waste.\n  On Monday, millions of seniors and disabled will be hit with a \ndeadline that means higher premiums for their prescription drugs. That \nMay 15 deadline is just 6 days away. I am hearing from seniors that \nthey are very worried about this deadline. They are worried they are \ngoing to pick the wrong plan, and they do not think it is fair to be \npunished if they need more time so they can make an informed choice.\n  I have been traveling throughout my home State of Washington, meeting \nwith seniors and holding roundtables with patients, with pharmacists, \nwith advocates.\n  Three weeks ago, I was in Chehalis, at the Twin Cities Senior Center. \nI can tell you, seniors are worried. They are angry. They are \nfrustrated. They are frightened about this May 15 deadline, and that \ndeadline is just one of the problems this flawed drug program is \npresenting.\n  The week before that, I was in Silverdale, and I have held Medicare \nroundtables in Kent, Vancouver, Ballard, Shelton, Spokane, Anacortes, \nBellevue, Aberdeen, Olympia, Lakewood, Seattle, and Everett. \nEverywhere, I have heard from seniors about just how bad the Medicare \nPart D Program is. I have heard their frustration about dealing with \nsuch a confusing system. I have heard their anger that this program \ndoes not meet their needs. And I have heard from many who just want to \nthrow their hands up in the air and ignore the whole program.\n  If we were serious about improving health care, we would be fixing \nthe problems they have outlined. Instead, we are going to let an unfair \ndeadline hurt our seniors even further. In just 6 days--in just 6 \ndays--they are going to have to pick a plan or face high penalties \nwhenever they do enroll, and the penalties grow larger the longer they \nwait. To me, that is just not fair.\n  Right now, this Senate could be extending the deadline so our seniors \nare not pressured into making the wrong choice in such a complicated \nsystem. Right now, we could be lifting the penalty so that seniors are \nnot punished if they need more time to make the right choice. Right \nnow, we could be providing help to millions of vulnerable Americans who \nhave been mistreated by this flawed Republican plan. But, instead, this \nCongress is leaving seniors to fend for themselves. The Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services has said he opposes extending the deadline or \nlifting the penalties, and this\n\n[[Page S4199]]\n\nRepublican Congress seems to agree with him by a shameful lack of \naction.\n  Seniors deserve better. The disabled deserve better. Our most \nvulnerable neighbors deserve better. If we really wanted to make health \ncare more affordable and more accessible and more innovative, we would \nbe on this floor fixing the Medicare drug program and helping seniors \nwho are facing that unfair deadline.\n  Now, that is just one example of what a real focus on health care on \nthis floor would include.\n  If we were serious about helping patients, we would be expanding \nlifesaving research. For patients who are living with diseases such as \nParkinson's or multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or diabetes, stem cell \nresearch holds the potential to help us understand and to treat and \nsomeday perhaps cure those devastating diseases.\n\n  Nearly a year ago, the House of Representatives passed legislation to \nlift the restrictions that hold back this promising research. The House \nof Representatives has acted, but for an entire year the Senate has \nnot. My colleagues, Senator Specter and Senator Harkin, are well known \nfor their leadership on this fight. They were promised a vote on stem \ncell research, and that vote has still not taken place. Every delay \nmeans missed opportunities for patients with devastating diseases.\n  If this Senate is serious about health care and saving lives, we \nshould be voting on stem cell legislation today. That is why, last \nweek, I joined with 39 other Senators in writing to the majority leader \nurging him to bring up H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement \nAct. But instead of real solutions, the Senate is focusing on a \ndistraction. Patients with life-threatening diseases deserve a lot \nbetter.\n  If we were serious about improving health care, we would be investing \nin local efforts that boost access to health care.\n  Two weeks ago, through the Johnson & Johnson Community Health Care \nAwards, I had a chance to honor leaders from across the country who are \ndoing innovative work to break down the barriers to care. If we were \nserious about improving health care, we would be building more Federal \nsupport for their work. Instead, we are moving in the opposite \ndirection.\n  Perhaps the best example is the Bush administration's 5-year effort \nto kill the Healthy Communities Access Program, which is known as HCAP. \nThis is a program which helps our local organizations coordinate care \nfor the uninsured. I have seen it make a tremendous difference in my \nhome State. Well, every year since taking office, this Bush \nadministration has tried to kill that successful program. I have been \nout here on the floor leading the fight for our local communities every \nyear, and most years we have won. But this past year, the White House \nand the Republican Congress ended the support for Healthy Communities \nand thus made health care less accessible for families from coast to \ncoast.\n  If we were serious about improving health care, we would be investing \nin local programs that make a difference. But, instead, the Republican \nleadership is focused on distractions. We can do better than that.\n  So let me take a few minutes to turn to the specific problems with \nthe bill that is before us, S. 1955, and explain why so many experts \nacross this country are warning us that this bill will eliminate \ncritical patient protections, it will lead to unfair premiums and \ninsurance practices, and it will raise the cost of health care.\n  First of all, this bill will eliminate many of the important \nprotections that keep patients healthy and lower the cost of health \ncare.\n  In my home State of Washington, we have enacted a number of State \npatient protections that require health plans to cover services such as \ndiabetic care, mental health services, breast and cervical cancer \nscreening, emergency medical services, and dental procedures. But under \nthis bill, small business health plans or association health plans \nwould not be required to cover those important benefits. Allowing \ninsurers to abandon mandated benefits, many of which are preventive and \nare diagnostic, will result in a sicker population and higher health \ncosts for everyone.\n  When this legislation was debated in the HELP Committee, I offered a \nnumber of amendments to provide for coverage of several important \nwomen's health benefits. Unfortunately, every one of those amendments \nwas defeated. So now, here we are, and we have a bill on this floor \nthat will strip away the protections on which our patients across this \ncountry rely.\n  A new report by Families USA shows just how many families in my home \nState will be hurt by this bill. That report found that 1,861,000 \nresidents of Washington State may lose protections if this bill is \npassed. And what could they lose? Emergency services, home health care, \ndrug and alcohol treatment, contraceptives, diabetic supplies and \neducation, hospice care, mammography screening, maternity services, \nmental health care--the list goes on. I am not going to tell nearly 2 \nmillion people in my home State whom I represent that we are going to \ntake a gamble and risk losing those hard-won protections for a plan \nthat will likely raise the cost of health care for many of our families \nand small businesses.\n  Secondly, this bill will encourage insurance companies to charge \nhigher premiums for less healthy consumers. This bill will preempt \nstrong laws and protections in our State that limit the ability of \ninsurers to vary premiums based on health status, age, gender, or \ngeography. I am very concerned this will result in adverse selection or \nwhat we call cherry-picking, leading to higher premiums for less \nhealthy consumers. In fact, rates will likely become unaffordable for \nthose who need it the most, potentially increasing the number of \nuninsured Americans.\n  Now, Mr. President, I would like to share some letters I have \nreceived from leaders in my home State who all speak against this \nflawed proposal. I ask unanimous consent that these two letters be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, recently I received a letter from the \nGovernor, Governor Christine Gregoire of my home State of Washington, \nin which she expressed many of her concerns regarding this legislation \nand its impact on the people who live in my home State.\n  This chart behind me contains the full text of the Governor's letter. \nAs you can see, she has many serious concerns. I wish to highlight for \nthe Senate some of the main points our Governor has raised with me.\n  Governor Gregoire alludes to the harmful aspects of this bill, and \nshe says:\n\n       [S. 1955] stands to harm our small group insurance market, \n     which is a critical component of [Washington State's] current \n     health care system. . . .\n       Instead of promoting more affordable health care, this \n     legislation would cause a serious increase in rates for \n     consumers--possibly two or three times over what they now \n     pay.\n\n  Governor Gregoire also warns in her letter to me that:\n\n       [this] bill threatens consumer protections that the state \n     of Washington strives to guarantee to [all of] our residents.\n\n  The Governor also warns that this bill:\n\n       would foster a proliferation of health plans that do not \n     cover preventive services that are absolutely vital to the \n     health and well-being of Washington residents. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, I would also like to share a letter that I have \nreceived from the 9,000-member Washington State Medical Association \nthat wrote to me in strong opposition to S. 1955.\n  Now, this chart shows the full letter, and I want to read just a \nportion of it:\n\n       This legislation will have a severe impact on all the \n     consumer health gains that have been made in Washington State \n     over the past decade.\n       S. 1955 will:\n       Undermine Washington State's many gains in advancing health \n     care quality;\n       Pull people from existing insurance coverage rather than \n     attract the uninsured;\n       Lead to higher costs for consumers;\n       Strike down Washington's Mental Health Parity law, which \n     took eight years of work to be enacted;\n       Eliminate other mandated benefits that help consumers such \n     as mammography services; and,\n       Leave Washington's citizens at risk for unpaid medical \n     bills in the event of an AHP insolvency.\n\n  That is from the head of the Washington State Medical Association, \nwhich has 9,000 members in my home\n\n[[Page S4200]]\n\nState. I think their words should be heeded by the Members of this \nSenate.\n  Third, this proposal does nothing to address increasing health care \ncosts.\n  In fact, it builds on the sorry record of this administration and \nthis Congress in not addressing the rising costs that Americans face. \nBecause of the flaws I mentioned, this bill does nothing to contain \nthose costs. In fact, it could dramatically increase costs for many \nbusinesses and families in Washington State. It could well mean that \npeople in the State of Washington who have affordable coverage today \ncould end up worse off than they are right now.\n  I know my State has been a leader in working to expand access to \naffordable health insurance for working families and small businesses. \nMany of the reforms that worked to control costs in my State would be \njeopardized if this legislation is enacted. Washington State has a \nproud tradition of strong consumer protections and integrated managed \ncare that has improved health outcomes and controlled cost increases. \nWe should not jeopardize what my State has fought hard for by dangerous \nFederal legislation.\n  I do support the concept of pooling. I believe we can implement \npolicies that provide stability in health insurance premiums. In fact, \nI am currently working with a number of my colleagues on legislation to \ncreate Federal and State catastrophic cost pools to spread out the \nrisks and address what is driving health care costs. We can help spread \nthe risk in ways that will lower costs and still protect patients. The \nlegislation before us could raise costs for consumers and small \nbusinesses. We can do better than that.\n  There are serious challenges facing our country when it comes to \nhealth care. This Senate needs to get serious. Instead of focusing on a \ndistraction, we should be helping seniors with prescription drugs. We \nshould be expanding lifesaving research, and we should be supporting \ncommunity health care. Those are some of the things we should be \nworking on to reduce the cost of health care and to improve access and \nto accelerate innovation. We can do all of those things, but we need \nthe Republican leadership to get serious if we are going to provide \nserious solutions. We don't have a day to waste. I hope we can get to \nwork on the real solutions that our American families deserve.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                            Christine O. Gregoire,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                      Olympia, WA, April 27, 2006.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: I am writing with great concern about \n     S. 1955, the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and \n     Affordability Act, and its potential to further erode our \n     ability to provide sound health coverage to citizens in \n     Washington State. This bill stands to harm our small group \n     insurance market, which is a critical component of our \n     current health care system. Furthermore, the bill threatens \n     consumer protections that the State of Washington strives to \n     guarantee to our residents. For these reasons, I ask that you \n     oppose the bill in its current form.\n       When it comes to providing health care, the federal \n     government has been putting an ever-Increasing burden on the \n     states. The Deficit Reduction Act, alone, paves the way to \n     eliminate nearly $50 billion over the next five years for the \n     Medicaid program. Fresh on the heals of signing the Deficit \n     Reduction Act, the President unveiled his Fiscal Year 2007 \n     budget proposal, which proposes eliminating $36 billion from \n     the Medicare program over the next five years. Additionally, \n     the implementation of the Medicare Part D prescription drug \n     program has had enormous impacts on the states. Nearly every \n     state in the Nation--Washington included--felt compelled to \n     step in to ensure that our most needy citizens, our dual \n     eligible population, continue to receive their medications \n     due to fundamental flaws in the Medicare Modernization Act. \n     Against this backdrop now comes S. 1955.\n       If passed, S. 1955 would establish a small group rating \n     mechanism that would further erode the possibility of \n     pursuing reasonable health care costs in the states. Instead \n     of promoting more affordable health care, this legislation \n     would cause a serious increase in rates for consumers--\n     possibly two or three times over what they now pay. At its \n     worst, the bill could result in the total collapse of our \n     small group insurance market, something we must fight to \n     prevent.\n       Additionally, I am concerned that S. 1955 would foster a \n     proliferation of health plans that do not cover preventative \n     services that are absolutely vital to the health and well-\n     being of Washington residents, such as mammography, \n     colonoscopies, diabetic care services, and newborn coverage. \n     In 2005, the Washington State Legislature passed, and I \n     signed, legislation providing mental health parity. If \n     Congress passes S. 1955, the bill could also fully abrogate \n     this effort to ensure mental health coverage in Washington \n     State.\n       It is surprising to me that S. 1955 is moving forward, \n     given that it is patterned, in part, on a flawed National \n     Association of Insurance Commissioner's 1993 Model Rating \n     Law, actually adopted by the state of New Hampshire in 2003. \n     This proved to be an unfortunate experiment for the people of \n     New Hampshire. Just this year, that state's Legislature \n     repealed provisions of its 2003 law due to the astronomical \n     jump in rates that occurred in only a two-year period after \n     it was implemented. Given this history that he knows only too \n     well, my colleague, Governor John Lynch of New Hampshire, \n     recently registered his opposition to S. 1955 in a letter to \n     his federal delegation, dated March 28, 2006. New Hampshire's \n     experience is illustrative and a harbinger of what could come \n     to all states, should Congress adopt S. 1955.\n       As Washington State's Attorney General from 1993-2005, I, \n     along with the majority of my colleagues within the National \n     Association of Attorneys General (NAAG), opposed several \n     precursor bills to S. 1955. Introduced in each of the last \n     several Congresses, these bills allow for the federal \n     regulation of association health plans (AHPs), and have \n     passed out of the U.S. House more than once. I appreciate \n     that S. 1955, in its current form, does away with one fatal \n     flaw of the earlier AHP bills--that being the wholesale \n     obliteration of state regulation over national AHPs. But, as \n     I have articulated, S. 1955 still goes too far in preempting \n     other basic consumer protections. It is heartening to see \n     that a majority of current members of NAAG, including \n     Washington State Attorney General Rob McKenna, have now \n     weighed in with their concerns and opposition to S. 1955.\n       As a nation, we need innovative solutions that provide high \n     quality, sustainable and affordable health care access to our \n     un- and under-insured populations. With the help of the \n     Washington State Legislature, I have embarked on a five-point \n     strategy to promote evidence-based medicine; better manage \n     chronic diseases; increase prevention and wellness \n     initiatives; require data transparency; and expand the reach \n     of health information technology. These strategies invite \n     strong partnerships between states and the federal government \n     that I remain committed to pursuing with you. Unfortunately, \n     proposals like S. 1955, are counterintuitive to the notion of \n     forging such partnerships and I ask that you reject the bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Christine O. Gregoire,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Washington State\n\n\n                                          Medical Association,\n\n                                                   April 25, 2006.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: On behalf of the 9,000 members of the \n     Washington State Medical Association, WSMA, I am writing to \n     ask that you vote no on S. 1955--Association Health Plans, \n     AHPs, when the bill comes to a vote in the U.S. Senate.\n       The WSMA is very concerned about the negative effect of \n     this legislation on our State's citizens, purchasers, \n     providers and health plans.\n       This legislation will have a severe impact on all the \n     consumer health gains that have been made in Washington State \n     over the past decade.\n       S. 1955 will:\n       Undermine Washington State's many gains in advancing health \n     care quality;\n       Pull people from existing insurance coverage rather than \n     attract the uninsured;\n       Lead to higher costs for consumers;\n       Strike down Washington's Mental Health Parity law, which \n     took eight years of work to be enacted;\n       Eliminate other mandated benefits that help consumers such \n     as mammography services; and,\n       Leave Washington's citizens at risk for unpaid medical \n     bills in the event of an AHP insolvency\n       The Washington State Medical Association works hard every \n     day to insure that Washington's citizens have access to the \n     finest medical care in the country. This legislation will \n     test our ability to continue in this endeavor.\n       For more information, please do not hesitate to contact Len \n     Eddinger in our Olympia office.\n           Very Truly yours,\n                                              Peter J. Dunbar, MD,\n                                                        President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to address some issues my \ncolleagues have raised. I am appreciative of the debate and the chance \nto talk about health care. It is a critically important topic. It is \none that we have to talk a lot more about, how we can provide as much \nhealth care as possible to everybody at the lowest price that we\n\n[[Page S4201]]\n\ncan get it and get more people insured. That is at the root of what we \nare trying to get done with the proposal of Senator Enzi and others to \nget more health insurance, better coverage to more people across the \nUnited States. That is a worthy goal, something we need to do. We have \nfar too many people uninsured. We need more people insured. That is \ncentral to us. It is central to the hospital and the provider community \nthat we have people who are insured. Because of those who are not \ninsured and then can't pay the price of their health care, that is \nspread across to other people, which is what we do today. That is what \nwe need to do, but it would be better if we could get more people \ninsured and have a direct system of payment.\n  Others have said that what we need to be talking about is different \nthan this, rather than expanding health insurance coverage. I respect \nthat. Some of my colleagues have raised the stem cell issue. I want to \naddress the concerns my colleagues have raised on stem cells. I want to \nreport to my colleagues what a tremendous positive story we have to \ntell about stem cells, an exciting story of people receiving \ntreatments, living longer and healthier lives because of stem cell \ntreatments. These are not the controversial ones. This does not involve \nthe destruction of a young human in the embryonic stage. This involves \nthe use of adult stem cells, which the Presiding Officer and others, \neverybody in this room has in their body, adult stem cells. It also \ninvolves cord blood stem cells. These are the stem cells that are in \nthe umbilical cord between the mother and child, while the mother is \ncarrying the child.\n  I want to show two charts to start off. I think it is best if we make \nthis a personal debate. I challenge my colleagues who have challenged \nme about this topic to come forward with pictures of individuals who \nare being treated with embryonic stem cells. I would like to see the \npeople who are being treated with embryonic stem cells. We have put \nnearly half a billion dollars of research money into embryonic stem \ncell research. We have known about embryonic stem cells for 20 years. I \ndon't know of the people being treated by embryonic stem cells.\n  I can show people who are being treated with adult stem cells or cord \nblood. This is Erik Haines. He is 13 years old. He was diagnosed with \nKrabbes disease, the first patient to receive cord blood for this rare, \ninherited metabolic disease. The date of transplant was 1994. He is \nalive today. He would be dead without this having taken place.\n  Let me show you a picture of Keone Penn. I had him in to testify \nbefore a Commerce Committee hearing a couple years ago. He has sickle \ncell anemia. The date of transplant was December 11, 1998. He had been \nvery sick. He wasn't expected to live. As a matter of fact, it says in \na statement that he made: If it wasn't for cord blood, I would probably \nbe dead by now. It is a good thing I found a match. It saved my life.\n  We have now many more people being treated for sickle cell, a whole \nhost of diseases. As a matter of fact, I want to read off a few of \nthese. These are human clinical trials, real people getting real \ntreatments, living longer lives, if not being cured, by the use of \nadult stem cells and cord blood stem cells in 69 different disease \nareas.\n  My colleagues have heard this debate for a period of years. We have \nbeen debating stem cells for a number of years. We have been debating \nthe controversial area of embryonic stem cells, which the Federal \nGovernment funds, which State governments fund, which private industry \nand the private sector is fully free to fund completely, every bit of \nthe way that they want to do that. They can. They have been. And we \nhave no human treatments from embryonic stem cells to date. We don't \nhave any. They are funded globally. There is no prohibition against \nembryonic stem cell research in the United States.\n  My colleagues seek more than the nearly $500 billion that we have put \ninto embryonic stem cell research, an area that has not produced any \nhuman treatments to date. I want to be clear that that is what we are \ntalking about. When we started this debate, my colleagues pushing \nembryonic stem cells, who in their hearts absolutely believe they are \ndoing the right thing and this will lead to cures, listed cancer, \nsickle cell anemia, Lou Gehrig's disease. We are going to deal with all \nof these things. With the promise of embryonic stem cells, we will cure \nthese things. That is what they said on their side when we started this \ndebate 6 years ago. Six years later--I could be off a year or 2--where \nare the cures? I say we have them. They are in adult and cord blood \nstem cells.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record at the end of my \nstatement a sheet of human clinical applications using adult stem \ncells.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I want to read a few of the 69 from this document: \nSickle cell anemia, aplastic anemia, chronic Epstein-Barr infection, \nlupus, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile arthritis, \nmultiple sclerosis, brain tumors, different cancers, lymphoma, non-\nHodgkins lymphoma, a number of solid tumors, cardiovascular. This is an \nexciting area that is taking place where we now have people with acute \nheart damage, chronic coronary artery disease being treated with adult \nstem cells. Primarily, this has been an adult stem cell treatment where \nthey harvest stem cells out of their own body and inject them right \nback into the damaged heart tissue.\n  Now we are seeing people who couldn't walk up a flight of steps going \nup eight flights, having hard tissue being regenerated with the use of \ntheir own adult stem cells. There is no rejection problem. This is \ntheir own cells. They take these adult stem cells from your body, which \nare repair cells, grow them outside of the body, put them back into the \ndamaged heart tissue area, and now instead of congestive heart failure, \nwithout any ability to get enough blood throughout the body, the heart \nis pumping harder and better. It is actually working. They are \nregenerating the heart in these people. This is actually taking place \nin human clinical trials today. It is a beautiful issue.\n  The list goes on: chronic liver failure, Parkinson's disease. I had a \ngentleman in to testify who had taken stem cells out of a part of his \nbody, grew them, put them in the left part of the brain. The right side \nof the body started functioning without Parkinson's disease. Later it \ncame back, after several years, but he had several years free and was \nstarting to learn how better this can work with Parkinson's disease.\n  Again, continuing from the list: spinal cord injury, stroke damage, \nlimb gangrene, skull bone repair. We have recently had advances. For \nexample, they took the stem cells out of a person's body. They had a \nform around which the bladder could be grown, outside a new bladder \ncould be grown. They took the stem cells, put them around this form, \nand actually grew a bladder out of a person's own stem cells. These are \nmarvelous, miraculous things that are taking place in 69 different \nareas of human clinical trials, adult and cord blood. I ask my \ncolleagues from the other side, the ones who promised all of the cures \nfrom embryonic stem cells, as this debate moves forward, we will bring \nout statements that people made 5, 6 years ago about the cures that \nwould come from embryonic stem cells. The cures have come from these \nnoncontroversial areas. This is where we ought to be funding. This is \nwhat we ought to be doing. This is where we are getting treatments.\n  I ask my colleagues from the other side, where are the treatments \nwith embryonic stem cells? Colleagues on the other side, for whom I \nhave great respect and I know in their hearts are doing what they \nbelieve is the right thing to do, asked about reputable scientists \nopposed to embryonic stem cells. I ask unanimous consent to print in \nthe Record this letter at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. It is dated October 27, 2004. It is to Senator John F. \nKerry, running for President at the time, signed by 57 scientists who \nhave a real problem with embryonic stem cell research.\n  They say in this letter:\n\n       As professionals trained in the life sciences we are \n     alarmed at these statements.\n\n  They are referring to what Senator Kerry was saying, that this would \nbe a\n\n[[Page S4202]]\n\ncenterpiece issue for him in moving forward with science. This is in \n2004.\n\n       First, your statement misrepresents science. In itself, \n     science is not a policy or a political program.\n       Second, it is no mere ``ideology'' to be concerned about \n     the possible misuse of humans in scientific research.\n\n  Here we come to the real rub of the issue on embryonic stem cell \nresearch. Is the embryo human life or isn't it? It is one or the other. \nIt is either a human life or it isn't. It is alive. It is human in its \ngenetic form. Is it a human life or not? If it is not a human life, do \nwith it as you choose. If it is a human life, it deserves protection \nand respect. We do it for everybody in this room, no matter what your \nState is, your physical condition. Why wouldn't we do it while you are \nin the womb?\n  I have a letter signed by 57 scientists with a real problem with \nembryonic stem cell research. My colleague asked me to produce \nscientists who are opposed to embryonic stem cell research. Here they \nare.\n  I finally say to my colleagues on this topic, the promises they have \nmade about embryonic stem cell research have not been realized to date, \nand reputable scientists question whether they will ever be realized. \nWe are half a billion dollars later after investment from the Federal \nGovernment on embryonic stem cell research, animal and human. Now you \nare seeing--this is just the Federal Government, not about the private \nsector or other governments around the world. I will read to you what \nother scientists who support embryonic stem cell research are saying \nabout the prospects of embryonic stem cell research. A British stem \ncell research expert, named Winston, warned colleagues that the \npolitical hype in support of human embryonic stem cells needs to be \nreined in. This is dated June 20, 2005, where he says this:\n\n       One of the problems is that in order to persuade the public \n     that we must do this work, we often go rather too far in \n     promising what we might achieve. This is a real issue for the \n     scientists. I am not entirely convinced that embryonic stem \n     cells will, in my lifetime, and possibly anybody's lifetime, \n     for that matter, be holding quite the promise that we \n     desperately hope they will.\n\n  Let's look at another researcher talking in this field. I want to get \ntestimony in here from Jamie Thompson, the first scientist to grow \nhuman embryonic stem cells. This is the question posed to him:\n\n       People who use nuclear transfer generally say that the \n     technique is optimized for producing stem cells rather than \n     making babies. They would not want to equate this with the \n     process that produces embryos that were fit for implantation, \n     and they argue that they are used in the reproductive process \n     differently.\n\n  I am talking about the use of embryonic stem cell research in a \ncloning procedure, where you create a clone, take the embryonic stem \ncells from the clone.\n  This is what Professor Thompson says:\n\n       So you are trying to define it away and it doesn't work. If \n     you create an embryo by nuclear transfer and you give it to \n     somebody, you didn't know where it came from, there would be \n     no test you could do on that embryo to say where it came \n     from. It is what it is. It is an embryo. It is a young human \n     life. It's true that they have much lower probability of \n     giving rise to a child, but by any reasonable definition, at \n     least at some frequency, you are creating an embryo. If you \n     are trying to define it away, you are being disingenuous.\n\n  My colleagues started to raise the issue that if you create an embryo \nby process of cloning, it is not really a young human life. But if you \ncreate an embryo that is a sheep, like Dolly, and grow it up to be \nDolly the sheep, is Dolly not a sheep? Would that be the contention? \nThat is simply not the case when they are creating a cloned individual \nor cloned human being, and that goes into the next step in this debate, \nto discuss human cloning. The other side calls it somatic nuclear cell \ntransfer--the same process that created Dolly.\n  My point is that that is the next step on this continuum. We are \ntalking about embryonic stem cell research funding and the lack of \nproduction taking place there for human treatment. The next step is \nthat we need to clone and then we need to clone the individual and not \nharvest it in a day or two, but we need to grow the fetus out several \nweeks so we have sort of fetal farming, which is a ghastly thing to \neven consider. Yet it is being talked about in some research circles.\n  I conclude with the statement that if we want to be successful in \nthis area and treat people, which I believe is the measure that we \nshould go by--the treatment of individuals--our best bet, if my \ncolleagues want human treatments to take place, they want to cure \npeople, if that is what their effort is, let's fund what is working, \nwhich is adult cord blood. Let's move off of this politicized debate \nwhich is about the definition of young human life. Let's move off this \ndebate and do something that is curing people. And we can.\n  That is the way we ought to go in this debate. We ought to also pass \nthe Enzi proposal that gets more people health insurance, which is \nwhere we should focus this debate now because that is what we are \ntalking about, rather than a politicized issue of embryonic stem cell \nresearch, which has not worked and is not working.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                Adult & Non-Embryonic Stem Cell Research\n\n                   Advances & Updates for April 2006\n\n\n       HIGHLIGHT OF THE MONTH--STEM CELL HOPE FOR LIVER PATIENTS\n\n       British doctors reported treatment of 5 patients with liver \n     failure with the patients' own adult stem cells. Four of the \n     5 patients showed improvement, and 2 patients regained near \n     normal liver function. The authors noted: ``Liver \n     transplantation is the only current therapeutic modality for \n     liver failure but it is available to only a small proportion \n     of patients due to the shortage of organ donors.

Kerry,\n     John Kerry for President,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: Recently you have made the promotion of \n     embryonic stem cell research, including the cloning of human \n     embryos for research purposes, into a centerpiece of your \n     campaign. You have said you will make such research a ``top \n     priority'' for government, academia and medicine (Los Angeles \n     Times, 10/17/04). You have even equated support for this \n     research with respect for ``science,'' and said that science \n     must be freed from ``ideology'' to produce miracle cures for \n     numerous diseases.\n       As professionals trained in the life sciences we are \n     alarmed at these statements.\n       First, your statements misrepresent science. In itself, \n     science is not a policy or a political program. Science is a \n     systematic method for developing and testing hypotheses about \n     the physical world. It does not ``promise'' miracle cures \n     based on scanty evidence. When scientists make such \n     assertions, they are acting as individuals, out of their own \n     personal faith and hopes, not as the voice of ``science''. If \n     such scientists allow their individual faith in the future of \n     embryonic stem cell research to be interpreted as a reliable \n     prediction of the outcome of this research, they are acting \n     irresponsibly.\n       Second, it is no mere ``ideology'' to be concerned about \n     the possible misuse of humans in scientific research. Federal \n     bioethics advisory groups, serving under both Democratic and \n     Republican presidents, have affirmed that the human embryo is \n     a developing form of human life that deserves respect. Indeed \n     you have said that human life begins at conception, that \n     fertilization produces a ``human being.'' To equate concern \n     for these beings with mere ``ideology'' is to dismiss the \n     entire history of efforts to protect human subjects from \n     research abuse.\n       Third, the statements you have made regarding the purported \n     medical applications of embryonic stem cells reach far beyond \n     any credible evidence, ignoring the limited state of our \n     knowledge about embryonic stem cells and the advances in \n     other areas of research that may render use of these cells \n     unnecessary for many applications. To make such exaggerated \n     claims, at this stage of our knowledge, is not only \n     scientifically irresponsible--it is deceptive and cruel to \n     millions of patients and their families who hope desperately \n     for cures and have come to rely on the scientific community \n     for accurate information.\n       What does science tell us about embryonic stem cells? The \n     facts can be summed up as follows:\n       At present these cells can be obtained only by destroying \n     live human embryos at the blastocyst (4-7 days old) stage. \n     They proliferate rapidly and are extremely versatile, \n     ultimately capable (in an embryonic environment) of forming \n     any kind of cell found in the developed human body. Yet \n     there is scant scientific evidence that embryonic stem \n     cells will form normal tissues in a culture dish, and the \n     very versatility of these cells is now known to be a \n     disadvantage as well--embryonic stem cells are difficult \n     to develop into a stable cell line, spontaneously \n     accumulate genetic abnormalities in culture, and are prone \n     to uncontrollable growth and tumor formation when placed \n     in animals.\n       Almost 25 years of research using mouse embryonic stem \n     cells have produced limited indications of clinical benefit \n     in some animals, as well as indications of serious and \n     potentially lethal side-effects. Based on this evidence, \n     claims of a safe and reliable treatment for any disease in \n     humans are premature at best.\n       Embryonic stem cells obtained by destroying cloned human \n     embryos pose an additional ethical issue--that of creating \n     human lives solely to destroy them for research--and may pose \n     added practical problems as well. The cloning process is now \n     known to produce many problems of chaotic gene expression, \n     and this may affect the usefulness and safety of these cells. \n     Nor is it proven that cloning will prevent all rejection of \n     embryonic stem cells, as even genetically matched stem cells \n     from cloning are sometimes rejected by animal hosts. Some \n     animal trials in research cloning have required placing \n     cloned embryos in a womb and developing them to the fetal \n     stage, then destroying them for their more developed tissues, \n     to provide clinical benefit--surely an approach that poses \n     horrific ethical issues if applied to humans.\n       Non-embryonic stem cells have also received increasing \n     scientific attention. Here the trajectory has been very \n     different from that of embryonic stem cells: Instead of \n     developing these cells and deducing that they may someday \n     have a clinical use, researchers have discovered them \n     producing undoubted clinical benefits and then sought to \n     better understand how and why they work so they can be put to \n     more uses. Bone marrow transplants were benefiting patients \n     with various forms of cancer for many years before it was \n     understood that the active ingredients in these transplants \n     are stem cells. Non-embryonic stem cells have been discovered \n     in many unexpected tissues--in blood, nerve, fat, skin, \n     muscle, umbilical cord blood, placenta, even dental pulp--and \n     dozens of studies indicate that they are far more versatile \n     than once thought. Use of these cells poses no serious \n     ethical problem, and may avoid all problems of tissue \n     rejection if stem cells can be obtained from a patient for \n     use in that same patient. Clinical use of non-embryonic stem \n     cells has grown greatly in recent years. In contrast to \n     embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells are in established or \n     experimental use to treat human patients with several dozen \n     conditions, according to the National Institutes of Health \n     and the National Marrow Donor Program (Cong. Record, \n     September 9, 2004, pages H6956-7). They have been or are \n     being assessed in human trials for treatment of spinal cord \n     injury, Parkinson's disease, stroke, cardiac damage, multiple \n     sclerosis, and so on. The results of these experimental \n     trials will help us better assess the medical prospects for \n     stem cell therapies.\n       In the case of many conditions, advances are likely to come \n     from sources other than any kind of stem cell. For example, \n     there is a strong scientific consensus that complex diseases \n     such as Alzheimer's are unlikely to be treated by any stem \n     cell therapy. When asked recently why so many people \n     nonetheless believe that embryonic stem cells will provide a \n     cure for Alzheimer's disease, NIH stem cell expert Ron McKay \n     commented that ``people need a fairy tale'' (Washington Post, \n     June 10, 2004, page A3). Similarly, autoimmune diseases like \n     juvenile diabetes, lupus and MS are unlikely to benefit from \n     simple addition of new cells unless the underlying problem--a \n     faulty immune system that attacks the body's own cells as \n     though they were foreign invaders--is corrected.\n       In short, embryonic stem cells pose one especially \n     controversial avenue toward understanding and (perhaps) \n     someday treating various degenerative diseases. Based on the \n     available evidence, no one can predict with\n\n[[Page S4204]]\n\n     certainty whether they will ever produce clinical benefits--\n     much less whether they will produce benefits unobtainable by \n     other, less ethically problematic means.\n       Therefore, to turn this one approach into a political \n     campaign--even more, to declare that it will be a ``top \n     priority'' or receive any particular amount of federal \n     funding, regardless of future evidence or the usual \n     scientific peer review process--is, in our view, \n     irresponsible. It is, in fact, a subordination of science to \n     ideology.\n       Because politicians, biotechnology interests and even some \n     scientists have publicly exaggerated the ``promise'' of \n     embryonic stem cells, public perceptions of this avenue have \n     become skewed and unrealistic. Politicians may hope to \n     benefit from these false hopes to win elections, knowing that \n     the collision of these hopes with reality will come only \n     after they win their races. The scientific and medical \n     professions have no such luxury. When desperate patients \n     discover that they have been subjected to a salesman's pitch \n     rather than an objective and candid assessment of \n     possibilities, we have reason to fear a public backlash \n     against the credibility of our professions. We urge you not \n     to exacerbate this problem now by repeating false promises \n     that exploit patients' hopes for political gain.\n       Signed by 57 doctors.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CORNYN). The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Report on Hurricane Katrina\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, last week the Senate Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs, of which I am a member, approved its \nreport titled ``Hurricane Katrina, A Nation Still Unprepared.'' The \ncommittee's distinguished chairman set today as the deadline for \nadditional views.\n  I reluctantly voted not to approve that draft of the report last week \nbecause it is seriously incomplete. While it is still lacking all of \nthe information, documents, and testimony which President Bush and his \nsubordinates denied the committee, last March 15 the ranking member \nasked the chairman to subpoena witnesses and documents that have been \nwithheld by the White House. Regrettably, she declined to do so.\n  Earlier this year, on January 12, the chairman and ranking member \nwrote the White House Chief of Staff, Mr. Andrew Card, regarding the \ninformation they had previously requested. Their letter stated, in \npart:\n\n       This practice (of withholding information) must cease.\n\n  It continued:\n\n       We are willing to discuss claims of executive privilege \n     asserted by the White House, either directly or through a \n     Federal agency. But we will not stand for blanket \n     instructions to refuse answering any questions concerning any \n     communications with the EOP [Executive Office of the \n     President].\n\n  Their insistence that either administration officials comply with \nthis oversight committee's rightful demands or the President invoke his \nexecutive privilege not to do so was entirely appropriate. \nUnfortunately, when Mr. Card and his subordinates still refused to \ncomply, the chairman denied the ranking member's request to issue \nsubpoenas.\n  Regrettably, at its markup of the draft report, the Senate committee \nfailed to support my motion to subpoena those documents and witnesses, \nwhich were being withheld by the White House without claim to executive \nprivilege, and which were being wrongfully denied by executive \nagencies.\n  The administration's refusal to comply and cooperate with this \ninvestigation is deplorable, as is the Homeland Security Committee's \nfailure to back the chairman and ranking member's proper insistence \nthat the White House do so. That committee is charged by the full \nSenate with the responsibility to oversee the agencies, programs, and \nactivities that are related to homeland security. The committee was \nexpressly directed by the Senate majority leader to examine the Bush \nadministration's failure to respond quickly or effectively to the \ndisasters caused by Hurricane Katrina. This investigation is not \ncomplete without all of the information requested from the \nadministration. Furthermore, the report's findings and conclusions can \nhardly be considered reliable if the White House has decided what \ninformation to provide and what information to withhold from the \ncommittee.\n  This unfortunate acquiescence confirms the judgment of the Senate \nDemocratic leader that an independent bipartisan commission was \nnecessary to ensure complete and unbiased investigation into the failed \nFederal, State, and local responses to Hurricane Katrina. His request \nhas been repeatedly denied by the majority, with the assurance that the \nSenate committee would fulfill those responsibilities. Tragically and \nreprehensibly, it has failed to do so. Thus, the committee failed the \nSenate's constitutional obligations to be an independent, coequal \nbranch of Government from the executive. It also failed the long-\nsuffering victims of Hurricane Katrina, who deserve to know why their \ngovernments failed them, and all of the American people, who depend \nupon their elected representatives to protect their lives and their \ninterests, without regard to partisan political considerations. That \npartisanship includes unjustified protection of an administration of \nthe same political party, as much as undue criticism of one from \nanother party.\n  That partisan protectionism is especially unwarranted given \nwidespread agreement about the urgent need to understand the failures \nduring and after Hurricane Katrina and to remedy them before another \nlarge-scale disaster, God forbid, should occur.\n  Now, 8 months after the hurricane, the lack of progress in cleanup, \nrepair, and reconstruction in devastated areas provides further \nevidence of the Federal Government's continuing failure to respond \nefficiently or effectively. There is no time in which the helping hand \nof Government is more urgently needed and more surely deserved than \nduring and after a disaster. Victims are damaged or devastated \nphysically, emotionally, and financially.\n  Local officials and their public services are overwhelmed, if not \ndestroyed. They need a Federal emergency response organization \ncomprised of experienced, dedicated professionals, who have the \nresources necessary to alleviate short-term suffering and commence \nlong-term recovery, and also have the authority to expeditiously commit \nthose resources.\n  What the failed Federal response to Hurricane Katrina showed is the \nutter ineptitude of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, known as \nFEMA. Even worse, FEMA's indifference and incompetence in the aftermath \nof Katrina was not an isolated instance. In my direct experience with \nFEMA's disaster relief responses in Minnesota, the agency is too often \na major obstruction to recovery projects rather than a principal ally.\n  Thus, I agree with the report's recommendation to create a new, \ncomprehensive emergency management organization, to prepare for and \nrespond to all disasters and catastrophes. I remain openminded about \nwhether this new entity should remain within the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, as this recommendation intends, or be established as a \nseparate Federal agency. The challenge for the committee, for all of \nCongress, and for the administration will be to actually recreate an \nexisting Federal agency which has become dysfunctional and \nnonfunctional. Merely ``reforming'' FEMA by rearranging some boxes and \nlines in its organizational chart, revising it, and giving its head a \nnew title, will be woefully inadequate. The new organization must be \nmore streamlined, centralized, and compact than its predecessor. It \nmust be less bureaucratic, less consumed with regulatory minutiae, and \nless resistant to local recovery initiatives. It must spend less time \ncreating complex plans and cumbersome procedures, and more time in \ntraining and perfecting action responses to emergency situations.\n  History shows that ``if a student does not learn the lesson, the \nteacher reappears.'' This report describes some of the most important \nlessons from the failed response to Hurricane Katrina. The committee's \nand this Congress's subsequent actions to correct these serious \ndeficiencies before the next catastrophe will indicate whether those \nlessons will be learned.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4205]]\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n         Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2005\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about bipartisan \nlegislation that is of critical importance to the people of Hawaii. S. \n147, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2005, would \nextend the Federal policy of self-governance and self-determination to \nHawaii's indigenous peoples, Native Hawaiians, by authorizing a process \nfor the reorganization of a Native Hawaiian governing entity for the \npurposes of a government-to-government relationship with the United \nStates.\n  Together with my senior Senator and the rest of Hawaii's \ncongressional delegation, I first introduced this bill in 1999. The \nbill passed the House in 2000, but, unfortunately, the Senate adjourned \nbefore we could complete consideration of that bill.\n  Since then, I have introduced a bill every Congress. In every \nCongress, the committees of jurisdiction--the Senate Committee on \nIndian Affairs and the House Committee on Resources--have favorably \nreported the bill and its companion measure.\n  I thank the majority leader, the senior Senator from Tennessee, who \nis working to uphold his commitment to bring this bill to the Senate \nfloor for a debate and rollcall vote. I must tell my colleagues that he \ndid try to meet his commitment in September 2005 and did schedule it \nfor the floor. But at that time, Katrina happened, and we took it off \nthe calendar.\n  I also appreciate the efforts of my colleague from Arizona who \nopposes the bill on substance, but has worked with me to uphold his \npromise to allow the bill to come to the floor for debate and rollcall \nvote.\n  S. 147 does three things. First, it authorizes the Office of Native \nHawaiian Relations in the Department of the Interior. The office is \nintended to serve as a liaison between Native Hawaiians and the United \nStates. It is not intended to become another Bureau of Indian Affairs, \nas the current program for Native Hawaiians will remain with the \nagencies that currently administer those programs.\n  Second, the bill establishes the Native Hawaiian interagency \ncoordinating group. This is a Federal working group to be composed of \nrepresentatives from Federal agencies who administer programs and \nservices for Native Hawaiians. There is no statutory requirement for \nthese agencies to work together. This working group can coordinate \npolicies to ensure consistency and prevent unnecessary duplication in \nFederal policies impacting Native Hawaiians.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes a process for the reorganization of the \nNative Hawaiian governing entity. And we ask: Why do we need to \norganize the entity? It is because the Native Hawaiian Government was \noverthrown with the assistance of U.S. agents in 1893. Rather than shed \nthe blood of the people, our beloved queen, Queen Lili`uokalani, \nabdicated her throne after being arrested and imprisoned in her own \nhome.\n  Following the overthrow, a republic was formed. Any reformation of a \nnative governing entity has been discouraged. Despite this fact, Native \nHawaiians have established distinct communities and retained their \nlanguage, culture, and traditions. They have done so in a way that also \nallows other cultures to flourish in Hawaii. Now their generosity is \nbeing used against them by opponents of this bill who claim that \nbecause Native Hawaiians do not have a governing entity, they cannot \npartake in the Federal policy of self-governance and self-determination \nthat is offered to their native brethren in the United States.\n  My bill authorizes a process for the reorganization of the Native \nHawaiian governing entity for the purposes of a federally recognized \ngovernment-to-government relationship. There are many checks and \nbalances in this process which has the structure necessary to comply--\nto comply--with Federal law and still maintains the flexibility for \nNative Hawaiians to determine the outcome of this process.\n  Further, my bill includes a negotiations process between the Native \nHawaiian governing entity, the State of Hawaii, and the United States \nto address issues such as lands, natural resources, assets, criminal \nand civil jurisdiction, and historical grievances. Nothing that is \ncurrently within the jurisdiction of another level of government can be \nconveyed to the Native Hawaiian Government without going through this \nnegotiations process.\n  I am proud of the fact that this bill respects the rights of Hawaii's \nindigenous peoples through a process that is consistent with Federal \nlaw and it provides the structured process for the people of Hawaii to \naddress the longstanding issues which have plagued both Native \nHawaiians and non-Native Hawaiians since the overthrow of the Kingdom \nof Hawaii.\n  I want to reiterate to my colleagues that this bill is not race \nbased. This bill is based on the Federal policies toward indigenous \npeoples. Those who characterize this bill as race based fail to \nunderstand the Federal policies toward indigenous peoples. Those who \ncharacterize this bill as race based fail to understand the legal and \npolitical relationship the United States had with the indigenous \npeoples and their governments preexisting the United States.\n\n  Finally, those who characterize this bill as race based are saying \nthat Native Hawaiians are not native enough. I find this offensive. And \nI ask that my colleagues join me in my efforts to bring parity to \nNative Hawaiians by enacting my bill.\n  This effort will continue from day-to-day here. We will continue to \nbring forward the history of Hawaii and the reasons why we are trying \nto enact this bill, not only for the benefit of the indigenous people \nof Hawaii but for the benefit of the United States as well.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/09/senate-section/article/S4177-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4177-S4205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETPLACE MODERNIZATION AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF \n                   2006--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 2:30 \nshall be equally divided.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I am going to be here numerous times this \nweek. This legislation is too important to have it shortcut. There is \nnot enough time in the debate to say it all at one time.\n  Last night, this body had the opportunity to vote on proceeding to \nchanges to the liability crisis that exists in health care today, but \nthe minority denied us the ability to move forward. They denied the \nability of the American people to hear an honest debate, to consider \nthoughtful amendments, and then to judge up or down on the content of \nthe legislation.\n  They had two opportunities: liability that was reform for all medical \nprofessionals; and, then, liability that was only changed for those who \nare OB/GYNs--that next generation of medical professionals who are \ngoing to deliver our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren, that \nprofession that is going to regenerate the population of this country \nand, in fact, is suffering today because of the high rate of liability \ncosts for the premiums they have to have.\n  Now we are here. We are in debate--30 hours of debate--to see if we \ncan proceed on a bill to bring small business group health insurance \nreforms into law, to enable small businesses in America to be able to \nprice insurance for their employees in the same way large corporations \nare able to produce products for their employees.\n  Today, small businesses' choice is between nothing and nothing. It is \nnot something and something. It is nothing and nothing. And what will \nwe do? We will debate, for 30 hours, whether we should proceed. Some \ndon't believe this is important enough or, if it is important enough, \nthat there ought to be all sorts of changes to it that are unrelated to \nthese millions of Americans for whom their employer cannot afford to \nprovide health care. Why? Because they are not big. The marketplace \ndiscriminates because they are small.\n  Let me give you some statistics about North Carolina. In North \nCarolina, 98 percent of firms with employees are small businesses. \nNinety-eight percent of my employers are shut out of the ability to \nnegotiate a reasonable cost of health care for their employees. Because \nof that, their employees have a choice between nothing and nothing.\n  We will have 30 hours of debate to see if we are going to proceed in \nthis body to provide something versus nothing--not something and \nsomething. How can anybody object to providing a choice of something \nfor those who do not have an option today?\n  Additionally, in North Carolina, we have 1.3 million uninsured \nindividuals. And 898,000--almost 900,000--North Carolinians are \nuninsured individuals in families or on their own with one full-time \nworker. Those are all individuals who potentially could be covered \nunder an individual or a family plan.\n  Of the 1.3 million who are uninsured in North Carolina, 900,000 could \nbe affected with this one piece of legislation in the Senate. But for \nthe next 30 hours, we will debate whether we proceed or never get to \nthe process of an up-or-down vote; in other words, it is a choice as to \nwhether we keep them with nothing and nothing and the uninsured numbers \nstay at 1.3 million or, in fact, we are going to provide something for \nNorth Carolina--900,000 people who today have nothing provided for \nthem.\n  Later today, I am going to come to this floor, and I am going to read \nfor my colleagues real letters, handwritten letters--handwritten \nletters--from people who live in North Carolina, whose choice is \nnothing and nothing. These are individuals who have the same health \nneeds, individuals who would like to have health insurance but whose \nemployers cannot afford it today, who want the opportunity in employer-\nbased health care, but because of the way the system is designed today, \nit is not achievable because it is not affordable for them.\n  We are here today and tomorrow, and we ought to be here as long as it \ntakes to make sure Americans at all levels have choices between \nsomething and something. These 30 hours will determine, in fact, \nwhether this historic institution will provide that for the American \npeople or we will walk away; whereby, once again, the American people \nwill be denied because some in this body do not believe there is a \nresponsibility to move to a point where there is an up-or-down vote. \nTruly, people can look and say: You have my future in your hands. My \nhealth security is in the hands of the Senate, the Members of the \nSenate, and whether they are going to, in fact, respond to that.\n  Well, I think people in North Carolina desperately want choice. I \nthink they desperately want this bill. They want their employers to \nhave the opportunity to be able to look at health insurance and to find \nit affordable. Why? Because that is their security. That is their \nability to have coverage.\n  My hope today is that the outcome of this legislation will not be a \nquick death such as last night with medical liability reform. We all \nagree health care is too expensive. We disagree on what the solutions \nare. But to end up with nothing, to deny the ability to move forward, \nto deny the ability for the American people's voice to be heard through \nthe amendment process on this floor is disgraceful.\n  My hope is after these 30 hours we will proceed, we will have a \nrobust debate on the amendments, and, at the end of the day, the \nAmerican people will have an opportunity for an up-or-down vote in the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today we are here in the middle of what \nis being called Health Week in the Senate. But rather than debating \nimportant lifesaving, life-enhancing\n\n[[Page S4178]]\n\nlegislation that has bipartisan support and could actually deliver hope \nand promise to millions of Americans, the Republican leadership in the \nSenate has, instead, decided to continue their political posturing, \nbusiness-as-usual approach to governing.\n  It is no wonder the American people have become disillusioned with \nthe leadership in Washington. Instead of debating and passing stem cell \nlegislation that will end suffering and extend lives, we are again \nfocusing on a partisan proposal to limit patient options, even when \nthey are harmed, for example, through medical malpractice.\n  Instead of passing stem cell legislation that will provide new \ntreatments and cures for debilitating diseases, such as Alzheimer's, \njuvenile diabetes, spinal cord injuries or cancer, we are debating a \nbill that would actually eliminate--eliminate--the health coverage that \nmany States currently provide to cover some of these very diseases, \nthat will cherry-pick, pitting the healthy versus older workers or \nthose who have some chronic disease or illness. And where there is no \ninsurance regulation, prices go up, insurance companies pick the \nhealthy, and they discriminate against older workers and those who are \nless healthy.\n  And they can deny coverage that States have thought important to have \nto meet the challenges of their individual States, sometimes very \nuniquely so.\n  So instead of wasting an entire week debating legislation that I \nbelieve ultimately has no chance of passing, we owe it to the American \npeople--to the millions of Americans and their families suffering from \nlife-altering disabilities and diseases--to demonstrate our Nation's \nfull commitment to finding a cure and doing all we can to help their \nhopes and dreams come true.\n  It has been almost 1 year since the House of Representatives passed \nthe Stem Cell Enhancement Act, and yet the Senate still has not passed \nthis vital legislation. I rise to urge the majority leader to do the \nsame and bring this important legislation to a vote in the Senate.\n  I was fortunate to have had the opportunity to vote in favor of the \nbill as a Member of the House, where we had broad bipartisan support \nfor the proposal. I believe that same bipartisan support exists in the \nSenate, which makes it even more difficult to understand why we cannot \ncome together and do something meaningful for those who are suffering.\n  My support of stem cell research is partially a reflection of my home \nState's commitment to innovation and discovery. In 2004, New Jersey \nbecame the second State in the Nation to enact a law that specifically \npermits embryonic stem cell research. We know that embryonic stem cells \nhave the unique ability to develop into virtually every cell and tissue \nin the body. And we know that numerous frozen embryos in fertility \nclinics remain unused by couples at the completion of their fertility \ntreatments. Why shouldn't they be allowed to donate those embryos to \nFederal research to save lives? We allow people to donate organs to \nsave lives. Why couldn't a couple, if they so chose, donate their \nfrozen embryos instead of simply discarding them?\n  The great State of New Jersey offers more scientists, engineers, and \ntechnicians per capita than any other State, and I am proud to \nrepresent the innovation and research taking place in New Jersey. Our \nState is not only known as the Garden State but also as America's \n``Medicine Chest.'' But for our State and our country to continue to \ncompete globally with health care breakthroughs, it is going to take \nmore than private and State support. It is going to take the support of \nour Nation. It is going to take leadership that looks beyond politics.\n  But, to me, similar to countless Americans and New Jerseyans, this \nissue is about more than our ability to compete as a nation. The \npromise of stem cell research is painfully personal. It means hope and \npromise--hope that people such as my mother who suffer from advanced \nAlzheimer's disease might one day be cured from the loneliness and \nconfusion caused by this horrible disease and the promise that future \ngenerations of families will not have to see their loved ones enter \ninto a world of dementia that robs them of the best years of their \nlives.\n  We hold the key to unlock that door. It is shameful that we have let \npartisan politics stand in the way of medical progress. We owe it to \nour parents, to our children, and our grandchildren to unlock that \ndoor.\n  Diabetes, Alzheimer's, cancer, Parkinson's--none of these diseases \nboast a party affiliation. And we cannot let ours keep us from doing \nwhat is right.\n  Today we have an opportunity to do what is right. But it is clear to \nme that the majority will again let that opportunity pass them by. I \nwill continue to fight, along with many of my colleagues, to see that \nthis bipartisan bill is debated on the Senate floor and becomes law. We \ncan no longer afford to delay this bill when it holds the key to curing \nsome of the most devastating and debilitating diseases of our day. As \nthe bill waits in the wings of the Capitol, children and adults alike \nwait for the cure they have been praying for.\n  This is Health Week. What could better demonstrate our commitment to \nthe health of this country than full Federal support for embryonic stem \ncell research? This bill has the potential to make a profound and \npositive impact on the health of millions of Americans. All we need is \nthe leadership to bring the bill to the floor for a vote for the \nhumanity of our Nation and for the mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, \nsons, and daughters across this country who are suffering or watching a \nloved one suffer.\n\n  This bill means so much more than ending restrictions placed on stem \ncell research. This bill means hope and promise to countless Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, like many of my colleagues, I rise today \nin support of S. 1955, the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization \nAct. As a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, I am proud to have worked on this legislation and to lend my \nsupport as a cosponsor.\n  First and foremost, I thank Chairman Enzi and Senator Ben Nelson, who \nhave worked so hard on this legislation. The chairman and Senator \nNelson did what many thought was impossible: they got the health \ninsurers, State insurance commissioners, and the small business \ncommunity to sit down together and work to find a compromise for small \nbusinesses. After over 10 years of deadlock, the Senate is finally \nconsidering a solution that will provide real relief to small \nbusinesses. This is truly a milestone. It has been said before, I am \nsure many times, that the House has passed this eight times, and we \nhave yet to find a solution. Now is the time.\n  Like many rural States, the Kansas economy is built on thousands of \nsmall businesses. Whether it is the farm implement store or the local \npharmacy, the beauty salon or the downtown coffee shop, these small \nbusinesses and their employees are the backbone of our communities. \nThey are what we are all about. But one nagging problem for virtually \nevery small business owner is the high cost of providing health \ninsurance. Most small businesses can't even afford to offer health \ninsurance to their employees, forcing many to go without health \ncoverage.\n  In Kansas, only about 41 percent--not even 50 percent, not even \nhalf--of our small businesses offer any health insurance coverage. This \nis in stark contrast to the 97 percent of our larger businesses that \noffer health insurance to their employees. Without such health \ninsurance coverage, employees are vulnerable to huge health care debts \nof their own, and it is harder for small employers to attract a good \nworker. I have literally heard from hundreds of Kansas small business \nowners and entrepreneurs, local Chamber of Commerce members over the \nyears who say they are forced to choose between staying in business or \nproviding the health care they deserve to their hard-working employees.\n  Take for example Kimberly Smith of Andover, KS. Kimberly has three \nchildren, including a 3-year-old with a mild heart condition. She is \nself-employed. She is a realtor. She is a good realtor. Like many, she \ndoes not have access to affordable health insurance. Because of this, \nKimberly and her family have been forced to go without health insurance \ncoverage, and now she must pay all of her medical costs out of her \npocket.\n\n[[Page S4179]]\n\n  Denise Breason from Lawrence, KS, is also facing the same crunch to \nfind affordable health care. Even though Denise is a hard-working small \nbusiness employee, she has been without health insurance for over a \nyear and a half and had to stop taking all of her medications because \nshe could no longer afford them without health insurance.\n  Denise Hulse and her husband went without health insurance for their \nfamily for years. They prayed their children would remain healthy so \nthey would not have to make a visit to the doctor or the emergency \nroom. In the end, her husband was forced to let his small business go \nand take a low-paying job, just because it came with health insurance. \nTo quote Denise:\n\n       It is sometimes very hard just making it in the small \n     business community, and very few small business owners are \n     rich enough to be able to afford the high costs of health \n     insurance for their families.\n\n  Another small business owner in Kansas told me he is paying over \n$2,000 a month each month in premiums alone for health insurance for \nhis family. This is more than his house payment, more than his utility \nbills and grocery expenses, all combined.\n  These stories go on and on, not limited to my home State of Kansas. I \nheard these stories when I had the privilege of serving in the House of \nRepresentatives. Eight times we approached this issue. Eight times we \npassed a bill. Now it is our turn in the Senate, and it is long \noverdue. I hear these stories from small business owners and employees \nacross the country. Small businesses all share one main concern: \nfinding affordable health care insurance.\n  This is why I am asking my colleagues today to support and pass the \nHealth Insurance Marketplace Modernization Act. The real question is, \nDo we take it up? Do we vote for cloture? Or do we let the House pass \nthe bill the ninth time while we sit in the Senate and do nothing for \nthose who cannot afford health insurance? I cannot imagine us doing \nthat at this particular time.\n  This legislation allows small businesses to pool together through an \nassociation and offer health insurance. Everything has to have an \nacronym in Washington. This one does, too. It is SBHP. I won't venture \ninto what that acronym will be called, but it stands for small business \nhealth care plan. It is going to give small businesses an affordable \nchoice for health care.\n  The legislation is built on the fact that small businesses, unlike \nlarge companies such as Microsoft or others, or unions, do not have the \npower to negotiate affordable prices for health care.\n  The concept of small business pooling together is not new. I \nsupported legislation when I served in the House. In fact, the \nassociation health plan legislation has passed the House numerous times \nover the years without any action in the Senate. Now we finally have a \nsolution that will provide meaningful relief to small businesses across \nKansas and the country. We all know small businesses face many \npressures in running the businesses. I believe we must enact \ncommonsense policies to overcome these hurdles. We should allow the \nlocal farm implement dealer to pool together with other dealers in \nKansas and across the Nation to purchase affordable care.\n  Kimberly Smith should no longer have to worry about finding \naffordable health insurance for her children. Denise Breason should not \nhave to stop taking her medications just because she works for a small \nbusiness and cannot afford her care. Denise Hulse and her husband \nshould not have been forced to let go of their small business, their \ndream they loved, just to find affordable health coverage. Instead, we \nneed to find these hard-working folks affordable options that allow \nthem to continue to contribute to our small communities, rural and \nsmalltown America. This is why I support the legislation.\n  As I stand before my colleagues today, I know there have been strong \nconcerns expressed about this and previous association plan proposals. \nHowever, the small business health plans that are created under this \nbill have the necessary protections in place to address these concerns. \nI would like my colleagues who have concerns to please pay attention.\n  The small business health plans will be regulated by the States, not \nthe Federal Government. The small business plans will have to play by \nthe same set of rules as other small group health plans. They must \npurchase their insurance through the regular insurance market. They \ncannot self-insure. Finally, the SBHPs may offer coverage that varies \nfrom State benefit mandates, but they must also offer an alternative \nplan that provides comprehensive coverage. This gives the consumer a \nchoice in choosing a health plan that best fits their needs, and that \nis the key.\n  I have heard concerns from organizations and individuals who fear \nthis bill will take away their coverage for cancer screenings, mental \nhealth benefits, or any other mandates required by State law. However, \nI stress that this is simply not true. Small business, under this bill, \nwill have access to a more comprehensive plan which will cover \nscreenings, mental health services, or numerous other benefits. \nHowever, it is up to the small businesses to decide whether such a \ncomprehensive plan is right for them.\n  The purpose of this language is to give small businesses the option \nof choosing comprehensive benefits but not requiring them to buy such a \nrich package or a package they cannot afford. Simply put, this \nlegislation trusts small businesses to choose a health care plan that \nbest fits their needs and puts these small businesses, not health \ninsurers or the Government, in the driver's seat when choosing their \nhealth care coverage. If a small employer wants to choose a more \naffordable plan for himself, his family, and his employees, he should \nhave that option. Under this legislation, he has that option. However, \nhe should not be forced by law to buy benefits that may be beyond what \nhe can afford or beyond what he and his employees really need.\n  I want to put the problem of mandating coverage in perspective. While \nsmall employers want to provide affordable health insurance for their \nemployees, expensive and burdensome benefit mandates make doing so very \ndifficult. Small firms and self-employed people have almost no leverage \nwith insurance companies. In addition, they have to deal with an \nenormous array of State-level health insurance regulations. I don't \nthink you read them; I think you weigh them. All of the benefit \nmandates, all of these regulations add to the cost and the complexity \nof the coverage.\n  In contrast, however, big businesses generally don't have to deal \nwith burdensome regulations. Federal law lets large companies, such as \nMicrosoft and GM, and unions bypass expensive State benefit mandates to \nprovide affordable comprehensive coverage for their workers. I ask my \ncolleagues, why shouldn't small businesses be able to enjoy these same \nopportunities?\n  Today, there are more than 1,800 State mandates, making it nearly \nimpossible for associations to offer uniform and affordable benefit \npackages on a regional or national basis. Taken together, these benefit \nmandates create a confusing web, an unfunded mandate that prices many \nAmericans out of the health insurance market. The Congressional Budget \nOffice and the Government Accountability Office and others have found \nthat State-imposed benefit mandates raise the cost of health insurance \nanywhere from 5 to 22 percent. In addition, CBO estimates that every 1-\npercent increase in insurance costs results in 200,000 to 300,000 more \nuninsured Americans. In reality, benefit mandates represent an unfunded \nmandate on employers because insurance companies simply pass the cost \nof each mandate along. When the cost goes up, the coverage goes down. \nYou have more uninsured.\n  The legislation we are debating today simply provides an opportunity \nfor a small business health plan to relax these burdensome mandates to \noffer affordable health insurance to small businesses on a regional or \nnational basis, just like the big businesses and unions currently do. \nWe should not be forcing small businesses to choose between staying in \nbusiness or offering health insurance to their employees. Boy, that is \na Hobson's choice. Instead, we need to give them more affordable health \ninsurance choices and be willing to trust them to choose the option \nthat makes the most sense for themselves, their families, their \nemployees, and the future of their businesses.\n\n[[Page S4180]]\n\n  I know this bill is not perfect. Seldom do we or the other body pass \na bill that is perfect. I have long said that we usually achieve the \nbest possible bill, but sometimes must settle for the best bill \npossible.\n  I appreciate the concerns that have been expressed with this \nlegislation. However, I express to my colleagues that I think this bill \nis the best opportunity we have for easing the burden on our small \nbusinesses and allowing them to finally offer affordable health care \ninsurance to their employees. I am proud to support this legislation. I \nurge my colleagues to do the same and vote for cloture. Eight times in \nthe House, zero in the Senate. That should not be a moment of pride for \nthis body. Let us vote for cloture and let us support this bill.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to associate myself with the remarks \nof the Senator from Kansas, and especially with the efforts of the \nSenator from Wyoming who brought this bill to the floor of the Senate. \nThis is a very significant piece of legislation in our efforts to try \nto make sure more Americans have the opportunity to get fair, \naffordable, and good health care insurance. It is a piece of \nlegislation about people. It is directed at people who work in what is \ntermed ``small business.'' That is the person who works as a cook in a \nlocal family restaurant or a person who works as a mechanic in a garage \nor a person who runs a mom-and-pop real estate agency.\n  Literally, there are tens of thousands, millions of these small \nentrepreneurial centers throughout this country. Most of these folks \ndon't make a great deal of money. They work very hard. They are taking \ncare of their families. One of their biggest concerns is whether they \ncan get health insurance so if somebody should get sick who works with \nthem or should somebody in their family get sick, they will be able to \nhave adequate care. But too many of them are not able to afford health \ninsurance. Approximately 22 million people who are in these small \nbusinesses, these small retail businesses, small manufacturing \nbusinesses, small entrepreneurial shops, don't have insurance. Another \n5 million people, who are sole proprietors and work by themselves, do \nnot have a number of employees working with them, also don't have \ninsurance. That is 27 million people who fall into this category. So \nSenator Enzi has brought forward a bill to try to address that problem. \nIt is going to try to make it possible for these people who work so \nhard and who would like to have insurance policies that are affordable \nto get them. By allowing them to band together in trade groups, so \nrealtors can come together, as well as automobile dealers, garage \nowners, restaurant associations, and hotel associations can come \ntogether and form a large enough group so that they can create enough \nof a mass of interest and buying power so that they can go out and \npurchase insurance. That is something they cannot do today as \nindividuals. This bill allows them to do that.\n  It is hard to understand how anybody could oppose this concept. But \npeople do oppose it, and I think most of the opposition comes from \nfolks who either misunderstand the bill or who are using the bill as a \nway to energize their constituencies with information that is at the \nmargin of believable, to be kind. The biggest opposition today to this \nbill, other than insurance companies who might see this as a \ncompetitor, comes from these groups that represent various different \ndiseases and have compelling stories to tell about their diseases. They \nhave gone to the State legislatures and they have gotten them to put in \nplace what is known as mandates so any policy sold in that State has to \ncover that disease.\n  As was pointed out by the Senator from Kansas, every time that \nhappens that increases the cost of the insurance in that State. For \nevery 1 percent increase in the cost of insurance--and some of these \nspecific mandates are expensive enough so they by themselves represent \na 1-percent increase in insurance premiums. But there are 200,000 to \n300,000 people who cannot afford insurance because the insurance bills \ngo up and 200,000 or 300,000 people fall off the rolls.\n  What this bill tries to do is address the issue of the person who has \nfallen off the rolls, the person who hasn't been able to get the \ninsurance, by giving them an option that they can buy, which they feel \nis adequate to their needs--it may not have a specific mandate in it \nbecause maybe they don't need those mandates to be covered, but at \nleast it gives them the basic coverage they need in order to get \nthrough their health insurance risks.\n  The flip side of this coin, which isn't talked about much but which \nis fairly obvious, is that these people have no insurance at all. When \nthese mandate groups argue, if you pass this bill, you are going to \nundermine the capacity of people to get insurance for this disease \ngroup, that is a totally misleading presentation because the people \nthis is focused on don't have insurance to begin with. You cannot take \nsomething away from somebody who doesn't have it. If a person doesn't \nhave an insurance policy, he doesn't have the mandates that the \ninsurance policy requires.\n  If a cook working in a restaurant or a garage attendant working at a \ngas station or a realtor working in a small mom-and-pop real estate \nagency doesn't have any health insurance, you cannot take away from \nthem mandated coverage for health insurance because they don't have it \nto begin with.\n  What this bill tries to do is allow that individual to participate in \na group where they will have health insurance as an option. And if they \nhave that option of health insurance, without mandates, they also have \nto have--that group, that restaurant, that real estate agency, that \ngarage the option to purchase a fully mandated policy. In other words, \nit is a policy that is, for lack of better terms, a higher option \npolicy, where you have everything covered. It has to track the five \nStates in this country which have the most mandates on their insured. \nSo the bill is balanced in that area of mandates.\n\n  A second opposition to this bill has been the fact that it moves from \ncommunity rating to a banding system. What does that mean? It \nessentially means that on a community rating you basically force \neverybody to be rated the same, no matter their health risk or age \ngroup or occupation. With a rating system, you adjust marginally for \nwhat health experience it may be or what age it is. Adjustments can be \nmade, but they are limited by the State. If you have a community-rated \nsystem, you inevitably have a much higher cost going in for a lot of \nthose people who are banding together in groups, who maybe don't have \nas much risk as others. But if you have a rating system, some people \nare going to be lower in insurance costs and some people will be \nhigher. They are going to be within a relatively narrow band.\n  So this bill allows these policies to be offered with a rating \nsystem, with a band. In New Hampshire--and this has been referred to on \nthe floor by the Senator from Massachusetts--they had a very bad \nexperience because, regrettably, New Hampshire did it the wrong way. We \nhad a community rating system and then we went to a band rating system \nbecause we recognized that was better policy. I congratulate the State \nfor that, but they didn't go to it correctly. They went sort of cold \nturkey. The practical effect was that one day people got one type of \nbill, and the next day they got a different type of bill. For some \npeople it went up, for some people it went down, and it was a rather \nstartling event for them. We looked at that experience in committee and \nsaid we don't want to emulate what happened in New Hampshire. We want \nto make this a much more responsible approach. We put into place a \nglidepath, 5-year phasing, so there will be plenty of time to adjust \nand to be able to handle this.\n  That type of opposition to this bill, clearly, in my opinion, has \nbeen addressed. It has been addressed specifically because of the New \nHampshire experience. So it is a misrepresentation to say that \ncontinues to be a major issue with this bill. As a practical matter, \nthere are about 85 million people in this country who work in small \nbusinesses. That is a huge number. They deserve the opportunity to have \nthis type of insurance made available to them. They should have the \nsame opportunity as big businesses--the IBMs,\n\n[[Page S4181]]\n\nthe Microsofts, the major manufacturers--in our country, if for no \nother reason than they happen to be the engine of economic activity in \nthis country. Most of the new jobs are created by small businesses, the \nmoms and pops who are willing to build that restaurant, take on that \nexciting opportunity, start small and grow. When they do that, they \nought to have the opportunity to also have an insurance option \navailable. But many of them don't because it is not affordable, because \nof the way the States work the system, and because of that these small \ngroups, as individuals, have no buying power. So this bill has \naddressed that need.\n  It is not the answer. This isn't a magic wand, but it is another \nopportunity put on, let's say, the cafeteria line of insurance that \ngives a small businessperson the chance to go down that cafeteria line \nand say: Yes, this plan works for the five people who work for me, and \nI am going to buy into the plan because I can afford it. Today, most \npeople who walk down that cafeteria line, if they are small \nbusinesspeople, don't choose anything because they cannot afford the \nprice of anything, or many of them are in that capacity, that 22 \nmillion. This will take a fairly significant number of those folks and \ngive them the opportunity to purchase health insurance.\n  So it will take people from a noninsurance status to an insured \nstatus, from a situation where if they get sick, they don't know how \nthey are going to pay for it, to a situation where if they get sick, \nthey will have coverage. It is very important financially to most \npeople and, obviously, it is important psychologically to everybody. So \nit is a good bill, something we should support.\n  I do think much of the opposition to it is misguided because it \ndoesn't recognize that the basic goal is to take people who don't have \ninsurance today and get them insurance. Therefore, the arguments around \nmandates are irrelevant to that group of people and the argument of \ncommunity rating as I think we will address.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Wyoming for bringing this bill \nforward. I look forward to working with him on this bill.\n  I want to speak on another matter briefly because there is a lot \ngoing on that is very good in this country relative to the economy, and \nit is not being highlighted.\n  Today, there was an editorial in the New York Times that said we \nshould not extend the tax cuts put into place in 2003. They say those \ntax cuts should not be extended in the areas of capital gains and \ndividends. That argument is good in 1930s economics. It is the old left \ntheory of tax policy, which is that you increase revenues by constantly \nincreasing taxes on people. It has been proven wrong this year, last \nyear, and the year before. It was proven wrong by John Kennedy when he \nput in place the first tax cut. It was proven wrong by Ronald Reagan \nwhen he put in place the tax cut of 1980. And it has been proven wrong \nagain.\n\n  In fact, in the first 6 months of this year, tax revenues jumped 11 \npercent, $134 billion, and a large percentage of that is the increase \nin tax revenues from capital gains and the fact that we have reduced \nthe rate on capital gains which causes people to free up assets. Over \nthe last 3 years, revenues have jumped dramatically--in fact, last year \nby 14 percent, and the year before by 7 percent, and next year they are \nprojected to jump again. Why is that? It is because we are seeing an \neconomic boom which has created 5.3 million new jobs since those tax \ncuts were put into place. There have been more jobs added in the United \nStates in that period than Europe and Japan combined have created. And \nthose jobs have led to economic activity and, in turn, have led to \nrevenues to the Federal Government.\n  Revenues to the Federal Government are dramatically increasing \nbecause the economy is growing, and the economy is growing because the \nburden on those people who go out and are willing to take risks through \ncapital investment, dividend activity, through income tax activity--\nthose people are taking risks and creating economic activity and, as a \nresult, creating jobs which, in turn, create taxpayers, which, in turn, \nincreases the Federal revenues.\n  The numbers don't lie. They are huge, significant, and they confirm, \nonce again, that John Kennedy was right, Ronald Reagan was right, and \nGeorge Bush was right. By making tax rates fair, especially on capital \nformation, you energize economic activity and, in turn, you create \nmassive increases in Federal revenues. Regrettably, I must say the New \nYork Times is wrong.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am so happy to come to the floor today \nbecause the Senate is finally debating how we can help small businesses \nacross our country afford health care for their employees. Just as \nSenator Gregg has mentioned how important it is to provide benefits to \ngroups who want to invest, and to individuals and companies who want to \ninvest and grow the economy, so too it is critically important that we \nprovide small businesses the ability to invest in themselves. That is \nwhat I want to talk about today.\n\n  Small businesses are critical to this country. They are critical to \nrural States such as mine in Arkansas, but they are the engine of our \neconomy in this great Nation. They are the No. 1 employers. That is why \nit is so important that we get this right, that we provide them with a \ntool that will allow them to reinvest in themselves and their employees \nand their communities, so that we can keep that engine going.\n  I applaud my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, for all he has \ndone in bringing about this debate. He has worked hard and genuinely on \nthis issue, and I appreciate very much what he has put into this. He \nhas helped us make sure this is not a debate about whether this is a \ncritical issue.\n  This reminds me of something I was taught by my father who said: If \nit is worth doing, it is worth doing right. It is worth doing \ncorrectly. That is what we are here to talk about today.\n  I believe very strongly that our small businesses are so important to \nus--our self-employed individuals in this country have the greatest \nspirit in the world--and it is so important that we should not offer \nthem a second-rate opportunity. We should offer them the same \nopportunity we have as Federal employees and Members of Congress: The \nopportunity to build a pool that will offer them greater access, \ngreater choice at a lower cost, by pooling all of themselves together \nacross this great country, while maintaining the quality, which is what \nwe do for ourselves. We maintain the quality of the product of the \nhealth insurance we receive or have access to as Federal employees and \nMembers of Congress, and we should do no less for the small businesses \nand the self-employed individuals in this great country.\n  So I hope, as we continue this debate, we will remember those hard-\nworking American families who are depending on us not just to do \nsomething, but to do what is right and fair, and offering what we see \nas fair tax policy and offering what we see as fair access to the same \nquality product of health care and health insurance that we as Members \nof Congress get.\n  The small business health care crisis is undoubtedly one of the \nissues I hear the most about when I return home to Arkansas. In fact, \nin every community in our Nation, as well as millions of working \nfamilies across this country, we are seeing the difficulty of having \naccess to quality health care and health insurance and the ability to \npay for that.\n  There are approximately 46 million Americans currently without health \ninsurance, including 456,000 Arkansans whom I am responsible for in \nterms of producing a product that is worthy of those individuals. Small \nbusinesses are the No. 1 source of our jobs in Arkansas. Yet only 26 \npercent of the businesses with fewer than 50 employees offer health \ninsurance coverage. Workers at these businesses, which again are the \nengine of our economy, are most likely to be uninsured. In fact, 20 \npercent of working-age adults are uninsured in Arkansas. This number is \nalarming, and addressing this problem should be a national priority, \nand we should approach it as if we are going to do the best job that we \nare capable of doing. That is why we are here today, to talk about \nthat.\n  Mr. President, 224 major organizations are opposed to the proposal \nthat\n\n[[Page S4182]]\n\nSenator Enzi has brought before us. Two hundred-and-twenty-four is a \nhuge number: everywhere from diabetes to mental illness to hospital \nfederations. These individuals understand how important the years have \nbeen in allowing State insurance commissioners to be able to set \nmandates in order to cover what is important to individuals in their \nStates, and what is important to small businesses and everyone in those \nStates. Those States have the right and the ability to figure out what \nis important to them, and the majority of them have agreed on many of \nthese major issues.\n  Those who lack health insurance do not get access to timely and \nappropriate health care. We know that, and we see it. We see it in the \ncost of Medicare when people don't get health care for 20 or 25 years \nwhen they are in the working marketplace as a small business owner or \nemployee, and then they become more costly to us when they hit Medicare \nage because they haven't received the screenings, the timely visits to \nthe doctor, and they haven't been getting the kind of health care they \ntruly need. They have less access to these important screenings. They \ndon't have access to the state-of-the-art technology that exists or \nprescription drugs, which is another piece of what can help keep down \nthe cost of health care.\n  Working families need help with this problem. The Institute of \nMedicine has reported that 18,000 people die each year because they are \nuninsured. The fact is, being insured does matter. It makes a big \ndifference. It makes a difference in our health care costs. It makes a \ndifference in whether you are going to survive--longevity, the ability \nto care for your family. It makes a big difference. We have reached a \njuncture where we are going to debate how we deal with those who are \nuninsured, whether we are going to give them substandard coverage or \nwhether we are going to give them the coverage that we have.\n\n  Again, I commend my colleagues, Senator Enzi from Wyoming and Senator \nNelson from Nebraska, for their leadership. I appreciate their hard \nwork on this issue. But I do disagree, because I believe that the devil \nis in the details on this issue, and I am deeply concerned about the \nvery harsh and unintended consequences that will occur if S. 1955 were \nto become law.\n  Senator Durbin and myself have been working together for several \nyears to come up with what we believe is a better health care plan for \nAmerica's small businesses. What we have done is looked to a 40-year-\nold tested delivery system, and it is the one that we ourselves use. It \nis a Federal plan that takes the best of what Government can do and \ncombines it with the best of what private industry can do. The private \nmarketplace and the competition that it can create allows the \nGovernment to pool all of its Federal employees and use that pool as a \nnegotiating tool to bring us greater choice at a lower cost.\n  About 3 years ago, I suppose it was, my staff and I were discussing \nthe way we could help small businesses, and I thought about the way my \nSenate office operates. It operates much like a small business in my \nhome State and here. As I looked at my employees, I saw that I had two \nemployees, one with 26 years with the Federal Government, another with \n30 years with the Federal Government. I had two women who had delivered \nbabies and were on maternity leave. I had some, such as myself, with \nsmall children and a husband that is on my plan, and then I had a host \nof young, healthy staffers who were single. But I had a whole array of \ndifferent individuals who needed a tailor-made insurance plan for their \nneeds. While there are similarities in our Senate office and small \nbusinesses, there are also some obvious differences. One of the most \nglaring contrasts is access to affordable and quality health care. I \nsaw what my office went through and realized that is what small \nbusinesses are going through. I knew we could do better. I knew we \ncould take the plan of what we have and apply it to small businesses.\n  Last year, more than 8 million people were banded together in the \nFederal employees purchasing pool, and that gave us choices among 10 \nnational health insurance plans and a variety of local insurance plans, \nand a total of 278 private insurance plans from the private \nmarketplace. Not government-run--not government-run health care at \nall--but health care from the private industry, health insurance from \nthe private industry that was created by competition of the multiple \nFederal employees across the country. It offered us greater access, \ngreater choices at a lower cost.\n  So I am here to ask this question: Why don't we try to give small \nbusinesses access to that same type of private health insurance option \nthat Members of Congress and Federal employees enjoy today? Rather than \nreinvent the wheel, why don't we create a program for small businesses \nthat is based on our Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan, through the \nFEHBP, by pooling them, the small businesses, together in one \nnationwide pool. That is exactly what Senator Durbin and I have \nproposed in our Small Employers Health Benefit Program. By pooling \nsmall businesses across America into one risk and purchasing pool \nsimilar to the FEHBP, our program will allow employers to reap the \nbenefit of group purchasing power and streamline administrative costs \nas well as access to more plan choices. The SEHBP, as we have \nintroduced, lowers costs for small businesses in two key ways: It pools \nthem into one national pool across the country, therefore spreading the \nrisk between the healthy and the sick, the young, the old, those who \nlive and work in the remotest parts of this great land and those who \nwork in the most urban areas. Second, our plan significantly lowers \nadministrative costs for small businesses.\n  Two economists have estimated that SEHBP would save small businesses \nbetween 27 and 37 percent annually, even if they don't take advantage \nof the tax cut that we offset costs with by insuring lower income \nworkers. We provide a tax cut to small businesses, and for the life of \nme, I can't figure out why those on the other side of the aisle, for \nthe first time I have ever noticed, will fight a tax cut for small \nbusinesses. Providing small business a tax cut to be able to engage in \nwhat is such an important tool in getting themselves and their \nemployees insured makes good sense. What a great investment.\n  Senator Gregg was talking about balancing all of that and the \neconomy. What a great way to balance what corporate America gets and \ntheir ability to deduct health insurance costs that they have and small \nbusiness getting a tax cut for investing in their employees and health \nbenefits for them. Under our bill, employers will receive an annual tax \ncredit for contributions made on behalf of their workers who make \n$25,000 per year or less. And if the employer contributes 60 percent or \nmore to the health insurance premium of an employee making $25,000 or \nless, the employer will receive a 25-percent tax credit. And the tax \ncredits increase with the number of people covered and the proportion \nof premium the employer chooses to cover. Also, the employer receives a \nbonus tax credit for signing up in the first year of the program, \nbecause we know from the example of the Federal employees that the more \nemployees who are in the pool, the greater advantage to everyone \nconcerned. Small businesses will save thousands of dollars--even more--\nunder our plan.\n  Segmenting the market into different association pools, as S. 1955 \ndoes under Senator Enzi's bill, will not achieve these savings that \nwould be created by instituting one large pool with all of those small \nbusinesses and self-employed individuals. Each association will be \nadministering to a separate group with a different administrative \nstructure and different costs, obviously. More funds would be going to \nadministrative costs as opposed to serving the people with a quality \nhealth plan. Our SEHBP would have one administrative structure and \ncould pool approximately 53 million workers together, therefore \nbalancing the risk of sick and healthy, young and old, rural and urban, \nfor affordable rates for everybody. Why wouldn't we want to make our \npool as big as it possibly could be, as we do with the Federal workers?\n  I believe our plan takes a real moderate and balanced approach that \ncombines the best of what Government can do with the best of what the \nprivate sector can do, and preserving important coverage for preventive \nhealth\n\n[[Page S4183]]\n\ncare treatment such as diabetes supplies, mammograms, prostate \nscreening, maternity and well-baby care, immunization, things that \nStates themselves have decided are important enough to mandate coverage \nfor and ensure that the people of their State are going to get the safe \nand important coverage of illnesses that are critical to them in their \nState.\n  Like the FEHB Plan, our program does not promote Government-run \nhealth care, but it harnesses the power of market competition to bring \ndown health insurance costs using a proven Government negotiator in the \nOffice of Personnel Management, OPM, which is the negotiator for our \nplan. We, once a year, as Federal employees, can choose among 270-plus \nplans. We are able to actually benefit from that proven Government \nnegotiator and the harnessing of that power.\n  Our legislation, S. 2510, has been endorsed by many organizations--\nthe National Association of Women Business Owners, Small Business \nMajority, the American Medical Society, the American Diabetes \nAssociation, the National Mental Health Association, the Cancer \nSociety, and many more that have realized how important it is to use a \nproven example, a proven structure that maintains quality but helps by \npooling and bringing down those costs.\n  The Mental Health Liaison Group, representing over 35 national mental \nhealth organizations, wrote to us and said about our bill:\n\n       S. 2510 does not sacrifice quality of coverage for \n     affordability or allow the offering of second class health \n     insurance to small businesses. Within the FEHBP program, \n     small business owners, employees and their family members \n     would be covered by all the consumer protections in their \n     home states--including hard-won state mental health parity \n     laws and mandated benefit laws.\n\n  The American Academy of Pediatrics, writing to us on behalf of over \n60,000 primary care pediatricians and pediatric specialists, wrote:\n\n       Through the benefits of pooling small businesses and \n     providing tax cuts to small employers, small pediatric \n     practices will be assisted in the health insurance market \n     without sacrificing health care services for children.\n\n  The American Diabetes Association wrote to us and said:\n\n       While other proposals seeking to provide health benefits \n     for small businesses . . . have exempted or eliminated \n     coverage for important diabetes care protections, [our bill,] \n     S. 2510, will allow individuals with diabetes to receive the \n     important health care coverage they require to remain healthy \n     and productive members of the workforce.\n\n  This is not just about quality of life, although many of us believe \nthat is very important. We as Members of Congress enjoy a quality of \nlife because of the very healthy health insurance program we are \noffered. We want our small businesses that are vital to our economy to \nenjoy that same opportunity. But it is also about economics. It is \nabout making sure we keep our workforce, particularly our small \nbusinesses and their workforce, healthy and thriving and productive and \nin the workplace. It is about making sure America's working individuals \nand working families get the health care they need before they reach \n65. When they hit 65 in the Medicare Program, then they are going to be \nmore costly to Government because they are not going to have gotten the \nhealth care they needed and deserved in their working years.\n  I believe our plan is better in so many ways. I am proud we are \nhaving this debate, and I hope so many people will realize we can do \nbetter. We can do better and make sure we truly elevate small \nbusinesses and self-employed people to the same level we hold \nourselves, in providing them the access to the same quality type of \nhealth care.\n  Our SEHBP bill offers tax cuts for small employers. Senator Enzi's \nbill does not. SEHBP relies on a proven program. It is based on the \nsuccessful Federal Employees Health Benefit Program which has \nefficiently and effectively provided extensive benefit choices at \naffordable prices to Members of Congress and Federal employees for \ndecades. For decades, we have had a proven program out there that \nproves you can harness the competitive nature of the marketplace, and \nwith the oversight of Government and the State mandates, you can \nactually provide that quality of health insurance at a lower cost. By \npooling small businesses together and allowing OPM to negotiate with \nprivate health insurance companies on their behalf, they, too, could \nhave access to this wide variety.\n  On the other hand, Senator Enzi and Senator Nelson's bill establishes \na new set of responsibilities at the U.S. Department of Labor, to \nadminister an untried and an untested program. We don't reinvent the \nwheel. What we do is use what already exists. To invent a new section \nof the Department of Labor to administer Senator Enzi's bill is going \nto take time and money. We are not going to know how it needs to be \nadministered through the Department of Labor. They have never done it \nbefore. Even the Department of Labor employees currently enjoy benefits \nfrom the health insurance program that is negotiated by the Office of \nPersonnel Management. So it is hard to believe they are going to want \nto go to another system.\n  SEHBP offers individual self-employed workers the same access to \nhealth insurance that is offered to group businesses. SEHBP defines \nsmall businesses as groups of 1 to 100, so an individual self-employed \nperson will be treated exactly as a business with 2 or more people. Any \nbusiness with 1 to 100 employees is eligible to participate in what we \nare trying to do.\n  Under Senator Enzi's bill, the self-employed people are not pooled \nwith the small businesses, unless they are mandated by State law. And \nthere are not that many State laws that actually mandate that. But the \nself-employed people in 36 States, including Arkansas, will not have \naccess to the same negotiated rates of businesses with 2 or more \npeople. They will be pulled out of that pool and rated on their own. \nThat means, if they are younger women of childbearing years or perhaps \nthey are older workers at 50 or 55 and are diabetic, they will be rated \ncompletely separate from the pool, which means they will be segregated \nand treated differently. They don't get to enjoy the benefit of a \nlarger risk pool which could bring down their costs and offer them \ngreater choice.\n  Our bill also ensures access to health care specialists. Many States \nhave passed laws requiring insurers to cover certain health care \nproviders, including dentists or psychologists or chiropractors. All \nthree of these and many more are required by our State of Arkansas law. \nI know the people of my State enjoy the assurance they have of knowing \nthat their State regulator, their State insurance commissioner, is \nlooking out for their needs. They can do that better on a State level. \nThat is why we have always left those types of regulatory issues up to \nour State--because they know and can work.\n  Can you imagine being a small business, or better yet an employee of \na small business, having to call some big, huge, Federal bureaucratic \noffice to request or to complain or to have your concerns heard about \nwhat is not covered under your insurance plan? No, they call the State \ninsurance commissioner today, and that is the way it should be. The \nState insurance commissioner can then respond to the concerns of their \nconstituency and has done so very well over many years.\n\n  The coverage for diabetes supplies, mammography, and other important \nscreenings are mandated by State law which would be preempted by what \nSenator Enzi is trying to do. Many States have passed laws requiring \nhealth insurance companies to cover these benefits because insurers \nsimply were not doing it. It did not happen because the insurance \ncommissioners just decided on a whim to do it; it is because the \ninsurers were not covering it. Why do we have to go back and relearn \nthat lesson?\n  For 40 years, the Federal Government has used the effectiveness of \nthe pool of the 8 million Federal employees and been able to enjoy the \nprotections that are there, guided by State insurance commissioners.\n  Our bill also prevents unfair rating on gender and health status. \nUnder our bill, health insurers will be prohibited from ratings based \non health status--whether you happen to be diabetic, whether you happen \nto have eating disorders--your gender, or the type of industry in which \nthe employees are working. Under Senator Enzi's rules, that will be all \npreempted, even for the 15 States that don't allow ratings on these \nfactors.\n  Our bill also frees employers to focus on running their businesses. \nThey don't\n\n[[Page S4184]]\n\nhave to go and negotiate these plans through their association or with \ntheir association. They are going to get sent a booklet just as we do, \nonce a year, to review all that is available to them, and choices, and \nthen figure out what is best for them. My employees--each of them picks \nsomething different. I pick coverage for a family with children. Some \nof them pick a PPO or an HMO. Some of them pick all different kinds of \nState plans and others that are offered to them in that process.\n  Mr. CARPER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, how much time is left on our side during \nthis period of debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CARPER. How much longer does the Senator expect to speak?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. How about if I just go ahead and yield to the Senator \nfrom Delaware because as a former Governor, he has some incredible \nstories to tell, and I think they really add to this debate. I will \nsimply say to my colleagues that I hope they follow this debate very \nclosely and certainly appreciate how important this is to the working \nfamilies of all of our States.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank my colleague for yielding. I ask if she would \nstay on the floor.\n  I commend Senator Lincoln for actually coming up with this idea. It \nis an idea for which she and Senator Durbin share credit. When you \nthink of some of our options, the options basically are do nothing, \nmaintain the status quo, continue to make the cost of insurance very \nsteep and rising for small businesses or to adopt the proposal of our \ncolleagues, Senator Enzi and Senator Nelson, whom I believe are two of \nthe most thoughtful Members of the Senate. They have worked hard to try \nto make a not very good idea--the original association health plan--a \nbetter idea. But between doing nothing and the modified HP legislation \nfrom Senators Enzi and Nelson is a third way. The third way has already \nbeen outlined here by Senator Lincoln.\n  I wish to ask my colleagues to think about it. I don't care whether \nit is a Democratic idea or Republican idea. It is actually an \nopportunity to take the best from what the Government, the public \nsector, can bring and to take maybe the best the private sector can \nbring.\n  One of the common values that are shared by the Enzi-Nelson \nlegislation and the Lincoln-Durbin legislation is the notion that we \nhave a lot of smaller employers, they have a lot of employees, and \ntogether is there some way we could pool their purchasing power? Maybe \nwe could increase the number of health insurance options available to \nthem and maybe we could bring down the cost of those options. They \npropose to do it in one particular way which, as Senator Lincoln \npointed out, has a number of problems, one of which affects us \nnegatively in Delaware.\n  We have had a very high rate of cancer mortality. Finally, we have \nbrought it down over the last 10 years or so, in part by having \nmandatory cancer screening--mammography, for cervical cancer, prostate \nscreening, for colorectal cancers--and that has helped to bring down \nour cancer mortality rate. From the top in the country, we have finally \nnow dropped to the top five. We are moving in the right direction. I \nwill talk about that tomorrow, and I will even bring some charts to \nrival the chart of my colleague, I hope.\n  But I suggest to my colleagues, think about this. We have all these \ndisparate Federal agencies across the country. Collectively, we have a \ncouple of million employees, family members, and retirees, and all we \ndo through the Federal health benefit plan is we pool our collective \npurchasing power. It doesn't matter if you work for the VA or Homeland \nSecurity or some other Federal agency--EPA--basically we could come \ntogether and use our collective might to negotiate better rates and, \nfrankly, better coverage than would otherwise be the case if we were \njust negotiating for ourselves. We do it all through the Office of \nPersonnel Management.\n  What Senator Lincoln is suggesting is it works great for us, provides \nreasonably good coverage for Federal employees, including us as U.S. \nSenators. We have to pay our portion. It is not that we get it for \nfree. We have to pay our share. But it works pretty darn well. She has \ncome up with a way where we take that Government idea and transpose it \nand transfer it to the private sector. She would have the Office of \nPersonnel Management effectively provide the service or play the role \nin the private sector that it currently plays in the public sector, to \nallow a lot of employees, whether you work for the local hardware store \nor restaurant or small manufacturer or technology company, to say: We \nwould like our employees to be able to pull together from Arkansas, \nfrom Delaware, even from Minnesota, in order to get a chance to buy \nbetter insurance products, have more variety, and bring down our costs \nto our small business employees.\n  It has worked. It is proven. It is time tested, and I believe it is \nworth trying. The worst thing that I think could happen, coming out of \nthis week, is for us to do nothing.\n  It is a big problem. It is a big problem for small employers, and it \nis a big problem for large employers. It is a big problem for America.\n  I think what would be the worst thing that could happen, and what \nwould basically ensure that we do nothing is for our Republican friends \nto basically allow no amendments to the Enzi-Nelson legislation. I \nthink that would be awful. That would be a huge mistake. It would \npretty much basically ensure we end up not getting this bill done or \nsome variation and not even having a chance for debate and vote on the \nLincoln-Durbin legislation. We can do better than that.\n  Frankly, the Senate deserves a lot better than that.\n  I say to my colleague from Arkansas, who has been good enough to \nrelinquish her time, I thank her on behalf of all us for pointing out a \ndifferent course, a third way in this regard. I thank her.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Minority time has expired.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I ask unanimous consent to continue until other Members arrive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I will be glad to yield the floor when others are ready to speak.\n  I would like to add that the experience of many of our colleagues, \nwhether they are former insurance commissioners, former Governors and \nothers, brings to this table the understanding what the American people \nwant, what our working families want. I think the debate is that small \nbusinesses definitely want more affordable health care. They also want \nto make sure that what they are providing for themselves and their \nfamilies and their employees is quality service, quality coverage. That \nis what they deserve. That is what they want.\n  Even for those who feel so young and invincible, we also know that \nthey may be one car accident or one diagnosis away from needing more \ncomprehensive health insurance for the rest of their lives.\n  That is why we want to make sure--as I said in the beginning--that \nwhatever we do is right, that we don't move forward on something that \nis going to be less productive and in the long run, unfortunately, put \nmore people at risk.\n  My goal is to help small businesses while not jeopardizing the \nquality of health care for the 68 million Americans in State-regulated \ngroup plans that are already out there. We don't want to do harm there.\n  The fact is if we move forward on what Senator Enzi wants to do, \nwhich is preempting those State regulations and State mandates, we \ncould do tremendous harm for those who are currently insured and the \n16.5 million Americans with individual health insurance coverage who \nwould probably lose some quality of coverage which they have.\n  If it is good enough for Federal employees, and if it good enough for \nMembers of Congress, I think it should be good enough for millions of \nsmall business employees who are the economic backbone of communities \nthroughout this Nation.\n  I applaud my colleagues for coming to the floor for this debate, and \nI hope we will have a serious debate so we can\n\n[[Page S4185]]\n\nmove forward and actually do what is right for the American people.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield once again?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Yes, absolutely.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, we do not often think of the Federal \nGovernment in the way we are trying to harness market forces and \ncompetition and put them to work. We try to hold down Federal outlays. \nThat is what we do with respect to the Federal. It is literally what we \ndo with respect to the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan. What we \nare trying to do, with respect to what the Senator has outlined, is \nharness market forces and competition and put them to work for small \nbusinesses as well.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, reclaiming our time, I didn't realize they \nwould be allowed to use part of it.\n  It would be helpful if the other side would actually share the \ndetails of their amendment with us so that we can take a look at it. \nThe details of our bill have been through the committee, out here, and \nhad hearings. We don't know what is going to be in there. The last time \nI looked at it, there was, I think, $9 billion of cost in it each year, \nand the huge bureaucracy that would be built up. I make that request to \nthe other side--that we sure would like to take a look at their bill. \nIt is hard to do until we have a copy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                 Cape Wind Facility in Nantucket Sound\n\n  Mr. President, I am here to discuss the provision in the Coast Guard \nand Maritime Transportation Act of 2006 and the provision which allows \nthe State of Massachusetts to have a say in the siting of a 24-square-\nmile, 130-wind turbine energy facility.\n  I have a chart I want to use and describe.\n  First, let me say why the Senator from Alaska is involved in this \nissue. What I am trying to say is that this is a tremendous precedent.\n  We have a series of areas of various States where there is a gap in \nState jurisdiction and where Federal waters are adjacent to and \nsometimes almost surrounding State waters. That is particularly true in \nmy State. With the Cook Inlet on either side of Kalgin Island, there \nare gaps of Federal waters surrounded by the mainland of Alaska going \ndown the inlet.\n  The Minerals Management Service tells us there are roughly 2.5 \nmillion acres of Federal waters going down that inlet that could be \nused for projects such as I am going to discuss today.\n  A similar situation exists with Chandeleur Island, LA; the Channel \nIslands in California; the Farallon Islands in California; the Hawaiian \nIslands in many instances; and in Puerto Rico.\n  What I am here to talk about is the precedent that would be \nestablished by locating this facility in Nantucket Sound, less than 2 \nmiles beyond the State of Massachusetts' jurisdiction.\n  If we look at this chart, you can see very clearly the area with the \ndarkest color on the chart, which is the proposed site of this power \nfacility. It is 9 miles from one part of Massachusetts, 13.8 miles from \nthe other side, and 6 miles from the other direction.\n  When you look at the situation, we realize the State has jurisdiction \nover at least 3 miles in that area.\n  This is very close to the area of Massachusetts where people have a \nright to be concerned over this project. Before the Federal Government \nclaimed ownership of this area, there was a judicial dispute over which \ngovernment had jurisdiction over it. I am informed that the State of \nMassachusetts had established a marine park in this area. As a matter \nof fact, it was listed as part of a proposed marine sanctuary, even in \nthe Federal listings. It is now the proposed site for the largest and \nmost expansive offshore wind energy project ever undertaken in the \nworld.\n  This facility would include turbines that stand 417 feet tall.\n  This is a chart that describes it. Those windmills would be 417 feet \ntall, taller than the Statue of Liberty. The one little point at the \nbottom shows a 30-foot sailboat. You can see the size of it. People \nsail their boats that size on Nantucket Bay, and the Great Point \nLighthouse is supposed to keep sailors and mariners warned about the \narea. It is only 73 feet tall.\n  When you look this area, it is 24 miles across, more than half the \nsize of Boston Harbor itself. It is going to be the site of this \nenormous facility.\n  As I said, it is larger than any similar kind of wind energy project \nin the world.\n  It is a very small area of Federal jurisdiction, completely \nsurrounded by the mainland and islands of Massachusetts.\n  Some in the media have insinuated that by including this provision in \nthe Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act, I am doing it as an \nold friend to Senator Ted Kennedy. He is an old friend. It is true that \nSenator Kennedy and the Governor of Massachusetts support the provision \nin the Coast Guard bill, but this is my amendment. They have agreed \nwith me. I didn't seek their agreement. It is not an issue based on \nfriendship or on past favors or future favors. It is strictly a \nprovision based upon my long-held belief that States should have the \nfinal say on projects which will directly impact their lands, \nresources, and constituents.\n  Some in the press have claimed this provision is embedded in \n``obscure legislation to be passed in the dead of the night.'' We hear \nthis all the time. But the Coast Guard authorization bill is hardly \nobscure legislation, and there is nothing secretive about this bill.\n  The version of this bill that passed the House of Representatives \nincluded a provision related to offshore wind farms. It was in the \nHouse-passed bill to start with. The House and the Senate, in a \nbicameral, bipartisan group of Members of a conference committee, \ndiscussed and negotiated language to provide the State of Massachusetts \na greater voice in the siting of this windmill farm in Nantucket Sound.\n  This bicameral, bipartisan group also negotiated language requiring \nthe Coast Guard to assess the potential navigational impacts of the \nproposed offshore powerplant.\n  This is the normal legislative process for passing legislation of \nthis type through the Congress.\n  Again, let me point out this chart. I don't live in this area, but I \nhave studied it very well. This is the path the ferries take coming out \nof these areas and going through this sound, and it is the path which \nthe commercial traffic, steamships, and cargo ships use going into that \nport.\n  As a consequence of this location, this line demonstrates the State's \njurisdiction and how close it is to the State's jurisdiction. As a \nmatter of fact, the area that is has been lined shows the previous plan \nwhich would have gone partially into the State's jurisdiction. The \nproject was amended, so it does not touch the State waters or State \njurisdiction areas at all.\n  It is this area of solid brown on this chart.\n  By the way, this is the very shallow portion of this area. There is \nno question about it. Nantucket Island is out here. But there are \nequally shallow portions outside of the sound that could have been \nused. But, of course, it is deeper going in there, and that access to \nthis interior part of this sound I think is strictly a financial \ndecision.\n  At the heart of the debate on the issue is States' rights. The fact \nis this project will be located entirely in the sound--in this small \ndoughnut hole of the Federal water surrounded by islands and mainland \nof the State of Massachusetts.\n  The debate over this project is similar to the fights those of us in \nAlaska have been engaged in for decades. Our State lands are surrounded \nby Federal lands, and we often don't have any decision regarding the \ndevelopment of our resources or projects which will be located in our \nState.\n  This is one of those situations where Congress ought to listen to the \nGovernor. They ought to listen to the senior Senator, in my opinion.\n  Those in Massachusetts have raised legitimate concerns about the \nimpact of this wind farm and what its impact will be on maritime \nnavigation, aviation, and radar installations critical to our homeland \nsecurity.\n  This proposed site is an area already known for its treacherous \nflight conditions, and this facility could make those conditions much \nworse. According to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, \nthis facility will be located in the flight path of thousands\n\n[[Page S4186]]\n\nof small planes. Both the Barnstable and Nantucket Airport Commissions \nare opposed to the construction of this facility, as are the major \nferry lines that operate in Nantucket Sound.\n  As the chart I have described shows, ferry routes pass within a mile \nof the proposed location for this project on two sides. The 24-square-\nmile footprint for this facility is nearly half the size of Boston \nHarbor, a 471-foot wind farm.\n  Again, those windmills are larger than this building. Those windmills \nare larger than the Capitol.\n  You have to get the specter of this size being built in the center of \nthis sound. It is a 24-square-mile footprint for this facility. As I \nhave said, it is half the size of Boston Harbor and has shipping and \nferry channels bordering on three sides.\n  There is not a single local fishing group from Massachusetts that \nsupports this project, I am informed. It would effectively close a 24-\nmile-square-mile footprint of many kinds of fishing that has taken \nplace in this sound for generations. Horseshoe Shoal, where the \nfacility will be built, is one of the most productive fishing grounds \nin the area. That means this area produces offspring. This is where the \nfish spawn.\n\n  The impact of the shoal will be significant. The piling for each one \nof these windmills--there are 130 of them--are 16 feet in diameter and \nwill be bored down into the shoal to a depth of about 80 feet. This \nproductive area will be littered with 130 drilled holes. Each piling \nwill occupy 2 acres of productive fishing ground. Navigating in and \naround 130 turbines will make fishing and fishing reproduction in this \narea nearly impossible.\n  In addition, these turbines will make Coast Guard search and rescue \nmissions much more difficult in this area, already known for severe \nweather and sea conditions in parts of the year.\n  Those in Massachusetts raise another important point. Developing a \nwind farm of this size and scale offshore has never been done before, \nlet alone in an environment as extreme as the waters of the North \nAtlantic.\n  To put this challenge in perspective, it helps to compare the \nMassachusetts project to the wind farm currently operating in Palm \nSprings, CA. I know a little bit about this. I have gone into that town \nseveral times by air. That facility stands 150 feet at the tallest \npoint. The blades are half the length of a football field, but they are \none-third of this size. Even on dry land and a relatively calm desert \nclimate, the Palm Springs wind farm has been plagued by serious \nmaintenance complications. Many of the turbines require constant \nmaintenance and repair.\n  Put that in the Massachusetts Sound. They require maintenance and \nrepair constantly. This Massachusetts project would require maintenance \nand repair to take place in icy waters of Nantucket Sound. The size of \nthe windmills for this facility would dwarf the existing land-based \nwind projects. The windmills in Nantucket Sound would stand nearly \nthree times as tall as those in Palm Springs, with wind blades over a \nfootball field in length. Just the blade is a football field in length.\n  Now, given the legitimate issues raised by the people of \nMassachusetts and their representative, I believe it is only fair to \nallow the State to have an equal voice in the debate over the siting of \nthis project. Nantucket Sound, as I have said, is not the only place \nwhere a project of this kind can be built. In Europe, deepwater wind \nenergy technologies are currently being developed as far out as 15 \nmiles in 138 feet of water. Placing wind energy facilities further from \ntheir shore reduces their impact on maritime navigation.\n  If this 24-square-mile wind farm is built further away from shore, \nthere would be a number of benefits. It would be removed from boating, \nfishing, ferrying, shipping channels, reducing the risk of collision \nand reducing the potential impact on the navigation which we have asked \nthe Coast Guard to look into.\n  I do support America's use of alternative energy sources, including \nwind farms and wind power. I have supported wind projects in the past \nduring my time as chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations. \nOur committee appropriated over $105 million for wind projects in \nfiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2006. There was even one in my State \naround Kotzebue.\n  It is the right of a State to determine if this type of project is \nconsistent with its efforts to protect its resources. I believe \nCongress should defer to the judgment of the Massachusetts \ncongressional delegation, the Governor of Massachusetts, and the people \nof Massachusetts on this matter. States should have a say in the \nactivities taking place in the waters adjacent to their shores. This \nlocation, in particular, deserves special consideration due to the \ngeographic peculiarities of the region.\n  California blocked oil platforms, Oregon and Washington blocked them \nbefore they were even built.\n  We now have a dispute before the Congress over a potential \ndevelopment of gas resources 170 miles off the State of Florida. This \nis 3 miles. This is within a sound that is one of the--I have only been \nthere two or three times, but it is a place if you ever go to it you \nwould not forget. It is not a place that deserves to have this impact. \nThe residents of Massachusetts will have to live with the impact of \nthis project. They must have a greater role in determining the fate of \nthis treasured area.\n  This bill, H.R. 889, as agreed to by the conference committee, \nrightly awards the State of Massachusetts this greater authority in the \ndecisions regarding this project. So I am here today to urge the House \nand the Senate to listen to the people of Massachusetts and \nparticularly to listen to their senior Senator.\n  I am pleased to yield whatever time I have remaining. I think I have \nonly another 10 minutes or so. I yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  I think we have 30 minutes on this side and 30 minutes on that side, \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 14 minutes remaining on the majority \nside.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is there time on the Democratic side for the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We are rotating back and forth. I am happy to work that \nout.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We will work that out.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We will stay on the subject matter.\n  Mr. ENZI. We had some latitude here to allow 20 minutes on this and \nwe were 5 minutes late from that one.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I talked too long.\n  Mr. ENZI. And Senator Thune does not have the time for his speech.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I cannot yield, but if the Senator from \nMassachusetts requests time and wants to use the Democratic time for \nthat, we have 14 minutes on the majority side I would like to use to \ntalk about the small business health plan. But if the Senator from \nMassachusetts wants to use Democratic time, that is fine.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask to be yielded 8 minutes on the Democratic time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, the \nSenator from Alaska.\n  I hope to have an opportunity to get into this in greater detail than \nI will for the few minutes I have this afternoon.\n  There are certain points I want to make. That is, the waters around \nthe area described by the Senator from Alaska, the Nantucket-Martha's \nVineyard-Cape Cod area, has been designated a state ocean sanctuary and \nit is an unreplaceable asset to the people of Massachusetts. Up to \n1986, it was generally recognized to be under the jurisdiction of the \nCommonwealth. In the 1970s, Massachusetts was concerned about potential \ndevelopment threats and made the entire area a protected state ocean \nsanctuary--where no structures could be built on the seabed and where \nno offshore electricity generation facilities could be constructed.\n  The legislation was passed easily through the State House. And the \nspecific part of Nantucket Sound that is no longer protected by the \nstate laws, because of a Supreme Court decision, is under consideration \nfor national marine sanctuary status.\n  My second point, Mr. President, is that I am for wind energy. We all \nknow we need it to meet our future needs, and we've seen the successes \nthat onshore wind energy farms can be. We ought to have offshore wind \nenergy, but we need to get it right.\n\n[[Page S4187]]\n\n  The problem in Massachusetts is that we have a developer who's \nbasically staked a claim to 24 square miles of Nantucket Sound back \nwhen there were no rules on offshore wind development, and then got the \nproject written into the new law so the new rules won't apply to this \nproject.\n  And the practical effect is that there will be no competition for the \ndeveloper and that his application is being reviewed and processed \nbefore the Department of the Interior can even complete a national \npolicy.\n  In the Energy bill, section 388 says:\n\n        . . . the Secretary shall issue a lease, easement or \n     right-of-way under paragraph (1) on a competitive basis \n     unless the Secretary after public notice of a proposed lease, \n     easement or right-of-way that there is no competitive \n     interest.\n\n  The next provision says:\n\n       Nothing in the amendment made by subsection (a) requires \n     the resubmittal of any document that was previously submitted \n     or the reauthorization of any action that was previously \n     authorized with respect to a project for which, before the \n     date of enactment of this Act--\n       (1) an offshore test facility has been constructed;\n\n  Well, where in the country was there a project that had an offshore \ntest facility?--only in Nantucket Sound. So this was a real special \ninterest provision.\n  Because of this ``savings provision,'' the developers are pushing \nInterior to complete this review before the rules of the game are even \nestablished and before the ocean is zoned.\n  So while Interior is setting a uniform program--and deciding which \nsites should be used--this project is on the fast track. The developer \nand the developer alone picked the site.\n  And this is a serious problem. Look at what the EPA said about this \nproject's draft environmental impact statement. They called it \n``inadequate.'' That's from the EPA, the agency charged with protecting \nthe environment.\n  And the EPA wasn't alone. Look at what the US Geological Survey said \nabout Cape Wind's draft environmental impact statement:\n\n        . . . the DEIS is at best incomplete, and too often \n     inaccurate and misleading.\n\n  Inadequate--Incomplete--and too often inaccurate and/or misleading. \nDoes this sound like project that should be on the fast track?\n  But because they've been written into the law, the interests of our \nstate have been basically submerged to a special interest developer.\n  They complain about the provision in this bill that Senator Stevens \nnegotiated with the House. He's right. He's trying to at least bring \nthis back up for review under the sunlight and ensure that the \ninterests of the state for safety and for environmental protection \naren't run roughshod over.\n  The project's developer is the one that got the special interest \nlegislation. This Coast Guard provision is designed to check that and \npreserve the public interest.\n  The provision Senator Stevens crafted tries to remedy an injustice \nthe developer created, and at least let the people of our State be \nheard.\n  We wish this provision wasn't necessary, and it wouldn't be if the \ndeveloper was content with following the rules that apply to everyone \nelse.\n  That would have been satisfactory, but no, we are denied that equal \ntreatment. We are prohibited from that. That is not right.\n  Our State went out and created the Cape and Islands Ocean Sanctuary \nas a protected area. Then the Supreme Court cut a hole in those \nprotections, and now the interests of the State to preserve the \nfisheries and environment of the whole region is being undermined. It \nis being handed off to private interests. It's not right. We deserve to \nhave at least a little fairness in this.\n  I will not take the time to list the various national marine \nsanctuaries, including the Channel Islands, all the Florida Keys, and \nother national treasures, like Stellwagen Bank outside of Boston, which \nI am so happy we have protected into the future.\n  The law says you can't build energy facilities in those sanctuaries \nand we shouldn't--and Nantucket Sound is just as important as those.\n  For 400 years the Sound was considered Massachusetts waters, and it \nwas a protected by the people of our state.\n  In preparation for the 1986 Supreme Court decision that would specify \nthat this narrow area would be carved out as Federal land, we took \nspecial care to get on the national marine sanctuary site evaluation \nlist. We didn't want to take any chances then, and we're still on the \nlist. At a minimum, no industrial project should be built there until \nwe can resolve that status.\n  And now we have a developer who wants complete control over 24 miles \nin the middle of the Sound, even though no government agency has zoned \nit for energy development yet.\n  We know that the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy called for a \ncomprehensive siting policy, and that Interior is now working on it. We \nendorse that approach completely, but this developer is undermining \nthat.\n  And the American people should know just what this developer is \ngetting for this no-bid, no-compete contract. There will be at least \n$28 million a year in federal tax benefits available to the developer \nthat's $280 million over 10 years.\n  And in Massachusetts, the developer will be eligible for between $37 \nmillion and $82 million a year in price subsidies under the renewable \nenergy credit program. That's $370 million to $820 million in price \nsubsidies over 10 years.\n  Then there's the fact that the company will be able to write off the \n$800 million cost of this project off in just 5 years.\n  This is a boondoggle, and it's an outrage the developer's getting a \nno-bid contract to a public resource. We've seen what no-bid contracts \ncan do, Mr. President.\n  Who pays when we talk about subsidies? It comes out of the taxpayers' \npockets when we talk about subsidies.\n  It is a great deal for this developer. It is a great deal for his \ninvestors. It is a great deal for the venture capitalists. They will \nget so much money they will not be able to count it. But it shouldn't \nbe done without the voice, without the consideration, and without the \ninterest of the State, let alone the many groups that oppose this \nproject and fear that it will undermine the safety, environment, and \neconomic interests of the region for years to come.\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska for his hard work on this bill and \nthis provision.\n  Let me ask the Senator--and I know the time is up--I understand if \nthis proposal were for an LNG facility in Nantucket Sound, the Governor \nof Massachusetts would have the same authority under the Deepwater Port \nAct that we're seeking here for this project. Am I correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is right.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We need LNG and we need more energy sources, but if they \nhad decided here to do an LNG on this site, the Governor would have a \nvoice in that, am I correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I believe the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So this idea about having a voice on this makes a good \ndeal of sense.\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes remains.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, if necessary, that \nI have a couple of additional minutes beyond that. I believe the other \nside was granted a little bit of extra time when they were addressing \nthis issue as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator will have an \nadditional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, last week the Robert Wood Johnson \nFoundation sponsored ``Cover the Uninsured'' week, a call for this \ncountry to wake up and address a huge and growing problem in our \nNation. In 2004, approximately 19.1 percent of nonelderly Americans did \nnot have health insurance. That number is growing.\n  Why do we have this problem in one of the wealthiest nations in the \nworld? It is because nearly one-half of the 45 million uninsured \nindividuals in the United States are either employees of small firms or \nfamily members of small business employees.\n  The primary reason cited by small businesses themselves for not \noffering health benefits is simply the high cost of health insurance. \nWe can do something about that beginning today. We\n\n[[Page S4188]]\n\nalso have this problem because Congress has repeatedly failed to do its \njob in the past. We can also do something about that, beginning today.\n  Today the Senate voted on a motion to proceed to S. 1955, which is a \nbipartisan bill addressing the issue of the working uninsured. This \nlegislation allows the creation of small business health plans to help \nlower the cost of health care for small business owners and their \nemployees.\n  Our colleagues on the other side have also offered some legislation \ntoday to address this issue. Senators Durbin and Lincoln have talked \nabout their particular proposal, which is a Government approach. In \nfact, they say it saves money, but it shifts the costs over to the \ntaxpayers, to the tune of $73 billion over a 10-year period. Why would \nwe ask for taxpayers to foot the bill before we have allowed the small \nbusinesses of this country to take advantage of a market-based approach \nand to use the market forces that exist out there in a way that would \ndrive health care costs down for them and their employees? It is very \nsimply a difference of philosophy.\n  Our philosophy--the approach contemplated under S. 1955--deals with a \nmarket-based solution to this issue. The proposal, S. 2510, by our \ncolleagues on the other side is a Federal Government solution to this \nissue, at a great cost, I might add, to the taxpayers of $73 billion \nover a 10-year period.\n  S. 1955, the Enzi bill, which, as I said earlier, we were able to \nmove to proceed to today, would lower the cost of care for employers \nand employees. In addition, the Congressional Budget Office estimates \nS. 1955 would reduce net Federal spending for Medicaid by about $790 \nmillion over the next 10 years. It would also save the States of this \ncountry about $600 million in the cost of Medicaid over a 10-year \nperiod. That is in addition, as I said, to the savings that would be \nachieved for small businesses.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has analyzed this particular piece of \nlegislation and concluded it would save somewhere between 2 and 3 \npercent for small firms in this country on the cost of their health \ninsurance. What is significant about this, as well, in contrast to the \nproposal by our colleagues on the other side, which would cost an \nadditional $73 billion over the course of the next 10 years, is the \nCongressional Budget Office said that the Enzi bill, S. 1955, would \nincrease tax revenues coming into the Government by $3.3 billion over \n10 years because lower spending on health insurance would increase the \nshare of employee compensation paid in taxable wages and salaries \nversus tax-excluded health benefits. In other words, lower spending on \nhealth insurance would translate into higher wages and salaries and \nactually would also generate more revenue for the Federal Government \nrather than less, which is what would happen under the proposal by the \nDemocrats, which would cost the taxpayers $73 billion, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, over a 10-year period.\n  So I believe it is important we move forward and we vote to send S. \n1955 out of the Senate to conference with the House. As a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives, I voted for the creation of small business \nhealth plans numerous times. In fact, that particular proposal has been \nvoted on no fewer than eight times in the House of Representatives.\n  Every time I voted when I was a Member of the House, and every time \nit has been passed by the House of Representatives, it has come to the \nSenate and has been unable to be voted on because it has been \nfilibustered, obstructed by the other side. I would say, that is in \nspite of the fact that if it were allowed an up-or-down vote in the \nSenate, I believe there would be a decisive bipartisan majority in \nfavor of this legislation.\n  Unfortunately, due to obstructionism, the Senate, until today, has \nnever voted on legislation creating small business health plans. As a \nCongressman and now Senator, I have listened to many accusations about \nthe harm that S. 1955 or similar legislation would do if it were \nenacted.\n  What harm would be caused by decreasing the cost of health care for \nsmall employers by 12 percent and increasing the coverage of the \nworking uninsured by 8 percent? Lower cost and more coverage for those \nwho are currently uninsured: That is not harm. That is exactly what we \nought to be accomplishing here by enacting legislation that would make \nhealth care coverage more affordable and more available to more \nAmericans.\n  South Dakota has an estimated 72,949 small businesses as of 2004, \nwhich is an increase of 2.4 percent from the previous year in 2003. \nSouth Dakota also had an estimated 90,000 uninsured individuals or 12 \npercent of our population in the year 2004. Fifty-two percent of South \nDakotans had employer-based health insurance, 8 percent below the \nnational average.\n  Small businesses are the backbone of South Dakota's, as well as our \nNation's, economy. It is time these businesses were placed on a level \nplaying field and allowed to pool together to purchase health \ninsurance, like large employers and unions.\n  I have heard from many provider groups in my State of South Dakota \nconcerned about coverage for their specific services. S. 1955 allows \nsmall business health plans to offer a basic benefit plan that would be \nexempt from State mandates as long as the small business health plan \nalso offers an enhanced benefits option that includes at least those \ncovered benefits and providers that are covered by a State employee \nhealth benefit plan in one of the five most populated States in this \ncountry.\n\n  According to the Council for Affordable Health Insurance, all of \nthese States--all of these States--require coverage for alcoholism, \nbreast reconstruction, diabetes self-management, diabetic supplies, \nemergency services, mammograms, mastectomy stays, maternity stays, \ngeneral mental health, chiropractors, optometrists, podiatrists, \npsychologists, and social workers.\n  Small business owners want to give their employees the best health \ncoverage possible under their budgets to recruit and retrain their \nworkforce. Facts suggest self-insured large company health plans, \ncurrently exempt from State mandates, generally cover services \nimportant to their employees.\n  This legislation would create new options for small businesses and \nthe potential for a choice in health plans for their employees. Today, \nonly 10 percent of firms with 50 or fewer employees offer their \nworkforce a choice of more than one health plan. Lowering the \nadministrative costs of health insurance plans will give small firms \nnew and better coverage choices for their workers.\n  Additionally, the GAO found that the added cost of mandates to a \ntypical plan is between 5 and 22 percent. CBO estimates that every 1-\npercent increase in insurance costs results in 200,000 to 300,000 more \nuninsured Americans. When the cost of health insurance goes up, \ncoverage and access go down.\n  The concept behind S. 1955 is very simple: to provide health \ninsurance to small businesses that is both affordable and accessible. \nSmall businesses not only in my State of South Dakota but across the \nNation have been fighting for the creation of small business health \nplans for over 10 years. It is high time that the obstruction end in \nthe Senate, that the Senate step aside and allow an up-and-down vote on \nthis very important legislation.\n  As I said before, it is legislation that, if you look at just the \nCongressional Budget Office findings, would cover nearly a million more \npeople, would allow three out of every four small business employees to \npay lower premiums than they currently pay under current law, and would \nsee small firms' premium costs decline by 2 to 3 percent. The average \ndecrease per firm would likely be greater, since the CBO estimate is a \ntotal that factors in the costs of other benefits added by firms in \nresponse to the reduction in premiums.\n  It would also allow annual spending on employer-sponsored health \ninsurance to be reduced by about $2 billion in a 5-year period. As I \nsaid earlier, it would increase Federal tax revenues by $3.3 billion \nover 10 years because lower spending on health insurance would increase \nthe share of employee compensation paid in taxable wages and salaries \nversus tax-excluded health benefits--more coverage; lower costs; more \nrevenue to the Federal Treasury, not less. The alternative offered by \nour colleagues on the other side, as I said earlier, comes at a high \ncost to the taxpayers: $73 billion over a 5-year period.\n\n[[Page S4189]]\n\n  We can do better. We can allow the market forces of this country to \nbe used. We can take a market-based approach to this issue and do \nsomething that has been done a long time ago, something that has, as I \nsaid, been voted on repeatedly in the House of Representatives, never \nto have been voted on here in the Senate, because it has been blocked.\n  It is high time for the small businesses of this country, for their \nemployees, for families who lack coverage today, to have another tool \nat their disposal, a tool that takes into account and takes full \nadvantage of market forces, by allowing small businesses to group \ntogether to leverage their size, to drive down the rates they pay for \nhealth insurance and, thereby, cover more of their employees.\n  That, again, is in stark contrast to the model and the proposal that \nis being offered by our colleagues on the other side, which consists of \na government-based solution, that comes at a very high cost to the \ntaxpayers, that calls for more bureaucracy and redtape, and does \nnothing in the end to bring down the cost of health care for small \nbusinesses in this country.\n  It is long overdue. I hope, as we have the chance to debate this now \nin the Senate, once that debate is concluded, we will be able to \nproceed to a vote because the one thing that has always been missed \nhere in the Senate, despite action on eight different occasions in the \nHouse, is an actual up-and-down vote in the Senate that would allow the \nSenate to speak on the issue of whether we want to do something \nmeaningful to reduce the cost of health care for small businesses in \nthis country, to provide more coverage for those who are currently \nuninsured, and also to do something that would reduce the cost to the \nGovernment, the cost of Medicaid, as well as the other costs that are \nassociated, as I said earlier, by increasing the amount that would come \ninto the Treasury.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 4:30 is controlled by the \nminority.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, here we are on day 2 of Health Week, and \nthere are still no plans to bring up H.R. 810, the stem cell research \nbill.\n  This bill was passed by the House of Representatives 351 days ago--\nalmost a year ago now--with still no action here in the Senate. Yet the \nmajority of Senators are for it. I do not understand how in the world \nwe can have a Health Week in the Senate and not vote on the American \npublic's No. 1 health research priority: lifting the President's \nrestriction on embryonic stem cell research.\n  That seems to be what we are doing. We are wasting our time on bills \nthat everyone knows are not going to pass. We are passing up a golden \nopportunity to promote one of the most promising areas of research in \nour lifetimes.\n  Most people by now have heard of the enormous potential of embryonic \nstem cells. These cells have the remarkable ability to turn into every \nother type of cell in the human body--brain cells that could replace \nthose lost in Parkinson's disease, islet cells to replace those lost in \ntype 1 diabetes, and on and on. Adult stem cells don't have that power, \nonly embryonic stem cells. That is why the world's best scientists \nthink embryonic stem cell research has so much promise to save lives \nand ease human suffering. It is also why they are so frustrated by the \nPresident's arbitrary restrictions on stem cell research.\n\n  Under the President's guidelines, Federal funding can be used for \nresearch only on those stem cell lines that were created before August \n9, 2001, at 9 p.m. Where did that date come from? Out of thin air? If \nthe stem cell lines were created at 8:30 p.m., they are fine, they are \nmoral, they are OK. If they were created at 9:30 p.m., all of a sudden \nthey missed the cutoff. It is totally arbitrary.\n  Shortly after the President announced his policy, he said 78 stem \ncell lines were eligible under his guidelines. It turns out that only \n22 are. In fact, it is even worse. Only a handful of those are even \nhealthy enough and readily available. More importantly, all of the 22 \nlines that are available have been contaminated by mouse cells. They \nhave been grown in a mouse feeder cell environment. It is unlikely they \nwill ever be used for any kind of human intervention, which is supposed \nto be the whole point of the research anyway.\n  Dozens more stem cell lines have been created since August 9, 2001. \nThey are healthier. Many have never been contaminated with mouse cells. \nBut thanks to President Bush, they are off limits to our best \nscientists.\n  Yet opponents of H.R. 810 sometimes argue that embryonic stem cell \nresearch has no potential. Last week, Senator Brownback presented a \nlist of diseases that are being treated with adult stem cells and asked \nwhy that hasn't happened yet with embryonic stem cells. Let me address \nthat directly. Scientists have been doing research on adult stem cells \nfor over 30 years. There are no arbitrary restrictions on research with \nadult stem cells. Scientists and private companies don't have to be \nskittish about doing this research. They don't have to worry that all \nof a sudden the Federal Government is going to ban it or limit it.\n  Let's compare that situation with human embryonic stem cells. \nScientists didn't even know how to derive them until 1998. The first \nFederal grant for these stem cells wasn't awarded until 2002. Even now, \nonly a tiny fraction of the total Federal budget for stem cell research \nis used for embryonic stem cells. The vast majority goes for adult stem \ncell research, and every scientist who enters this field is taking a \nrisk that Congress will pass a law to shut down the lab. They also risk \nthat they won't get any 1 of the 22 lines contaminated by mouse feeder \ncells which they will then not be able to use for human therapy. So it \nis no wonder that more diseases are being treated today with adult stem \ncells. Adult stem cell research had a 30-year head start. Meanwhile, \nscientists have been studying embryonic stem cells for just 5 years \nwith one arm tied behind their back.\n  The fact is, it doesn't matter what I think about the potential of \nembryonic stem cell research. It doesn't matter what Senator Brownback \nthinks either. What matters is what the scientists think. And I defy \nanyone to find a single reputable biomedical scientist whose doesn't \nbelieve we should pursue embryonic stem cell research.\n  I have a letter from Dr. J. Michael Bishop who won the Nobel Prize in \nmedicine in 1989. He writes:\n\n       The vast majority of the biomedical research community \n     believes that human embryonic stem cells are likely to be the \n     source of key discoveries related to many debilitating \n     diseases. . . . In fact, some of the strongest advocates for \n     human embryonic stem cell research are those scientists who \n     have devoted their careers to the study of adult stem cells.\n\n  A letter from Dr. Alfred G. Gilman, who won the Nobel Prize for \nmedicine in 1994:\n\n       It has become obvious, however, that the number of stem \n     cell lines actually available under current policy is too \n     small and is controlled by a limited monopoly, which has made \n     it significantly more difficult and expensive for research to \n     be conducted. These limits have hindered the important search \n     for new understanding and treatment of devastating diseases.\n\n  I have similar letters from Dr. Ferid Murad, who won the Nobel Prize \nfor medicine in 1998; Dr. Arthur Kornberg, who won the Nobel Prize in \nmedicine in 1959; and dozens more of our Nation's top researchers--all \nof whom believe in the potential of embryonic stem cell research. I ask \nmy friend from Kansas, in response to his speech of late last week: Are \nthere any Nobel Prize winners in medicine who oppose embryonic stem \ncell research? Name one.\n  In fact, I challenge him further: Are there any reputable biomedical \nresearchers at all who think we should be studying adult stem cells \nonly and not embryonic stem cells? Name one.\n  I don't think he will find one. Every scientist I have spoken to says \nstem cell research should not be an either/or endeavor. We should not \nbe talking about stem cell research or embryonic stem cell research. We \nshould study both. We should open all doors in the pursuit of therapies \nthat can save lives and ease human suffering. The breakthroughs are \ncoming, but they take time. To clamp down on embryonic stem cell \nresearch before it even has a chance to start shows a total lack of \nunderstanding about how science\n\n[[Page S4190]]\n\nworks. More importantly, it denies hope to millions of Americans who \nsuffer from Parkinson's, ALS, juvenile diabetes, spinal cord injuries, \nand dozens of other terrible diseases and conditions.\n\n  We are rapidly approaching the 1-year anniversary of the vote in the \nHouse on H.R. 810. It has been 351 days since the House passed it on a \nstrong bipartisan vote. If the Senate were allowed to vote on H.R. 810, \nwe would win here, too. We have the votes. We would pass this bill and \nsend it on to the President. Regrettably, however, the Republican \nleadership has not let that happen. So here we are, we are going \nthrough this farce--it is farcical--comedy, gimmickry of a so-called \nHealth Week without taking up the American public's No. 1 health \nresearch priority.\n  It is Tuesday. Health Week lasts for 3 more days. We could pass H.R. \n810 in a matter of hours. I urge the majority leader, take up the bill. \nLet the Senate have a quantified amount of time to debate it. We will \npass it, and we will give millions of Americans who are suffering from \ndiseases the hope they deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I say to my \ncolleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, how much I appreciate his \nleadership in the area of health care. His analysis of where we stand \non the stem cell issue is so appropriate, and he is so right. Here we \nhave a whole area of scientific research that is waiting to take off. \nWe have States, such as mine and others, that are taking the lead \ninstead of following the lead of the Federal Government.\n  I say to my friend, does he ever remember a time in history when this \ncountry was plagued by disease that the Federal Government didn't step \nto the plate, whether there was a Republican President or a Democratic \nPresident? Isn't it shocking that as we face these epidemics of \nAlzheimer's and Parkinson's and cancer and heart disease and all the \nothers my friend mentioned, isn't it amazing--I am sure it is to him as \nwell as to me--that we have a lack of leadership in Washington?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to the Senator from California, it is not just \namazing, it is shameful. It is shameful what is happening now with the \nlack of support for biomedical research, especially embryonic stem cell \nresearch. As I said, every Nobel Prize winner in medicine, all the \nreputable scientists say we should be on it and we should be on it \nstrongly. Yet the President, through this arbitrary cutoff, is denying \nthis for scientists, denying it to people who are suffering. I say to \nmy friend from California, God bless California. They took the lead out \nthere. Her State has taken the lead. They are forging ahead. Other \nStates are following their lead. If only we could get the Federal \nGovernment to follow their lead.\n  Mrs. BOXER. As my friend pointed out in his statement, we have the \nvotes for stem cell research, even with the President's opposition. If \nwe asked for a show of hands in any roomful of people: Have you been \ntouched by cancer, have you not personally or someone you know been \ntouched by heart disease, by stroke, by Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, \nparalysis, all these things, we know how many hands would go up.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Juvenile diabetes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is clearly one. And I have met with juvenile \ndiabetics. I have met with the children, the parents and the families. \nThey are counting on us. Here we are in Health Week, as my friend \npoints out. We have the votes. Yet what do they bring up? A bill that \nis actually going to take away health care from people, the Enzi bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Exactly. I appreciate my colleague from California. She \nis right on target. I know my friend from California, the distinguished \nSenator, has been in the forefront of fighting for the things that will \nhelp people have better lives, especially in health care, and to ease \nthe pain and suffering of people, especially juvenile diabetics.\n  As the Senator knows, the families tell us that perhaps one of the \nfirst therapies that could come from embryonic stem cell research would \nbe for these kids suffering from juvenile diabetes. What a great day \nthat would be.\n  I thank the Senator for her comments and strong leadership in all the \nareas of health care, and I thank California, through her, for the \nleadership they have shown.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am very proud of my State.\n  In my State the gentleman who took the lead in putting the stem cell \nresearch initiative on the ballot has a child with juvenile diabetes. \nWatching that child suffer and struggle motivated him. He ignited this \nwonderful movement in our State. Shockingly, here we are in Health Week \nand this thing is nowhere to be seen. It is another example of why we \nneed change around this place. I thank my friend.\n  This Health Week Republican style is really fascinating when you look \nat the bills that have come before us. The first two bills would have \nhurt patients who were injured by malpractice, patients who might have \nbeen made infertile or harmed in many ways. Those two bills took away \nthe rights of patients.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent to speak another 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent to suggest a quorum call.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent agreement, we \nare alternating every 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the precedents of the Senate, the \nSenator must control at least 10 minutes in order to suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that at 5 o'clock I be given the \nfloor for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the Senator's \nside controls the time at that time. So if they want to give the \nSenator the 10 minutes, there would be no objection to that. It would \ncome out of the Democratic time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, first, I apologize for the confusion over \nthe unanimous consent that we had. It was designed early this morning \nto make sure each side had an opportunity to have an equal amount of \nsay on the 30 hours that we are working on in order to actually get to \namendments on this bill. Now that we have had cloture and everybody has \nagreed, or almost everybody, that we needed to proceed on the bill, we \nare talking about an issue that is huge to small businesses out there \nand wanting to find some kind of solution. We even suggested that \nperhaps they would like to reduce the number of hours of debate about \nthe right to proceed so that we could actually get to offering \namendments. But we have a 30-hour time requirement. That could be \nreduced by unanimous consent, or even eliminated by unanimous consent. \nBut it has not been, so we will try to keep on a half-hour rotating \nbasis so that as many people as possible can have something to say on \nthe bill.\n  I am going to take a few minutes at this point to talk about this \nissue. We have been talking about health care. One advantage of having \nthis 30 hours is to have some additional health care debate. I need to \ntalk a little bit about prescription drugs Part D. That is not part of \nthe motion to proceed, but it has been talked about a number of times \non the Senate floor today. There are some confusing things out there \nfor seniors that I would like to clear up.\n  I have been taking the last two recesses to travel across Wyoming and \nhold meetings with senior citizens to explain the prescription drug \nplan to get them signed up so they can get the benefit. There is some \nconfusion out there. When we were designing the plan, we were worried \nthat there would not be any plan interested in our small population in \nWyoming. We have less than 500,000 people in our State. Our biggest \ncity has 52,000 people. So we have a little bit of trouble finding a \nbig enough pool for anything and to encourage interest. So I asked that \nthere be kind of a Federal backup plan on it, and that was put in the \nbill.\n  But when the time came around for companies to offer plans in \nWyoming, obviously, they were even excited about 500,000 people because \nwe had 41\n\n[[Page S4191]]\n\nplans respond. That is competition. That competition brought the prices \ndown by 25 percent before the people even applied for the benefit. A \nhuge decrease in cost; that is cost by competition. The downside is \nthat 41 plans create confusion. If you have ever tried to buy insurance \nand talk to a number of different insurance salesmen, every package is \ndesigned slightly different to make it a little bit more confusing so \nthat their plan looks better, but it is also harder for you to make \ncomparisons.\n  There is an easy way to make comparisons. Medicare saw that coming \nand set up a computer analyzation so that all you have to know is what \nyour prescriptions are and what the doses are. You can put them in over \nthe Internet or you can talk to somebody live by an 800 number or there \nare a lot of volunteers across America who are helping to get this \ninformation out. It lets Medicare do the math. They will present you \nwith three or four plans that meet your prescription, your doses, and \nyour criteria for where you want to buy it. You can look at these line \nby line. All the lines match up and you can compare them and find the \nbest one for you. It has been a tremendous help.\n  My mother asked me to help her on her decision. There are kids across \nthe United States--kids like me--who need to be helping their moms on \nthese kinds of decisions. I was happy to do it because it gave me an \nopportunity to try out the telephone method, the Internet method, and I \ntalked to a number of volunteers and the local pharmacist. We owe the \nlocal pharmacist a great deal of thanks for the way this is working and \nthe difficulties that they have had doing a new program. We have not \nhad a big change in the program in decades. When we first had Medicare, \nthere were problems. They got worked out. When we started this one, \nthere were problems, and I think they have mostly been worked out.\n  Occasionally, at these hearings, somebody was having a problem. A \nhour and a half was the longest it took us to straighten out any \nproblem for anybody. I ran this process and came up with these four \nbest at the least cost for my mom.\n  One of the things that people raise in those sections is they say: I \ndon't need any drugs so I should not have to do this. I should not have \nto pay a penalty later.\n  The way insurance works is that you buy into the plan usually before \nyou get sick. You pay a premium and when you get sick, then you have \nthe coverage for the things that can happen to you in the future.\n  Medicare prescription Part D is completely different because you can \nalready have a huge medical problem and a lot of prescriptions and you \ncan sign up for this now and have a maximum guaranteed cost. I know of \npeople who are actually saving thousands of dollars because they signed \nup. If you don't have anything the matter with you and you don't want \nto buy into a big plan, you run the evaluation and you can find a small \nplan you can buy into.\n\n  One in Wyoming is $1.87 a month. What if the $1.87 a month doesn't \ncover me if I have something really bad happen to me? Well, every \nNovember 15 to December 31 you can change your mind. You can change \nyour company, and they cannot stop you. Tell me where else insurance \nworks like that. Every November 15 to December 31, you can change your \nmind and sign up for a plan that has new kinds of benefits for you that \nmatch new illnesses that you might have.\n  This is working for the people who have paid attention. It is easy to \nhave Medicare do the math. So everybody out there who hasn't signed up \nneeds to talk to the volunteers, probably at their senior citizen \ncenter or call the 1-800 number or get on the Medicare Internet site \nand have that plan figured out for you. It takes a few minutes and you \ncan be set so that you, first of all, won't have any penalties, but, \nsecondly, you will have some tremendous benefits as you need the \nmedication. It has made a huge difference.\n  Some people have talked about negotiating the price. When I was doing \nthese hearings, I had some difficulty with people who showed up and \nsaid: You know, there are some medications I really want to have, that \nI am supposed to have, and I cannot get them. Well, when I checked, \nthose were the veterans, and the veterans' prices are negotiated, and \nwhen they negotiate prices, they pick a similar drug and get the best \nprice by kind of fixing the price on it and driving the price down \nthrough this bidding war. But it eliminates medications. Yes, there are \nmedications you can take. It may not be the medication your doctor \nthinks is absolutely the best. But that is what happens with negotiated \nprices.\n  So what we relied on in the Medicare prescription Part D was \ncompetition, and competition has happened. Prices came down 25 percent, \nand then people who signed up for the program who are using medications \nfound out that they are also saving another 25 percent as the least \namount, or 37 percent as the average amount, and some people are \ngetting 83 percent--I say some people. I know some people who are \ngetting several thousand times more than what they are paying in \nbecause they are into the catastrophic care. I wasn't even listing the \ncatastrophic care.\n  The important thing is that we need to tell people and help people to \nsign up by May 15. It is a tremendous benefit. We have had more people \nsign up than we had anticipated signing up. That means, again, a bigger \nmarket; that means lower costs. So it works for all of us when people \nsign up. Remember, there are plans out there. If they have them for \n$1.87 a month in Wyoming, I bet they have that at $1.87 or less every \nplace in the country. Look at those if you are not using any \nmedication.\n  So that is what competition does. That is the purpose of the bill \nthat we are talking about and that we have actually had the motion to \nproceed on, not the ones that fall under other committees' \njurisdictions, such as Medicare or stem cells or some of the other \nthings that have been talked about here. Those are things that \nactually--this falls under the jurisdiction of the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee. We took the bill through committee that \nhas never been through the Senate before. The House passed a bill that \nis considerably more liberal and difficult than the one that we passed. \nThey passed it eight times over there in a very bipartisan way. If we \nhave the same Democratic Senators over here vote for it that had \nDemocrats in the House vote for it, we will pass this bill easily. Even \nif there is a filibuster, we will pass it because it is a concept that \nsmall businesses have been asking for. This is the first opportunity we \nhave had to provide it for them.\n  We did it by being very conservative in the approach and going to a \nsituation where we could work across State borders, so that \nassociations could build a big enough pool that they could effectively \nwork with their insurance companies to get these multiple competition \nbids. We are certain that it will work. One of the reasons we are \ncertain that it will work is because it has been tried within States. \nBut those who have tried it within States have found that it works very \nwell, and they know it would work even better if they could go across \nState borders. So even those who are doing it are asking to do it on a \nwider scale than what they have been. For a lot of the States that have \nless population, yes, they want to be able to do it at all. They don't \nhave big enough pools within their States to do it, so they want to be \nable to go across the State borders.\n  I want to discuss a little bit why we need to pass S. 1955 and allow \nfor the creation of these small business health plans. First of all, \nthe concept of allowing small businesses to join together to find \nbetter prices for health insurance is not new, as I mentioned. Many \norganizations have offered nationwide health plans to members in the \npast. But States continued to add mandated benefits and other \nregulations to their insurance markets during the 1980s and 1990s, and \nthe administrative hassles and costs associated with the mandates and \nregulations became too much of a burden for existing plans that could \nno longer offer an affordable benefit on a national basis. So they \ndiscontinued the plans.\n  The Associated Builders and Contractors organization, known as ABC, \nis an unfortunate example of this problem. Their insurance carrier \nrefused to continue doing business with the ABC insurance trust in the \nlate 1990s because\n\n[[Page S4192]]\n\nthe panoply of 50 different State regulations and excessive benefit \nmandates made it impractical and unattractive for the insurance company \nto continue the program. ABC was unable to find another carrier to pick \nup their business.\n  This chart kind of shows how health care costs have gone. I don't \nthink there is any argument on either side of the aisle that this is \nwhat has happened. There has been a rapid escalation, and compared to \nwhat it used to be, there has been a rapid escalation for a long time, \noddly enough. We are up to a national average cost per employee of \nabout $8,000 a year. That doesn't include the part the individuals are \npaying, which brings it up to about $11,000 a year. That is the amount \nwe have been talking about on both sides of the aisle today.\n  What is truly unfortunate is that workers at ABC's member companies \nwere benefiting from this program, and the companies were saving money \non their health care expenses. The health plan sponsored by ABC for \nnearly 45 years had total administrative expenses of about 13 cents for \nevery dollar in premium. These costs included all marketing \nadministration, insurance company risk, claim payment expenses, and \nState premium taxes. Compare this to the small business employers who \npurchase coverage directly from an insurance company. The total \nexpenses for most small businesses today can approach 35 cents for \nevery dollar of premium. So saving nearly 25 cents on a dollar is real \nmoney, especially in today's health insurance prices.\n  The other benefit to ABC's member companies and employees is that any \nprofit generated by their health plan stays in the plan. This also \nhelped keep costs down. So the idea isn't new, and it has worked \nbefore.\n\n  But Congress needs to act before small business organizations can \nresurrect their defunct programs and before other organizations can \nstart new ones. Congress considered fixing this problem during debate \nover the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in 1996--\nit is better known as HIPAA--but the small business affordability \nprovisions in the House bill were dropped during the conference between \nthe House and the Senate in the final bill. As a result, HIPAA only \naddressed access to health insurance and not affordability. So now \neveryone has access to health insurance policies, but the policies \nthemselves are unaffordable to many. When I became chairman of the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions last year, I \nannounced that I would bring a health insurance affordability bill \nbefore the committee so we could finish the job we started 10 years \nago--in other words, to make it possible for all Americans to have \naccess to a health insurance policy that is affordable.\n  Many were skeptical then, and some may still be skeptical now, but \nthe time for more of the same is over. America's working families want \nchange, and they are tired of excuses from Congress.\n  Small businesses and working families are demanding relief from high \nhealth insurance costs. And it is no wonder. This year, employers are \npaying twice what they were paying in the year 2000 for health \ninsurance. That is correct. What businesses paid for health insurance \nhas doubled over the past 6 years. That is a pace we can't keep up.\n  This cost squeeze hurts small businesses the most. The highest rates \nof uninsured workers can be found in businesses with 25 or fewer \nworkers. Only 60 percent of the Nation's businesses are offering health \ninsurance these days, down from nearly 75 percent just 5 years ago.\n  Small businesses and working families are stuck on the escalator of \nrising health insurance costs, with no end in sight. And in a tight \nlabor market, small business owners don't want to jump off this fast-\nmoving escalator because dropping health insurance puts them at a major \ndisadvantage in competing for the best workers. We need to give them a \nsafe place to get off this escalator of rising costs, somewhere where \nit is more affordable for themselves and working families, and the \nsmall business health plan will give them that option.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, the chairman has brought a carefully crafted \npiece of legislation to the Senate floor, one that took a tremendous \namount of skill to negotiate and one that has incredible support--more \nsupport when the bill passed out of committee than it does today. Why? \nBecause people now fear it might become law. People fear this might \npass, and they never believed it would. What does it do? It brings \nadditional competition to the marketplace, but more importantly, it \nbrings health care coverage to Americans who have no coverage today.\n  Why are we here today, on Tuesday afternoon at almost 5 o'clock? \nBecause the Senate is in a 30-hour debate about whether we are going to \nbe willing or able to proceed. We are not even on the bill yet; we are \nin a procedural mode which requires us to have a vote to proceed to \nconsider whether we are going to have a debate on this bill, S. 1955, a \nbill that changes the choices of the uninsured population in America.\n  The choices they have today are nothing and nothing. Under any \nscenario, you would have unanimous support to change that. But there \nare actually people who are against that up here, but not across the \ncountry. As a matter of fact, in this poll done by Public Opinion \nStrategies in March of this year, over 80 percent of the people polled \noverwhelmingly support small business health plans; in other words, \nthey support this legislation--the effort to bring new choices of \nproducts that are affordable to small businesses, to employers, and, \nmore importantly, to the employees they hire.\n  In North Carolina, we have 671,000 small businesses. Ninety-eight \npercent of firms with employees are small businesses in North Carolina. \nDon't let anybody come to the floor and tell you that this bill does \nnot have an effect except on a select group of people. It may be a \nselect group of people, but it is 98 percent of the employers of North \nCarolina. Women-owned small businesses have increased 24 percent in \nNorth Carolina since 1997, Hispanic-owned small businesses have \nincreased 24 percent since the same date, Black-owned small businesses \nhave increased 31 percent since 1997, and Asian-owned small businesses \nhave increased 74 percent since 1997. These are companies which benefit \nfrom this legislation. These are companies which today can't afford the \npremium costs of health insurance; therefore, their employee base goes \nwithout. They are in that category of uninsured that so many people \ncome and talk about on this floor, but they talk about uninsured \nwithout the solution as to how to cover them.\n  This is a population which in some cases today is on Medicaid. They \nwork full-time. Their income level qualifies them for Medicaid. And \nwhat would be the incentive for them to get off of Medicaid? It would \nbe if their employer has the option to offer them health care the way \nthe majority of America is now provided health care: through their \nemployer. But we are here in 30 hours of debate trying to decide \nwhether we are going to allow Members to come to the floor and debate a \nbill and offer amendments which will allow us to switch from nothing \nand nothing to nothing and something, which will allow us to inject \nsomething, some ray of hope into the millions of Americans who don't \nhave coverage today.\n  Let me read a few letters. I think it is always helpful to hear from \npeople whom this affects, the human face behind the issues that \nsometimes we lose on this floor simply because we don't want to talk \nabout names or pictures.\n  This is a woman from Sunbury, NC. She wrote me in mid-April of this \nyear. I am just going to read some pieces. She says:\n\n       Support SBHP legislation, S. 1955. I feel that this is very \n     important because I haven't had health insurance in many \n     years, because my employer doesn't have access to affordable \n     insurance to offer us.\n\n  Some suggest on this Senate floor that is not the case, that \neverybody has the opportunity to have health insurance. ``I haven't had \nhealth insurance in many years.'' Why? ``Because my employer can't \nafford what is available.''\n  Another letter received in April of this year from a young lady in \nElizabeth City, NC:\n\n       Please support Senate bill 1955, the Health Insurance \n     Marketplace Modernization and\n\n[[Page S4193]]\n\n     Affordability Act. My employer cannot afford health insurance \n     for their employees. My husband works for Ford. They are \n     closing his plant soon. We will have no insurance unless my \n     employer offers it. I have premature twins. They were born 3 \n     months early. It costs me $2,000 a month to feed them. That \n     does not include any doctor's appointments we have to go to. \n     I feel that this is a great bill.\n\n  What is America looking for? They are looking for hope. They are \nlooking for us to produce a product out of this institution that \nactually fulfills their needs. I don't know how it can be any clearer.\n\n       It is not offered to me today, because my employer can't \n     afford the options that are in our marketplace.\n\n  What do we do? We create new options that are affordable. That is, in \nfact, what the chairman is trying to do with this bill.\n  Here is a third letter, also from Elizabeth City but a different \nbusiness. It says:\n\n       Small businesses need help with insurance--\n\n  In big bold letters--\n\n       I am now paying $986 per month for my wife and myself. This \n     is for only 60 percent coverage and a $2,500 deductible. I \n     know people with group insurance who are paying $600 a month \n     for 80 percent coverage and a $250 deductible. Many of those \n     have dental insurance as well. My policy provides none. \n     Please vote for this bill. Allow small businesses to have \n     coverage equal to employers of other companies.\n\n  That is all we are doing. We are using the scale of what people who \nhave a tremendous amount of employees can do, and that is they can go \nto insurance carriers and they can negotiate for products based upon \nthe volume of their employees. But how does a small business owner do \nthat when he has five or six or seven employees? Well, it is real \nsimple. We allow them to band together. We allow them to band together \ninto a common association, and we allow that association to then market \ntheir entire association based upon the volume.\n  Another letter that I received on April 6 says:\n\n       As a small business owner, it is important to enable some \n     economy of scale in allowing franchises to obtain more \n     affordable health care coverage.\n\n  The last one I am going to read is quite unique.\n\n       As a professional photographer, I have seen firsthand the \n     difficulty that my fellow professional photographers face \n     when attempting to purchase health insurance on their own. S. \n     1955 would allow photographers and other independent business \n     owners to band together across State lines and purchase \n     health insurance. Having this as an option and choice will \n     improve our access to quality health care and help control \n     costs through competition.\n\n  These letters are from people on the front lines. They are from \nemployees whose employers can't offer coverage today because it is not \naffordable. They are from individuals who own businesses and would like \nto offer coverage to their employees. They are even from photographers, \npeople whose lives are in their hands every day in a camera, but they \ncannot afford the individual costs of health insurance in today's \nmarketplace.\n  In North Carolina, we have 1.3 million uninsured North Carolinians. \nOf that 1.3 million, almost 900,000 uninsured individuals are in \nfamilies or are on their own where one person at least works full-time. \nWith the passage of this bill, 900,000 of the 1.3 million uninsured in \nNorth Carolina could potentially be offered health insurance. We can \nnarrow it down from 1.3 million to 400,000 individuals who are \nuninsured in North Carolina with the passage of one simple bill, or at \nleast they would have the option to be able to purchase it for once. \nNinety-one percent of workers in large firms of 1,000 employees or more \nhave health insurance, yet 66 percent of workers in small businesses \ndefined as 10 employees or fewer have health insurance. Well, if you \nremember the North Carolina numbers, I said 98 percent of firms with \nemployees were small businesses. Think of the millions of Americans who \nare going to be touched by the passage of this one piece of legislation \nthat provides them choice. Where today their choice is between nothing \nand nothing, tomorrow their choice is between nothing and something.\n  Why are we here? We are here for 30 hours of debate--not debate on \nthe bill, not debate about the amendments, debate about whether we are \ngoing to move forward. We do that at a time when--I just went back and \ndid a quick calculation on the back of my calendar--we have 76 \nlegislative days left between now and adjournment. That is assuming we \nhave productive days on Fridays and Mondays, and as the chairman knows, \nFridays and Mondays are not always productive in the Halls of Congress. \nPeople are either slow to get here or quick to leave. If you take out \nFridays and Mondays, we are down to 45 days. But we are going to spend \n30 hours trying to decide whether we are going to move forward to \ndebate this bill, and we will spend another 30 hours after we file \ncloture on the bill to get to a point where we can have an up-or-down \nvote, if, in fact, we get that far.\n  Last night, we voted on two medical liability bills--medical \nliability that covers the entire medical professional world--and last \nnight, we were denied the ability to proceed and to debate the \nlegislation, much less amend it. The second bill is legislation in \nwhich--and I think the American people would be shocked at this--we \nwere denied the ability to move forward to debate or amend legislation \nthat limited the liability to OB/GYNs in America, a specialty we are \nlosing specialists out of every day, where every year people aren't \ncontinuing to practice. But we will spend 30 hours debating whether we \nproceed to debate not necessarily the merits of the bill--and my hope \nis that the chairman will be successful, and I will be beside him \narguing every step of the way, because without this, these Americans \ndon't have hope of a choice of anything other than nothing and nothing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, my understanding is that Senator Dorgan \nhad time at 5 o'clock set aside, so if he wishes to take it now, then I \nwill wait until his conclusion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of Senator Dorgan's \nremarks I be permitted to speak at that time. Since it is controlled by \nthe Democrats, I can make that request by myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota will be \nrecognized, and at such time as he completes his statement, the Senator \nfrom California will be recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. That is assuming it comes within the 30-minute parameters?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have listened to some of the debate \ntoday. It has been very interesting. The last speaker spoke about \nchoice and choices. I want to talk about choices in health care a bit. \nThis is Health Week, we are told. It is an opportunity, for a change, \nat long last to talk about some health care issues on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  The intent, I believe, of the chairman who brings this bill to the \nfloor is that we should speak only about and address only the issues \ndealing with small business health plans. However, he knows and I know \nthere are many other health issues that have been long delayed by this \nChamber and that need to be debated. I intend to offer a number of \namendments. They are in order under the rules of the Senate. They are \namendments that deal explicitly with health care issues.\n  The issue before the Senate is not unimportant. The question of \nrising health care costs is very significant to everybody--individuals, \nbusinesses, governments. Everyone who is a consumer has to deal with \nincreased costs of health care and we should, indeed, address the issue \nof health care costs for business associations and for small \nbusinesses. There is no question about that. I wish to be a part of the \ngroup that works on that in a bipartisan way, in a way that expands \nopportunity, not narrows opportunity; in a way that expands coverage, \nnot narrows coverage; in a way that covers everyone, not just a few. I \ndo not agree that we should make health care unaffordable for the older \nand sicker and then make profit out of insuring people who are younger \nand healthier. That is not the right way to do this.\n  But having said all of that, let me describe some other things that \nhave been long delayed on the floor of the Senate that need to be \naddressed. Let me talk about the first one. It is the\n\n[[Page S4194]]\n\nissue of reimportation of prescription drugs. A bipartisan piece of \nlegislation has been long ago introduced and discussed here on the \nfloor of the Senate, and we have not had the opportunity to vote on it.\n  The reimportation of prescription drugs, why is that important? \nBecause the American people are charged the highest prices in the world \nfor prescription drugs; it is not even close--the highest prices in the \nworld. Consumers in every other country are paying lower prices. Try to \nbuy Lipitor and if you buy it in the United States you pay a higher \nprice than in any country in the world--France, Germany, England, you \nname it. You pay the highest prices in the United States. Why should \nU.S. consumers be charged the highest prices?\n  With consent, I want to show a couple of things on the floor of the \nSenate. Let me show, if I might, two bottles of Lipitor. I ask consent \nto show these on the floor of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. As you can see, they look identical: identical labels, \nidentical pills in the same bottle made by the same company--shipped to \ntwo different places. One is shipped to Canada and one is shipped to \nthe United States. The difference? One is half the price of the other. \nGuess which. It is the Canadian consumer who gets the benefit of paying \nhalf the price for the identical prescription drug.\n  Let me also show a couple of containers of Prevacid. This is a drug \nthat is widely used for ulcers. Once again, as you can see, it is \nessentially the same bottle, same pill, made by the same company, made \nin an FDA-approved plant and shipped to two different locations, one to \nCanada and one to the United States. The difference? This one costs \ntwice as much. Who buys this one? The U.S. consumer; twice as much for \nthe same pill.\n  An old fellow sitting on a hay bale in North Dakota at a farm meeting \nsaid, my wife has been fighting breast cancer for 3 years. She took \nTamoxifen for breast cancer. Every 3 months we drove to Canada to get \nTamoxifen because it was the only way we could afford it, and we paid \nabout 80 percent less than it would have cost us to buy that \nprescription drug to treat her breast cancer. We paid 80 percent less \nby driving to Canada to get it.\n\n  The fact is, they allow a small amount of drugs to come across the \nborder for personal use. But other than that, a U.S. consumer cannot \naccess an FDA-approved prescription drug nor can a U.S. pharmacist \naccess that same FDA-approved prescription drug. That is unbelievable. \nWe have a bipartisan group of Members of the Senate who say consumers \nought to be able to purchase FDA prescription drugs by reimporting them \nfrom other countries. That would put downward pressure on prescription \ndrug prices in this country. A bipartisan group of Senators wants to do \nthat, but we are prevented from doing it by current law. We want to \nchange the law.\n  Yet we are prevented from changing the law because the majority \nleader won't bring this legislation to the floor of the Senate. This is \nsomething we can offer as an amendment to the bill on the floor. It is \nwell within the rules of the Senate, it deals with health care, and I \nam serving notice now that this is an amendment we will offer and vote \non during the conduct of this discussion, providing we are allowed to \noffer amendments. I am hearing rumors that perhaps the majority leader \nwill decide to fill the tree legislatively and allow no amendments. If \nthat is the case, it will be a long week, but my hope is he will not do \nthat. If amendments are allowed, I will offer this amendment and will \nget a vote.\n  Let me go back to about midnight on the night of March 11, 2004. That \nis a little over 2 years ago--midnight. The reason I remember it was \nmidnight, I was sitting right back here and I reached an agreement with \nthe majority leader, Senator Frist. Here is what Senator Frist \nannounced that evening after our negotiations, and after which I agreed \nto release the name of Dr. Mark McClellan to be promoted from the head \nof FDA to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. As a result \nof that, Senator Frist came to the floor and put this in the Record.\n\n       I announce for the information of my colleagues that, with \n     consultation with the chairman of the Senate Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, Pensions, Senator Dorgan, Senator \n     Stabenow, Senator McCain, Senator Cochran, and other \n     interested Senators, the Senate will begin a process for \n     developing proposals that would allow for the safe \n     reimportation of FDA-approved prescription drugs.\n\n  Two years later, nothing: No vote on the floor of the Senate, \nnothing. My colleague, Senator Vitter, sent a letter around a year ago. \nIt says:\n\n        . . . in the context of the Lester Crawford FDA \n     nomination, I obtained an agreement with Majority Leader \n     Frist regarding drug importation legislation. . . .The Senate \n     will probably hold some floor vote on a reimportation \n     amendment soon, probably on the Agriculture Appropriations \n     bill. Should that vote demonstrate that reimportation has 60-\n     vote support on the floor, then Leader Frist will be open to \n     and work in good faith toward a floor debate and vote on a \n     reimportation bill. . . .\n\n  What happened as a result of that? Nothing. No action, no votes, \nnothing.\n  This bill on the floor of the Senate is amendable. This bipartisan \namendment deals with health care. It has been long delayed--and no \nmore. I intend to offer this amendment this week.\n  Finally, at long last, perhaps the American consumers will no longer \nbe charged the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs \nbecause they will be able to access FDA-approved drugs by reimporting \nthem from virtually any other country in which the consumers are paying \na lesser price for the identical prescription drug. That is unfair to \nthe American people. The only reason we have not changed it yet is \nthere are, regrettably, a few people in this Chamber who have blocked \nthat opportunity, I assume on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry. \nBut that blocking is about done. This week this bill is open for \namendment. I intend to come and offer this as an amendment.\n  That is one.\n  Let me talk for a moment about another issue, once again long \npromised here to the Senate. We are told we are going to have an \nopportunity to do this--again and again and again--and we are not. We \ndon't get the opportunity. It is called stem cell research. It is \ncontroversial; there is no question about that. I understand the \ncontroversy. But is it important? Yes, it is. We have all these people \nwho talk about life. This is about life. This is about life-giving \nmedical research, to find ways to unlock the mysteries and to cure some \nof the worst diseases known to people: Alzheimer's, diabetes, cancer, \nheart disease, Parkinson's. There is an unbelievable opportunity for \nmedical research to unlock the cures for some of these diseases. But we \nneed to proceed with stem cell research.\n  We have been long promised the opportunity to have a vote on stem \ncell research on the floor of the Senate, and guess what. No such vote. \nOn May 24, almost 1 year ago, the House of Representatives passed a \nbill on stem cell research. We are still waiting to have a vote on that \nhere on the floor of the Senate--once again, a bill with bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Let me describe, if I might, the importance of this in the eyes of a \nyoung woman. I met with this young girl about 2 weeks ago. It is not \nthe first time I met her. She is a young lady, Camille Johnson, 13 \nyears old, diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 4. She is the one in \nthe middle, playing the clarinet. She has had some very serious health \nproblems, some very serious problems in her young life. She would like \nvery much to live her life without diabetes. She would like diabetes to \nbe cured for her and millions of others.\n  In 2002, scientists at Stanford University used special chemicals to \nwhat is called transform undifferentiated embryonic stem cells of mice \ninto cell masses that resemble islets found in the mouse pancreas. When \nthis tissue is transplanted into the diabetic mice, it produces insulin \nin response to high glucose levels in animals. Wouldn't it be wonderful \nif, through this stem cell research, we cure diabetes; if we could tell \nthis young woman your life is not going to be a life of diabetes. We \ncan cure that disease.\n\n  I have been involved in political campaigns recently and have been \ntold by opponents that my proposal and my position on stem cell \nresearch is one that\n\n[[Page S4195]]\n\nmurders embryos. Nothing could be further from the truth, nothing at \nall. Do you know there are 1 million people living among us, walking, \nbreathing, talking--1 million people who were conceived through in \nvitro fertilization? One million people. When that in vitro \nfertilization takes place, the uniting of a sperm and an egg in a petri \ndish, more than a single embryo is created. A number of embryos are \ncreated in that process. Some are implanted into the uterus of a woman \nand some become a human being. Some are cryogenically frozen and stored \nin the event they should be used again if this did not result in a \npregnancy.\n  There are some 400,000 of those embryos frozen at in vitro clinics \nright now, 400,000 of them, and 8,000 to 11,000 are discarded, thrown \naway, every year. They become hospital waste.\n  Should some perhaps be used for stem cell research with the hope of \nsaving lives? The answer clearly is yes. This is not about murdering an \nembryo. If in fact this is the murder of an embryo, then the discarding \nof the embryos at the in vitro fertilization clinic, 8,000 to 11,000 a \nyear, is also murder.\n  We had one person testify at the Commerce Committee a couple of years \nago who said those 1 million people who are here as a result of in \nvitro fertilization should not be here; it was wrong to create these \npeople. Tell that to the parents who had those children; the childless \nparents who, through in vitro fertilization, discovered the miracle of \nhaving a child.\n  The question of stem cell research is not about murdering an embryo, \nit is about an opportunity to cure some of the dreaded diseases.\n  The other issue--and the reason I am talking about this is this is a \nbig issue that we are not allowed to vote on in the Senate. This, too, \nshould be an amendment on this bill. This, too, during Health Week is a \nvery important issue dealing with health.\n  The other side of this research is something called somatic cell \nnuclear transfer. Simply it is this: Let us assume a patient takes a \nskin cell from their own earlobe and that skin cell from their earlobe \nis then put in an evacuated egg and stimulated to become a blastocyst \nof a couple of hundred cells.\n  That blastocyst now has predictor cells. They use the predictor cells \nfor heart muscle, to inject back into the heart muscle to grow a \nstronger heart, to repair a heart attack.\n  Some would say you have destroyed or murdered an embryo. There is no \nfertilized egg. There is only the skin cell from the person who had the \nheart attack whose cell is now being used, through somatic cell nuclear \ntransfer, to save that person's life. This is about lifesaving. Yet we \nhave so many here who said: Let's not worry about these diseases. Let's \nshut off this research because we think it is about murdering embryos.\n  That is not what this is about. It is about this young girl and \nwhether we decide we want this young girl to live her life as a \ndiabetic, a life filled with hope at this point that Congress will \nfinally do the right thing.\n  The House of Representatives did it. The Senate needs to vote on it. \nPerhaps this week is as good a week as any. We have been promised. A \nyear ago we were promised, just like drug reimportation. This Chamber \nis full of promises, but we never quite get to vote on important \nissues.\n  I am not suggesting that when I talk about stem cell research that \nthere are not ethical considerations, without serious concerns and \nserious issues to which we should be attentive. We should. I don't \ndismiss all the other concerns. But I do say this: If you have lost a \nchild, if you have lost a loved one, and you have watched someone die \nfrom Parkinson's or cancer or heart disease, if you have been through \nthat and then say to yourself: But I want to shut down promising \nresearch that could potentially cure diseases, then you have not been \nthrough it the way a number of people in this Chamber have been through \nit. I think it is so important for us to do the right thing and to \ncontinue this breathtaking research that can save lives.\n  There are so many other issues. There are just a couple of minutes \nremaining. Then I will yield the time to my colleague from California.\n  We passed recently in the Senate a piece of legislation that provides \nprescription drug benefits to senior citizens. But we did nothing to \nput downward pressure on drug prices. There is a special provision in \nthe bill which my colleagues, Senators Wyden and Snowe, were talking \nabout earlier today, that actually prevents the Federal Government from \nnegotiating for lower prices with the pharmaceutical industry. That is \nunbelievably ignorant. A provision like that is unbelievably ignorant, \nand it ought to be repealed.\n  All we need is a vote on that on the Senate floor. That, too, is a \nhealth issue. There is no excuse for this Congress to say: By the way, \nthe Federal Government cannot negotiate for a lower price. We already \ndo it in the VA. We end up with far lower prices as a result of the \nnegotiations.\n  In this case, with this bill, there is a provision that says: Don't \nyou dare negotiate. It would be against the law for you to try to get \nlower prices and reduce Government spending. That, too, is a health \nissue. That, too, will be in order this week.\n  I hope very much that we will have a vote on that. Yes, the \nunderlying bill is important. We ought to find a bipartisan way to fix \nit. No, it doesn't work the way it is. It will restrict choice, in my \njudgement, increase prices for some, and make others completely \nuninsurable. We ought to fix it in a bipartisan way.\n  But on the other three issues--reimportation of prescription drugs, \nstem cell research, repeal the law that prevents negotiation of lower \nprices with the pharmaceutical industry to save taxpayers money--\nshouldn't we do all three of those? We ought to do all three of those \nthis afternoon, right now. We have been blocked for far too long.\n  If there is, in fact, an amendable vehicle--and I hope it will be; we \nwill know that tomorrow morning--then I have just described three \namendments that I believe should be offered, and when offered I believe \nwill be approved in the coming days. If not, if this is a charade, and \ntomorrow we discover there is a legislative approach called ``filling \nthe tree,'' which is simply setting up a little blocking device to say \nwe are not going to allow anybody to offer anything, then I think the \nSenate will have sent a very strong message that this isn't Health \nWeek. This is a week in which you want to trot out a little proposal of \nyour own and avoid votes on serious issues that we should be taking in \nthe Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Dorgan's remarks. I \nhave been on the floor of the Senate a lot today waiting to get the \ntime, and I have been fortunate to hear many colleagues. I thank him \nfor very succinctly pointing out that in a real health care week you \nwouldn't close your eyes to hope--hope that we are going to find cures \nfor the terrible diseases that plague our families--Parkinson's, \nAlzheimer's, diabetes, spinal cord injuries, stroke, heart attack, you \njust name them. The fact is, we know stem cell research is promising. \nWe know a lot of States have gotten out ahead of the Federal Government \nbecause this President and this Congress have restricted the number of \nstem cell lines we can fund research on. And many of those stem cell \nlines are, frankly, no good at all because they have been impacted by \nmice cells. And they lack the diversity needed for robust research.\n  I have talked to leaders in this field. I am not a scientist. I was \neducated in economics. But I have spoken to leading scientists, among \nwhom is a gentleman named Dr. Peterson who worked at USFC in San \nFrancisco. He is one of the leading pioneers in stem cell research who \nleft to go to England because this President and this Congress put up a \nbig stop sign in front of stem cell research. It is tragic.\n  Our families need the hope of a cure. How many of us have met with \nthese youngsters who have juvenile diabetes, and we have seen how \ndifficult their lives are and how they suffer, even with the strides \nthat have been made in this area. They are still in great danger.\n  Health Week is here. We have a vehicle, as Senator Dorgan calls it, \nthe Enzi bill, which tries to deal with the health insurance problems \nthat small businesses face. I am going to talk about a better \nalternative to the Enzi\n\n[[Page S4196]]\n\nbill that will really do something. But we also have a chance to raise \nthese issues during the debate on the Enzi bill.\n  We have bipartisan support for drug importation from countries such \nas Canada, where drugs are sold at half the price of what drug \ncompanies charge in the U.S. We have bipartisan support for stem cell \nresearch, fixing the Medicare prescription drug issue so we could \nactually say to Medicare: You have the ability and the right just as \nthe VA has to negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies for lower \nprices. But I have to say Health Care Week Republican style is really \nInsurance Company Week.\n\n  If you look at the bills that have been brought before us, they all \nhelp the insurance companies. They don't help average Americans. They \ndo not help us.\n  The first two bills said we are going to restrict the right of \npatients--whether they are very wealthy, whether they are middle \nincome, whether they are poor--we are going to stop them from \nrecovering damages if they are harmed by medical malpractice.\n  I was very pleased that the Senate chose not to limit debate on those \ntwo bills which would have taken away the rights of patients while \ngiving a gift to the insurance companies. And hopefully we can change \nthe Enzi bill.\n  I don't like bills that take away benefits from my people in \nCalifornia. I don't like bills that take away benefits from all \nAmericans. That is why the Enzi bill is a bad bill. It does just that. \nI will go through with you the list of benefits that are taken away.\n  Mr. President, the Republicans bring us Health Care Week. They bring \nus the Enzi bill. What they do not tell us and you don't find out until \nyou look is that all the States' protections that have been put into \nplace will be wiped out upon passage of the Enzi bill.\n  Those are harsh words. What do I mean? What benefits will be taken \naway from my people in California? According to the report put together \nby Families U.S.A, ``The Enzi Bill, Bad Medicine for America,'' those \nbenefits include AIDS vaccines, alcoholism treatment, blood lead \nscreening. You know that is important because if you don't screen kids \nfor lead in their blood they could have learning disabilities--bone \ndensity screening. We know about osteoporosis. In California we \nguarantee that your insurance will pay for that; no guarantee in the \nEnzi bill whatsoever. As a matter of fact, the Enzi bill overrides all \nof this--cervical cancer screening, clinical trials, colorectal \nscreening, contraceptives, diabetic supplies and education.\n  We just talked about how it is so important for diabetics to have \ntheir meds--drug abuse treatment, emergency services, home health care, \nhospice care, infertility treatment, mammography screening, maternity \ncare, mental health parity.\n  In my State, if you have a mental health problem and you need help, \nyour insurance coverage will cover your treatment, just the same as if \nyou had a physical problem. We know it works. The list goes on--\nmetabolic disorders, minimal mastectomy, off-label drug use. In \nCalifornia, we have a law that says you can't kick a woman out of a \nhospital the same day she has a mastectomy. What, you may say? This \nhappens? It does--off-label drug use, orthotics, prosthetics, prostate \ncancer screening. We know that prostate cancer is a scourge--\nreconstructive surgery, second medical surgery opinion.\n  If somebody tells you you need serious surgery, you can get a second \nopinion in California. That is covered--special footwear, telemedicine, \nwell child care, so that we prevent diseases. That is my State.\n  Every single State in the Union gets overridden, whether it is \nAlabama, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho.\n  I know my friend from Georgia would be interested because he is \nsitting in the Chair. These are the things that your State offers. It \nprotects your consumers. It is as long a list as California, I am proud \nto say--alcoholism treatment, ambulatory surgery, bone density \nscreening, bone marrow transplants are covered in the State of Georgia. \nCervical cancer screening, contraceptives, dental anesthesia, diabetic \nsupplies, drug abuse treatment, emergency services, heart transplants \nare covered in Georgia. Infertility treatment, mammography screening, \nmental health parity, minimal mastectomy stay, morbid obesity care--\nwhich is very important now with the obesity epidemic--off-label drug \nuse, ovarian cancer screening, telemedicine, and well child care. \nGeorgia has a very inclusive and wonderful list of guaranteed \nprotections for people.\n  In the State of Georgia there are 2.347 million people affected by \nthis who would not have those guarantees under the Enzi plan. The Enzi \nplan essentially says to insurance companies: You can choose. You have \nto offer one plan. What do they call that plan? One premium plan. You \nhave to offer one premium plan based on a state plan of their choosing, \nbut there is no guarantee at all that what is in that premium plan is \nwhat is in the Georgia plan or the California plan or the North Dakota \nplan.\n  The fact is, all of the work that has been done in our States--and I \nfind it somewhat amusing given this is a Republican debate, that the \nRepublican bill preempts the States. What is wrong with this picture? I \nthought our Republican friends loved decisionmaking at the State \nlevel. No, not here in the Senate. They would prefer the insurance \ncompanies decide it rather than the States.\n\n  This is why I call my colleagues' attention to a study done on the \nimpact on all the States, with letters compiled from attorneys general \nfrom many of the States and Governors.\n  From Oregon, they register their opposition, first their benefits are \nnot guaranteed any longer. In addition, they are very worried about \nwhat happens to premiums. The Enzi bill disadvantages older people. As \nfar as the research I have done, it disadvantages women. It certainly \ndisadvantages people who come in with a preexisting condition such as \nhigh blood pressure. That includes a lot of Americans.\n  The bottom line is, the Enzi bill, the star rollout production of the \nRepublican Health Care Week, will make null and void all protections \nthat our States have given their citizens and replace them with some \nkind of riverboat gamble where insurers will choose some plan, from \nsome State, and apply it to my State. I don't want a so-called premium \nplan from another State.\n  Here is a good example. In Connecticut, there is a terrible epidemic \nof Lyme disease. A tick bites your body and it can make a person very \nill. We have some of that in California, but we do not have as much per \ncapita as Connecticut. In Connecticut, the State legislature and the \nGovernor say insurers have to cover Lyme disease because it is an \nepidemic in the State. In other States, it may not be necessary. \nHowever, we will wipe that Connecticut requirement off the books, and \nwe will say, through the Enzi bill, insurance companies are going to \ndecide.\n  Something is wrong. This is not Health Care Week, this is ``insurance \ncompany week.'' That is not good for consumers.\n  My own State has built a comprehensive State health insurance system \nthat encourages affordable and equitable coverage for all, while \nensuring consumers are protected and guaranteed benefits. The Enzi bill \ntakes away a State's power to regulate health insurance. It is a gift \nto the insurers, as I said. It preempts benefits, as I said. It also is \ngoing to lead to way higher premiums for all in America who are covered \nby health insurance.\n  Insurance companies, not the States, will now decide what benefits \nthe consumers. That is why we have letter after letter after letter \nfrom Governors, from attorneys general, warning us not to pass the Enzi \nbill.\n  There appears to be no limits on the cost shares an insurer can \ncharge nor are there requirements that plans treat consumers equitably \nor offer comprehensive coverage.\n  As I said, if you are a little older--maybe you have high blood \npressure, maybe you have some other health problems--you are in \ntrouble. You are not going to have an affordable plan and you will lose \nthe benefits you have. You may be priced out of the market. It will be \ncatastrophic.\n  We have serious problems with the Enzi bill. Here is the great news. \nThere is a wonderful alternative out there, the Durbin-Lincoln bill, of \nwhich I am a cosponsor. I thank my friends for working so hard on this.\n  As I go around my State, people nod in agreement with the Durbin-\nLincoln bill's premise. Senators have very good\n\n[[Page S4197]]\n\nhealth insurance. We pay half of the premium and the Government matches \nthe other half. There is a Federal Employee Health Benefits Program. \nThere are basic benefits required and private companies come in and \noffer various plans. People such as me and my employees can choose from \na broad array of plans. It works beautifully.\n  I ask unanimous consent, at 5:45, the Senator from Oregon, Senator \nMurray, be recognized for 15 minutes, until 6 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Senators Durbin and Lincoln take this Federal plan and \nopen it up to small businesses with 100 employees down to a single \nself-employed person.\n  This plan will work because there will be a huge pool set up. \nEveryone can buy into it from any business in this country with less \nthan 100 employees. It would be a very diverse pool of people. They \nwill be insured. The pricing is going to be very fair and reasonable. \nThe plan will be administered in the same way our Federal benefits are \nadministered.\n  I heard Senator Thune say: That is a government plan. No, it isn't. \nIt is a plan that is administered by the Federal Employees Health \nBenefit Plan, but it is coverage provided by private insurers. Because \nthe administrative costs are kept so low, this is going to be very \naffordable and will solve the problem.\n  And guess what. This alternative, the Durbin-Lincoln alternative, \ndoes not take away the protections States have given all who live in \nthose States. If you are in California, you still get the benefits. By \nlaw, you are protected. If you live in Washington State, you will get \nthose benefits. The alternative that the Democrats are behind will cost \nless. It will protect benefits. It will work beautifully.\n  I say to my colleagues, if it is good enough for you, it ought to be \ngood enough for small businesses and their employees. This bill is a \nwonderful and practical alternative.\n  In my concluding 6 or 7 minutes, I will say that this so-called \nHealth Care Week is a major disappointment, unless we find out tomorrow \nwe can amend the Enzi bill. If we can amend Enzi and pass stem cell \nresearch and prescription drug reimportation, if we can make sure there \nis hope for patients with Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart condition, \nstroke, cancer because we move ahead with science, then Health Care \nWeek will have mattered. If we can offer the Durbin-Lincoln substitute, \nit will not preempt the protections of State law as the Enzi bill does. \nThe Enzi bill has more opposition than any bill I remember. AARP is \nagainst it. The Cancer Foundation is against it. There are 224 \norganizations against it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record those \norganizations opposed to the Enzi bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered

Mr. President, this bill is going to hurt American health \ncare by cancelling out all the hard-won State protections and by \nraising premiums so high they will price consumers out of the market. \nThat is why across the board there is opposition. I have not seen this \nmany organizations come out against a bill.\n  By the way, this bill, when it was first presented, sounded \nreasonable. It was only when we looked at the small print that we \nrealized how dangerous it is.\n  Instead of working on this misguided bill, we could have done the \nalternative, we could have done the stem cell, we could have fixed the \nMedicare prescription drugs, we could have allowed drug importation.\n  If we didn't want to do real health care reform, there are a lot of \nother things we could have done, such as raise the minimum wage. We \ncould have finished the job on immigration reform, strengthening the \nenforcement at the border and stopping illegal immigration, but getting \npeople on a path and out of the shadows.\n  What about Superfund sites? We have some of the most polluted sites \nin the country still awaiting cleanup. We have one in four people in \nAmerica, including 10 million children, living within 4 miles of a \nSuperfund site.\n  What about debating the war Iraq? That is on everyone's mind. There \nis still no exit strategy. There is still no plan. We see suffering on \nthe ground there every single day.\n  We have issues with a potential nuclear Iran. We should debate that. \nIn Afghanistan, the situation is deteriorating and we have all but \nforgotten about it. We have not followed the recommendations of the 9/\n11 Commission to this date. We have failed fiscal policies. We have \ndebt as far as the eye can see. We ought to debate pay-as-you-go. If \nMembers want to spend money, they should show how they going to pay for \nit instead of putting the burden on the backs of America's children.\n  There are many other things we could do, but since we are on Health \nCare Week, let's fix our health care system. Let's not pass a bill that \nwill not help people with serious diseases or fix the problems with the \nMedicare prescription drug program.\n  We have so much work to do and this Enzi bill is masquerading as a \nbill that will help our citizens. When we read the fine print, we find \nout it is only going to make matters worse.\n  I am proud to yield the floor to my friend from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the next \nDemocratic speakers in order be Senator Dayton, Senator Durbin, and \nSenator Akaka.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, at this hour, families are struggling \nwith health care. Seniors are facing a critical deadline for drug \ncoverage. Businesses are grappling with the high cost of insurance. And \npatients are being denied the cutting-edge research that could save \ntheir lives. Those are critical issues. And what is the Senate doing? \nWe are dealing with a distraction instead of real solutions to make \nhealth care affordable, more accessible, and more innovative.\n\n  I am on the Senate floor this evening to talk about what we should be \ndoing to help families and businesses and communities meet their health \ncare needs. I also want to talk this evening about why the Republican \nproposal, S. 1955, could do more harm than good.\n  This is a bill which takes a good idea--pooling the risk in health \ninsurance--and distorts it with a plan that will raise the cost of \nhealth care, strip away patient protections, and hurt many of our small \nbusinesses. But do not take my word for it. Attorneys general from 41 \nStates, including my own, have written to outline the serious problems \nwith the Republican bill. I have heard from doctors with the Washington \nState Medical Association and from my own Governor about the damage \nthis bill will inflict on patients and on our economy.\n  Simply put, this proposal is a distraction. Instead of dealing with \nreal solutions to real problems, the Republican leadership is wasting \ntime on one narrow proposal that is only going to make things worse. We \ncan do better. The truth is that patients and seniors, doctors and \nnurses, and all of our communities deserve better.\n  If we were serious about reducing the cost of health care, helping to \nimprove access, and driving innovation, we would be talking about the \ncritical issues that the Republican leadership is trying to avoid. We \nshould be focusing on everything from the Medicare drug program, to \nstem cell research, to community health care. Frankly, we do not have a \nday to waste.\n  On Monday, millions of seniors and disabled will be hit with a \ndeadline that means higher premiums for their prescription drugs. That \nMay 15 deadline is just 6 days away. I am hearing from seniors that \nthey are very worried about this deadline. They are worried they are \ngoing to pick the wrong plan, and they do not think it is fair to be \npunished if they need more time so they can make an informed choice.\n  I have been traveling throughout my home State of Washington, meeting \nwith seniors and holding roundtables with patients, with pharmacists, \nwith advocates.\n  Three weeks ago, I was in Chehalis, at the Twin Cities Senior Center. \nI can tell you, seniors are worried. They are angry. They are \nfrustrated. They are frightened about this May 15 deadline, and that \ndeadline is just one of the problems this flawed drug program is \npresenting.\n  The week before that, I was in Silverdale, and I have held Medicare \nroundtables in Kent, Vancouver, Ballard, Shelton, Spokane, Anacortes, \nBellevue, Aberdeen, Olympia, Lakewood, Seattle, and Everett. \nEverywhere, I have heard from seniors about just how bad the Medicare \nPart D Program is. I have heard their frustration about dealing with \nsuch a confusing system. I have heard their anger that this program \ndoes not meet their needs. And I have heard from many who just want to \nthrow their hands up in the air and ignore the whole program.\n  If we were serious about improving health care, we would be fixing \nthe problems they have outlined. Instead, we are going to let an unfair \ndeadline hurt our seniors even further. In just 6 days--in just 6 \ndays--they are going to have to pick a plan or face high penalties \nwhenever they do enroll, and the penalties grow larger the longer they \nwait. To me, that is just not fair.\n  Right now, this Senate could be extending the deadline so our seniors \nare not pressured into making the wrong choice in such a complicated \nsystem. Right now, we could be lifting the penalty so that seniors are \nnot punished if they need more time to make the right choice. Right \nnow, we could be providing help to millions of vulnerable Americans who \nhave been mistreated by this flawed Republican plan. But, instead, this \nCongress is leaving seniors to fend for themselves. The Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services has said he opposes extending the deadline or \nlifting the penalties, and this\n\n[[Page S4199]]\n\nRepublican Congress seems to agree with him by a shameful lack of \naction.\n  Seniors deserve better. The disabled deserve better. Our most \nvulnerable neighbors deserve better. If we really wanted to make health \ncare more affordable and more accessible and more innovative, we would \nbe on this floor fixing the Medicare drug program and helping seniors \nwho are facing that unfair deadline.\n  Now, that is just one example of what a real focus on health care on \nthis floor would include.\n  If we were serious about helping patients, we would be expanding \nlifesaving research. For patients who are living with diseases such as \nParkinson's or multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or diabetes, stem cell \nresearch holds the potential to help us understand and to treat and \nsomeday perhaps cure those devastating diseases.\n\n  Nearly a year ago, the House of Representatives passed legislation to \nlift the restrictions that hold back this promising research. The House \nof Representatives has acted, but for an entire year the Senate has \nnot. My colleagues, Senator Specter and Senator Harkin, are well known \nfor their leadership on this fight. They were promised a vote on stem \ncell research, and that vote has still not taken place. Every delay \nmeans missed opportunities for patients with devastating diseases.\n  If this Senate is serious about health care and saving lives, we \nshould be voting on stem cell legislation today. That is why, last \nweek, I joined with 39 other Senators in writing to the majority leader \nurging him to bring up H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement \nAct. But instead of real solutions, the Senate is focusing on a \ndistraction. Patients with life-threatening diseases deserve a lot \nbetter.\n  If we were serious about improving health care, we would be investing \nin local efforts that boost access to health care.\n  Two weeks ago, through the Johnson & Johnson Community Health Care \nAwards, I had a chance to honor leaders from across the country who are \ndoing innovative work to break down the barriers to care. If we were \nserious about improving health care, we would be building more Federal \nsupport for their work. Instead, we are moving in the opposite \ndirection.\n  Perhaps the best example is the Bush administration's 5-year effort \nto kill the Healthy Communities Access Program, which is known as HCAP. \nThis is a program which helps our local organizations coordinate care \nfor the uninsured. I have seen it make a tremendous difference in my \nhome State. Well, every year since taking office, this Bush \nadministration has tried to kill that successful program. I have been \nout here on the floor leading the fight for our local communities every \nyear, and most years we have won. But this past year, the White House \nand the Republican Congress ended the support for Healthy Communities \nand thus made health care less accessible for families from coast to \ncoast.\n  If we were serious about improving health care, we would be investing \nin local programs that make a difference. But, instead, the Republican \nleadership is focused on distractions. We can do better than that.\n  So let me take a few minutes to turn to the specific problems with \nthe bill that is before us, S. 1955, and explain why so many experts \nacross this country are warning us that this bill will eliminate \ncritical patient protections, it will lead to unfair premiums and \ninsurance practices, and it will raise the cost of health care.\n  First of all, this bill will eliminate many of the important \nprotections that keep patients healthy and lower the cost of health \ncare.\n  In my home State of Washington, we have enacted a number of State \npatient protections that require health plans to cover services such as \ndiabetic care, mental health services, breast and cervical cancer \nscreening, emergency medical services, and dental procedures. But under \nthis bill, small business health plans or association health plans \nwould not be required to cover those important benefits. Allowing \ninsurers to abandon mandated benefits, many of which are preventive and \nare diagnostic, will result in a sicker population and higher health \ncosts for everyone.\n  When this legislation was debated in the HELP Committee, I offered a \nnumber of amendments to provide for coverage of several important \nwomen's health benefits. Unfortunately, every one of those amendments \nwas defeated. So now, here we are, and we have a bill on this floor \nthat will strip away the protections on which our patients across this \ncountry rely.\n  A new report by Families USA shows just how many families in my home \nState will be hurt by this bill. That report found that 1,861,000 \nresidents of Washington State may lose protections if this bill is \npassed. And what could they lose? Emergency services, home health care, \ndrug and alcohol treatment, contraceptives, diabetic supplies and \neducation, hospice care, mammography screening, maternity services, \nmental health care--the list goes on. I am not going to tell nearly 2 \nmillion people in my home State whom I represent that we are going to \ntake a gamble and risk losing those hard-won protections for a plan \nthat will likely raise the cost of health care for many of our families \nand small businesses.\n  Secondly, this bill will encourage insurance companies to charge \nhigher premiums for less healthy consumers. This bill will preempt \nstrong laws and protections in our State that limit the ability of \ninsurers to vary premiums based on health status, age, gender, or \ngeography. I am very concerned this will result in adverse selection or \nwhat we call cherry-picking, leading to higher premiums for less \nhealthy consumers. In fact, rates will likely become unaffordable for \nthose who need it the most, potentially increasing the number of \nuninsured Americans.\n  Now, Mr. President, I would like to share some letters I have \nreceived from leaders in my home State who all speak against this \nflawed proposal. I ask unanimous consent that these two letters be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, recently I received a letter from the \nGovernor, Governor Christine Gregoire of my home State of Washington, \nin which she expressed many of her concerns regarding this legislation \nand its impact on the people who live in my home State.\n  This chart behind me contains the full text of the Governor's letter. \nAs you can see, she has many serious concerns. I wish to highlight for \nthe Senate some of the main points our Governor has raised with me.\n  Governor Gregoire alludes to the harmful aspects of this bill, and \nshe says:\n\n       [S. 1955] stands to harm our small group insurance market, \n     which is a critical component of [Washington State's] current \n     health care system. . . .\n       Instead of promoting more affordable health care, this \n     legislation would cause a serious increase in rates for \n     consumers--possibly two or three times over what they now \n     pay.\n\n  Governor Gregoire also warns in her letter to me that:\n\n       [this] bill threatens consumer protections that the state \n     of Washington strives to guarantee to [all of] our residents.\n\n  The Governor also warns that this bill:\n\n       would foster a proliferation of health plans that do not \n     cover preventive services that are absolutely vital to the \n     health and well-being of Washington residents. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, I would also like to share a letter that I have \nreceived from the 9,000-member Washington State Medical Association \nthat wrote to me in strong opposition to S. 1955.\n  Now, this chart shows the full letter, and I want to read just a \nportion of it:\n\n       This legislation will have a severe impact on all the \n     consumer health gains that have been made in Washington State \n     over the past decade.\n       S. 1955 will:\n       Undermine Washington State's many gains in advancing health \n     care quality;\n       Pull people from existing insurance coverage rather than \n     attract the uninsured;\n       Lead to higher costs for consumers;\n       Strike down Washington's Mental Health Parity law, which \n     took eight years of work to be enacted;\n       Eliminate other mandated benefits that help consumers such \n     as mammography services; and,\n       Leave Washington's citizens at risk for unpaid medical \n     bills in the event of an AHP insolvency.\n\n  That is from the head of the Washington State Medical Association, \nwhich has 9,000 members in my home\n\n[[Page S4200]]\n\nState. I think their words should be heeded by the Members of this \nSenate.\n  Third, this proposal does nothing to address increasing health care \ncosts.\n  In fact, it builds on the sorry record of this administration and \nthis Congress in not addressing the rising costs that Americans face. \nBecause of the flaws I mentioned, this bill does nothing to contain \nthose costs. In fact, it could dramatically increase costs for many \nbusinesses and families in Washington State. It could well mean that \npeople in the State of Washington who have affordable coverage today \ncould end up worse off than they are right now.\n  I know my State has been a leader in working to expand access to \naffordable health insurance for working families and small businesses. \nMany of the reforms that worked to control costs in my State would be \njeopardized if this legislation is enacted. Washington State has a \nproud tradition of strong consumer protections and integrated managed \ncare that has improved health outcomes and controlled cost increases. \nWe should not jeopardize what my State has fought hard for by dangerous \nFederal legislation.\n  I do support the concept of pooling. I believe we can implement \npolicies that provide stability in health insurance premiums. In fact, \nI am currently working with a number of my colleagues on legislation to \ncreate Federal and State catastrophic cost pools to spread out the \nrisks and address what is driving health care costs. We can help spread \nthe risk in ways that will lower costs and still protect patients. The \nlegislation before us could raise costs for consumers and small \nbusinesses. We can do better than that.\n  There are serious challenges facing our country when it comes to \nhealth care. This Senate needs to get serious. Instead of focusing on a \ndistraction, we should be helping seniors with prescription drugs. We \nshould be expanding lifesaving research, and we should be supporting \ncommunity health care. Those are some of the things we should be \nworking on to reduce the cost of health care and to improve access and \nto accelerate innovation. We can do all of those things, but we need \nthe Republican leadership to get serious if we are going to provide \nserious solutions. We don't have a day to waste. I hope we can get to \nwork on the real solutions that our American families deserve.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                            Christine O. Gregoire,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                      Olympia, WA, April 27, 2006.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: I am writing with great concern about \n     S. 1955, the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and \n     Affordability Act, and its potential to further erode our \n     ability to provide sound health coverage to citizens in \n     Washington State. This bill stands to harm our small group \n     insurance market, which is a critical component of our \n     current health care system. Furthermore, the bill threatens \n     consumer protections that the State of Washington strives to \n     guarantee to our residents. For these reasons, I ask that you \n     oppose the bill in its current form.\n       When it comes to providing health care, the federal \n     government has been putting an ever-Increasing burden on the \n     states. The Deficit Reduction Act, alone, paves the way to \n     eliminate nearly $50 billion over the next five years for the \n     Medicaid program. Fresh on the heals of signing the Deficit \n     Reduction Act, the President unveiled his Fiscal Year 2007 \n     budget proposal, which proposes eliminating $36 billion from \n     the Medicare program over the next five years. Additionally, \n     the implementation of the Medicare Part D prescription drug \n     program has had enormous impacts on the states. Nearly every \n     state in the Nation--Washington included--felt compelled to \n     step in to ensure that our most needy citizens, our dual \n     eligible population, continue to receive their medications \n     due to fundamental flaws in the Medicare Modernization Act. \n     Against this backdrop now comes S. 1955.\n       If passed, S. 1955 would establish a small group rating \n     mechanism that would further erode the possibility of \n     pursuing reasonable health care costs in the states. Instead \n     of promoting more affordable health care, this legislation \n     would cause a serious increase in rates for consumers--\n     possibly two or three times over what they now pay. At its \n     worst, the bill could result in the total collapse of our \n     small group insurance market, something we must fight to \n     prevent.\n       Additionally, I am concerned that S. 1955 would foster a \n     proliferation of health plans that do not cover preventative \n     services that are absolutely vital to the health and well-\n     being of Washington residents, such as mammography, \n     colonoscopies, diabetic care services, and newborn coverage. \n     In 2005, the Washington State Legislature passed, and I \n     signed, legislation providing mental health parity. If \n     Congress passes S. 1955, the bill could also fully abrogate \n     this effort to ensure mental health coverage in Washington \n     State.\n       It is surprising to me that S. 1955 is moving forward, \n     given that it is patterned, in part, on a flawed National \n     Association of Insurance Commissioner's 1993 Model Rating \n     Law, actually adopted by the state of New Hampshire in 2003. \n     This proved to be an unfortunate experiment for the people of \n     New Hampshire. Just this year, that state's Legislature \n     repealed provisions of its 2003 law due to the astronomical \n     jump in rates that occurred in only a two-year period after \n     it was implemented. Given this history that he knows only too \n     well, my colleague, Governor John Lynch of New Hampshire, \n     recently registered his opposition to S. 1955 in a letter to \n     his federal delegation, dated March 28, 2006. New Hampshire's \n     experience is illustrative and a harbinger of what could come \n     to all states, should Congress adopt S. 1955.\n       As Washington State's Attorney General from 1993-2005, I, \n     along with the majority of my colleagues within the National \n     Association of Attorneys General (NAAG), opposed several \n     precursor bills to S. 1955. Introduced in each of the last \n     several Congresses, these bills allow for the federal \n     regulation of association health plans (AHPs), and have \n     passed out of the U.S. House more than once. I appreciate \n     that S. 1955, in its current form, does away with one fatal \n     flaw of the earlier AHP bills--that being the wholesale \n     obliteration of state regulation over national AHPs. But, as \n     I have articulated, S. 1955 still goes too far in preempting \n     other basic consumer protections. It is heartening to see \n     that a majority of current members of NAAG, including \n     Washington State Attorney General Rob McKenna, have now \n     weighed in with their concerns and opposition to S. 1955.\n       As a nation, we need innovative solutions that provide high \n     quality, sustainable and affordable health care access to our \n     un- and under-insured populations. With the help of the \n     Washington State Legislature, I have embarked on a five-point \n     strategy to promote evidence-based medicine; better manage \n     chronic diseases; increase prevention and wellness \n     initiatives; require data transparency; and expand the reach \n     of health information technology. These strategies invite \n     strong partnerships between states and the federal government \n     that I remain committed to pursuing with you. Unfortunately, \n     proposals like S. 1955, are counterintuitive to the notion of \n     forging such partnerships and I ask that you reject the bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Christine O. Gregoire,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Washington State\n\n\n                                          Medical Association,\n\n                                                   April 25, 2006.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: On behalf of the 9,000 members of the \n     Washington State Medical Association, WSMA, I am writing to \n     ask that you vote no on S. 1955--Association Health Plans, \n     AHPs, when the bill comes to a vote in the U.S. Senate.\n       The WSMA is very concerned about the negative effect of \n     this legislation on our State's citizens, purchasers, \n     providers and health plans.\n       This legislation will have a severe impact on all the \n     consumer health gains that have been made in Washington State \n     over the past decade.\n       S. 1955 will:\n       Undermine Washington State's many gains in advancing health \n     care quality;\n       Pull people from existing insurance coverage rather than \n     attract the uninsured;\n       Lead to higher costs for consumers;\n       Strike down Washington's Mental Health Parity law, which \n     took eight years of work to be enacted;\n       Eliminate other mandated benefits that help consumers such \n     as mammography services; and,\n       Leave Washington's citizens at risk for unpaid medical \n     bills in the event of an AHP insolvency\n       The Washington State Medical Association works hard every \n     day to insure that Washington's citizens have access to the \n     finest medical care in the country. This legislation will \n     test our ability to continue in this endeavor.\n       For more information, please do not hesitate to contact Len \n     Eddinger in our Olympia office.\n           Very Truly yours,\n                                              Peter J. Dunbar, MD,\n                                                        President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to address some issues my \ncolleagues have raised. I am appreciative of the debate and the chance \nto talk about health care. It is a critically important topic. It is \none that we have to talk a lot more about, how we can provide as much \nhealth care as possible to everybody at the lowest price that we\n\n[[Page S4201]]\n\ncan get it and get more people insured. That is at the root of what we \nare trying to get done with the proposal of Senator Enzi and others to \nget more health insurance, better coverage to more people across the \nUnited States. That is a worthy goal, something we need to do. We have \nfar too many people uninsured. We need more people insured. That is \ncentral to us. It is central to the hospital and the provider community \nthat we have people who are insured. Because of those who are not \ninsured and then can't pay the price of their health care, that is \nspread across to other people, which is what we do today. That is what \nwe need to do, but it would be better if we could get more people \ninsured and have a direct system of payment.\n  Others have said that what we need to be talking about is different \nthan this, rather than expanding health insurance coverage. I respect \nthat. Some of my colleagues have raised the stem cell issue. I want to \naddress the concerns my colleagues have raised on stem cells. I want to \nreport to my colleagues what a tremendous positive story we have to \ntell about stem cells, an exciting story of people receiving \ntreatments, living longer and healthier lives because of stem cell \ntreatments. These are not the controversial ones. This does not involve \nthe destruction of a young human in the embryonic stage. This involves \nthe use of adult stem cells, which the Presiding Officer and others, \neverybody in this room has in their body, adult stem cells. It also \ninvolves cord blood stem cells. These are the stem cells that are in \nthe umbilical cord between the mother and child, while the mother is \ncarrying the child.\n  I want to show two charts to start off. I think it is best if we make \nthis a personal debate. I challenge my colleagues who have challenged \nme about this topic to come forward with pictures of individuals who \nare being treated with embryonic stem cells. I would like to see the \npeople who are being treated with embryonic stem cells. We have put \nnearly half a billion dollars of research money into embryonic stem \ncell research. We have known about embryonic stem cells for 20 years. I \ndon't know of the people being treated by embryonic stem cells.\n  I can show people who are being treated with adult stem cells or cord \nblood. This is Erik Haines. He is 13 years old. He was diagnosed with \nKrabbes disease, the first patient to receive cord blood for this rare, \ninherited metabolic disease. The date of transplant was 1994. He is \nalive today. He would be dead without this having taken place.\n  Let me show you a picture of Keone Penn. I had him in to testify \nbefore a Commerce Committee hearing a couple years ago. He has sickle \ncell anemia. The date of transplant was December 11, 1998. He had been \nvery sick. He wasn't expected to live. As a matter of fact, it says in \na statement that he made: If it wasn't for cord blood, I would probably \nbe dead by now. It is a good thing I found a match. It saved my life.\n  We have now many more people being treated for sickle cell, a whole \nhost of diseases. As a matter of fact, I want to read off a few of \nthese. These are human clinical trials, real people getting real \ntreatments, living longer lives, if not being cured, by the use of \nadult stem cells and cord blood stem cells in 69 different disease \nareas.\n  My colleagues have heard this debate for a period of years. We have \nbeen debating stem cells for a number of years. We have been debating \nthe controversial area of embryonic stem cells, which the Federal \nGovernment funds, which State governments fund, which private industry \nand the private sector is fully free to fund completely, every bit of \nthe way that they want to do that. They can. They have been. And we \nhave no human treatments from embryonic stem cells to date. We don't \nhave any. They are funded globally. There is no prohibition against \nembryonic stem cell research in the United States.\n  My colleagues seek more than the nearly $500 billion that we have put \ninto embryonic stem cell research, an area that has not produced any \nhuman treatments to date. I want to be clear that that is what we are \ntalking about. When we started this debate, my colleagues pushing \nembryonic stem cells, who in their hearts absolutely believe they are \ndoing the right thing and this will lead to cures, listed cancer, \nsickle cell anemia, Lou Gehrig's disease. We are going to deal with all \nof these things. With the promise of embryonic stem cells, we will cure \nthese things. That is what they said on their side when we started this \ndebate 6 years ago. Six years later--I could be off a year or 2--where \nare the cures? I say we have them. They are in adult and cord blood \nstem cells.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record at the end of my \nstatement a sheet of human clinical applications using adult stem \ncells.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I want to read a few of the 69 from this document: \nSickle cell anemia, aplastic anemia, chronic Epstein-Barr infection, \nlupus, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile arthritis, \nmultiple sclerosis, brain tumors, different cancers, lymphoma, non-\nHodgkins lymphoma, a number of solid tumors, cardiovascular. This is an \nexciting area that is taking place where we now have people with acute \nheart damage, chronic coronary artery disease being treated with adult \nstem cells. Primarily, this has been an adult stem cell treatment where \nthey harvest stem cells out of their own body and inject them right \nback into the damaged heart tissue.\n  Now we are seeing people who couldn't walk up a flight of steps going \nup eight flights, having hard tissue being regenerated with the use of \ntheir own adult stem cells. There is no rejection problem. This is \ntheir own cells. They take these adult stem cells from your body, which \nare repair cells, grow them outside of the body, put them back into the \ndamaged heart tissue area, and now instead of congestive heart failure, \nwithout any ability to get enough blood throughout the body, the heart \nis pumping harder and better. It is actually working. They are \nregenerating the heart in these people. This is actually taking place \nin human clinical trials today. It is a beautiful issue.\n  The list goes on: chronic liver failure, Parkinson's disease. I had a \ngentleman in to testify who had taken stem cells out of a part of his \nbody, grew them, put them in the left part of the brain. The right side \nof the body started functioning without Parkinson's disease. Later it \ncame back, after several years, but he had several years free and was \nstarting to learn how better this can work with Parkinson's disease.\n  Again, continuing from the list: spinal cord injury, stroke damage, \nlimb gangrene, skull bone repair. We have recently had advances. For \nexample, they took the stem cells out of a person's body. They had a \nform around which the bladder could be grown, outside a new bladder \ncould be grown. They took the stem cells, put them around this form, \nand actually grew a bladder out of a person's own stem cells. These are \nmarvelous, miraculous things that are taking place in 69 different \nareas of human clinical trials, adult and cord blood. I ask my \ncolleagues from the other side, the ones who promised all of the cures \nfrom embryonic stem cells, as this debate moves forward, we will bring \nout statements that people made 5, 6 years ago about the cures that \nwould come from embryonic stem cells. The cures have come from these \nnoncontroversial areas. This is where we ought to be funding. This is \nwhat we ought to be doing. This is where we are getting treatments.\n  I ask my colleagues from the other side, where are the treatments \nwith embryonic stem cells? Colleagues on the other side, for whom I \nhave great respect and I know in their hearts are doing what they \nbelieve is the right thing to do, asked about reputable scientists \nopposed to embryonic stem cells. I ask unanimous consent to print in \nthe Record this letter at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. It is dated October 27, 2004. It is to Senator John F. \nKerry, running for President at the time, signed by 57 scientists who \nhave a real problem with embryonic stem cell research.\n  They say in this letter:\n\n       As professionals trained in the life sciences we are \n     alarmed at these statements.\n\n  They are referring to what Senator Kerry was saying, that this would \nbe a\n\n[[Page S4202]]\n\ncenterpiece issue for him in moving forward with science. This is in \n2004.\n\n       First, your statement misrepresents science. In itself, \n     science is not a policy or a political program.\n       Second, it is no mere ``ideology'' to be concerned about \n     the possible misuse of humans in scientific research.\n\n  Here we come to the real rub of the issue on embryonic stem cell \nresearch. Is the embryo human life or isn't it? It is one or the other. \nIt is either a human life or it isn't. It is alive. It is human in its \ngenetic form. Is it a human life or not? If it is not a human life, do \nwith it as you choose. If it is a human life, it deserves protection \nand respect. We do it for everybody in this room, no matter what your \nState is, your physical condition. Why wouldn't we do it while you are \nin the womb?\n  I have a letter signed by 57 scientists with a real problem with \nembryonic stem cell research. My colleague asked me to produce \nscientists who are opposed to embryonic stem cell research. Here they \nare.\n  I finally say to my colleagues on this topic, the promises they have \nmade about embryonic stem cell research have not been realized to date, \nand reputable scientists question whether they will ever be realized. \nWe are half a billion dollars later after investment from the Federal \nGovernment on embryonic stem cell research, animal and human. Now you \nare seeing--this is just the Federal Government, not about the private \nsector or other governments around the world. I will read to you what \nother scientists who support embryonic stem cell research are saying \nabout the prospects of embryonic stem cell research. A British stem \ncell research expert, named Winston, warned colleagues that the \npolitical hype in support of human embryonic stem cells needs to be \nreined in. This is dated June 20, 2005, where he says this:\n\n       One of the problems is that in order to persuade the public \n     that we must do this work, we often go rather too far in \n     promising what we might achieve. This is a real issue for the \n     scientists. I am not entirely convinced that embryonic stem \n     cells will, in my lifetime, and possibly anybody's lifetime, \n     for that matter, be holding quite the promise that we \n     desperately hope they will.\n\n  Let's look at another researcher talking in this field. I want to get \ntestimony in here from Jamie Thompson, the first scientist to grow \nhuman embryonic stem cells. This is the question posed to him:\n\n       People who use nuclear transfer generally say that the \n     technique is optimized for producing stem cells rather than \n     making babies. They would not want to equate this with the \n     process that produces embryos that were fit for implantation, \n     and they argue that they are used in the reproductive process \n     differently.\n\n  I am talking about the use of embryonic stem cell research in a \ncloning procedure, where you create a clone, take the embryonic stem \ncells from the clone.\n  This is what Professor Thompson says:\n\n       So you are trying to define it away and it doesn't work. If \n     you create an embryo by nuclear transfer and you give it to \n     somebody, you didn't know where it came from, there would be \n     no test you could do on that embryo to say where it came \n     from. It is what it is. It is an embryo. It is a young human \n     life. It's true that they have much lower probability of \n     giving rise to a child, but by any reasonable definition, at \n     least at some frequency, you are creating an embryo. If you \n     are trying to define it away, you are being disingenuous.\n\n  My colleagues started to raise the issue that if you create an embryo \nby process of cloning, it is not really a young human life. But if you \ncreate an embryo that is a sheep, like Dolly, and grow it up to be \nDolly the sheep, is Dolly not a sheep? Would that be the contention? \nThat is simply not the case when they are creating a cloned individual \nor cloned human being, and that goes into the next step in this debate, \nto discuss human cloning. The other side calls it somatic nuclear cell \ntransfer--the same process that created Dolly.\n  My point is that that is the next step on this continuum. We are \ntalking about embryonic stem cell research funding and the lack of \nproduction taking place there for human treatment. The next step is \nthat we need to clone and then we need to clone the individual and not \nharvest it in a day or two, but we need to grow the fetus out several \nweeks so we have sort of fetal farming, which is a ghastly thing to \neven consider. Yet it is being talked about in some research circles.\n  I conclude with the statement that if we want to be successful in \nthis area and treat people, which I believe is the measure that we \nshould go by--the treatment of individuals--our best bet, if my \ncolleagues want human treatments to take place, they want to cure \npeople, if that is what their effort is, let's fund what is working, \nwhich is adult cord blood. Let's move off of this politicized debate \nwhich is about the definition of young human life. Let's move off this \ndebate and do something that is curing people. And we can.\n  That is the way we ought to go in this debate. We ought to also pass \nthe Enzi proposal that gets more people health insurance, which is \nwhere we should focus this debate now because that is what we are \ntalking about, rather than a politicized issue of embryonic stem cell \nresearch, which has not worked and is not working.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                Adult & Non-Embryonic Stem Cell Research\n\n                   Advances & Updates for April 2006\n\n\n       HIGHLIGHT OF THE MONTH--STEM CELL HOPE FOR LIVER PATIENTS\n\n       British doctors reported treatment of 5 patients with liver \n     failure with the patients' own adult stem cells. Four of the \n     5 patients showed improvement, and 2 patients regained near \n     normal liver function. The authors noted: ``Liver \n     transplantation is the only current therapeutic modality for \n     liver failure but it is available to only a small proportion \n     of patients due to the shortage of organ donors.

Kerry,\n     John Kerry for President,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: Recently you have made the promotion of \n     embryonic stem cell research, including the cloning of human \n     embryos for research purposes, into a centerpiece of your \n     campaign. You have said you will make such research a ``top \n     priority'' for government, academia and medicine (Los Angeles \n     Times, 10/17/04). You have even equated support for this \n     research with respect for ``science,'' and said that science \n     must be freed from ``ideology'' to produce miracle cures for \n     numerous diseases.\n       As professionals trained in the life sciences we are \n     alarmed at these statements.\n       First, your statements misrepresent science. In itself, \n     science is not a policy or a political program. Science is a \n     systematic method for developing and testing hypotheses about \n     the physical world. It does not ``promise'' miracle cures \n     based on scanty evidence. When scientists make such \n     assertions, they are acting as individuals, out of their own \n     personal faith and hopes, not as the voice of ``science''. If \n     such scientists allow their individual faith in the future of \n     embryonic stem cell research to be interpreted as a reliable \n     prediction of the outcome of this research, they are acting \n     irresponsibly.\n       Second, it is no mere ``ideology'' to be concerned about \n     the possible misuse of humans in scientific research. Federal \n     bioethics advisory groups, serving under both Democratic and \n     Republican presidents, have affirmed that the human embryo is \n     a developing form of human life that deserves respect. Indeed \n     you have said that human life begins at conception, that \n     fertilization produces a ``human being.'' To equate concern \n     for these beings with mere ``ideology'' is to dismiss the \n     entire history of efforts to protect human subjects from \n     research abuse.\n       Third, the statements you have made regarding the purported \n     medical applications of embryonic stem cells reach far beyond \n     any credible evidence, ignoring the limited state of our \n     knowledge about embryonic stem cells and the advances in \n     other areas of research that may render use of these cells \n     unnecessary for many applications. To make such exaggerated \n     claims, at this stage of our knowledge, is not only \n     scientifically irresponsible--it is deceptive and cruel to \n     millions of patients and their families who hope desperately \n     for cures and have come to rely on the scientific community \n     for accurate information.\n       What does science tell us about embryonic stem cells? The \n     facts can be summed up as follows:\n       At present these cells can be obtained only by destroying \n     live human embryos at the blastocyst (4-7 days old) stage. \n     They proliferate rapidly and are extremely versatile, \n     ultimately capable (in an embryonic environment) of forming \n     any kind of cell found in the developed human body. Yet \n     there is scant scientific evidence that embryonic stem \n     cells will form normal tissues in a culture dish, and the \n     very versatility of these cells is now known to be a \n     disadvantage as well--embryonic stem cells are difficult \n     to develop into a stable cell line, spontaneously \n     accumulate genetic abnormalities in culture, and are prone \n     to uncontrollable growth and tumor formation when placed \n     in animals.\n       Almost 25 years of research using mouse embryonic stem \n     cells have produced limited indications of clinical benefit \n     in some animals, as well as indications of serious and \n     potentially lethal side-effects. Based on this evidence, \n     claims of a safe and reliable treatment for any disease in \n     humans are premature at best.\n       Embryonic stem cells obtained by destroying cloned human \n     embryos pose an additional ethical issue--that of creating \n     human lives solely to destroy them for research--and may pose \n     added practical problems as well. The cloning process is now \n     known to produce many problems of chaotic gene expression, \n     and this may affect the usefulness and safety of these cells. \n     Nor is it proven that cloning will prevent all rejection of \n     embryonic stem cells, as even genetically matched stem cells \n     from cloning are sometimes rejected by animal hosts. Some \n     animal trials in research cloning have required placing \n     cloned embryos in a womb and developing them to the fetal \n     stage, then destroying them for their more developed tissues, \n     to provide clinical benefit--surely an approach that poses \n     horrific ethical issues if applied to humans.\n       Non-embryonic stem cells have also received increasing \n     scientific attention. Here the trajectory has been very \n     different from that of embryonic stem cells: Instead of \n     developing these cells and deducing that they may someday \n     have a clinical use, researchers have discovered them \n     producing undoubted clinical benefits and then sought to \n     better understand how and why they work so they can be put to \n     more uses. Bone marrow transplants were benefiting patients \n     with various forms of cancer for many years before it was \n     understood that the active ingredients in these transplants \n     are stem cells. Non-embryonic stem cells have been discovered \n     in many unexpected tissues--in blood, nerve, fat, skin, \n     muscle, umbilical cord blood, placenta, even dental pulp--and \n     dozens of studies indicate that they are far more versatile \n     than once thought. Use of these cells poses no serious \n     ethical problem, and may avoid all problems of tissue \n     rejection if stem cells can be obtained from a patient for \n     use in that same patient. Clinical use of non-embryonic stem \n     cells has grown greatly in recent years. In contrast to \n     embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells are in established or \n     experimental use to treat human patients with several dozen \n     conditions, according to the National Institutes of Health \n     and the National Marrow Donor Program (Cong. Record, \n     September 9, 2004, pages H6956-7). They have been or are \n     being assessed in human trials for treatment of spinal cord \n     injury, Parkinson's disease, stroke, cardiac damage, multiple \n     sclerosis, and so on. The results of these experimental \n     trials will help us better assess the medical prospects for \n     stem cell therapies.\n       In the case of many conditions, advances are likely to come \n     from sources other than any kind of stem cell. For example, \n     there is a strong scientific consensus that complex diseases \n     such as Alzheimer's are unlikely to be treated by any stem \n     cell therapy. When asked recently why so many people \n     nonetheless believe that embryonic stem cells will provide a \n     cure for Alzheimer's disease, NIH stem cell expert Ron McKay \n     commented that ``people need a fairy tale'' (Washington Post, \n     June 10, 2004, page A3). Similarly, autoimmune diseases like \n     juvenile diabetes, lupus and MS are unlikely to benefit from \n     simple addition of new cells unless the underlying problem--a \n     faulty immune system that attacks the body's own cells as \n     though they were foreign invaders--is corrected.\n       In short, embryonic stem cells pose one especially \n     controversial avenue toward understanding and (perhaps) \n     someday treating various degenerative diseases. Based on the \n     available evidence, no one can predict with\n\n[[Page S4204]]\n\n     certainty whether they will ever produce clinical benefits--\n     much less whether they will produce benefits unobtainable by \n     other, less ethically problematic means.\n       Therefore, to turn this one approach into a political \n     campaign--even more, to declare that it will be a ``top \n     priority'' or receive any particular amount of federal \n     funding, regardless of future evidence or the usual \n     scientific peer review process--is, in our view, \n     irresponsible. It is, in fact, a subordination of science to \n     ideology.\n       Because politicians, biotechnology interests and even some \n     scientists have publicly exaggerated the ``promise'' of \n     embryonic stem cells, public perceptions of this avenue have \n     become skewed and unrealistic. Politicians may hope to \n     benefit from these false hopes to win elections, knowing that \n     the collision of these hopes with reality will come only \n     after they win their races. The scientific and medical \n     professions have no such luxury. When desperate patients \n     discover that they have been subjected to a salesman's pitch \n     rather than an objective and candid assessment of \n     possibilities, we have reason to fear a public backlash \n     against the credibility of our professions. We urge you not \n     to exacerbate this problem now by repeating false promises \n     that exploit patients' hopes for political gain.\n       Signed by 57 doctors.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CORNYN). The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Report on Hurricane Katrina\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, last week the Senate Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs, of which I am a member, approved its \nreport titled ``Hurricane Katrina, A Nation Still Unprepared.'' The \ncommittee's distinguished chairman set today as the deadline for \nadditional views.\n  I reluctantly voted not to approve that draft of the report last week \nbecause it is seriously incomplete. While it is still lacking all of \nthe information, documents, and testimony which President Bush and his \nsubordinates denied the committee, last March 15 the ranking member \nasked the chairman to subpoena witnesses and documents that have been \nwithheld by the White House. Regrettably, she declined to do so.\n  Earlier this year, on January 12, the chairman and ranking member \nwrote the White House Chief of Staff, Mr. Andrew Card, regarding the \ninformation they had previously requested. Their letter stated, in \npart:\n\n       This practice (of withholding information) must cease.\n\n  It continued:\n\n       We are willing to discuss claims of executive privilege \n     asserted by the White House, either directly or through a \n     Federal agency. But we will not stand for blanket \n     instructions to refuse answering any questions concerning any \n     communications with the EOP [Executive Office of the \n     President].\n\n  Their insistence that either administration officials comply with \nthis oversight committee's rightful demands or the President invoke his \nexecutive privilege not to do so was entirely appropriate. \nUnfortunately, when Mr. Card and his subordinates still refused to \ncomply, the chairman denied the ranking member's request to issue \nsubpoenas.\n  Regrettably, at its markup of the draft report, the Senate committee \nfailed to support my motion to subpoena those documents and witnesses, \nwhich were being withheld by the White House without claim to executive \nprivilege, and which were being wrongfully denied by executive \nagencies.\n  The administration's refusal to comply and cooperate with this \ninvestigation is deplorable, as is the Homeland Security Committee's \nfailure to back the chairman and ranking member's proper insistence \nthat the White House do so. That committee is charged by the full \nSenate with the responsibility to oversee the agencies, programs, and \nactivities that are related to homeland security. The committee was \nexpressly directed by the Senate majority leader to examine the Bush \nadministration's failure to respond quickly or effectively to the \ndisasters caused by Hurricane Katrina. This investigation is not \ncomplete without all of the information requested from the \nadministration. Furthermore, the report's findings and conclusions can \nhardly be considered reliable if the White House has decided what \ninformation to provide and what information to withhold from the \ncommittee.\n  This unfortunate acquiescence confirms the judgment of the Senate \nDemocratic leader that an independent bipartisan commission was \nnecessary to ensure complete and unbiased investigation into the failed \nFederal, State, and local responses to Hurricane Katrina. His request \nhas been repeatedly denied by the majority, with the assurance that the \nSenate committee would fulfill those responsibilities. Tragically and \nreprehensibly, it has failed to do so. Thus, the committee failed the \nSenate's constitutional obligations to be an independent, coequal \nbranch of Government from the executive. It also failed the long-\nsuffering victims of Hurricane Katrina, who deserve to know why their \ngovernments failed them, and all of the American people, who depend \nupon their elected representatives to protect their lives and their \ninterests, without regard to partisan political considerations. That \npartisanship includes unjustified protection of an administration of \nthe same political party, as much as undue criticism of one from \nanother party.\n  That partisan protectionism is especially unwarranted given \nwidespread agreement about the urgent need to understand the failures \nduring and after Hurricane Katrina and to remedy them before another \nlarge-scale disaster, God forbid, should occur.\n  Now, 8 months after the hurricane, the lack of progress in cleanup, \nrepair, and reconstruction in devastated areas provides further \nevidence of the Federal Government's continuing failure to respond \nefficiently or effectively. There is no time in which the helping hand \nof Government is more urgently needed and more surely deserved than \nduring and after a disaster. Victims are damaged or devastated \nphysically, emotionally, and financially.\n  Local officials and their public services are overwhelmed, if not \ndestroyed. They need a Federal emergency response organization \ncomprised of experienced, dedicated professionals, who have the \nresources necessary to alleviate short-term suffering and commence \nlong-term recovery, and also have the authority to expeditiously commit \nthose resources.\n  What the failed Federal response to Hurricane Katrina showed is the \nutter ineptitude of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, known as \nFEMA. Even worse, FEMA's indifference and incompetence in the aftermath \nof Katrina was not an isolated instance. In my direct experience with \nFEMA's disaster relief responses in Minnesota, the agency is too often \na major obstruction to recovery projects rather than a principal ally.\n  Thus, I agree with the report's recommendation to create a new, \ncomprehensive emergency management organization, to prepare for and \nrespond to all disasters and catastrophes. I remain openminded about \nwhether this new entity should remain within the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, as this recommendation intends, or be established as a \nseparate Federal agency. The challenge for the committee, for all of \nCongress, and for the administration will be to actually recreate an \nexisting Federal agency which has become dysfunctional and \nnonfunctional. Merely ``reforming'' FEMA by rearranging some boxes and \nlines in its organizational chart, revising it, and giving its head a \nnew title, will be woefully inadequate. The new organization must be \nmore streamlined, centralized, and compact than its predecessor. It \nmust be less bureaucratic, less consumed with regulatory minutiae, and \nless resistant to local recovery initiatives. It must spend less time \ncreating complex plans and cumbersome procedures, and more time in \ntraining and perfecting action responses to emergency situations.\n  History shows that ``if a student does not learn the lesson, the \nteacher reappears.'' This report describes some of the most important \nlessons from the failed response to Hurricane Katrina. The committee's \nand this Congress's subsequent actions to correct these serious \ndeficiencies before the next catastrophe will indicate whether those \nlessons will be learned.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4205]]\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n         Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2005\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about bipartisan \nlegislation that is of critical importance to the people of Hawaii. S. \n147, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2005, would \nextend the Federal policy of self-governance and self-determination to \nHawaii's indigenous peoples, Native Hawaiians, by authorizing a process \nfor the reorganization of a Native Hawaiian governing entity for the \npurposes of a government-to-government relationship with the United \nStates.\n  Together with my senior Senator and the rest of Hawaii's \ncongressional delegation, I first introduced this bill in 1999. The \nbill passed the House in 2000, but, unfortunately, the Senate adjourned \nbefore we could complete consideration of that bill.\n  Since then, I have introduced a bill every Congress. In every \nCongress, the committees of jurisdiction--the Senate Committee on \nIndian Affairs and the House Committee on Resources--have favorably \nreported the bill and its companion measure.\n  I thank the majority leader, the senior Senator from Tennessee, who \nis working to uphold his commitment to bring this bill to the Senate \nfloor for a debate and rollcall vote. I must tell my colleagues that he \ndid try to meet his commitment in September 2005 and did schedule it \nfor the floor. But at that time, Katrina happened, and we took it off \nthe calendar.\n  I also appreciate the efforts of my colleague from Arizona who \nopposes the bill on substance, but has worked with me to uphold his \npromise to allow the bill to come to the floor for debate and rollcall \nvote.\n  S. 147 does three things. First, it authorizes the Office of Native \nHawaiian Relations in the Department of the Interior. The office is \nintended to serve as a liaison between Native Hawaiians and the United \nStates. It is not intended to become another Bureau of Indian Affairs, \nas the current program for Native Hawaiians will remain with the \nagencies that currently administer those programs.\n  Second, the bill establishes the Native Hawaiian interagency \ncoordinating group. This is a Federal working group to be composed of \nrepresentatives from Federal agencies who administer programs and \nservices for Native Hawaiians. There is no statutory requirement for \nthese agencies to work together. This working group can coordinate \npolicies to ensure consistency and prevent unnecessary duplication in \nFederal policies impacting Native Hawaiians.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes a process for the reorganization of the \nNative Hawaiian governing entity. And we ask: Why do we need to \norganize the entity? It is because the Native Hawaiian Government was \noverthrown with the assistance of U.S. agents in 1893. Rather than shed \nthe blood of the people, our beloved queen, Queen Lili`uokalani, \nabdicated her throne after being arrested and imprisoned in her own \nhome.\n  Following the overthrow, a republic was formed. Any reformation of a \nnative governing entity has been discouraged. Despite this fact, Native \nHawaiians have established distinct communities and retained their \nlanguage, culture, and traditions. They have done so in a way that also \nallows other cultures to flourish in Hawaii. Now their generosity is \nbeing used against them by opponents of this bill who claim that \nbecause Native Hawaiians do not have a governing entity, they cannot \npartake in the Federal policy of self-governance and self-determination \nthat is offered to their native brethren in the United States.\n  My bill authorizes a process for the reorganization of the Native \nHawaiian governing entity for the purposes of a federally recognized \ngovernment-to-government relationship. There are many checks and \nbalances in this process which has the structure necessary to comply--\nto comply--with Federal law and still maintains the flexibility for \nNative Hawaiians to determine the outcome of this process.\n  Further, my bill includes a negotiations process between the Native \nHawaiian governing entity, the State of Hawaii, and the United States \nto address issues such as lands, natural resources, assets, criminal \nand civil jurisdiction, and historical grievances. Nothing that is \ncurrently within the jurisdiction of another level of government can be \nconveyed to the Native Hawaiian Government without going through this \nnegotiations process.\n  I am proud of the fact that this bill respects the rights of Hawaii's \nindigenous peoples through a process that is consistent with Federal \nlaw and it provides the structured process for the people of Hawaii to \naddress the longstanding issues which have plagued both Native \nHawaiians and non-Native Hawaiians since the overthrow of the Kingdom \nof Hawaii.\n  I want to reiterate to my colleagues that this bill is not race \nbased. This bill is based on the Federal policies toward indigenous \npeoples. Those who characterize this bill as race based fail to \nunderstand the Federal policies toward indigenous peoples. Those who \ncharacterize this bill as race based fail to understand the legal and \npolitical relationship the United States had with the indigenous \npeoples and their governments preexisting the United States.\n\n  Finally, those who characterize this bill as race based are saying \nthat Native Hawaiians are not native enough. I find this offensive. And \nI ask that my colleagues join me in my efforts to bring parity to \nNative Hawaiians by enacting my bill.\n  This effort will continue from day-to-day here. We will continue to \nbring forward the history of Hawaii and the reasons why we are trying \nto enact this bill, not only for the benefit of the indigenous people \nof Hawaii but for the benefit of the United States as well.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune).

Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate voted on two motions \nto invoke cloture to proceed to legislation regarding medical \nmalpractice. Due to a mechanical problem with the plane on my flight \nfrom Chicago, I was necessarily absent for this debate and the first \nvote. Had I been present for that vote, I would have voted against the \nmotion to invoke cloture, and I did vote against the second motion.\n  Since 2003, the last time Congress considered this issue, 34 States \nhave passed malpractice legislation. Four additional States have \npending legislation in this year.\n  AMA counts 21 States as ``crisis'' States. Of those 21 States, 16 \nStates passed legislation in the past 2 years, and two are currently \nconsidering bills.\n  Instead of considering ways to cap pain and suffering damages for \ninjured patients, Congress should be working on other health care \npriorities.\n  Neither S. 22 nor S. 23 do anything to address medical errors, the \nunderlying reason for medical malpractice lawsuits.\n  According to the Institute of Medicine, medical errors have caused \nmore American deaths per year than breast cancer, AIDS and car \naccidents combined. It is equivalent to a jumbo jet liner crashing \nevery 24 hours for 1 year.\n  When I sat on the Government Affairs Committee, Dr. Carolyn Clancy, \nDirector of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, testified \nabout patient safety.\n\n[[Page S4206]]\n\n  She called medical errors ``a national problem of epidemic \nproportions.'' She went on to say that Congress and HHS need to make \nsure that health care professionals work in systems that are designed \nto prevent mistakes and catch problems before they cause harm.\n  These bills will do nothing to reach that goal.\n  The most far-reaching study of the extent and cost of medical errors \nin our hospitals was published in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation, the authors of the study analyzed 7.45 million records \nfrom 994 hospitals in 28 States, a sample representative of about 20 \npercent of U.S. hospitals.\n  They concluded that medical injuries in hospitals ``pose a \nsignificant threat to patients and incur substantial costs to society'' \nand ``are a serious epidemic confronting our health care system.''\n  The study found that injuries in U.S. hospitals in 2000, just 1 year, \nled to approximately 32,600 deaths, at least 2.4 million extra days of \npatient hospitalization and additional costs of up to $9.3 billion. \nThese injuries did not include adverse drug reactions or malfunctioning \nmedical devices.\n  What do these bills do about these medical errors? Nothing.\n  Instead, these bills place an arbitrary, one-size-fits-all cap on \nnoneconomic damages, forfeiting the right of a jury to decide the \nappropriate level of compensation for an injured person.\n  The answer to this problem is not to have Congress deciding what \ninjured patients should receive. America has judges and juries who make \nthose decisions. One hundred Senators do not have all the facts and \nshould not place a blanket cap on all cases.\n  Proponents of this bill are saying it is a ``new'' medical \nmalpractice proposal because a patient could receive up to $750,000 in \npain and suffering as opposed to the $250,000 cap we considered in \n2003.\n  However, the cap is still $250,000 for a doctor, a hospital or other \nprovider. If a patient is injured at three hospitals or by three \ndoctors, he or she could receive a total $750,000, but the cap is still \n$250,000 per provider.\n  Ten years ago, Donna Harnett arrived at a hospital in Chicago, IL, in \nlabor with her first child. She waited nearly 5 hours before being \nadmitted. Following an initial examination, her doctor decided that her \nlabor was not progressing quickly enough and prescribed a drug to help \ninduce more contractions.\n  Later, when Donna's labor still was not progressing, her doctor broke \nher water and found that it was abnormal. Rather than consider a C-\nsection, Donna's doctor decided to continue administering the drug, in \nhopes that the labor would progress.\n  Six hours later, Donna still hadn't delivered, but her son's fetal \nmonitoring system began alarming, indicating that the baby was in \nserious respiratory distress. The doctor finally decided that it was \ntime to perform an emergency C-section, but it was another hour before \nDonna was taken into the operating room.\n  During that time, the doctor failed to administer oxygen or an IV to \nhelp the baby breathe. After Martin was born, he remained in the \nintensive care unit for 3 weeks. Examinations have since revealed that \nMartin has substantial brain damage and cerebral palsy--a direct result \nof the doctor's failure to respond to indications of serious oxygen \ndeprivation and deliver in a timely manner.\n  Donna's doctor told her never to have more children because there was \na serious problem with her DNA, which could result in similar mental \nand physical disabilities in any of her future children.\n  Donna has since given birth to three perfectly healthy sons. Donna \nsued the doctor responsible for Martin's delivery and received a \nsettlement, but this doctor is still licensed and practicing medicine \nin Illinois--despite several other cases that have been filed against \nhim.\n  Donna is thankful that she has money from a malpractice settlement to \nhelp cover the costs associated with Martin's care that are not covered \nby health insurance--such as the used, wheelchair-accessible van that \nshe purchased for $50,000, and the $100,000 for renovating the new home \nshe purchased to make it accessible for Martin.\n  If the law we are debating today had been in place when Donna filed \nher malpractice suit against the doctor who delivered Martin, she \ndoubts that she would have been able to keep him out of an institution, \nbecause as someone who sustained permanent injuries as a newborn, \nMartin would not have been eligible for an economic damage award.\n  The problem with malpractice premiums is a cyclical insurance \nproblem. We had a crisis during the 1970s and again in the 1980s. \nDozens of States have passed tort reform. Yet we find ourselves faced \nwith the same problems. That is because we haven't looked closely at \ninsurance companies.\n  Property casualty insurers had a record year in 2005.\n  The property casualty insurance industry made $43 billion in profit \nlast year.\n  The difference between the cost of the policies offered to doctors \nand hospitals, and the payouts from lawsuits is enormous. Payouts have \nremained steady while premiums have skyrocketed.\n  Wonder where that money is going?\n  Jeffry Immelt, the CEO of GE, made $19.23 million last year.\n  Martin Sullivan, CEO of American International Group, made $11 \nmillion.\n  Stephen Lilienthal, CEO of CNA Financial Corporation, made $3.2 \nmillion.\n  A. Derrill Crowe, CEO of ProAssurance, made $1.5 million.\n  This bill completely ignores the role of insurers in this problem.\n  Between 1993 and 2003, the annual premiums Americans paid for their \nhealth insurance increased by 79 percent and employer contributions to \ntheir employee insurance increased by 90 percent.\n  We need to be looking at the underlying reasons for rising health \ncosts, and these bills do nothing to achieve that goal.\n  In fact, a new CBO report, published last Friday concluded that ``the \nestimated effect of implementing a package of previously proposed tort \nlimits is near zero.''\n  In other words, capping pain and suffering for patients will not \nbring down health insurance costs.\n  Proponents of limiting pain and suffering claim frivolous lawsuits \nare at the root of the problem, but these bills do nothing to cut down \non the number of lawsuits. They only punish those who have legitimate \ncases.\n  The people whose cases make it to jury verdicts have surmounted many \nhurdles. Cases without merit are thrown out before they ever reach the \njury. Why would we want to limit pain and suffering for those whose \ncases make it through the system?\n  Medical malpractice is a complicated and multifaceted problem that \nrequires a variety of solutions.\n  First, we must improve patient safety. Medicare is starting to \nembrace something called Pay for Performance that will go a long way \ntoward improving quality.\n  The idea of Pay for Performance is to pay doctors based on whether \nthey fulfill certain quality standards and use the best treatment \nmethods, rather than simply reimbursing for all services performed.\n  Under a Medicare pilot program, doctors can qualify for bonuses if \nthey provide services like vaccines and cancer screening, and eliminate \nunnecessary procedures.\n  Here is an example of how it can improve quality.\n  Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey signed up for the \nprogram. It agreed to report its performance on a variety of measures.\n  Right away, the hospitals noticed some problem areas. Under clinical \nguidelines, a patient who has had orthopedic surgery should be taken \noff IV antibiotics after 24 hours. Longer use of the drugs don't \nprevent infection, they cost money, and they can lead to greater \nantibiotic resistance.\n  Hackensack hospital found that 25 percent of their surgery patients \nwere being kept on IV antibiotics longer than 24 hours. Within one week \nof the launch of the Pay for Performance program, 94 percent of \npatients were taken off the drugs on time.\n  Second, we must improve oversight. We have something called the \nNational Practitioner Data Bank, which was set up to allow licensing \nboards and employers to check on doctors' records before they are hired \nso problem doctors could not move from state to state.\n\n[[Page S4207]]\n\n  This data bank is not working. According to the federal Department of \nHealth and Human Services, nearly 54 percent of all hospitals have \nnever reported a disciplinary action to the data bank.\n  Federal law requires that hospitals and medical boards be penalized \nif they don't report to the data bank. But no fine or penalty has ever \nbeen levied.\n  Further, hospitals sometimes agree not to report doctors they are \nforcing from their staffs to smooth their departure. Also, physicians' \nnames are removed from malpractice settlements to keep them out of the \ndata bank.\n  The failings of the data bank create problems like the one faced by \nGwyneth Vives. Three hours after giving birth to a healthy boy in 2001, \nVives, a scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, \nsuffered a complication and bled to death.\n  The OB/GYN who tended to Ms. Vives had a troubled history. She had \npreviously been forced to leave a job at Duke University Medical Center \nin North Carolina when questions arose about her surgical skills and \nher complication rate.\n  According to the New Mexico Medical Board, she lied to get her New \nMexico license, saying she had never lost hospital privileges.\n  After Ms. Vives died, the OB/GYN went to Michigan and got a license.\n  We must improve the national practitioner database system so the few \ndoctors who are causing medical injuries cannot simply move to another \nState.\n  Contrary to popular belief about frivolous lawsuits, 95 percent of \npeople who are injured by a doctor do not sue.\n  Studies have shown that the most significant reason people sue is \nbecause they feel their doctor or hospital did not acknowledge the \nproblem, or apologize. In other words, they are angry.\n  Based on this data, a program called ``Sorry Works'' has been \nlaunched. Under the program, doctors and hospital staff conduct \nanalyses after every patient injury, and if a medical error caused the \nproblem, the doctors and hospital staff apologize, provide solutions to \nfix the problem, and offer upfront compensation to the patient, family, \nand their attorney.\n  This approach helps alleviate anger and actually reduces the chances \nof litigation and costly defense litigation bills. The program has \nworked successfully at hospitals such as the University of Michigan \nHospital system, Stanford Medical Center, Children's Hospitals and \nClinics of Minnesota, and the VA Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky.\n  I am proud to say that Illinois is the first State to enact a Sorry \nWorks pilot program statewide.\n  My colleague from Illinois, Barack Obama, has introduced a bill in \nthe U.S. Senate to facilitate federal funding for apology programs.\n  The insurance industry has a blanket exemption from Federal antitrust \nlaws. Using their exemption, insurers can collude to set rates, \nresulting in higher premiums than true competition would achieve--and \nbecause of this exemption, enforcement officials cannot investigate any \nsuch collusion.\n  There was an article in the Washington Post last Friday about Hank \nGreenberg, the former chairman of one of the largest malpractice \ninsurers in the country, American Continental Group.\n  Mr. Greenberg has been sued by New York Attorney General Eliot \nSpitzer for fraudulent transactions aimed at manipulating the insurer's \nfinancial statements and deceiving regulators and investors.\n  If Congress is serious about controlling rising medical malpractice \npremiums, we must revoke this blanket exemption created in the \nMcCarran-Ferguson act.\n  I am a cosponsor of a bill introduced by Senator Leahy called the \nMedical Malpractice Insurance Antitrust Act. Our bill modifies the \nMcCarran-Ferguson Act for the most pernicious antitrust offenses: price \nfixing, bid rigging, and market allocations.\n  Who could object to a prohibition on insurance carriers' fixing \nprices or dividing territories for anticompetitive purposes. After all, \nthe rest of our Nation's industries manage either to abide by these \nlaws or pay the consequences.\n  We need to stop insurers from gouging doctors and hospitals and this \nbill is a step in the right direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/09/senate-section/article/S4205-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4205-S4207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Our bill modifies the \nMcCarran-Ferguson Act for the most pernicious antitrust offenses: price \nfixing, bid rigging, and market allocations.\n  Who could object to a prohibition on insurance carriers' fixing \nprices or dividing territories for anticompetitive purposes. After all, \nthe rest of our Nation's industries manage either to abide by these \nlaws or pay the consequences.\n  We need to stop insurers from gouging doctors and hospitals and this \nbill is a step in the right direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/09/senate-section/article/S4207-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Leaving his life and family \nbehind him, Joseph risked everything to fight for the values Americans \nhold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  After September 11, many Americans, including Joseph, felt a deep \ncalling to help their country in its time of need. In the wake of the \nattacks, despite his family's concerns over his safety, Joseph signed \nup for the Indiana National Guard, where he had served 20 years ago as \na young man. After his Guard service in the mid-1980s, he went into the \nArmy on active duty and served in Desert Storm. Joseph re-enlisted in \nthe Guard in 2002, and began work as a refueler in Iraq. His brother \nEddie told a local news outlet that Joseph had seen his military \nservice as a way to help out fellow soldiers. He recounted Joseph's \nselflessness, saying that one of the reasons Joseph went to Iraq was to \ngive other soldiers a break to come home and see their families. At the \ntime of his death, he was supposed to return home in just 2 weeks.\n  Joseph was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. He was assigned to the 638th Aviation Support Battalion in \nNoblesville. This brave soldier leaves behind his wife, Beth, and three \nchildren, Joe, 20, Cassandra, 17, and Adam, 11, years old.\n  Today, I join Joseph's family and friends in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Joseph, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Joseph was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Joseph will be remembered by family members, \nfriends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Joseph's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Joseph's actions will live on far longer that any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Joseph Proctor in the official \nrecord\n\n[[Page S4208]]\n\nof the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his profound \ncommitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I think about this \njust cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain that comes \nwith the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like Joseph's can \nfind comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will \nswallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from \noff all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Joseph.\n\n\n                     Honoring Corporal Eric Lueken\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep sense of \ngratitude to honor the life of a brave young Marine from Southern \nIndiana.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nlegislation introduced in the Senate which has a significant impact on \nmore than 800 small businesses in Montana and hundreds of thousands \nmore around the country. S. 722 would reduce the tax burden on every \nbarrel of beer, which currently stands at $18. Prior to 1991, this tax \nwas only half of the cost today.\n  This tax was originally enacted as a means to pay for the U.S. Civil \nWar. The lesson is that there is no such thing as a short-term tax. The \ntax on beer, which accounts for 44 percent of a bottle of beer and a \nwhopping 80 percent cost of a six-pack, has been steadily increasing \nsince 1991.\n  The taxation of beer falls unfairly on Montanans who can least afford \nto pay it. A report by Citizens for Tax Justice indicates that people \nwhose family's income is in the top 20 percent pay five times less in \nexcise beer tax than those whose family is in the bottom 20 percent.\n\n[[Page S4209]]\n\n  The Tax Code was intended to raise revenue for the Federal \nGovernment. It should not be used to influence behavior or personal \nchoice. This excessive tax on beer is not efficient at raising revenue, \nand the cost of each dollar imposed is much greater in terms of jobs \nlost and economic drag.\n  There are, of course, concerns about the social costs of alcohol \nconsumption. I am very sensitive to those concerns and am encouraged by \nthe reductions in drunk driving and alcohol abuse. But the fact is, \nthis tax punishes all beer consumers instead of the minority who act \ndangerously. In any case, these problems must be addressed directly \nthrough specific legislation rather than indirectly through the Tax \nCode, which is already complicated enough.\n  Mr. President, because this tax has grown so much since 1991 and \nbecause it not only affects beer wholesalers and resellers but hard-\nworking Montanans who enjoy these products responsibly, I am pleased to \ncosponsor this legislation in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/09/senate-section/article/S4208-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4208-S4209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COSPONSORSHIP OF S. 722\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Prior to 1991, this tax \nwas only half of the cost today.\n  This tax was originally enacted as a means to pay for the U.S. Civil \nWar. The lesson is that there is no such thing as a short-term tax. The \ntax on beer, which accounts for 44 percent of a bottle of beer and a \nwhopping 80 percent cost of a six-pack, has been steadily increasing \nsince 1991.\n  The taxation of beer falls unfairly on Montanans who can least afford \nto pay it. A report by Citizens for Tax Justice indicates that people \nwhose family's income is in the top 20 percent pay five times less in \nexcise beer tax than those whose family is in the bottom 20 percent.\n\n[[Page S4209]]\n\n  The Tax Code was intended to raise revenue for the Federal \nGovernment. It should not be used to influence behavior or personal \nchoice. This excessive tax on beer is not efficient at raising revenue, \nand the cost of each dollar imposed is much greater in terms of jobs \nlost and economic drag.\n  There are, of course, concerns about the social costs of alcohol \nconsumption. I am very sensitive to those concerns and am encouraged by \nthe reductions in drunk driving and alcohol abuse. But the fact is, \nthis tax punishes all beer consumers instead of the minority who act \ndangerously. In any case, these problems must be addressed directly \nthrough specific legislation rather than indirectly through the Tax \nCode, which is already complicated enough.\n  Mr. President, because this tax has grown so much since 1991 and \nbecause it not only affects beer wholesalers and resellers but hard-\nworking Montanans who enjoy these products responsibly, I am pleased to \ncosponsor this legislation in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/09/senate-section/article/S4209-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PASSING THE MINIMUM WAGE\n\n  Mr. BIDEN.

During that same period, the incomes of average \nAmericans grew just 15 percent.\n  But the poorest fifth of our citizens saw their already inadequate \nincomes grow just $600--over 24 years.\n  As a result, the top 1 percent of Americans now get over 12 percent \nof all the income, up over 50 percent 24 years ago. And the share of \nthe average family actually dropped. The share going to the bottom \nfifth dropped even more.\n  We are moving apart, not coming together, as a nation. Last year, the \nChair of the Federal Reserve called growing concentration of income in \nthe hands of a tiny minority ``a really serious problem.''\n  There are many things we need to do to get our economy working for \nworking families. One place to start is at the bottom among those \nAmericans who work at full-time jobs and remain below the poverty line. \nWe should not permit that to happen. If we honor work, we have to \nreward it. We should not stand for any American to work a full-time job \nand come home too poor to meet the basic needs.\n  The minimum wage has not increased since 1996--and all of that \nincrease has been wiped out by the cost of living. The minimum wage \ntoday, at $5.15 an hour, is even worth less in today's dollars than the \n$4.25 rate it replaced.\n  Today, the minimum wage is worth only a third of the average hourly \nwage of American workers, the lowest level in more than half a century. \nThe bottom rung of the ladder of opportunity is broken.

Over the \npast few years, we have passed tax cuts that last year alone gave over \n$100,000 to the wealthiest among us.

Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that this week, \nMay 7 to 13, 2006, has been designated by the American Humane \nAssociation as the 92nd Be Kind to Animals Week. The American Humane \nAssociation, which is headquartered in Englewood, CO, was founded in \n1877 and is the oldest national organization dedicated to the mission \nof preventing cruelty to animals, as well as to children. Through this \nwork, American Humane has helped America shed light on the nature and \norigins of cruelty and through this annual observance reminds us that \nthe practice of kindness can both heal hurt and yield constructive \nreform.\n  When, in 1915, American Humane launched the Nation's first national \nweek for animals, its purpose was simple: ``to direct the attention of \nthe public to the importance of giving proper care and attention to \nanimals.'' This message resonated powerfully with Americans and quickly \nevolved into a national public education campaign with a broader \nmission: promoting the teaching of humane education in our schools; \npromoting the good works of animal shelters; and helping Americans \nunderstand the unique bond between humans and animals.\n  Be Kind to Animals Week is the oldest event of its kind. Each year it \nreminds us how animals enrich our lives through their companionship, \nfriendship and love. Over the last 91 years, a central theme of this \nannual event has been the importance of teaching the principles of \nkindness and compassion to children. Humane groups spend much of their \ntime reacting to mistreatment of animals as it occurs. American Humane \nbelieves that, if we share our humane values with our children, these \nproblems can be prevented and our society made safer and kinder.\n  American Humane's Be Kind to Animals Week is as much a lifelong \nattitude as it is a weeklong event. It is about animal shelters, \nveterinarians, humane educators, animal control professionals, and the \nfaith community promoting discussion and reflection about kindness to \nanimals, to individuals, within families and perhaps most important, \nwithin communities. But Be Kind to Animals Week isn't just about \nanimals. It is also about children and those who care for and about \nthem.\n  As a veterinarian, I have seen firsthand how important animals are to \npeople. When a family adopts a pet, it becomes one of them. Usually, \nwhen people bring an animal to a veterinarian, it is because there is \nsomething wrong with the animal. It was always obvious to me the love \nthat people had for their animals. The illness of a pet can cause great \nsorrow, but the healing of a pet brings great joy. Many studies have \nshown the increased happiness and healing powers of spending time with \na pet.\n  During Be Kind to Animals Week, we should all keep in mind a simple \nbut powerful message. The week should serve as a reminder that as \nhumans, we need to be ever more compassionate about the animals in our \nworld, whether they are companion pets, service animals such as seeing-\neye dogs, zoo critters, livestock, or nature's wildlife. It is a \nreminder that the bond between humans and animals is a vital one and is \ncapable of bringing joy and healing to people of all ages. It is also a \nreminder to be more kind and compassionate to our fellow man.

Mr. President. I rise today to recognize the Beta \nPhi Chapter of Delta Tau Delta for their reinstatement to the Ohio \nState University's fraternity system and for the chapter's commitment \nto living lives of excellence that can serve as an example for us all.\n  Founded at Bethany College in 1858, Delta Tau Delta began as a \nresponse by the eight founding members to suspicions that the student-\nrun Neotrophian Literary Society had been compromised and that the \nresults of a student oratory contest had been manipulated. This \ninjustice was not to be tolerated by the young founding members, as \nthey were devoted to the idea of truth in all matters. Their response \nwas to found the fraternal society of Delta Tau Delta, which continues \nto thrive on college campuses across America.\n  This devotion to the truth is only one of the hallmarks of Delta Tau \nDelta. The ideals of courage, faith and power complete the quartet of \nfounding principles. These guiding lights have illuminated the lives of \nmany extraordinary young men who have undertaken the commitment that is \nrequired to become an active member of this outstanding organization.\n  Those men have gone on to serve in positions of trust and great \nresponsibility today as CEOs of companies like GM and General Mills, as \nGovernor of New Mexico, as U.S. Representatives, and as U.S. Senators \nof South Dakota and Delaware.\n  The Beta Phi chapter at the Ohio State University was founded on \nNovember 19, 1894. More than 2,000 young men have forged their college \nmemories there through their participation in this chapter. Located \nless than 200 yards from campus, the Delta Tau Delta house stood for \nmuch of the past century as a testament to character, honesty, and \nintegrity. The reinstatement of the Beta Phi chapter represents a \nreturn to those values.\n  These bonds of brotherhood do not dissolve at graduation. They \ncontinue through time because the brothers of Delta Tau Delta commit \nthemselves to a cause that is larger than a single individual or \ngraduating class.\n  With chapters on more than 200 college campuses across America and \napproximately 6,000 active members and more than 145,000 alumni, Delta \nTau Delta has had an immeasurable impact on the communities in which \nits members--past and present--live and serve. Volunteer service is \nvital to the improvement of any community. It is one of the primary \nrequirements for becoming an active member of Delta Tau Delta. By \npartnering with the Adopt-A-School volunteer service organization, the \nmen of the Beta Phi Chapter have lent their time and energy at every \nturn to mentor and tutor thousands of schoolchildren less fortunate \nthan they.\n  The Delta Tau Delta experience also allows young men to gain \nexperience that the average college student does not receive by \nproviding members with opportunities for responsibility and leadership \nthat are not easily found in the many traditional college settings. \nWhether mentoring school children or organizing a community blood \ndrive, the men of Delta Tau Delta accept responsibility for more than \nthemselves.

Retha has served as Westminster \nPresbyterian Church's director of social services for 29 years, and her \nleadership over that span of time has won her the respect and gratitude \nof our entire State. She has been, and remains, a trusted friend to \nmany members of our congregation and of the community that we serve.\n  Retha was born in Fayetteville, NC, on April 18, 1936. She was the \nonly child of Clara and Lester McLerin. Her early childhood ambition \nwas to become a nurse, but she decided against it because she disliked \nthe sight of blood. After many years of piano and voice lessons, she \nbegan her college career in Washington, DC, at Howard University where \nshe majored in music. She later decided to follow her childhood desire \nto help her fellow man and changed her major to psychology and \nsociology with a minor in English. It was during this time that she \nmade the decision to become a social worker.\n  After graduation and while looking for employment, Retha applied to \nwhat was then known as the State Department of Welfare, Child Welfare \nDivision in Dover. During the interview process, she was asked if she \nwould like to take advantage of a stipend to attend graduate school. \nWhile living in Wilmington, she attended the University of \nPennsylvania's School of Social Work and was placed in a position in \nDover. Her placement was with Child Welfare Services, and she soon \ndiscovered that working with children was her true calling. Twelve \nyears later, Retha accepted a position with the Wilmington Housing \nAuthority as their coordinator of social services.\n  Throughout these many years doing her fine work, Retha maintained and \nnourished some other ``loves of her life.'' She met and married Arland \nRoland Fisher, whom everyone called Roland. Together they had one \ndaughter, Whitney Gayle Fisher, who now practices personal injury and \ncriminal law in Newark, NJ. After her daughter's birth, Retha left her \nposition to with the Wilmington Housing Authority to devote her time as \na full-time wife and mother.\n  In 1977, though, Retha was asked by Westminster Presbyterian Church \nif she would be interested in interviewing for a job there. It was with \nthis wonderful opportunity that Retha found her true calling. She \nbecame the church's director of social services, and the people of \nWestminster and of Delaware have been truly blessed by this decision \nfor almost three decades.\n  Retha's service has extended far beyond the church walls and well \ninto the community. In 1993, she founded the Food Bank of Delaware, a \nnonprofit agency that helps feed hungry people throughout our State. \nThe Food Bank of Delaware is the only facility in Delaware with the \nequipment, warehouse, and staff to collect donations for all sectors of \nthe food industry and to safely and efficiently redistribute it to the \npeople who need it most. Through 235 member agencies, the Food Bank of \nDelaware distributes over 10 million pounds of food annually.\n  In addition to the Food Bank of Delaware, Retha has also helped \ncountless low-income individuals with financial assistance. She founded \nF.A.I.T.H. Center, which provides financial assistance to the poor. In \n1992, she also chaired the Conectiv--now Delmarva Power--Consumer \nCouncil, which continues to meet with representatives of the utility \nand the State of Delaware to bring financial support to those who \ncannot afford to pay their utility bills.\n\n[[Page S4211]]\n\n  In 1989, Retha met with 10 Westminster couples to explore the \npossibility of how they might help homeless families get off the street \nand into adequate housing. To that end, Retha founded the Samaritans. \nFrom case management to furniture to mentoring, the Samaritans stand \nready to provide support for the year or so that a homeless family \nneeds to become stabilized.\n  At Christmastime, Retha embodies the true spirit of the holidays. \nEach year, Retha organizes and oversees Westminster's yearly program to \ndistribute Christmas food and gift baskets to nearly 200 clients of the \nsocial services agencies of greater Wilmington.\n  Retha has not only brought financial assistance through her work in \nthese various programs, but she has served as a spiritual leader as \nwell. She has been an ear to the lonely and a person to pray with \nthrough the hard times. She has given each of these people who have \ncome to her dignity and hope.\n  Through Retha's tireless efforts, she has made a profound difference \nin the lives of thousands of Delawareans. Upon her retirement, she \nleaves behind a legacy of commitment to public service for future \ngenerations to follow. I thank her for the friendship that many of us \nare privileged to share with Retha and for the inspiration that she \nprovides through a lifetime of caring. On behalf of all Delawareans, I \ncongratulate her on a truly remarkable and distinguished career and \nextend to her my very best wishes for every success in the future.

A bill to provide assistance to improve the health of \nnewborns, children, and mothers in developing countries, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, on behalf of myself and my \nfriend, Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon, the Child Health Investment for \nLong-term Development (CHILD and Newborn) Act of 2006. This legislation \nwould perform four simple, yet critically important functions.\n  First, it would require the Administration to develop and implement a \nstrategy to improve the health of, and reduce mortality rates among, \nnewborns, children, and mothers in developing countries.\n  Second, it would mandate the establishment of a U.S. Government task \nforce to assess, monitor, and evaluate the progress of U.S. efforts to \nmeet the United Nations Millennium Development Goals by 2015--\nspecifically as those goals relate to reducing mortality rates for \nmothers and for children less than 5 years of age in developing \ncountries.\n  Third, it would authorize the President to furnish assistance for \nprograms whose goal is to improve the health of newborns, children, and \nmothers in developing countries.\n  And fourth, this legislation would authorize appropriations to carry \nout its provisions--$660 million for fiscal year 2007, and $1.2 billion \nfor each of fiscal years 2008-2011.\n  I know that some of my colleagues will look at this bill and ask why \nthe U.S. should devote such large amounts of resources to combating \nchild and maternal mortality in the developing world. Certainly, nobody \nwould deny that it's an important cause, but should it really be this \nmuch of a priority?\n  I would argue that the answer to this is yes. Why? Because with U.S. \nleadership, the current reality for mothers and their young children in \nthe developing world can be changed dramatically.\n  What is that reality?\n  Almost 11 million children under the age of 5 die every year in the \ndeveloping world--that's approximately 30,000 each day. About four \nmillion of those children die in their first four weeks of life. In \nmany cases, they aren't even provided with a fighting chance. Indeed, \nfor children under the age of five in the developing world, preventable \nor treatable diseases such as measles, tetanus, diarrhea, pneumonia, \nand malaria are the most common causes of death.\n  Each year, more than 525,000 women die from causes related to \npregnancy and childbirth--more than 1,400 each day. Ninety-nine percent \nof these deaths occur in the developing world. And the lifetime risk of \nan African woman dying from a pregnancy or childbirth-related \ncomplication is I in 16, a high level of risk that is all the more \nstriking when compared to the same risk for women in more developed \nregions--1 in 2,800. Some of the most common risk factors for maternal \ndeath in developing countries include early pregnancy and childbirth, \nclosely spaced births, infectious diseases, malnutrition, and \ncomplications during childbirth.\n\n  Mr. President, the deaths of these nearly 12 million mothers and \nchildren are from largely preventable causes. This is a tragic \nsituation, and it shouldn't be the case.\n  Luckily, we can combat these high levels of mortality--and it won't \nrequire lots of sophisticated technology. Instead, it will require \nsimple measures that we take for granted here in the developed world.\n  For instance, it is estimated that two-thirds of deaths among \nchildren under 5 years of age--that's 7.1 million children, including 3 \nmillion newborns--could be prevented by low-cost, low-tech health and \nnutritional interventions. These interventions include encouraging \nbreastfeeding; providing vitamin supplements, immunizations, and \nantibiotics; offering oral rehydration therapy with clean water; and \nexpansion of basic clinical care.\n  For expecting mothers, simple steps such as birth spacing, access to \npreventive care, skilled birth attendants, and emergency obstetric care \ncan help reduce maternal morality rates. And keeping mothers healthy is \ncritical because the welfare of newborns and infants is inextricably \ntied to the health of the mother.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. isn't new at this battle. Over the past 30 \nyears, our work in promoting child survival and maternal health \nglobally has resulted in millions of lives being saved.\n  And in 2000, the U.S. joined 188 other countries in supporting eight \nMillennium Development Goals laid out by the United Nations. Two of \nthese goals are related to child and maternal health--one calls for a \nreduction by two-thirds in the mortality rate of children under 5, and \nthe other calls for a reduction in maternal deaths by three-quarters. \nBoth of these goals are targeted to be met by 2015.\n  But with current structures and at current funding levels, the world \nis unlikely to meet these laudable goals. Certainly, the U.S. can't \nmeet these global needs alone. Addressing this critical issue can't be \na unilateral effort--countries around the world must also do their part \nand come forward with much-needed funding.\n  But passing the CHILD and Newborn Act of 2006 would send a strong \nmessage to the international community that this is a priority issue, \nand it would encourage them to step up to the plate. Millions of lives \ncould be saved in the process.\n  On September 14, 2005, President Bush stated that the U.S. is \n``committed to the Millennium Development Goals.'' I commend the \nPresident for his words. But now, it is time for Congress to stand up \nand make sure that the U.S. fulfills this commitment to protect \nmillions of innocent women and their children around the globe. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2765\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Health Investment for \n     Long-term Development (CHILD and Newborn) Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Around the world, approximately 10.8 million children \n     under the age of five die each year, more than 30,000 per \n     day, almost all in the developing world.\n       (2) Each year in the developing world, four million \n     newborns die in their first four weeks of life.\n\n[[Page S4214]]\n\n       (3) Sub-Saharan Africa, with only 10 percent of the world's \n     population, accounts for 43 percent of all deaths among \n     children under the age of five.\n       (4) Countries such as Afghanistan, Angola and Niger \n     experience extreme levels of child mortality, with 25 percent \n     of children dying before their fifth birthday.\n       (5) For children under the age of five in the developing \n     world, preventable or treatable diseases, such as measles, \n     tetanus, diarrhea, pneumonia, and malaria, are the most \n     common causes of death.\n       (6) Throughout the developing world, the lack of basic \n     health services, clean water, adequate sanitation, and proper \n     nutrition contribute significantly to child mortality.\n       (7) Hunger and malnutrition contribute to over five million \n     child deaths annually.\n       (8) The lack of low-cost antibiotics and anti-malarial \n     drugs contribute to three million child deaths each year.\n       (9) Lack of access to health services results in 30 million \n     children under the age of one year going without necessary \n     immunizations.\n       (10) Every year an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 vitamin A-\n     deficient children become blind, with one-half of such \n     children dying within 12 months of losing their sight.\n       (11) Iron deficiency, affecting over 30 percent of the \n     world's population, causes premature birth, low birth weight, \n     and infections, elevating the risk of death in children.\n       (12) Two-thirds of deaths of children under five years of \n     age, or 7.1 million children, including three million newborn \n     deaths, could be prevented by low-cost, low-tech health and \n     nutritional interventions.\n       (13) Exclusive breastfeeding--giving only breast milk for \n     the first six months of life--could prevent an estimated 1.3 \n     million newborn and infant deaths each year, primarily by \n     protecting against diarrhea and pneumonia.\n       (14) An additional two million lives could be saved \n     annually by providing oral-rehydration therapy prepared with \n     clean water.\n       (15) During the 1990s, successful immunization programs \n     reduced polio by 99 percent, tetanus deaths by 50 percent, \n     and measles cases by 40 percent.\n       (16) Between 1998 and 2000, distribution of low-cost \n     vitamin A supplements saved an estimated one million lives.\n       (17) Expansion of clinical care of newborns and mothers, \n     such as clean delivery by skilled attendants, emergency \n     obstetric care, and neonatal resuscitation, can avert 50 \n     percent of newborn deaths.\n       (18) Keeping mothers healthy is essential for child \n     survival because illness, complications, or maternal death \n     during or following pregnancy increases the risk for death in \n     newborns and infants.\n       (19) Each year more than 525,000 women die from causes \n     related to pregnancy and childbirth, with 99 percent of these \n     deaths occurring in developing countries.\n       (20) The lifetime risk of an African woman dying from a \n     complication related to pregnancy or childbirth is 1 in 16, \n     while the same risk for a woman in a developed country is 1 \n     in 2,800.\n       (21) Risk factors for maternal death in developing \n     countries include early pregnancy and childbirth, closely \n     spaced births, infectious diseases, malnutrition, and \n     complications during childbirth.\n       (22) Birth spacing, access to preventive care, skilled \n     birth attendants, and emergency obstetric care can help \n     reduce maternal mortality.\n       (23) The role of the United States in promoting child \n     survival and maternal health over the past three decades has \n     resulted in millions of lives being saved around the world.\n       (24) In 2000, the United States joined 188 other countries \n     in supporting eight Millennium Development Goals designed to \n     achieve ``a more peaceful, prosperous and just world''.\n       (25) Two of the Millennium Development Goals call for a \n     reduction in the mortality rate of children under the age of \n     five by two-thirds and a reduction in maternal deaths by \n     three-quarters by 2015.\n       (26) On September 14, 2005, President George W. Bush stated \n     before the leaders of the world: ``To spread a vision of \n     hope, the United States is determined to help nations that \n     are struggling with poverty. We are committed to the \n     Millennium Development Goals.''.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) authorize assistance to improve the health of newborns, \n     children, and mothers in developing countries, including by \n     strengthening the capacity of health systems and health \n     workers;\n       (2) develop and implement a strategy to improve the health \n     of newborns, children, and mothers, including reducing child \n     and maternal mortality, in developing countries;\n       (3) to establish a task force to assess, monitor, and \n     evaluate the progress and contributions of relevant \n     departments and agencies of the Government of the United \n     States in achieving the United Nations Millennium Development \n     Goals by 2015 for reducing the mortality of children under \n     the age of five by two-thirds and reducing maternal mortality \n     by three-quarters in developing countries.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for innovation in health care through \nState initiatives that expand coverage and access and improve quality \nand efficiency in the health care system; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a bill my \ncolleague Senator Bingaman and I introduced today, the Health Care \nPartnership Act. For too many years, I have listened to my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle talk about the rising cost of health care \nand the growing number of uninsured Americans. Yet, we have not been \nable to make much progress here at the Federal level to find a \nmeaningful solution for the dilemma this Nation is facing regarding \naccess to quality, affordable health care. Next to the economy, it is \nthe greatest domestic challenge facing our Nation. In fact, the rising \ncost of health care is a major part of what is hurting our \ncompetitiveness in the global marketplace.\n  While surveys have indicated that health insurance premiums have \nstabilized--a 9.2 percent increase in 2006 and 2005 and compared with a \n12.3 percent in 2004; 14.7 percent in 2003; and 15.2 percent in 2002--\nhealth insurance costs continue to be a significant factor impacting \nAmerican competitiveness. In addition, the share of costs that \nindividuals have paid for employer sponsored insurance has risen \nroughly 2 percent each year, from 31.4 percent of health care costs in \n2001 to 38.4 percent this year.\n  In fact, spending on health care in the United States reached $1.9 \ntrillion in 2004--almost 16.5 percent of our GDP--the largest share \never.\n  Yet, despite all the increases in health care spending some 46 \nmillion Americans--15 percent of the population--had no health \ninsurance at some point last year. This number has increased steadily. \nIn 2000, that number was 39.8 million. In 2002 it was 43.6 million.\n  These statistics are startling and it is time that we do something \nabout them. The bill Senator Bingaman and I are introducing today aims \nto break the log-jam here in Washington and\n\n[[Page S4216]]\n\nallow states the freedom to explore with health care reform options. \nThis bill would support state-based efforts to reduce the uninsured and \nthe cost of health care, improve quality, improve access to care, and \nexpand information technology.\n  I have been in this situation before. As Governor of Ohio, I had to \nwork creatively to expand coverage and deal with increasing health care \ncosts for a growing number of uninsured Ohioans. I am happy to report \nthat we were able to make some progress toward reducing the number of \nuninsured Ohioans during my time as the head of the state by \nnegotiating with the state unions to move to managed care; by \ncontrolling Medicaid costs to the point where from 1995 to 1998, due to \ngood stewardship and management, Ohio ended up under-spending on \nMedicaid without harming families; and implementing the S-CHIP program \nto provide coverage for uninsured children.\n  Like we did in Ohio, a number of states are already actively pursuing \nefforts to reduce the number of their residents who lack adequate \nhealth care coverage. The Health Care Partnership Act will build on \nwhat states like Massachusetts and others are doing, while providing a \nmechanism to analyze results and make recommendations for future action \nat the Federal level.\n  Under the Health Partnership Act, Congress would authorize grants to \nindividual states, groups of states, and Indian tribes and local \ngovernments to carry out any of a broad range of strategies to improve \nour Nation's health care delivery. The bill creates a mechanism for \nstates to apply for grants to a bipartisan ``State Health Innovation \nCommission'' housed at the Department of Health and Human Services \n(HHS). After reviewing the state proposals, the Commission would submit \nto Congress a list of recommended state applications. The Commission \nwould also recommend the amount of Federal grant money each state \nshould receive to carry out the actions described in their plan.\n  Most importantly, at the end of the five-year period, the Commission \nwould be required to report to Congress whether the states are meeting \nthe goals of the Act. The Commission would then recommend future action \nCongress should take concerning overall reform, including whether or \nnot to extend the state program.\n  I believe it is important that we pass this legislation to provide a \nplatform from which we can have a thoughtful conversation about health \ncare reform here in Washington. Since I have been in the Senate, \nCongress has made some progress toward improving health care, most \nnotably for our 43 million seniors who now have access to affordable \nprescription medication through the Medicare Modernization Act. We have \nalso increased funding for community health centers and safety net \nhospitals that provide health care for the uninsured and under insured; \nincreased the use of technology in our health care delivery system; and \nimproved the safety of medical care by passing a medical errors \nreporting bill.\n  Yet, these incremental steps are not enough, and we have been at this \ntoo long here in Washington without comprehensive, meaningful results. \nI ask for my colleagues' support for this bipartisan bill that I hope \nwill move us closer toward a solution to the uninsured.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2772\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be \n     construed to include the approval of State proposals that \n     involve waivers or modifications in applicable Federal law.\n       (5) Program or project period.--A State program or project \n     may be approved for a period of 5 years and may be extended \n     for subsequent 5-year periods upon approval by the Commission \n     and the Secretary, based upon achievement of targets, except \n     that a shorter period may be requested by a State and granted \n     by the Secretary.\n       (e) Expedited Congressional Consideration.--\n       (1) Introduction and Committee Consideration.--\n       (A) Introduction.--The legislative proposal submitted \n     pursuant to subsection (d)(4)(B) shall be in the form of a \n     joint resolution (in this subsection referred to as the \n     ``resolution''). Such resolution shall be introduced in the \n     House of Representatives by the Speaker, and in the Senate, \n     by the Majority Leader, immediately upon receipt of the \n     language and shall be referred to the appropriate committee \n     of Congress. If the resolution is not introduced in \n     accordance with the preceding sentence, the resolution may be \n     introduced in either House of Congress by any member thereof.\n       (B) Committee consideration.--A resolution introduced in \n     the House of Representatives shall be referred to the \n     Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives. \n     A resolution introduced in the Senate shall be referred to \n     the Committee on Finance of the Senate. Not later than 15 \n     calendar days after the introduction of the resolution, the \n     committee of Congress to which the resolution was referred \n     shall report the resolution or a committee amendment thereto. \n     If the committee has not reported such resolution (or an \n     identical resolution) at the end of 15 calendar days after \n     its introduction or at the end of the first day after there \n     has been reported to the House involved a resolution, \n     whichever is earlier, such committee shall be deemed to be \n     discharged from further consideration of such reform bill and \n     such reform bill shall be placed on the appropriate calendar \n     of the House involved.\n       (2) Expedited Procedure.--\n       (A) Consideration.--Not later than 5 days after the date on \n     which a committee has been discharged from consideration of a \n     resolution, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, or \n     the Speaker's designee, or the Majority Leader of the Senate, \n     or the Leader's designee, shall move to proceed to the \n     consideration of the committee amendment to the resolution, \n     and if there is no such amendment, to the resolution. It \n     shall also be in order for any member of the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate, respectively, to move to \n     proceed to the consideration of the resolution at any time \n     after the conclusion of such 5-day period. All points of \n     order against the resolution (and against consideration of \n     the resolution) are waived. A motion to proceed to the \n     consideration of the resolution is highly privileged in the \n     House of Representatives and is privileged in the Senate and \n     is not debatable. The motion is not subject to amendment, to \n     a motion to postpone consideration of the resolution, or to a \n     motion to proceed to the consideration of other business. A \n     motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion to proceed \n     is agreed to or not agreed to shall not be in order. If the \n     motion to proceed is agreed to, the House of Representatives \n     or the Senate, as the case may be, shall immediately proceed \n     to consideration of the resolution without intervening \n     motion, order, or other business, and the resolution shall \n     remain the unfinished business of the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate, as the case may be, until \n     disposed of.\n       (B) Consideration by other house.--If, before the passage \n     by one House of the resolution that was introduced in such \n     House, such House receives from the other House a resolution \n     as passed by such other House--\n       (i) the resolution of the other House shall not be referred \n     to a committee and may only be considered for final passage \n     in the House that receives it under clause (iii);\n       (ii) the procedure in the House in receipt of the \n     resolution of the other House, with respect to the resolution \n     that was introduced in the House in receipt of the resolution \n     of the other House, shall be the same as if no resolution had \n     been received from the other House; and\n       (iii) notwithstanding clause (ii), the vote on final \n     passage shall be on the reform bill of the other House.\n     Upon disposition of a resolution that is received by one \n     House from the other House, it shall no longer be in order to \n     consider the resolution bill that was introduced in the \n     receiving House.\n       (C) Consideration in conference.--Immediately upon a final \n     passage of the resolution that results in a disagreement \n     between the two Houses of Congress with respect to the \n     resolution, conferees shall be appointed and a conference \n     convened. Not later than 10 days after the date on which \n     conferees are appointed, the conferees shall file a report \n     with the House of Representatives and the Senate resolving \n     the differences between the Houses on the resolution. \n     Notwithstanding any other rule of the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate, it shall be in order to \n     immediately consider a report of a committee of conference on \n     the resolution filed in accordance with this subclause. \n     Debate in the House of Representatives and the Senate on the \n     conference report shall be limited to 10 hours, equally \n     divided and controlled by the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the Minority Leader of the House of \n     Representatives or their designees and the Majority and \n     Minority Leaders of the Senate or their designees. A vote on \n     final passage of the conference report shall occur \n     immediately at the conclusion or yielding back of all time \n     for debate on the conference report.\n       (3) Rules of the senate and house of representatives.--This \n     subsection is enacted by Congress--\n       (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives, respectively, and is deemed to \n     be part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n     applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed \n     in that House in the case of a resolution, and it supersedes \n     other rules only to the extent that it is inconsistent with \n     such rules; and\n       (B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as they relate to \n     the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, \n     and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of \n     that House.\n       (4) Limitation.--The amount of Federal funds provided with \n     respect to any State proposal that is deemed approved under \n     subsection (d)(3) shall not exceed the cost provided for such \n     proposals within the concurrent resolution on the budget as \n     enacted by Congress for the fiscal year involved.\n       (f) Funding.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall provide a grant to a \n     State that has an application approved under subsection (b) \n     to enable such State to carry out an innovative State health \n     program in the State.\n       (2) Amount of grant.--The amount of a grant provided to a \n     State under paragraph (1) shall be determined based upon the \n     recommendations of the Commission, subject to the amount \n     appropriated under subsection (k).\n       (3) Performance-based funding allocation and \n     prioritization.--In awarding grants under paragraph (1), the \n     Secretary shall--\n       (A) fund a diversity of approaches as provided for by the \n     Commission in subsection (c)(1)(B);\n       (B) give priority to those State programs that the \n     Commission determines have the greatest opportunity to \n     succeed in providing expanded health insurance coverage and \n     in providing children, youth, and other vulnerable \n     populations with improved access to health care items and \n     services; and\n       (C) link allocations to the State to the meeting of the \n     goals and performance measures relating to health care \n     coverage, quality, and health care costs established under \n     this Act through the State project application process.\n       (4) Maintenance of effort.--A State, in utilizing the \n     proceeds of a grant received under paragraph (1), shall \n     maintain the expenditures of the State for health care \n     coverage purposes for the support of direct health care \n     delivery at a level equal to not less than the level of such \n     expenditures maintained by the State for the fiscal year \n     preceding the fiscal year for which the grant is received.\n       (5) Report.--At the end of the 5-year period beginning on \n     the date on which the Secretary awards the first grant under \n     paragraph (1), the State Health Innovation Advisory \n     Commission established under subsection (c) shall prepare and \n     submit to the appropriate committees of Congress, a report on \n     the progress made by States receiving grants under paragraph \n     (1) in meeting the goals of expanded coverage, improved \n     quality, and cost containment through performance measures \n     established during the 5-year period of the grant.

Amounts appropriated \n     for a fiscal year under this subsection and not expended may \n     be used in subsequent fiscal years to carry out this section.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am pleased to announce today the introduction of \nbipartisan legislation with Senator Voinovich entitled the ``Health \nPartnership Act of 2006'' with additional bipartisan support from \nSenators DeWine and Akaka. The ``Health Partnership Act'' is intended \nto move beyond the political gridlock in Washington, D.C., and set us \non a path toward finding solutions to affordable, quality health care \nfor all Americans by creating partnerships between the federal \ngovernment, state and local governments, private payers, and health \ncare providers to implement different and promising approaches to \nhealth care.\n  Federal funding and support would be committed to states to reduce \nthe number of uninsured, reduce costs, and improve the quality of \nhealth care for all Americans. Should a state decline to apply or if a \nunique need exists, local governments also would be authorized to apply \nfor a federal grant for such purposes.\n  States, local governments, and tribes and tribal governments would be \nable to submit applications to the federal government for funding to \nimplement a state health care expansion and improvement program to a \nbipartisan ``State Health Innovation Commission.'' Based on funding \navailable through the federal budget process, the Commission would \napprove a variety of reform options and innovative approaches.\n  This federalist approach to health reform would encourage a broad \narray of reform options that would be closely monitored to see what is \nworking and what is not. As Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis \nwrote in 1932, ``It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system \nthat a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a \nlaboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk \nto the rest of the country.''\n  Our bipartisan legislation, the ``Health Partnership Act,'' \nencourages this type of state-based innovation and will help the nation \nbetter address both the policy and the politics of health care reform. \nWe do not have consensus at the federal level on anyone approach and so \nencouraging states to adopt a variety of approaches will help us all \nbetter understand what may or may not work. And, it is well past the \ntime when we need action to be taking place to address the growing and \nrelated problems of the uninsured and increasing health care costs.\n  In fact, spending on health care in our country has now reached $2 \ntrillion annually, and yet, the number of uninsured has increased to 46 \nmillion people, which is six million more than in 2000. The \nconsequences are staggering, as uninsured citizens get about half the \nmedical care they need compared to those with health insurance and, \naccording to the Institute of Medicine, about 18,000 unnecessary deaths \noccur each year in the United States because of lack of health \nInsurance.\n  While gridlock absent a solution continues to permeate Washington, \nDC, a number of states and local governments are moving ahead with \nhealth reform. The premise on which this bill is based is that the \nfederal government should provide support for such efforts rather than \nconstantly undermining them.\n  The ``Health Partnership Act'' would provide such support, as it \nauthorizes grants to states, groups of states, local governments, and \nIndian tribes and organizations to carry out any of a broad range of \nstrategies to reach the goals\n\n[[Page S4220]]\n\nof reducing the number of uninsured, reducing costs, and improving the \nquality of care.\n  As usual, state and local governments are not waiting around for \nfederal action. This is exactly what was happening in the early 1990s \nas states such as New Mexico, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Florida, \nRhode Island, Hawaii, Maryland, Tennessee, Vermont, and Washington led \nthe way to expanding coverage to children through the enactment of a \nvariety of health reforms. Some of these programs worked better than \nothers and the federal government responded in 1997 with passage of the \n``State Children's Health Insurance Program'' or SCHIP. This \nlegislation received broad bipartisan support and was built upon the \nexperience of the state expansions. SCHIP continues to be a state-based \nmodel that covers millions of children and continues to have broad-\nbased bipartisan support across this nation.\n  So, why not use that successful model and build upon it? In fact, \nstate and local governments are already taking up that challenge and \nthe federal government should, through the enactment of the ``Health \nPartnership Act,'' do what it can to be helpful with those efforts. For \nexample--\n  On November 15, 2005, Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich signed into \nlaw the ``Covering All Kids Health Insurance Act'' which, beginning in \nJuly 2006, will attempt to make insurance coverage available to all \nuninsured children.\n  In Massachusetts, Governor Mitt Romney recently signed into law \nlegislation that requires all Bay State residents to have health \ninsurance. Virtually everyone interested in solutions to our nation's \nhealth care problems are looking at the Massachusetts ``experiment'' as \na possible solution.\n  Other states, including New Mexico, Maine, West Virginia, Oklahoma, \nand New York have enacted other health reforms that have had mixed \nsuccess.\n  All of these efforts are very important to add to our knowledge base, \nwhich can then lead to the formation of a possible national solution to \nour uninsured and affordability crisis. We can learn from each and \nevery one of these efforts, whether successful or failed.\n  Commonwealth Fund President Karen Davis said it well by noting that \nstate-based reforms, such as that passed in Massachusetts, are very \ngood news. As she notes, ``First, any substantive effort to expand \naccess to coverage is worthwhile, given the growing number of uninsured \nin this country and the large body of evidence showing the dangerous \nhealth implications of lacking coverage.''\n  She adds, ``But something more important is at work here, While we \nurgently need a national solution so that all Americans have insurance, \nit doesn't appear that we'll be getting one at the federal level any \ntime soon. So what Massachusetts has done potentially holds lessons for \nevery state.'' I would add that it holds lessons for the federal \ngovernment as well and not just for the mechanics of implementing \nhealth reform policy but also to the politics of health reform.\n  As she concludes, ``One particularly cogent lesson is the manner in \nwhich the measure was crafted--via a civil process that successfully \nbrought together numerous players from across the political business, \nhealth care delivery, and policy sectors.''\n  Mr. President, Senator Voinovich and I have worked together for many \nmonths now on this legislation via a process much like that described \nby Karen Davis. The legislation stems from past legislative efforts by \nsenators such as Bob Graham, Mark Hatfield, and Paul Wellstone, but \nalso from work across ideological lines by Henry Aaron of the Brookings \nInstitute and Stuart Butler of the Heritage Foundation.\n  The legislation also received much advice and support from Dr. Tim \nGarson who, as Dean of the University of Virginia, brought a much \nneeded provider perspective which is reflected in support for the \nlegislation from the American Medical Association, the American Academy \nof Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians, the American College \nof Cardiology, American Gastroenterological Association, the Visiting \nNurses Association, the National Association of Community Health \nCenters, and from state-based health providers such as the New Mexico \nMedical Society and Ohio Association of Community Health Centers.\n  And the legislation also received much comment and support from \nconsumer-based groups advocating for national health reform, including \nthat by Dr. Ken Frisof and UHCAN, which is the Universal Health Care \nAction Network, Bill Vaughan at Consumers Union, and from numerous \nhealth care advocates in New Mexico, including Community Action New \nMexico, Health Action New Mexico, Health Care for All Campaign of New \nMexico, New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty, New Mexico Health Choices \nInitiative, New Mexico POZ Coalition, New Mexico Public Health \nAssociation, New Mexico Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, \nNew Mexico Progressive Alliance for Community Empowerment, and the \nHealth Security for New Mexicans Campaign, which includes 115 \norganizations based in the State.\n  Support from all stakeholders in our nation's health care system has \nbeen sought and I would like to thank the many organizations from New \nMexico for their support and input to this legislation. There is great \nurgency in New Mexico because our State, like all of those along the \nU.S.-Mexico border, faces a severe health care crisis. In fact, New \nMexico ranks second only to Texas in the percentage of its citizens who \nare uninsured. New Mexico is also the only state in the country with \nless than half of its population having private health insurance \ncoverage.\n  A rather shocking statistic, which also continues to worsen, is that \none out of every three Hispanic citizens are uninsured. In fact, less \nthan 43 percent of the Hispanic population now has employer-based \ncoverage nationwide, which is in sharp comparison to the 68 percent of \nnon-Hispanic whites who have employer-based coverage.\n  The State has also enacted its own health reform plan called the \nState Coverage Initiative, or SCI in July 2005. SCI is a public/private \npartnership that is intended to expand employer-sponsored insurance and \nwas developed in part with grant funding from the Robert Wood Johnson \nFoundation. As of May 1, there were just over 4,500 people covered by \nthis initiative and there are efforts to expand this effort to cover \nover 20,000 individuals. With federal support for my State, the hope \nwould be to further expand coverage to as many New Mexicans as \npossible.\n  It is also important to note that the legislation encourages reforms \nat both the state and local levels of government. Senator Voinovich, as \nformer Mayor of Cleveland, suggested language that would capture \ncommunity-based efforts as well. Illinois, Georgia, Michigan, and \nOregon have all initiated efforts at the local level for reform, \nincluding what is known as the ``three-share'' programs in Illinois and \nMichigan. These initiatives have employers, employees, and the \ncommunity each pick up about one-third of the cost of the program.\n  Jeaneane Smith, deputy administrator in the Office of Oregon Health \nPolicy and Research was quoted in a recent Academy Health publication \nsaying, ``In recent years it has become apparent that there is a need \nto consider both state- and community-level approaches to improved \naccess. We want to learn how best to support communities as they play \nan integral part in addressing the gaps in coverage.''\n  Our hope is to spawn as much creative innovation as possible. \nBrookings Institute Senior Health Fellow Henry Aaron and Heritage \nFoundation Vice President Stuart Butler wrote a Health Affairs article \nin March 2004 that lays out the foundation for this legislative effort. \nThey argue that while we remain unable to reconcile how best to expand \ncoverage at the federal level, we can agree to support states in their \nefforts to try widely differing solutions to health coverage, cost \ncontainment, and quality improvement. As they write, ``This approach \noffers both a way to improve knowledge about how to reform health care \nand a practical way to initiate a process of reform. Such a pluralist \napproach respects the real, abiding differences in politics, \npreferences, traditions, and institutions across the nation. It also \nimplies a willingness to accept differences over an extended period in \norder to make progress. And it recognizes that permitting wide \ndiversity can foster consensus by revealing the strengths and exposing \nthe weaknesses of rival approaches.''\n  The most important message that I hope this bill carries is that we \nmust stop having the perfect be the enemy of the good. This proposal is \ncertainly not perfect but we hope it makes a very\n\n[[Page S4221]]\n\nimportant contribution to addressing our nation's health care crisis.\n  In addition to Dr. Garson, Mr. Aaron, Mr. Butler, and Dr. Frisof, I \nwould like to express my appreciation to Dan Hawkins at the National \nAssociation of Community Health Centers, Bill Vaughan at Consumers \nUnion, and both Jack Meyer and Stan Dorn at ESRI for their counsel and \nguidance on health reform and this legislation.\n  I would also like to commend the American College of Physicians, or \nACP, for their outstanding leadership on the issue of the uninsured and \nfor their willingness to support a variety of efforts to expand health \ncoverage. ACP has been a longstanding advocate for expanding health \ncoverage and has authored landmark reports on the important role that \nhealth insurance has in reducing people's morbidity and mortality. In \nfact, to cite the conclusion of one of those studies, ``Lack of \ninsurance contributes to the endangerment of the health of each \nuninsured American as well as the collective health of the nation.''\n  And finally, I would also thank the many people at the Robert Wood \nJohnson Foundation on their forethought and knowledge on all the issues \nconfronting the uninsured. Their efforts to maintain the focus and \ndialogue on addressing the uninsured has kept the issue alive for many \nyears.\n  I hope we can break the gridlock and urge my colleagues to support \nthis important legislation.\n  I would ask for unanimous consent for a Fact Sheet and copy of the \nHealth Affairs article entitled ``How Federalism Could Spur Bipartisan \nAction on the Uninsured'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       The Health Partnership Act\n\n       Introduced by Senators Voinovich and Bingaman in May 2006--\n     ``A bill to provide for innovation in health care through \n     state initiatives that expand coverage and access and improve \n     quality and efficiency in the health care system.''\n       The Health Partnership Act, cosponsored by U.S. Senators \n     Voinovich (R-OH) and Bingaman (D-NM), is a first step to move \n     beyond the political deadlock that has prevented the United \n     States from finding paths to affordable, quality health care \n     for all. For decades, national solutions have proven \n     impossible to attain because of sharp differences on how to \n     pay for and organize health care services. The Health \n     Partnership Act breaks through the impasse. It creates \n     partnerships among the federal government, state governments, \n     private payers and health care providers to implement \n     different approaches to achieve sustainable reform that \n     provides affordable, quality health care for all. It \n     demonstrates federal leadership on health care through \n     establishing a mechanism by which federal dollars are \n     committed to states to reduce the number of uninsured and to \n     improve the quality of health care for all.\n       A creative new bipartisan initiative to move beyond \n     political deadlock and a potential first step towards \n     affordable quality health care for all.\n\n\n                           the federal level\n\n       Federal dollars will fund five-year State Health Care \n     Expansion and Improvement Grants. The amount of federal \n     funding for new grants will be determined annually in the \n     budgetary process.\n       The bill establishes a bipartisan State Health Innovation \n     Commission composed of national, state and local leaders that \n     will:\n       Issue requests for proposals.\n       Establish, in collaboration with an organization such as \n     the Institute of Medicine, minimum performance standards and \n     5-year goals.\n       Provide states with a ``toolkit'' of reform options, such \n     as single-payer systems, public program expansions, pay-or-\n     play mechanisms, tax credit incentives, health savings \n     accounts, etc.\n       Ensure the maintenance of Medicaid--prohibiting restrictive \n     rule changes that would limit eligibility or benefits.\n       Recommend to Congress which grants to support, giving \n     preference to states maximizing the reduction in numbers of \n     the uninsured.\n       Monitor the progress of programs and promote information \n     exchange on what works.\n       Recommend ways to minimize negative effects on national \n     employer groups, providers and insurers related to differing \n     state requirements.\n\n\n                              state level\n\n       Each state applying for a grant will develop a health care \n     plan to increase coverage, improve quality and reduce costs, \n     with specific targets for reduction in the number of \n     uninsured and the costs of administration.\n       States will receive renewable grants for five-year \n     expansion and improvement programs.\n       States will receive from the federal level technical \n     assistance, if requested, for developing proposals.\n       Each state plan would address:\n       Coverage by describing the process and setting a 5-year \n     target for reducing the number of uninsured individuals in \n     the state.\n       Quality by providing a plan to increase health care \n     effectiveness, efficiency, timeliness, and equity while \n     reducing health disparities and medical errors.\n       Costs by developing and implementing systems to improve the \n     efficiency of health care, including a 5-year target to \n     reduce administrative costs and paperwork burdens.\n       Information technology by designing the appropriate use of \n     health information technology to improve infrastructure, to \n     expand the availability of evidence-based medical and to \n     provide outcomes data to providers and patients.\n\n\n      states in the lead: lessons on the process of making change\n\n       Given the inaction of the federal government on health care \n     access issues, states have begun to address these challenges \n     creatively with sensitivity to local ideas and conditions. \n     Dozens of states are considering new proposals. Five have \n     already acted.\n       Maine, June 2003--the Dirigo Health Plan.\n       California, October 2003--phased-in Employer Mandate \n     (repealed by ballot initiative, November 2004).\n       Illinois, September 2005--Health Care for All Children.\n       Maryland, January 2006--Fair Share Health Care (employer \n     mandate for the largest employers).\n       Massachusetts, April 2006--Massachusetts Health Reform \n     Package--with both an individual and an employer mandate.\n       The recently passed Massachusetts law deserves special \n     attention because it is the first one enacted cooperatively \n     with a divided government--a strongly Democratic state \n     legislature and a Republican governor.\n       The detailed policy particulars in each of these state \n     measures are controversial, with strong supporters and strong \n     detractors. But they teach us a lot about the process of \n     reforming health care in America.\n       State political leadership at the highest level is \n     necessary.\n       Active consumer advocacy plays an important role.\n       Some stakeholder leadership must be willing to put the \n     larger public interest above their own narrow economic self-\n     interest.\n       The proposals have implementation phased in over several \n     years.\n       It is easier for these proposals to expand access than to \n     restrain the growth of costs--the latter being critical to \n     make them sustainable over the long term.\n       Massachusetts, in particular, demonstrated how modest \n     federal financial incentives (in this case the threatened \n     loss of less than \\1/10\\ of federal Medicaid funding) can \n     provide the critical stimulus for leaders to come together to \n     create comprehensive reform.\n\n\n           political advantages of the health partnership act\n\n       The Health Partnership Act provides positive multi-year \n     financial incentives to states to address these issues, \n     making it more likely for them to take the first steps and \n     less likely to backslide when money concerns arise.\n       Congress need not pick just one path to health care for \n     all. Members may be willing to let other states try models \n     that they would oppose in their home states.\n       Allowing states to design their own plans, based on simple \n     federal standards, has the potential to break through the \n     current political deadlock. Breakthroughs in some states \n     could be replicated elsewhere.\n       Advocacy is needed concurrently at the state and federal \n     levels, with each reinforcing the other.\n       Federal support has the potential to counteract likely \n     opposition by special interests in state efforts.\n\n\n            policy advantages of the health partnership act\n\n       The process of implementing a variety of partnerships \n     recognizes that one national plan may not address the \n     differences among states and encourages states to address \n     creatively their own needs.\n       Lessons learned in testing diverse state plans would \n     benefit other states and national reform.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      How Federalism Could Spur Bipartisan Action on the Uninsured\n\n                (By Henry J. Aaron and Stuart M. Butler)\n\n       Nearly everyone thinks that something should be done to \n     reduce the number of Americans lacking health insurance. \n     Unfortunately, while numerous plans exist on how to reach \n     that goal, few agree on any one. In deed, as authors we \n     disagree on how best to extend and assure health insurance \n     coverage. Nonetheless, we believe that using the pluralism \n     and creative power of federalism is the best way to break the \n     political logjam and to discover the best way to expand \n     coverage.\n       Accordingly, we believe that states should be strongly \n     encouraged to try any of a wide range of approaches to \n     increasing health insurance coverage and rewarded for their \n     success. This approach offers both a way to improve knowledge \n     about how to reform health care and a practical way to \n     initiate a process of reform. Such a pluralist approach \n     respects the real, abiding differences in politics, \n     preferences, traditions, and institutions across\n\n[[Page S4222]]\n\n     the nation. It also implies a willingness to accept \n     differences over an extended period in order to make \n     progress. And it recognizes that permitting wide diversity \n     can foster consensus by revealing the strengths and exposing \n     the weaknesses of rival approaches.\n       Despite our abiding disagreements on which substantive \n     approach to extending coverage is best, we believe that \n     people of goodwill must be prepared to countenance the \n     testing of ideas they oppose if progress is to be made. \n     Moreover, we believe that there is no hope for legislation \n     to begin to transform the largest U.S. industry--health \n     care--unless such legislation enjoys strong support from \n     both major political parties.\n\n\n                    Using Federalism To Spur Action\n\n       Proposals to reduce the number of uninsured Americans \n     abound. Some favor expanding government programs, such as \n     Medicaid. Others favor refundable tax credits to help \n     families buy private health insurance. Still others favor \n     regulatory approaches, such as changes in insurance rules. \n     But working together in health care to achieve a goal shared \n     by virtually everyone has proved to be impossible. One reason \n     for this is that the capacity to reach substantive compromise \n     in Washington has seriously eroded. Among the causes is the \n     widespread view that reforming the complex health care system \n     requires very carefully designed and internally consistent \n     actions. Some say that it is like building a new airplane: \n     Unless all the key parts are there and fit together \n     perfectly, the airplane will not fly. Thus, many proponents \n     of particular approaches fear that abandoning key components \n     of their proposals to achieve a compromise will prevent a \n     fair test of their favored approach and lead to failure. \n     Another obstacle is that many lawmakers believe that \n     approaches that might conceivably work in one part of the \n     country, given the cultural, philosophical, or health \n     industry conditions prevailing there, will not work in their \n     state or district because of different local conditions. This \n     view leads many in Congress to resist proposals that might \n     work in some areas because they believe that those proposals \n     could make things worse for their constituents.\n       These and other factors have stalled efforts to extend \n     health insurance and achieve other reforms for decades. The \n     enactment of Medicare and Medicaid stands as one notable--and \n     instructive--exception to that pattern. Medicare sprang from \n     comprehensive social insurance initiatives of congressional \n     Democrats, Medicaid from limited needs based approaches of \n     congressional Republicans. The passage of each program was \n     possible only because the two initiatives were linked in the \n     form of a trade-off, not so much by blending some elements of \n     each approach but by moving forward with two programs in \n     parallel: Medicare for the elderly and disabled, and Medicaid \n     for the poor of all ages. That experience illustrates a \n     principle of politics: that progress often requires combining \n     elements of competing proposals into a hybrid legislative \n     initiative, in which internally consistent approaches operate \n     in parallel.\n       In our view, federalism offers a promising approach to the \n     challenge of building support to tackle the problem of \n     uninsurance. While proponents of nationwide measures to \n     introduce health insurance tax credits, or to extend Medicare \n     or the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to \n     other groups, should of course continue to make their case \n     for national policies, we emphasize an initiative designed to \n     support states in launching a variety of localized \n     initiatives. Under this process, the federal government \n     would reward states that agreed to test comprehensive and \n     internally consistent strategies that succeeded in \n     extending coverage within their borders. In contrast to \n     block grants, federal-state covenants would operate within \n     congressionally specified policy constraints designed to \n     achieve national goals for extending health insurance. \n     These covenants would include plans ranging from heavy \n     government regulation to almost none, as long as the plans \n     were consistent with the broad goals and included \n     specified protections. States could also select items from \n     a federally designed ``policy toolbox'' to include in \n     their proposals. Allowable state plans would include forms \n     of single-payer plans, employer mandates, mandatory \n     individual purchase of privately offered insurance, tax \n     credits, and creative new approaches. States would be free \n     not to undertake such experiments and continue with the \n     current array of programs, but sizable financial \n     incentives would be offered to those that chose to \n     experiment and financial rewards given to those that \n     achieve agreed-upon goals.\n       The model we propose builds upon proposals we have outlined \n     elsewhere. It is also compatible with some other federalism \n     approaches, such as the plan advanced by the Institute of \n     Medicine. We favor a wide diversity of federal-state \n     initiatives for three reasons. First, fostering a bold \n     program in a state will produce much information that will \n     aid the policy discovery process. Successes will encourage \n     others to follow, while unanticipated problems will force \n     redesign or abandonment and will be geographically contained. \n     Second, encouraging bold state action will quickly and \n     directly extend coverage to many of the uninsured. Instead of \n     facing continued national inaction or the potential for \n     disruption of state initiatives by future federal action, \n     states would have the incentive and freedom to act \n     decisively. Third, we see no evidence of an emerging \n     consensus on how to deal with these problems at the national \n     level. But our proposal is based on the observation that \n     advocates of rival plans trust their preferred approaches \n     enough to believe that a real-life version would persuade \n     opponents and create a consensus. Not all can be right, of \n     course, but all advocates of health insurance reform, like \n     residents of Lake Wobegon, seem to believe that their plans \n     are above average. Thus, they should be open to the idea of \n     testing diverse proposals. Our proposal is a process to \n     enable policymakers to discover which is right, either for \n     the whole country or for a region.\n\n\n                             Core Elements\n\n       We propose that Congress provide financial assistance and a \n     legal framework to trigger a diverse set of federal-state \n     initiatives. To help break the impasse in Congress over most \n     national approaches, we propose steps designed to enable \n     ``first choice'' political ideas to be tried in limited \n     areas, with the support of states and through the \n     enactment of a federal ``policy toolbox'' of legislated \n     approaches that would be available to states but not \n     imposed on them. Our view is that elected officials would \n     be prepared to authorize some approaches now bottled up in \n     Congress if they knew that the approach would not be \n     imposed on their states. Our proposed strategy would \n     contain six key elements.\n       Goals and protections. First, Congress would set certain \n     goals and general protections. Goals would be established for \n     extending coverage, and perhaps improving the coverage of \n     some of those with inadequate coverage today. One such goal \n     could be a percentage reduction in the number of uninsured \n     people in a state. The more precise the goals, the more \n     contentious they are likely to be. But clear and measurable \n     goals under the proposed covenants are necessary if the \n     system of financial rewards described below is to work \n     effectively.\n       What is ``insurance''? For a coverage goal to mean \n     anything, it would have to define what constitutes \n     ``insurance.'' Specifying adequate coverage in health care is \n     no easier than quantifying an adequate high school education, \n     and when money follows success, drafting such definitions \n     becomes even more difficult.\n       In defining what is meant by adequate insurance, agreement \n     on two characteristics is vital: the services to be covered \n     and the maximum residual costs (deductibles and copayments) \n     that the insured must bear. States could be more generous \n     than these standards. Instead of speciying precisely what \n     states must do in each of these dimensions, we suggest that \n     Congress establish a required actuarial minimum--such as the \n     cost of providing the benefit package of the Federal \n     Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) for the state's \n     population--as the standard, with states retaining \n     considerable latitude on which services to include and how \n     much cost sharing to require. Whether to set this actuarial \n     standard high or low will be controversial and will determine \n     the overall cost to the federal government of eliciting state \n     participation.\n       Both high and low benefit standards suffer from well-known \n     problems. High standards would raise program costs and weaken \n     individuals' incentives to be prudent purchasers of health \n     care. Low standards expose patients to sizable financial risk \n     and raise questions about whether to restrict patients' right \n     to buy supplemental coverage. Thus, federal legislation would \n     not specify the content of insurance plans beyond some such \n     actuarial amount. States would then be free to design plans \n     as they wish, although certain types of plans might be \n     presumptively acceptable (see below), and others could be \n     negotiated as part of a covenant. The exact mix of benefits \n     could vary within reason, but no further limits would be \n     imposed. One goal of this approach, after all, is to \n     encourage experimentation to generate information on whether \n     particular configurations of benefits work better than \n     others. It might turn out, for example, that states would \n     adopt quite different plans with similar actuarial values. \n     One group might opt for high deductible plans covering a wide \n     range of services with no cost sharing above the \n     deductible and generous relief from the deductible for the \n     poor, while others might adopt a system with low \n     deductibles and modest cost sharing but covering a much \n     narrower range of benefits. Discovering how individuals' \n     and providers' attitudes and behavior differ under such \n     plans and how health outcomes vary would provide valuable \n     information for private health insurance planners and \n     government officials.\n       Protections for individuals. In addition to the \n     definitional question, the question also arises, What \n     limitations and protections should be applied to state \n     experiments? If a simple net reduction in uninsurance \n     guaranteed a financial reward to a state, for example, the \n     state would have the incentive to drop coverage of costly \n     high-risk adults and extend coverage to less costly \n     (healthier and younger) workers. Some such concerns could be \n     addressed in negotiating covenants, but some broad \n     protections and policy ``corridors'' would be established \n     under our proposal and would be necessary to achieve \n     political support.\n       One of the most politically sensitive would be a primum non \n     nocere limitation. That is, states could not introduce a plan \n     that reduced coverage for currently insured populations, most \n     notably the Medicaid population, beyond some minimum amount. \n     We believe that no reform proposal is likely to\n\n[[Page S4223]]\n\n     be achievable without that restriction. Most Medicaid outlays \n     in many states are not strictly mandated by federal law, in \n     the sense that some beneficiaries and some services for all \n     beneficiaries are optional. States provide optional coverage \n     because federal law permits it, and the federal match makes \n     its provision attractive to states. If incentives were \n     introduced to cover the non-Medicaid population, states might \n     find it financially and politically attractive to increase \n     the total number of insured people by curtailing Medicaid \n     eligibility and benefits and using the money saved, together \n     with federal support, to cover a larger number of people who \n     are uninsured but less poor.\n       Designing and enforcing rules to prohibit or limit such \n     ``insurance swapping'' would be extremely challenging but \n     politically--and, one could argue, morally--essential. On the \n     other hand, we believe that states should have some \n     opportunity to propose different ways of delivering the \n     Medicaid commitment to the currently insured population, as \n     long as the degree and quality of coverage were not \n     diminished. That form of Medicaid protection could stimulate \n     creativity and improvement in coverage for the poorest \n     citizens while avoiding any threat to their existing \n     coverage. To be sure, there are disagreements, including \n     between us, on the degree of freedom states should have in \n     deciding how to deliver the Medicaid commitment. Positions \n     range from only minor tweaking to sweeping changes in the \n     delivery system, such as allowing states to use Medicaid \n     money to subsidize individual enrollment in an equivalent \n     private plan. The degree of flexibility states should have, \n     while maintaining eligibility and level of coverage, is a \n     difficult political issue for Congress to decide.\n       Acceptable state proposals would also have to limit cost \n     sharing and features analogous to pension nondiscrimination \n     rules. We believe that requirements, consistent with the \n     general goals and protections we propose, are needed to \n     ensure that lower-income households do not face \n     unaffordable coverage. Without such limits, states could \n     reduce the number of uninsured people and secure attendant \n     federal financial support, for example, by instituting an \n     individual mandate with a high premium that would \n     effectively make insurance universal among the financially \n     secure and do little for the poor. States would need to \n     propose a fair, plausible way of meeting the requirement, \n     such as by mandating some form of community rating or \n     through a cross-subsidy to more vulnerable populations.\n       The federal government should establish broad guidelines, \n     but no more. A key principle of our proposal is that state \n     officials are more likely than federal officials to design \n     successful solutions to those problems that members of the \n     policy or congressional staff community have failed to solve. \n     Congress can and should set the parameters, but it should \n     avoid micromanagement.\n       ``Policy toolbox'' of federal policies and programs. A \n     feature of the congressional impasse noted earlier is that \n     many plausible health initiatives that might merit testing, \n     and have support in some states, are blocked by other \n     lawmakers who oppose the introduction of the approach in \n     their own state or across the country. Thus, we propose that \n     Congress enact presumptively legitimate approaches to the \n     expansion of health insurance coverage as a ``policy \n     toolbox'' that would be available to states a la carte to \n     apply within their borders. Lawmakers could safely vote to \n     permit an initiative, confident that it would not be imposed \n     on their states. In this way, potentially useful policies and \n     programs could be ``unlocked'' from Congress and become \n     available for states to use in their own initiatives.\n       A policy toolbox likely would include expansions of \n     existing policies, such as raising income limits under \n     Medicaid or lowering the age of Medicare eligibility. It \n     could include arrangements to subsidize individual buy-ins to \n     the FEHBP, refundable tax credits or their equivalent \n     (perhaps with some steps to modify the federal income tax \n     exclusion for employee-sponsored health insurance costs), \n     mandating employer or individual coverage, or creating a \n     single state insurance plan though which everyone may buy \n     subsidized coverage.\n       Other possible examples might include the following: (1) \n     Remove regulatory and tax obstacles to churches, unions, and \n     other organizations providing group health insurance plans. \n     This could open up new forms of group coverage offered though \n     organizations with an established membership and common \n     values. (2) Allow Medicaid and SCHIP to cover additional \n     populations, with greatly enhanced federal matching payments, \n     and perhaps to operate in very different ways--with \n     appropriate safeguards to protect those who are covered under \n     current law. Both federal welfare legislation and SCHIP, for \n     example, included safeguards to preserve existing Medicaid \n     coverage. (3) Extend limited federal Employee Retirement \n     Income Security Act (ERISA) protection to large corporate \n     health plans willing to enroll nonemployees, and extend the \n     tax exclusion to those enrollees. This could lead in a state \n     to expanded access to comprehensive coverage. (4) Provide \n     a voucher to individuals designed to mimic a comprehensive \n     refundable tax credit for health insurance. This could \n     allow the practical issues of a major tax credit approach \n     to be examined. (5) Enact legislation to make forms of \n     FEHBP-style coverage available to broader populations \n     within states. This would enable states and federal \n     government to explore the issues associated with extending \n     the program to nonfederal employees and retirees. (6) \n     Enable states to establish association plans and other \n     innovative health organizations.\n       We emphasize that any menu of tools would be optional for \n     states. None would be required. Members of Congress would be \n     more likely to agree to the inclusion of elements they would \n     deplore in their own states if they knew that no state, \n     including their own, would be forced to adopt them than they \n     would be in a nationally uniform system. Some lawmakers, for \n     instance, oppose association plans be cause they believe that \n     such plans would disrupt successful state insurance \n     arrangements. Under the menu approach, association plans \n     would be introduced only in states wishing to use them as \n     part of their overall strategy.\n       State proposals, federal approval. Under our proposed \n     strategy, states interested in a bold, creative initiative \n     would design a proposal consistent with the goals and \n     restrictions established by Congress. Typically this proposal \n     would include some elements from the federal policy toolbox \n     in conjunction with state initiatives.\n       Needless to say, a critical congressional decision would \n     concern mechanisms for approving state plans and monitoring \n     state performance. States would no doubt seek to take \n     advantage of every financial opportunity to game the system \n     and to stretch agreements to the limit, as the almost zany \n     history of the Medicaid upper payment level (UPL) controversy \n     makes painfully clear. Yet monitoring state behavior, \n     determining state violations, and enforcing penalties on \n     states is enormously difficult. Moreover, the entity could \n     (and we think should) have the power to negotiate parts of a \n     proposal, not merely approve or reject it, so that \n     refinements could be made consistent with Congress's \n     objectives.\n       But what entity should this be? It might seem natural to \n     designate an executive agency that reports to the president, \n     such as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). We \n     suspect, however, that many members of Congress would refuse \n     to cede so much selection authority to another branch of \n     government and that roughly half would fear partisan \n     decisions by an administration of the ``other'' party. \n     Congress would likely insist on adding suffocating selection \n     criteria and other restrictions to executive department \n     decisions, jeopardizing the very creativity we intend. Thus, \n     we favor instead an existing or newly created body that has \n     independence but ultimately answers to Congress. A new \n     bipartisan body might perform this function with members \n     selected by Congress and the administration or with members \n     also representing the states, with technical advice from the \n     U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO). This body would \n     evaluate and negotiate draft state proposals according to the \n     general requirements specified by Congress and then present a \n     recommended ``slate'' of proposals to Congress for an up-\n     or-down vote without amendment. Once the state proposals \n     had been selected, HHS would be responsible for \n     implementing the program.\n       Bipartisan willingness to authorize state programs and to \n     appropriate sufficient funds to elicit state participation \n     also requires that members of Congress believe that \n     approaches they find congenial will receive a fair trial and \n     agree that approaches they reject will also receive a fair \n     trial. Unfortunately, current federal legislation makes two \n     key approaches difficult to implement in individual states or \n     even groups of states: a single-payer plan and an individual \n     mandate combined with refundable tax credits. A federalist \n     approach should include mechanisms that would enable states \n     to give such proposals as fair and complete a test as \n     possible, both because that would provide valuable \n     information and because the political support of their \n     advocates is important in Congress.\n       Crafting a single-payer experiment. ERISA, which exempts \n     self-insured plans from state regulation, is the primary \n     technical obstacle to testing single-payer plans. The \n     political sensitivity to modifications in ERISA is difficult \n     to exaggerate. Any attempt to carve out an exception from \n     ERISA for state programs to extend cover age would probably \n     doom federal legislation. But states could create ``wrap \n     around'' plans to cover all who are not currently insured, or \n     even to cover all who are not insured under plans exempted by \n     ERISA from state regulation. While such an arrangement would \n     not be a single-payer plan, it could achieve universal \n     coverage, which is one defining characteristic of single-\n     payer plans, and arguably be sufficient for a valid test. \n     After all, the U.S. health care system is characterized by \n     different subsystems for certain populations and has a form \n     of single-payer coverage for military veterans. But of course \n     the real test is whether advocates of single-payer plans \n     regard such a limited arrangement as a fair trial.\n       An individual tax credit approach. The obstacles to a state \n     level individual mandate with a refundable credit are also \n     serious and complicated. We presume that an individual \n     mandate would require some contribution from people with \n     incomes above defined levels. Such a mandate raises both \n     political and practical questions. Testing federal tax reform \n     in selected geographic areas also raises constitutional and \n     practical issues, although advocates of the approach maintain \n     that other site-specific programs involving federal tax \n     changes, such as enterprise zones,\n\n[[Page S4224]]\n\n     have passed muster. In addition, for a limited experiment it \n     might be possible to design subsidy programs that would mimic \n     tax relief.\n       Administering a refundable tax credit would pose formidable \n     difficulties for some states, particularly those that do not \n     have a personal income tax. In all states, the logistics of \n     providing a credit with reasonable accuracy on a timely basis \n     would be challenging. So, too, would deciding how to address \n     such administrative problems as households that live in one \n     state yet work in another. Advocates for tax credits say they \n     have solutions to these and similar challenges, just as \n     supporters of single-payer approaches or employer mandates \n     claim to have answers to challenges facing those approaches. \n     For instance, some maintain that the employment-based tax \n     withholding system could serve as a vehicle for refundable \n     credits or equivalent subsidies and would make individual \n     enrollment practical. Whether or not they are right is of \n     course disputed by their critics. The beauty of a ``put up \n     or shut up'' federalism initiative is that it offers a \n     chance for advocates to offer such solutions in practice \n     instead of in theory.\n       Using ``managed federalism'' to build support? Deciding how \n     many states could qualify for experiments is an open \n     political and technical question. One approach would be to \n     limit it to a few states. This would limit costs but has \n     little else to be said for it. Accordingly, we would favor \n     opening the program to all states wishing to accept a federal \n     offer. Nevertheless, we recognize that some lawmakers would \n     be reluctant to vote for a process of federal-state \n     innovation unless they were sure that certain ``generic'' or \n     ``standard'' approaches were included--especially if the \n     number of states in the program were to be limited. In \n     particular, we believe that our proposal can win \n     congressional support only if liberals and conservatives \n     alike are fully convinced that the approaches each holds dear \n     will receive a fair and full trial in practice.\n       While we believe that any state initiative that meets \n     approval should be welcomed, political considerations thus \n     might require that no state's proposal would be approved \n     unless a sufficient range of acceptable variants was \n     proposed. For example, strong advocates of market-based or \n     single-payer approaches might find the federalism option \n     acceptable only if each was confident that favored approaches \n     would be tested.\n       Adequate data collection. To determine whether a state was \n     actually making progress toward a goal, accurate and timely \n     data would be needed. These data would include surveys of \n     insurance coverage, with sufficient detail to provide state-\n     level estimates. Such surveys would be essential to show \n     whether the states were making progress in extending health \n     insurance coverage. They are vital to the success of the \n     whole approach because payments to states (apart from modest \n     planning assistance) should be based on actual progress in \n     extending coverage, not on compliance with procedural \n     milestones.\n       Congress should also assure that states report on use of \n     health services, costs, health status, and any other \n     information deemed necessary to judge the relative success of \n     various approaches to extending coverage. Only a national \n     effort could ensure that data are comparable across states. \n     States' cooperation with data collection would be one element \n     of the determination of whether a state was in compliance \n     with its covenant and was therefore eligible for full \n     incentive payments. The experience with state waivers under \n     welfare before enactment of the 1996 welfare reform clearly \n     illustrates the power and importance of such data collection. \n     The cumulative effect of the reports showing the \n     effectiveness of welfare-to-work requirements in reducing \n     rolls, increasing earnings, and raising recipients' \n     satisfaction transformed the political environment and made \n     welfare reform inescapable.\n       Rewarding progress. Congress would design a formula under \n     which states would be rewarded for their progress in meeting \n     the agreed federal-state goals of extending insurance \n     coverage. As experience with countless grant programs \n     attests, haggling over such formulas can become politics at \n     its grubbiest, with elected officials voting solely on the \n     basis of what a particular formula does for their districts. \n     Even without political parochialism, designing a formula that \n     rewards progress fairly is no easy task. For one thing, \n     states will be starting from quite different places. The \n     proportion of states' uninsured populations under age sixty-\n     five during 1997-1999 ranged from 27.7 percent in New Mexico \n     and 26.8 percent in Texas to 9.6 percent in Rhode Island and \n     10.5 percent in Minnesota and Hawaii. Designing an incentive \n     formula to reward progress amid such diverse conditions is \n     both an analytical and a political challenge. Moreover, the \n     per capita cost of health care varies across the nation, \n     which further complicates the assessment of progress. The \n     cost of extending coverage depends on the geographic \n     location, income, and health status of the uninsured \n     population. Having financial access may be hollow in \n     communities where services are physically unavailable or \n     highly limited. Extending coverage may require supply-side \n     measures to supplement financial access.\n       We believe that the only way to design such a formula is to \n     remove the detailed design decisions from congressional \n     micromanagement. We suggest that Congress be asked to adopt \n     the domestic equivalent of ``fast-track'' trade negotiation \n     rules or base-closing legislation. Under this arrangement, \n     Congress would designate a body appointed in equal numbers by \n     the two parties, to design an incentive formula that Congress \n     would agree to vote up or down, without amendments. Such a \n     formula would have to recognize the different positions from \n     which various states would start. Any acceptable formula \n     would have to reward both absolute and relative reductions in \n     the proportions of uninsured people. Whether financial \n     incentives would be offered for other dimensions of \n     performance and how performance would be measured constitute \n     additional important challenges.\n       Sources of funding. Bleak budget prospects could cause one \n     to give up on this or any other attempt to extend health \n     insurance coverage broadly. But as recent history amply \n     illustrates, the political and budgetary weather can change \n     dramatically and with little notice. What funding approach \n     would be desirable if funds were available? Under our \n     proposal, the federal funding would be intended for several \n     broad purposes: (1) A large portion of the money would be \n     used to help states actually fund approaches to be tested. \n     (2) Some funding (perhaps with assistance from private \n     foundations) would provide national support and technical \n     assistance to states. A model to consider for such support is \n     the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) State \n     Planning Grants program, which both funds state planning \n     activities and provides federal support and technical \n     assistance. (3) Some funds would cover the cost of \n     independent performance monitoring. (4) Some funds would be \n     set aside to reward states for meeting the goals in their \n     agreed-upon plan. Congress might consider an automatic \n     ``performance bonus'' system similar to the mechanism used \n     in welfare reform. Congress could also consider \n     withholding the periodic release of part of a state's \n     grant pending a periodic assessment by the independent \n     monitor of the degree to which the state is accomplishing \n     the objectives specified in its covenant. Only those \n     states willing to offer proposals designed to achieve the \n     national goals would be eligible for a share of the \n     funding or for the menu of federal policy tools. A state \n     could decline to offer a proposal and remain under current \n     programs.\n       Federalism enables the states to undertake innovative \n     approaches to challenges facing the United States. Federal \n     legislation often grants states broad discretion in designing \n     even those programs for which the federal government bears \n     much or most of the cost. In health care as well as education \n     or welfare, states have been the primary innovators. But the \n     federal government limits, shapes, and facilitates such \n     innovation through regulation, taxation, and grants. Such a \n     partnership is bound to be marked by conflict and tension as \n     state and federal interests diverge.\n       A creative federalism approach of the kind we propose would \n     change the dynamics of discovering better ways to expand \n     insurance coverage, just as a version of this approach \n     triggered a radical change in the way states addressed \n     welfare dependency. By actually testing competing approaches \n     to reach common goals, rather than endlessly debating them, \n     the United States is far more likely to find the solution to \n     the perplexing and seemingly intractable problem of \n     uninsurance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/09/senate-section/article/S4213-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4213-S4224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 2765. A bill to provide assistance to improve the health of \nnewborns, children, and mothers in developing countries, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, on behalf of myself and my \nfriend, Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon, the Child Health Investment for \nLong-term Development (CHILD and Newborn) Act of 2006. This legislation \nwould perform four simple, yet critically important functions.\n  First, it would require the Administration to develop and implement a \nstrategy to improve the health of, and reduce mortality rates among, \nnewborns, children, and mothers in developing countries.\n  Second, it would mandate the establishment of a U.S. Government task \nforce to assess, monitor, and evaluate the progress of U.S. efforts to \nmeet the United Nations Millennium Development Goals by 2015--\nspecifically as those goals relate to reducing mortality rates for \nmothers and for children less than 5 years of age in developing \ncountries.\n  Third, it would authorize the President to furnish assistance for \nprograms whose goal is to improve the health of newborns, children, and \nmothers in developing countries.\n  And fourth, this legislation would authorize appropriations to carry \nout its provisions--$660 million for fiscal year 2007, and $1.2 billion \nfor each of fiscal years 2008-2011.\n  I know that some of my colleagues will look at this bill and ask why \nthe U.S. should devote such large amounts of resources to combating \nchild and maternal mortality in the developing world. Certainly, nobody \nwould deny that it's an important cause, but should it really be this \nmuch of a priority?\n  I would argue that the answer to this is yes. Why? Because with U.S. \nleadership, the current reality for mothers and their young children in \nthe developing world can be changed dramatically.\n  What is that reality?\n  Almost 11 million children under the age of 5 die every year in the \ndeveloping world--that's approximately 30,000 each day. About four \nmillion of those children die in their first four weeks of life. In \nmany cases, they aren't even provided with a fighting chance. Indeed, \nfor children under the age of five in the developing world, preventable \nor treatable diseases such as measles, tetanus, diarrhea, pneumonia, \nand malaria are the most common causes of death.\n  Each year, more than 525,000 women die from causes related to \npregnancy and childbirth--more than 1,400 each day. Ninety-nine percent \nof these deaths occur in the developing world. And the lifetime risk of \nan African woman dying from a pregnancy or childbirth-related \ncomplication is I in 16, a high level of risk that is all the more \nstriking when compared to the same risk for women in more developed \nregions--1 in 2,800. Some of the most common risk factors for maternal \ndeath in developing countries include early pregnancy and childbirth, \nclosely spaced births, infectious diseases, malnutrition, and \ncomplications during childbirth.\n\n  Mr. President, the deaths of these nearly 12 million mothers and \nchildren are from largely preventable causes. This is a tragic \nsituation, and it shouldn't be the case.\n  Luckily, we can combat these high levels of mortality--and it won't \nrequire lots of sophisticated technology. Instead, it will require \nsimple measures that we take for granted here in the developed world.\n  For instance, it is estimated that two-thirds of deaths among \nchildren under 5 years of age--that's 7.1 million children, including 3 \nmillion newborns--could be prevented by low-cost, low-tech health and \nnutritional interventions. These interventions include encouraging \nbreastfeeding; providing vitamin supplements, immunizations, and \nantibiotics; offering oral rehydration therapy with clean water; and \nexpansion of basic clinical care.\n  For expecting mothers, simple steps such as birth spacing, access to \npreventive care, skilled birth attendants, and emergency obstetric care \ncan help reduce maternal morality rates. And keeping mothers healthy is \ncritical because the welfare of newborns and infants is inextricably \ntied to the health of the mother.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. isn't new at this battle. Over the past 30 \nyears, our work in promoting child survival and maternal health \nglobally has resulted in millions of lives being saved.\n  And in 2000, the U.S. joined 188 other countries in supporting eight \nMillennium Development Goals laid out by the United Nations. Two of \nthese goals are related to child and maternal health--one calls for a \nreduction by two-thirds in the mortality rate of children under 5, and \nthe other calls for a reduction in maternal deaths by three-quarters. \nBoth of these goals are targeted to be met by 2015.\n  But with current structures and at current funding levels, the world \nis unlikely to meet these laudable goals. Certainly, the U.S. can't \nmeet these global needs alone. Addressing this critical issue can't be \na unilateral effort--countries around the world must also do their part \nand come forward with much-needed funding.\n  But passing the CHILD and Newborn Act of 2006 would send a strong \nmessage to the international community that this is a priority issue, \nand it would encourage them to step up to the plate. Millions of lives \ncould be saved in the process.\n  On September 14, 2005, President Bush stated that the U.S. is \n``committed to the Millennium Development Goals.'' I commend the \nPresident for his words. But now, it is time for Congress to stand up \nand make sure that the U.S. fulfills this commitment to protect \nmillions of innocent women and their children around the globe. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2765\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Health Investment for \n     Long-term Development (CHILD and Newborn) Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Around the world, approximately 10.8 million children \n     under the age of five die each year, more than 30,000 per \n     day, almost all in the developing world.\n       (2) Each year in the developing world, four million \n     newborns die in their first four weeks of life.\n\n[[Page S4214]]\n\n       (3) Sub-Saharan Africa, with only 10 percent of the world's \n     population, accounts for 43 percent of all deaths among \n     children under the age of five.\n       (4) Countries such as Afghanistan, Angola and Niger \n     experience extreme levels of child mortality, with 25 percent \n     of children dying before their fifth birthday.\n       (5) For children under the age of five in the developing \n     world, preventable or treatable diseases, such as measles, \n     tetanus, diarrhea, pneumonia, and malaria, are the most \n     common causes of death.\n       (6) Throughout the developing world, the lack of basic \n     health services, clean water, adequate sanitation, and proper \n     nutrition contribute significantly to child mortality.\n       (7) Hunger and malnutrition contribute to over five million \n     child deaths annually.\n       (8) The lack of low-cost antibiotics and anti-malarial \n     drugs contribute to three million child deaths each year.\n       (9) Lack of access to health services results in 30 million \n     children under the age of one year going without necessary \n     immunizations.\n       (10) Every year an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 vitamin A-\n     deficient children become blind, with one-half of such \n     children dying within 12 months of losing their sight.\n       (11) Iron deficiency, affecting over 30 percent of the \n     world's population, causes premature birth, low birth weight, \n     and infections, elevating the risk of death in children.\n       (12) Two-thirds of deaths of children under five years of \n     age, or 7.1 million children, including three million newborn \n     deaths, could be prevented by low-cost, low-tech health and \n     nutritional interventions.\n       (13) Exclusive breastfeeding--giving only breast milk for \n     the first six months of life--could prevent an estimated 1.3 \n     million newborn and infant deaths each year, primarily by \n     protecting against diarrhea and pneumonia.\n       (14) An additional two million lives could be saved \n     annually by providing oral-rehydration therapy prepared with \n     clean water.\n       (15) During the 1990s, successful immunization programs \n     reduced polio by 99 percent, tetanus deaths by 50 percent, \n     and measles cases by 40 percent.\n       (16) Between 1998 and 2000, distribution of low-cost \n     vitamin A supplements saved an estimated one million lives.\n       (17) Expansion of clinical care of newborns and mothers, \n     such as clean delivery by skilled attendants, emergency \n     obstetric care, and neonatal resuscitation, can avert 50 \n     percent of newborn deaths.\n       (18) Keeping mothers healthy is essential for child \n     survival because illness, complications, or maternal death \n     during or following pregnancy increases the risk for death in \n     newborns and infants.\n       (19) Each year more than 525,000 women die from causes \n     related to pregnancy and childbirth, with 99 percent of these \n     deaths occurring in developing countries.\n       (20) The lifetime risk of an African woman dying from a \n     complication related to pregnancy or childbirth is 1 in 16, \n     while the same risk for a woman in a developed country is 1 \n     in 2,800.\n       (21) Risk factors for maternal death in developing \n     countries include early pregnancy and childbirth, closely \n     spaced births, infectious diseases, malnutrition, and \n     complications during childbirth.\n       (22) Birth spacing, access to preventive care, skilled \n     birth attendants, and emergency obstetric care can help \n     reduce maternal mortality.\n       (23) The role of the United States in promoting child \n     survival and maternal health over the past three decades has \n     resulted in millions of lives being saved around the world.\n       (24) In 2000, the United States joined 188 other countries \n     in supporting eight Millennium Development Goals designed to \n     achieve ``a more peaceful, prosperous and just world''.\n       (25) Two of the Millennium Development Goals call for a \n     reduction in the mortality rate of children under the age of \n     five by two-thirds and a reduction in maternal deaths by \n     three-quarters by 2015.\n       (26) On September 14, 2005, President George W. Bush stated \n     before the leaders of the world: ``To spread a vision of \n     hope, the United States is determined to help nations that \n     are struggling with poverty. We are committed to the \n     Millennium Development Goals.''.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) authorize assistance to improve the health of newborns, \n     children, and mothers in developing countries, including by \n     strengthening the capacity of health systems and health \n     workers;\n       (2) develop and implement a strategy to improve the health \n     of newborns, children, and mothers, including reducing child \n     and maternal mortality, in developing countries;\n       (3) to establish a task force to assess, monitor, and \n     evaluate the progress and contributions of relevant \n     departments and agencies of the Government of the United \n     States in achieving the United Nations Millennium Development \n     Goals by 2015 for reducing the mortality of children under \n     the age of five by two-thirds and reducing maternal mortality \n     by three-quarters in developing countries.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for innovation in health care through \nState initiatives that expand coverage and access and improve quality \nand efficiency in the health care system; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a bill my \ncolleague Senator Bingaman and I introduced today, the Health Care \nPartnership Act. For too many years, I have listened to my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle talk about the rising cost of health care \nand the growing number of uninsured Americans. Yet, we have not been \nable to make much progress here at the Federal level to find a \nmeaningful solution for the dilemma this Nation is facing regarding \naccess to quality, affordable health care. Next to the economy, it is \nthe greatest domestic challenge facing our Nation. In fact, the rising \ncost of health care is a major part of what is hurting our \ncompetitiveness in the global marketplace.\n  While surveys have indicated that health insurance premiums have \nstabilized--a 9.2 percent increase in 2006 and 2005 and compared with a \n12.3 percent in 2004; 14.7 percent in 2003; and 15.2 percent in 2002--\nhealth insurance costs continue to be a significant factor impacting \nAmerican competitiveness. In addition, the share of costs that \nindividuals have paid for employer sponsored insurance has risen \nroughly 2 percent each year, from 31.4 percent of health care costs in \n2001 to 38.4 percent this year.\n  In fact, spending on health care in the United States reached $1.9 \ntrillion in 2004--almost 16.5 percent of our GDP--the largest share \never.\n  Yet, despite all the increases in health care spending some 46 \nmillion Americans--15 percent of the population--had no health \ninsurance at some point last year. This number has increased steadily. \nIn 2000, that number was 39.8 million. In 2002 it was 43.6 million.\n  These statistics are startling and it is time that we do something \nabout them. The bill Senator Bingaman and I are introducing today aims \nto break the log-jam here in Washington and\n\n[[Page S4216]]\n\nallow states the freedom to explore with health care reform options. \nThis bill would support state-based efforts to reduce the uninsured and \nthe cost of health care, improve quality, improve access to care, and \nexpand information technology.\n  I have been in this situation before. As Governor of Ohio, I had to \nwork creatively to expand coverage and deal with increasing health care \ncosts for a growing number of uninsured Ohioans. I am happy to report \nthat we were able to make some progress toward reducing the number of \nuninsured Ohioans during my time as the head of the state by \nnegotiating with the state unions to move to managed care; by \ncontrolling Medicaid costs to the point where from 1995 to 1998, due to \ngood stewardship and management, Ohio ended up under-spending on \nMedicaid without harming families; and implementing the S-CHIP program \nto provide coverage for uninsured children.\n  Like we did in Ohio, a number of states are already actively pursuing \nefforts to reduce the number of their residents who lack adequate \nhealth care coverage. The Health Care Partnership Act will build on \nwhat states like Massachusetts and others are doing, while providing a \nmechanism to analyze results and make recommendations for future action \nat the Federal level.\n  Under the Health Partnership Act, Congress would authorize grants to \nindividual states, groups of states, and Indian tribes and local \ngovernments to carry out any of a broad range of strategies to improve \nour Nation's health care delivery. The bill creates a mechanism for \nstates to apply for grants to a bipartisan ``State Health Innovation \nCommission'' housed at the Department of Health and Human Services \n(HHS). After reviewing the state proposals, the Commission would submit \nto Congress a list of recommended state applications. The Commission \nwould also recommend the amount of Federal grant money each state \nshould receive to carry out the actions described in their plan.\n  Most importantly, at the end of the five-year period, the Commission \nwould be required to report to Congress whether the states are meeting \nthe goals of the Act. The Commission would then recommend future action \nCongress should take concerning overall reform, including whether or \nnot to extend the state program.\n  I believe it is important that we pass this legislation to provide a \nplatform from which we can have a thoughtful conversation about health \ncare reform here in Washington. Since I have been in the Senate, \nCongress has made some progress toward improving health care, most \nnotably for our 43 million seniors who now have access to affordable \nprescription medication through the Medicare Modernization Act. We have \nalso increased funding for community health centers and safety net \nhospitals that provide health care for the uninsured and under insured; \nincreased the use of technology in our health care delivery system; and \nimproved the safety of medical care by passing a medical errors \nreporting bill.\n  Yet, these incremental steps are not enough, and we have been at this \ntoo long here in Washington without comprehensive, meaningful results. \nI ask for my colleagues' support for this bipartisan bill that I hope \nwill move us closer toward a solution to the uninsured.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2772\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be \n     construed to include the approval of State proposals that \n     involve waivers or modifications in applicable Federal law.\n       (5) Program or project period.--A State program or project \n     may be approved for a period of 5 years and may be extended \n     for subsequent 5-year periods upon approval by the Commission \n     and the Secretary, based upon achievement of targets, except \n     that a shorter period may be requested by a State and granted \n     by the Secretary.\n       (e) Expedited Congressional Consideration.--\n       (1) Introduction and Committee Consideration.--\n       (A) Introduction.--The legislative proposal submitted \n     pursuant to subsection (d)(4)(B) shall be in the form of a \n     joint resolution (in this subsection referred to as the \n     ``resolution''). Such resolution shall be introduced in the \n     House of Representatives by the Speaker, and in the Senate, \n     by the Majority Leader, immediately upon receipt of the \n     language and shall be referred to the appropriate committee \n     of Congress. If the resolution is not introduced in \n     accordance with the preceding sentence, the resolution may be \n     introduced in either House of Congress by any member thereof.\n       (B) Committee consideration.--A resolution introduced in \n     the House of Representatives shall be referred to the \n     Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives. \n     A resolution introduced in the Senate shall be referred to \n     the Committee on Finance of the Senate. Not later than 15 \n     calendar days after the introduction of the resolution, the \n     committee of Congress to which the resolution was referred \n     shall report the resolution or a committee amendment thereto. \n     If the committee has not reported such resolution (or an \n     identical resolution) at the end of 15 calendar days after \n     its introduction or at the end of the first day after there \n     has been reported to the House involved a resolution, \n     whichever is earlier, such committee shall be deemed to be \n     discharged from further consideration of such reform bill and \n     such reform bill shall be placed on the appropriate calendar \n     of the House involved.\n       (2) Expedited Procedure.--\n       (A) Consideration.--Not later than 5 days after the date on \n     which a committee has been discharged from consideration of a \n     resolution, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, or \n     the Speaker's designee, or the Majority Leader of the Senate, \n     or the Leader's designee, shall move to proceed to the \n     consideration of the committee amendment to the resolution, \n     and if there is no such amendment, to the resolution. It \n     shall also be in order for any member of the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate, respectively, to move to \n     proceed to the consideration of the resolution at any time \n     after the conclusion of such 5-day period. All points of \n     order against the resolution (and against consideration of \n     the resolution) are waived. A motion to proceed to the \n     consideration of the resolution is highly privileged in the \n     House of Representatives and is privileged in the Senate and \n     is not debatable. The motion is not subject to amendment, to \n     a motion to postpone consideration of the resolution, or to a \n     motion to proceed to the consideration of other business. A \n     motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion to proceed \n     is agreed to or not agreed to shall not be in order. If the \n     motion to proceed is agreed to, the House of Representatives \n     or the Senate, as the case may be, shall immediately proceed \n     to consideration of the resolution without intervening \n     motion, order, or other business, and the resolution shall \n     remain the unfinished business of the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate, as the case may be, until \n     disposed of.\n       (B) Consideration by other house.--If, before the passage \n     by one House of the resolution that was introduced in such \n     House, such House receives from the other House a resolution \n     as passed by such other House--\n       (i) the resolution of the other House shall not be referred \n     to a committee and may only be considered for final passage \n     in the House that receives it under clause (iii);\n       (ii) the procedure in the House in receipt of the \n     resolution of the other House, with respect to the resolution \n     that was introduced in the House in receipt of the resolution \n     of the other House, shall be the same as if no resolution had \n     been received from the other House; and\n       (iii) notwithstanding clause (ii), the vote on final \n     passage shall be on the reform bill of the other House.\n     Upon disposition of a resolution that is received by one \n     House from the other House, it shall no longer be in order to \n     consider the resolution bill that was introduced in the \n     receiving House.\n       (C) Consideration in conference.--Immediately upon a final \n     passage of the resolution that results in a disagreement \n     between the two Houses of Congress with respect to the \n     resolution, conferees shall be appointed and a conference \n     convened. Not later than 10 days after the date on which \n     conferees are appointed, the conferees shall file a report \n     with the House of Representatives and the Senate resolving \n     the differences between the Houses on the resolution. \n     Notwithstanding any other rule of the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate, it shall be in order to \n     immediately consider a report of a committee of conference on \n     the resolution filed in accordance with this subclause. \n     Debate in the House of Representatives and the Senate on the \n     conference report shall be limited to 10 hours, equally \n     divided and controlled by the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the Minority Leader of the House of \n     Representatives or their designees and the Majority and \n     Minority Leaders of the Senate or their designees. A vote on \n     final passage of the conference report shall occur \n     immediately at the conclusion or yielding back of all time \n     for debate on the conference report.\n       (3) Rules of the senate and house of representatives.--This \n     subsection is enacted by Congress--\n       (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives, respectively, and is deemed to \n     be part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n     applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed \n     in that House in the case of a resolution, and it supersedes \n     other rules only to the extent that it is inconsistent with \n     such rules; and\n       (B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as they relate to \n     the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, \n     and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of \n     that House.\n       (4) Limitation.--The amount of Federal funds provided with \n     respect to any State proposal that is deemed approved under \n     subsection (d)(3) shall not exceed the cost provided for such \n     proposals within the concurrent resolution on the budget as \n     enacted by Congress for the fiscal year involved.\n       (f) Funding.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall provide a grant to a \n     State that has an application approved under subsection (b) \n     to enable such State to carry out an innovative State health \n     program in the State.\n       (2) Amount of grant.--The amount of a grant provided to a \n     State under paragraph (1) shall be determined based upon the \n     recommendations of the Commission, subject to the amount \n     appropriated under subsection (k).\n       (3) Performance-based funding allocation and \n     prioritization.--In awarding grants under paragraph (1), the \n     Secretary shall--\n       (A) fund a diversity of approaches as provided for by the \n     Commission in subsection (c)(1)(B);\n       (B) give priority to those State programs that the \n     Commission determines have the greatest opportunity to \n     succeed in providing expanded health insurance coverage and \n     in providing children, youth, and other vulnerable \n     populations with improved access to health care items and \n     services; and\n       (C) link allocations to the State to the meeting of the \n     goals and performance measures relating to health care \n     coverage, quality, and health care costs established under \n     this Act through the State project application process.\n       (4) Maintenance of effort.--A State, in utilizing the \n     proceeds of a grant received under paragraph (1), shall \n     maintain the expenditures of the State for health care \n     coverage purposes for the support of direct health care \n     delivery at a level equal to not less than the level of such \n     expenditures maintained by the State for the fiscal year \n     preceding the fiscal year for which the grant is received.\n       (5) Report.--At the end of the 5-year period beginning on \n     the date on which the Secretary awards the first grant under \n     paragraph (1), the State Health Innovation Advisory \n     Commission established under subsection (c) shall prepare and \n     submit to the appropriate committees of Congress, a report on \n     the progress made by States receiving grants under paragraph \n     (1) in meeting the goals of expanded coverage, improved \n     quality, and cost containment through performance measures \n     established during the 5-year period of the grant.

Amounts appropriated \n     for a fiscal year under this subsection and not expended may \n     be used in subsequent fiscal years to carry out this section.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am pleased to announce today the introduction of \nbipartisan legislation with Senator Voinovich entitled the ``Health \nPartnership Act of 2006'' with additional bipartisan support from \nSenators DeWine and Akaka. The ``Health Partnership Act'' is intended \nto move beyond the political gridlock in Washington, D.C., and set us \non a path toward finding solutions to affordable, quality health care \nfor all Americans by creating partnerships between the federal \ngovernment, state and local governments, private payers, and health \ncare providers to implement different and promising approaches to \nhealth care.\n  Federal funding and support would be committed to states to reduce \nthe number of uninsured, reduce costs, and improve the quality of \nhealth care for all Americans. Should a state decline to apply or if a \nunique need exists, local governments also would be authorized to apply \nfor a federal grant for such purposes.\n  States, local governments, and tribes and tribal governments would be \nable to submit applications to the federal government for funding to \nimplement a state health care expansion and improvement program to a \nbipartisan ``State Health Innovation Commission.'' Based on funding \navailable through the federal budget process, the Commission would \napprove a variety of reform options and innovative approaches.\n  This federalist approach to health reform would encourage a broad \narray of reform options that would be closely monitored to see what is \nworking and what is not. As Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis \nwrote in 1932, ``It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system \nthat a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a \nlaboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk \nto the rest of the country.''\n  Our bipartisan legislation, the ``Health Partnership Act,'' \nencourages this type of state-based innovation and will help the nation \nbetter address both the policy and the politics of health care reform. \nWe do not have consensus at the federal level on anyone approach and so \nencouraging states to adopt a variety of approaches will help us all \nbetter understand what may or may not work. And, it is well past the \ntime when we need action to be taking place to address the growing and \nrelated problems of the uninsured and increasing health care costs.\n  In fact, spending on health care in our country has now reached $2 \ntrillion annually, and yet, the number of uninsured has increased to 46 \nmillion people, which is six million more than in 2000. The \nconsequences are staggering, as uninsured citizens get about half the \nmedical care they need compared to those with health insurance and, \naccording to the Institute of Medicine, about 18,000 unnecessary deaths \noccur each year in the United States because of lack of health \nInsurance.\n  While gridlock absent a solution continues to permeate Washington, \nDC, a number of states and local governments are moving ahead with \nhealth reform. The premise on which this bill is based is that the \nfederal government should provide support for such efforts rather than \nconstantly undermining them.\n  The ``Health Partnership Act'' would provide such support, as it \nauthorizes grants to states, groups of states, local governments, and \nIndian tribes and organizations to carry out any of a broad range of \nstrategies to reach the goals\n\n[[Page S4220]]\n\nof reducing the number of uninsured, reducing costs, and improving the \nquality of care.\n  As usual, state and local governments are not waiting around for \nfederal action. This is exactly what was happening in the early 1990s \nas states such as New Mexico, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Florida, \nRhode Island, Hawaii, Maryland, Tennessee, Vermont, and Washington led \nthe way to expanding coverage to children through the enactment of a \nvariety of health reforms. Some of these programs worked better than \nothers and the federal government responded in 1997 with passage of the \n``State Children's Health Insurance Program'' or SCHIP. This \nlegislation received broad bipartisan support and was built upon the \nexperience of the state expansions. SCHIP continues to be a state-based \nmodel that covers millions of children and continues to have broad-\nbased bipartisan support across this nation.\n  So, why not use that successful model and build upon it? In fact, \nstate and local governments are already taking up that challenge and \nthe federal government should, through the enactment of the ``Health \nPartnership Act,'' do what it can to be helpful with those efforts. For \nexample--\n  On November 15, 2005, Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich signed into \nlaw the ``Covering All Kids Health Insurance Act'' which, beginning in \nJuly 2006, will attempt to make insurance coverage available to all \nuninsured children.\n  In Massachusetts, Governor Mitt Romney recently signed into law \nlegislation that requires all Bay State residents to have health \ninsurance. Virtually everyone interested in solutions to our nation's \nhealth care problems are looking at the Massachusetts ``experiment'' as \na possible solution.\n  Other states, including New Mexico, Maine, West Virginia, Oklahoma, \nand New York have enacted other health reforms that have had mixed \nsuccess.\n  All of these efforts are very important to add to our knowledge base, \nwhich can then lead to the formation of a possible national solution to \nour uninsured and affordability crisis. We can learn from each and \nevery one of these efforts, whether successful or failed.\n  Commonwealth Fund President Karen Davis said it well by noting that \nstate-based reforms, such as that passed in Massachusetts, are very \ngood news. As she notes, ``First, any substantive effort to expand \naccess to coverage is worthwhile, given the growing number of uninsured \nin this country and the large body of evidence showing the dangerous \nhealth implications of lacking coverage.''\n  She adds, ``But something more important is at work here, While we \nurgently need a national solution so that all Americans have insurance, \nit doesn't appear that we'll be getting one at the federal level any \ntime soon. So what Massachusetts has done potentially holds lessons for \nevery state.'' I would add that it holds lessons for the federal \ngovernment as well and not just for the mechanics of implementing \nhealth reform policy but also to the politics of health reform.\n  As she concludes, ``One particularly cogent lesson is the manner in \nwhich the measure was crafted--via a civil process that successfully \nbrought together numerous players from across the political business, \nhealth care delivery, and policy sectors.''\n  Mr. President, Senator Voinovich and I have worked together for many \nmonths now on this legislation via a process much like that described \nby Karen Davis. The legislation stems from past legislative efforts by \nsenators such as Bob Graham, Mark Hatfield, and Paul Wellstone, but \nalso from work across ideological lines by Henry Aaron of the Brookings \nInstitute and Stuart Butler of the Heritage Foundation.\n  The legislation also received much advice and support from Dr. Tim \nGarson who, as Dean of the University of Virginia, brought a much \nneeded provider perspective which is reflected in support for the \nlegislation from the American Medical Association, the American Academy \nof Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians, the American College \nof Cardiology, American Gastroenterological Association, the Visiting \nNurses Association, the National Association of Community Health \nCenters, and from state-based health providers such as the New Mexico \nMedical Society and Ohio Association of Community Health Centers.\n  And the legislation also received much comment and support from \nconsumer-based groups advocating for national health reform, including \nthat by Dr. Ken Frisof and UHCAN, which is the Universal Health Care \nAction Network, Bill Vaughan at Consumers Union, and from numerous \nhealth care advocates in New Mexico, including Community Action New \nMexico, Health Action New Mexico, Health Care for All Campaign of New \nMexico, New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty, New Mexico Health Choices \nInitiative, New Mexico POZ Coalition, New Mexico Public Health \nAssociation, New Mexico Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, \nNew Mexico Progressive Alliance for Community Empowerment, and the \nHealth Security for New Mexicans Campaign, which includes 115 \norganizations based in the State.\n  Support from all stakeholders in our nation's health care system has \nbeen sought and I would like to thank the many organizations from New \nMexico for their support and input to this legislation. There is great \nurgency in New Mexico because our State, like all of those along the \nU.S.-Mexico border, faces a severe health care crisis. In fact, New \nMexico ranks second only to Texas in the percentage of its citizens who \nare uninsured. New Mexico is also the only state in the country with \nless than half of its population having private health insurance \ncoverage.\n  A rather shocking statistic, which also continues to worsen, is that \none out of every three Hispanic citizens are uninsured. In fact, less \nthan 43 percent of the Hispanic population now has employer-based \ncoverage nationwide, which is in sharp comparison to the 68 percent of \nnon-Hispanic whites who have employer-based coverage.\n  The State has also enacted its own health reform plan called the \nState Coverage Initiative, or SCI in July 2005. SCI is a public/private \npartnership that is intended to expand employer-sponsored insurance and \nwas developed in part with grant funding from the Robert Wood Johnson \nFoundation. As of May 1, there were just over 4,500 people covered by \nthis initiative and there are efforts to expand this effort to cover \nover 20,000 individuals. With federal support for my State, the hope \nwould be to further expand coverage to as many New Mexicans as \npossible.\n  It is also important to note that the legislation encourages reforms \nat both the state and local levels of government. Senator Voinovich, as \nformer Mayor of Cleveland, suggested language that would capture \ncommunity-based efforts as well. Illinois, Georgia, Michigan, and \nOregon have all initiated efforts at the local level for reform, \nincluding what is known as the ``three-share'' programs in Illinois and \nMichigan. These initiatives have employers, employees, and the \ncommunity each pick up about one-third of the cost of the program.\n  Jeaneane Smith, deputy administrator in the Office of Oregon Health \nPolicy and Research was quoted in a recent Academy Health publication \nsaying, ``In recent years it has become apparent that there is a need \nto consider both state- and community-level approaches to improved \naccess. We want to learn how best to support communities as they play \nan integral part in addressing the gaps in coverage.''\n  Our hope is to spawn as much creative innovation as possible. \nBrookings Institute Senior Health Fellow Henry Aaron and Heritage \nFoundation Vice President Stuart Butler wrote a Health Affairs article \nin March 2004 that lays out the foundation for this legislative effort. \nThey argue that while we remain unable to reconcile how best to expand \ncoverage at the federal level, we can agree to support states in their \nefforts to try widely differing solutions to health coverage, cost \ncontainment, and quality improvement. As they write, ``This approach \noffers both a way to improve knowledge about how to reform health care \nand a practical way to initiate a process of reform. Such a pluralist \napproach respects the real, abiding differences in politics, \npreferences, traditions, and institutions across the nation. It also \nimplies a willingness to accept differences over an extended period in \norder to make progress. And it recognizes that permitting wide \ndiversity can foster consensus by revealing the strengths and exposing \nthe weaknesses of rival approaches.''\n  The most important message that I hope this bill carries is that we \nmust stop having the perfect be the enemy of the good. This proposal is \ncertainly not perfect but we hope it makes a very\n\n[[Page S4221]]\n\nimportant contribution to addressing our nation's health care crisis.\n  In addition to Dr. Garson, Mr. Aaron, Mr. Butler, and Dr. Frisof, I \nwould like to express my appreciation to Dan Hawkins at the National \nAssociation of Community Health Centers, Bill Vaughan at Consumers \nUnion, and both Jack Meyer and Stan Dorn at ESRI for their counsel and \nguidance on health reform and this legislation.\n  I would also like to commend the American College of Physicians, or \nACP, for their outstanding leadership on the issue of the uninsured and \nfor their willingness to support a variety of efforts to expand health \ncoverage. ACP has been a longstanding advocate for expanding health \ncoverage and has authored landmark reports on the important role that \nhealth insurance has in reducing people's morbidity and mortality. In \nfact, to cite the conclusion of one of those studies, ``Lack of \ninsurance contributes to the endangerment of the health of each \nuninsured American as well as the collective health of the nation.''\n  And finally, I would also thank the many people at the Robert Wood \nJohnson Foundation on their forethought and knowledge on all the issues \nconfronting the uninsured. Their efforts to maintain the focus and \ndialogue on addressing the uninsured has kept the issue alive for many \nyears.\n  I hope we can break the gridlock and urge my colleagues to support \nthis important legislation.\n  I would ask for unanimous consent for a Fact Sheet and copy of the \nHealth Affairs article entitled ``How Federalism Could Spur Bipartisan \nAction on the Uninsured'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       The Health Partnership Act\n\n       Introduced by Senators Voinovich and Bingaman in May 2006--\n     ``A bill to provide for innovation in health care through \n     state initiatives that expand coverage and access and improve \n     quality and efficiency in the health care system.''\n       The Health Partnership Act, cosponsored by U.S. Senators \n     Voinovich (R-OH) and Bingaman (D-NM), is a first step to move \n     beyond the political deadlock that has prevented the United \n     States from finding paths to affordable, quality health care \n     for all. For decades, national solutions have proven \n     impossible to attain because of sharp differences on how to \n     pay for and organize health care services. The Health \n     Partnership Act breaks through the impasse. It creates \n     partnerships among the federal government, state governments, \n     private payers and health care providers to implement \n     different approaches to achieve sustainable reform that \n     provides affordable, quality health care for all. It \n     demonstrates federal leadership on health care through \n     establishing a mechanism by which federal dollars are \n     committed to states to reduce the number of uninsured and to \n     improve the quality of health care for all.\n       A creative new bipartisan initiative to move beyond \n     political deadlock and a potential first step towards \n     affordable quality health care for all.\n\n\n                           the federal level\n\n       Federal dollars will fund five-year State Health Care \n     Expansion and Improvement Grants. The amount of federal \n     funding for new grants will be determined annually in the \n     budgetary process.\n       The bill establishes a bipartisan State Health Innovation \n     Commission composed of national, state and local leaders that \n     will:\n       Issue requests for proposals.\n       Establish, in collaboration with an organization such as \n     the Institute of Medicine, minimum performance standards and \n     5-year goals.\n       Provide states with a ``toolkit'' of reform options, such \n     as single-payer systems, public program expansions, pay-or-\n     play mechanisms, tax credit incentives, health savings \n     accounts, etc.\n       Ensure the maintenance of Medicaid--prohibiting restrictive \n     rule changes that would limit eligibility or benefits.\n       Recommend to Congress which grants to support, giving \n     preference to states maximizing the reduction in numbers of \n     the uninsured.\n       Monitor the progress of programs and promote information \n     exchange on what works.\n       Recommend ways to minimize negative effects on national \n     employer groups, providers and insurers related to differing \n     state requirements.\n\n\n                              state level\n\n       Each state applying for a grant will develop a health care \n     plan to increase coverage, improve quality and reduce costs, \n     with specific targets for reduction in the number of \n     uninsured and the costs of administration.\n       States will receive renewable grants for five-year \n     expansion and improvement programs.\n       States will receive from the federal level technical \n     assistance, if requested, for developing proposals.\n       Each state plan would address:\n       Coverage by describing the process and setting a 5-year \n     target for reducing the number of uninsured individuals in \n     the state.\n       Quality by providing a plan to increase health care \n     effectiveness, efficiency, timeliness, and equity while \n     reducing health disparities and medical errors.\n       Costs by developing and implementing systems to improve the \n     efficiency of health care, including a 5-year target to \n     reduce administrative costs and paperwork burdens.\n       Information technology by designing the appropriate use of \n     health information technology to improve infrastructure, to \n     expand the availability of evidence-based medical and to \n     provide outcomes data to providers and patients.\n\n\n      states in the lead: lessons on the process of making change\n\n       Given the inaction of the federal government on health care \n     access issues, states have begun to address these challenges \n     creatively with sensitivity to local ideas and conditions. \n     Dozens of states are considering new proposals. Five have \n     already acted.\n       Maine, June 2003--the Dirigo Health Plan.\n       California, October 2003--phased-in Employer Mandate \n     (repealed by ballot initiative, November 2004).\n       Illinois, September 2005--Health Care for All Children.\n       Maryland, January 2006--Fair Share Health Care (employer \n     mandate for the largest employers).\n       Massachusetts, April 2006--Massachusetts Health Reform \n     Package--with both an individual and an employer mandate.\n       The recently passed Massachusetts law deserves special \n     attention because it is the first one enacted cooperatively \n     with a divided government--a strongly Democratic state \n     legislature and a Republican governor.\n       The detailed policy particulars in each of these state \n     measures are controversial, with strong supporters and strong \n     detractors. But they teach us a lot about the process of \n     reforming health care in America.\n       State political leadership at the highest level is \n     necessary.\n       Active consumer advocacy plays an important role.\n       Some stakeholder leadership must be willing to put the \n     larger public interest above their own narrow economic self-\n     interest.\n       The proposals have implementation phased in over several \n     years.\n       It is easier for these proposals to expand access than to \n     restrain the growth of costs--the latter being critical to \n     make them sustainable over the long term.\n       Massachusetts, in particular, demonstrated how modest \n     federal financial incentives (in this case the threatened \n     loss of less than \\1/10\\ of federal Medicaid funding) can \n     provide the critical stimulus for leaders to come together to \n     create comprehensive reform.\n\n\n           political advantages of the health partnership act\n\n       The Health Partnership Act provides positive multi-year \n     financial incentives to states to address these issues, \n     making it more likely for them to take the first steps and \n     less likely to backslide when money concerns arise.\n       Congress need not pick just one path to health care for \n     all. Members may be willing to let other states try models \n     that they would oppose in their home states.\n       Allowing states to design their own plans, based on simple \n     federal standards, has the potential to break through the \n     current political deadlock. Breakthroughs in some states \n     could be replicated elsewhere.\n       Advocacy is needed concurrently at the state and federal \n     levels, with each reinforcing the other.\n       Federal support has the potential to counteract likely \n     opposition by special interests in state efforts.\n\n\n            policy advantages of the health partnership act\n\n       The process of implementing a variety of partnerships \n     recognizes that one national plan may not address the \n     differences among states and encourages states to address \n     creatively their own needs.\n       Lessons learned in testing diverse state plans would \n     benefit other states and national reform.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      How Federalism Could Spur Bipartisan Action on the Uninsured\n\n                (By Henry J. Aaron and Stuart M. Butler)\n\n       Nearly everyone thinks that something should be done to \n     reduce the number of Americans lacking health insurance. \n     Unfortunately, while numerous plans exist on how to reach \n     that goal, few agree on any one. In deed, as authors we \n     disagree on how best to extend and assure health insurance \n     coverage. Nonetheless, we believe that using the pluralism \n     and creative power of federalism is the best way to break the \n     political logjam and to discover the best way to expand \n     coverage.\n       Accordingly, we believe that states should be strongly \n     encouraged to try any of a wide range of approaches to \n     increasing health insurance coverage and rewarded for their \n     success. This approach offers both a way to improve knowledge \n     about how to reform health care and a practical way to \n     initiate a process of reform. Such a pluralist approach \n     respects the real, abiding differences in politics, \n     preferences, traditions, and institutions across\n\n[[Page S4222]]\n\n     the nation. It also implies a willingness to accept \n     differences over an extended period in order to make \n     progress. And it recognizes that permitting wide diversity \n     can foster consensus by revealing the strengths and exposing \n     the weaknesses of rival approaches.\n       Despite our abiding disagreements on which substantive \n     approach to extending coverage is best, we believe that \n     people of goodwill must be prepared to countenance the \n     testing of ideas they oppose if progress is to be made. \n     Moreover, we believe that there is no hope for legislation \n     to begin to transform the largest U.S. industry--health \n     care--unless such legislation enjoys strong support from \n     both major political parties.\n\n\n                    Using Federalism To Spur Action\n\n       Proposals to reduce the number of uninsured Americans \n     abound. Some favor expanding government programs, such as \n     Medicaid. Others favor refundable tax credits to help \n     families buy private health insurance. Still others favor \n     regulatory approaches, such as changes in insurance rules. \n     But working together in health care to achieve a goal shared \n     by virtually everyone has proved to be impossible. One reason \n     for this is that the capacity to reach substantive compromise \n     in Washington has seriously eroded. Among the causes is the \n     widespread view that reforming the complex health care system \n     requires very carefully designed and internally consistent \n     actions. Some say that it is like building a new airplane: \n     Unless all the key parts are there and fit together \n     perfectly, the airplane will not fly. Thus, many proponents \n     of particular approaches fear that abandoning key components \n     of their proposals to achieve a compromise will prevent a \n     fair test of their favored approach and lead to failure. \n     Another obstacle is that many lawmakers believe that \n     approaches that might conceivably work in one part of the \n     country, given the cultural, philosophical, or health \n     industry conditions prevailing there, will not work in their \n     state or district because of different local conditions. This \n     view leads many in Congress to resist proposals that might \n     work in some areas because they believe that those proposals \n     could make things worse for their constituents.\n       These and other factors have stalled efforts to extend \n     health insurance and achieve other reforms for decades. The \n     enactment of Medicare and Medicaid stands as one notable--and \n     instructive--exception to that pattern. Medicare sprang from \n     comprehensive social insurance initiatives of congressional \n     Democrats, Medicaid from limited needs based approaches of \n     congressional Republicans. The passage of each program was \n     possible only because the two initiatives were linked in the \n     form of a trade-off, not so much by blending some elements of \n     each approach but by moving forward with two programs in \n     parallel: Medicare for the elderly and disabled, and Medicaid \n     for the poor of all ages. That experience illustrates a \n     principle of politics: that progress often requires combining \n     elements of competing proposals into a hybrid legislative \n     initiative, in which internally consistent approaches operate \n     in parallel.\n       In our view, federalism offers a promising approach to the \n     challenge of building support to tackle the problem of \n     uninsurance. While proponents of nationwide measures to \n     introduce health insurance tax credits, or to extend Medicare \n     or the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to \n     other groups, should of course continue to make their case \n     for national policies, we emphasize an initiative designed to \n     support states in launching a variety of localized \n     initiatives. Under this process, the federal government \n     would reward states that agreed to test comprehensive and \n     internally consistent strategies that succeeded in \n     extending coverage within their borders. In contrast to \n     block grants, federal-state covenants would operate within \n     congressionally specified policy constraints designed to \n     achieve national goals for extending health insurance. \n     These covenants would include plans ranging from heavy \n     government regulation to almost none, as long as the plans \n     were consistent with the broad goals and included \n     specified protections. States could also select items from \n     a federally designed ``policy toolbox'' to include in \n     their proposals. Allowable state plans would include forms \n     of single-payer plans, employer mandates, mandatory \n     individual purchase of privately offered insurance, tax \n     credits, and creative new approaches. States would be free \n     not to undertake such experiments and continue with the \n     current array of programs, but sizable financial \n     incentives would be offered to those that chose to \n     experiment and financial rewards given to those that \n     achieve agreed-upon goals.\n       The model we propose builds upon proposals we have outlined \n     elsewhere. It is also compatible with some other federalism \n     approaches, such as the plan advanced by the Institute of \n     Medicine. We favor a wide diversity of federal-state \n     initiatives for three reasons. First, fostering a bold \n     program in a state will produce much information that will \n     aid the policy discovery process. Successes will encourage \n     others to follow, while unanticipated problems will force \n     redesign or abandonment and will be geographically contained. \n     Second, encouraging bold state action will quickly and \n     directly extend coverage to many of the uninsured. Instead of \n     facing continued national inaction or the potential for \n     disruption of state initiatives by future federal action, \n     states would have the incentive and freedom to act \n     decisively. Third, we see no evidence of an emerging \n     consensus on how to deal with these problems at the national \n     level. But our proposal is based on the observation that \n     advocates of rival plans trust their preferred approaches \n     enough to believe that a real-life version would persuade \n     opponents and create a consensus. Not all can be right, of \n     course, but all advocates of health insurance reform, like \n     residents of Lake Wobegon, seem to believe that their plans \n     are above average. Thus, they should be open to the idea of \n     testing diverse proposals. Our proposal is a process to \n     enable policymakers to discover which is right, either for \n     the whole country or for a region.\n\n\n                             Core Elements\n\n       We propose that Congress provide financial assistance and a \n     legal framework to trigger a diverse set of federal-state \n     initiatives. To help break the impasse in Congress over most \n     national approaches, we propose steps designed to enable \n     ``first choice'' political ideas to be tried in limited \n     areas, with the support of states and through the \n     enactment of a federal ``policy toolbox'' of legislated \n     approaches that would be available to states but not \n     imposed on them. Our view is that elected officials would \n     be prepared to authorize some approaches now bottled up in \n     Congress if they knew that the approach would not be \n     imposed on their states. Our proposed strategy would \n     contain six key elements.\n       Goals and protections. First, Congress would set certain \n     goals and general protections. Goals would be established for \n     extending coverage, and perhaps improving the coverage of \n     some of those with inadequate coverage today. One such goal \n     could be a percentage reduction in the number of uninsured \n     people in a state. The more precise the goals, the more \n     contentious they are likely to be. But clear and measurable \n     goals under the proposed covenants are necessary if the \n     system of financial rewards described below is to work \n     effectively.\n       What is ``insurance''? For a coverage goal to mean \n     anything, it would have to define what constitutes \n     ``insurance.'' Specifying adequate coverage in health care is \n     no easier than quantifying an adequate high school education, \n     and when money follows success, drafting such definitions \n     becomes even more difficult.\n       In defining what is meant by adequate insurance, agreement \n     on two characteristics is vital: the services to be covered \n     and the maximum residual costs (deductibles and copayments) \n     that the insured must bear. States could be more generous \n     than these standards. Instead of speciying precisely what \n     states must do in each of these dimensions, we suggest that \n     Congress establish a required actuarial minimum--such as the \n     cost of providing the benefit package of the Federal \n     Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) for the state's \n     population--as the standard, with states retaining \n     considerable latitude on which services to include and how \n     much cost sharing to require. Whether to set this actuarial \n     standard high or low will be controversial and will determine \n     the overall cost to the federal government of eliciting state \n     participation.\n       Both high and low benefit standards suffer from well-known \n     problems. High standards would raise program costs and weaken \n     individuals' incentives to be prudent purchasers of health \n     care. Low standards expose patients to sizable financial risk \n     and raise questions about whether to restrict patients' right \n     to buy supplemental coverage. Thus, federal legislation would \n     not specify the content of insurance plans beyond some such \n     actuarial amount. States would then be free to design plans \n     as they wish, although certain types of plans might be \n     presumptively acceptable (see below), and others could be \n     negotiated as part of a covenant. The exact mix of benefits \n     could vary within reason, but no further limits would be \n     imposed. One goal of this approach, after all, is to \n     encourage experimentation to generate information on whether \n     particular configurations of benefits work better than \n     others. It might turn out, for example, that states would \n     adopt quite different plans with similar actuarial values. \n     One group might opt for high deductible plans covering a wide \n     range of services with no cost sharing above the \n     deductible and generous relief from the deductible for the \n     poor, while others might adopt a system with low \n     deductibles and modest cost sharing but covering a much \n     narrower range of benefits. Discovering how individuals' \n     and providers' attitudes and behavior differ under such \n     plans and how health outcomes vary would provide valuable \n     information for private health insurance planners and \n     government officials.\n       Protections for individuals. In addition to the \n     definitional question, the question also arises, What \n     limitations and protections should be applied to state \n     experiments? If a simple net reduction in uninsurance \n     guaranteed a financial reward to a state, for example, the \n     state would have the incentive to drop coverage of costly \n     high-risk adults and extend coverage to less costly \n     (healthier and younger) workers. Some such concerns could be \n     addressed in negotiating covenants, but some broad \n     protections and policy ``corridors'' would be established \n     under our proposal and would be necessary to achieve \n     political support.\n       One of the most politically sensitive would be a primum non \n     nocere limitation. That is, states could not introduce a plan \n     that reduced coverage for currently insured populations, most \n     notably the Medicaid population, beyond some minimum amount. \n     We believe that no reform proposal is likely to\n\n[[Page S4223]]\n\n     be achievable without that restriction. Most Medicaid outlays \n     in many states are not strictly mandated by federal law, in \n     the sense that some beneficiaries and some services for all \n     beneficiaries are optional. States provide optional coverage \n     because federal law permits it, and the federal match makes \n     its provision attractive to states. If incentives were \n     introduced to cover the non-Medicaid population, states might \n     find it financially and politically attractive to increase \n     the total number of insured people by curtailing Medicaid \n     eligibility and benefits and using the money saved, together \n     with federal support, to cover a larger number of people who \n     are uninsured but less poor.\n       Designing and enforcing rules to prohibit or limit such \n     ``insurance swapping'' would be extremely challenging but \n     politically--and, one could argue, morally--essential. On the \n     other hand, we believe that states should have some \n     opportunity to propose different ways of delivering the \n     Medicaid commitment to the currently insured population, as \n     long as the degree and quality of coverage were not \n     diminished. That form of Medicaid protection could stimulate \n     creativity and improvement in coverage for the poorest \n     citizens while avoiding any threat to their existing \n     coverage. To be sure, there are disagreements, including \n     between us, on the degree of freedom states should have in \n     deciding how to deliver the Medicaid commitment. Positions \n     range from only minor tweaking to sweeping changes in the \n     delivery system, such as allowing states to use Medicaid \n     money to subsidize individual enrollment in an equivalent \n     private plan. The degree of flexibility states should have, \n     while maintaining eligibility and level of coverage, is a \n     difficult political issue for Congress to decide.\n       Acceptable state proposals would also have to limit cost \n     sharing and features analogous to pension nondiscrimination \n     rules. We believe that requirements, consistent with the \n     general goals and protections we propose, are needed to \n     ensure that lower-income households do not face \n     unaffordable coverage. Without such limits, states could \n     reduce the number of uninsured people and secure attendant \n     federal financial support, for example, by instituting an \n     individual mandate with a high premium that would \n     effectively make insurance universal among the financially \n     secure and do little for the poor. States would need to \n     propose a fair, plausible way of meeting the requirement, \n     such as by mandating some form of community rating or \n     through a cross-subsidy to more vulnerable populations.\n       The federal government should establish broad guidelines, \n     but no more. A key principle of our proposal is that state \n     officials are more likely than federal officials to design \n     successful solutions to those problems that members of the \n     policy or congressional staff community have failed to solve. \n     Congress can and should set the parameters, but it should \n     avoid micromanagement.\n       ``Policy toolbox'' of federal policies and programs. A \n     feature of the congressional impasse noted earlier is that \n     many plausible health initiatives that might merit testing, \n     and have support in some states, are blocked by other \n     lawmakers who oppose the introduction of the approach in \n     their own state or across the country. Thus, we propose that \n     Congress enact presumptively legitimate approaches to the \n     expansion of health insurance coverage as a ``policy \n     toolbox'' that would be available to states a la carte to \n     apply within their borders. Lawmakers could safely vote to \n     permit an initiative, confident that it would not be imposed \n     on their states. In this way, potentially useful policies and \n     programs could be ``unlocked'' from Congress and become \n     available for states to use in their own initiatives.\n       A policy toolbox likely would include expansions of \n     existing policies, such as raising income limits under \n     Medicaid or lowering the age of Medicare eligibility. It \n     could include arrangements to subsidize individual buy-ins to \n     the FEHBP, refundable tax credits or their equivalent \n     (perhaps with some steps to modify the federal income tax \n     exclusion for employee-sponsored health insurance costs), \n     mandating employer or individual coverage, or creating a \n     single state insurance plan though which everyone may buy \n     subsidized coverage.\n       Other possible examples might include the following: (1) \n     Remove regulatory and tax obstacles to churches, unions, and \n     other organizations providing group health insurance plans. \n     This could open up new forms of group coverage offered though \n     organizations with an established membership and common \n     values. (2) Allow Medicaid and SCHIP to cover additional \n     populations, with greatly enhanced federal matching payments, \n     and perhaps to operate in very different ways--with \n     appropriate safeguards to protect those who are covered under \n     current law. Both federal welfare legislation and SCHIP, for \n     example, included safeguards to preserve existing Medicaid \n     coverage. (3) Extend limited federal Employee Retirement \n     Income Security Act (ERISA) protection to large corporate \n     health plans willing to enroll nonemployees, and extend the \n     tax exclusion to those enrollees. This could lead in a state \n     to expanded access to comprehensive coverage. (4) Provide \n     a voucher to individuals designed to mimic a comprehensive \n     refundable tax credit for health insurance. This could \n     allow the practical issues of a major tax credit approach \n     to be examined. (5) Enact legislation to make forms of \n     FEHBP-style coverage available to broader populations \n     within states. This would enable states and federal \n     government to explore the issues associated with extending \n     the program to nonfederal employees and retirees. (6) \n     Enable states to establish association plans and other \n     innovative health organizations.\n       We emphasize that any menu of tools would be optional for \n     states. None would be required. Members of Congress would be \n     more likely to agree to the inclusion of elements they would \n     deplore in their own states if they knew that no state, \n     including their own, would be forced to adopt them than they \n     would be in a nationally uniform system. Some lawmakers, for \n     instance, oppose association plans be cause they believe that \n     such plans would disrupt successful state insurance \n     arrangements. Under the menu approach, association plans \n     would be introduced only in states wishing to use them as \n     part of their overall strategy.\n       State proposals, federal approval. Under our proposed \n     strategy, states interested in a bold, creative initiative \n     would design a proposal consistent with the goals and \n     restrictions established by Congress. Typically this proposal \n     would include some elements from the federal policy toolbox \n     in conjunction with state initiatives.\n       Needless to say, a critical congressional decision would \n     concern mechanisms for approving state plans and monitoring \n     state performance. States would no doubt seek to take \n     advantage of every financial opportunity to game the system \n     and to stretch agreements to the limit, as the almost zany \n     history of the Medicaid upper payment level (UPL) controversy \n     makes painfully clear. Yet monitoring state behavior, \n     determining state violations, and enforcing penalties on \n     states is enormously difficult. Moreover, the entity could \n     (and we think should) have the power to negotiate parts of a \n     proposal, not merely approve or reject it, so that \n     refinements could be made consistent with Congress's \n     objectives.\n       But what entity should this be? It might seem natural to \n     designate an executive agency that reports to the president, \n     such as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). We \n     suspect, however, that many members of Congress would refuse \n     to cede so much selection authority to another branch of \n     government and that roughly half would fear partisan \n     decisions by an administration of the ``other'' party. \n     Congress would likely insist on adding suffocating selection \n     criteria and other restrictions to executive department \n     decisions, jeopardizing the very creativity we intend. Thus, \n     we favor instead an existing or newly created body that has \n     independence but ultimately answers to Congress. A new \n     bipartisan body might perform this function with members \n     selected by Congress and the administration or with members \n     also representing the states, with technical advice from the \n     U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO). This body would \n     evaluate and negotiate draft state proposals according to the \n     general requirements specified by Congress and then present a \n     recommended ``slate'' of proposals to Congress for an up-\n     or-down vote without amendment. Once the state proposals \n     had been selected, HHS would be responsible for \n     implementing the program.\n       Bipartisan willingness to authorize state programs and to \n     appropriate sufficient funds to elicit state participation \n     also requires that members of Congress believe that \n     approaches they find congenial will receive a fair trial and \n     agree that approaches they reject will also receive a fair \n     trial. Unfortunately, current federal legislation makes two \n     key approaches difficult to implement in individual states or \n     even groups of states: a single-payer plan and an individual \n     mandate combined with refundable tax credits. A federalist \n     approach should include mechanisms that would enable states \n     to give such proposals as fair and complete a test as \n     possible, both because that would provide valuable \n     information and because the political support of their \n     advocates is important in Congress.\n       Crafting a single-payer experiment. ERISA, which exempts \n     self-insured plans from state regulation, is the primary \n     technical obstacle to testing single-payer plans. The \n     political sensitivity to modifications in ERISA is difficult \n     to exaggerate. Any attempt to carve out an exception from \n     ERISA for state programs to extend cover age would probably \n     doom federal legislation. But states could create ``wrap \n     around'' plans to cover all who are not currently insured, or \n     even to cover all who are not insured under plans exempted by \n     ERISA from state regulation. While such an arrangement would \n     not be a single-payer plan, it could achieve universal \n     coverage, which is one defining characteristic of single-\n     payer plans, and arguably be sufficient for a valid test. \n     After all, the U.S. health care system is characterized by \n     different subsystems for certain populations and has a form \n     of single-payer coverage for military veterans. But of course \n     the real test is whether advocates of single-payer plans \n     regard such a limited arrangement as a fair trial.\n       An individual tax credit approach. The obstacles to a state \n     level individual mandate with a refundable credit are also \n     serious and complicated. We presume that an individual \n     mandate would require some contribution from people with \n     incomes above defined levels. Such a mandate raises both \n     political and practical questions. Testing federal tax reform \n     in selected geographic areas also raises constitutional and \n     practical issues, although advocates of the approach maintain \n     that other site-specific programs involving federal tax \n     changes, such as enterprise zones,\n\n[[Page S4224]]\n\n     have passed muster. In addition, for a limited experiment it \n     might be possible to design subsidy programs that would mimic \n     tax relief.\n       Administering a refundable tax credit would pose formidable \n     difficulties for some states, particularly those that do not \n     have a personal income tax. In all states, the logistics of \n     providing a credit with reasonable accuracy on a timely basis \n     would be challenging. So, too, would deciding how to address \n     such administrative problems as households that live in one \n     state yet work in another. Advocates for tax credits say they \n     have solutions to these and similar challenges, just as \n     supporters of single-payer approaches or employer mandates \n     claim to have answers to challenges facing those approaches. \n     For instance, some maintain that the employment-based tax \n     withholding system could serve as a vehicle for refundable \n     credits or equivalent subsidies and would make individual \n     enrollment practical. Whether or not they are right is of \n     course disputed by their critics. The beauty of a ``put up \n     or shut up'' federalism initiative is that it offers a \n     chance for advocates to offer such solutions in practice \n     instead of in theory.\n       Using ``managed federalism'' to build support? Deciding how \n     many states could qualify for experiments is an open \n     political and technical question. One approach would be to \n     limit it to a few states. This would limit costs but has \n     little else to be said for it. Accordingly, we would favor \n     opening the program to all states wishing to accept a federal \n     offer. Nevertheless, we recognize that some lawmakers would \n     be reluctant to vote for a process of federal-state \n     innovation unless they were sure that certain ``generic'' or \n     ``standard'' approaches were included--especially if the \n     number of states in the program were to be limited. In \n     particular, we believe that our proposal can win \n     congressional support only if liberals and conservatives \n     alike are fully convinced that the approaches each holds dear \n     will receive a fair and full trial in practice.\n       While we believe that any state initiative that meets \n     approval should be welcomed, political considerations thus \n     might require that no state's proposal would be approved \n     unless a sufficient range of acceptable variants was \n     proposed. For example, strong advocates of market-based or \n     single-payer approaches might find the federalism option \n     acceptable only if each was confident that favored approaches \n     would be tested.\n       Adequate data collection. To determine whether a state was \n     actually making progress toward a goal, accurate and timely \n     data would be needed. These data would include surveys of \n     insurance coverage, with sufficient detail to provide state-\n     level estimates. Such surveys would be essential to show \n     whether the states were making progress in extending health \n     insurance coverage. They are vital to the success of the \n     whole approach because payments to states (apart from modest \n     planning assistance) should be based on actual progress in \n     extending coverage, not on compliance with procedural \n     milestones.\n       Congress should also assure that states report on use of \n     health services, costs, health status, and any other \n     information deemed necessary to judge the relative success of \n     various approaches to extending coverage. Only a national \n     effort could ensure that data are comparable across states. \n     States' cooperation with data collection would be one element \n     of the determination of whether a state was in compliance \n     with its covenant and was therefore eligible for full \n     incentive payments. The experience with state waivers under \n     welfare before enactment of the 1996 welfare reform clearly \n     illustrates the power and importance of such data collection. \n     The cumulative effect of the reports showing the \n     effectiveness of welfare-to-work requirements in reducing \n     rolls, increasing earnings, and raising recipients' \n     satisfaction transformed the political environment and made \n     welfare reform inescapable.\n       Rewarding progress. Congress would design a formula under \n     which states would be rewarded for their progress in meeting \n     the agreed federal-state goals of extending insurance \n     coverage. As experience with countless grant programs \n     attests, haggling over such formulas can become politics at \n     its grubbiest, with elected officials voting solely on the \n     basis of what a particular formula does for their districts. \n     Even without political parochialism, designing a formula that \n     rewards progress fairly is no easy task. For one thing, \n     states will be starting from quite different places. The \n     proportion of states' uninsured populations under age sixty-\n     five during 1997-1999 ranged from 27.7 percent in New Mexico \n     and 26.8 percent in Texas to 9.6 percent in Rhode Island and \n     10.5 percent in Minnesota and Hawaii. Designing an incentive \n     formula to reward progress amid such diverse conditions is \n     both an analytical and a political challenge. Moreover, the \n     per capita cost of health care varies across the nation, \n     which further complicates the assessment of progress. The \n     cost of extending coverage depends on the geographic \n     location, income, and health status of the uninsured \n     population. Having financial access may be hollow in \n     communities where services are physically unavailable or \n     highly limited. Extending coverage may require supply-side \n     measures to supplement financial access.\n       We believe that the only way to design such a formula is to \n     remove the detailed design decisions from congressional \n     micromanagement. We suggest that Congress be asked to adopt \n     the domestic equivalent of ``fast-track'' trade negotiation \n     rules or base-closing legislation. Under this arrangement, \n     Congress would designate a body appointed in equal numbers by \n     the two parties, to design an incentive formula that Congress \n     would agree to vote up or down, without amendments. Such a \n     formula would have to recognize the different positions from \n     which various states would start. Any acceptable formula \n     would have to reward both absolute and relative reductions in \n     the proportions of uninsured people. Whether financial \n     incentives would be offered for other dimensions of \n     performance and how performance would be measured constitute \n     additional important challenges.\n       Sources of funding. Bleak budget prospects could cause one \n     to give up on this or any other attempt to extend health \n     insurance coverage broadly. But as recent history amply \n     illustrates, the political and budgetary weather can change \n     dramatically and with little notice. What funding approach \n     would be desirable if funds were available? Under our \n     proposal, the federal funding would be intended for several \n     broad purposes: (1) A large portion of the money would be \n     used to help states actually fund approaches to be tested. \n     (2) Some funding (perhaps with assistance from private \n     foundations) would provide national support and technical \n     assistance to states. A model to consider for such support is \n     the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) State \n     Planning Grants program, which both funds state planning \n     activities and provides federal support and technical \n     assistance. (3) Some funds would cover the cost of \n     independent performance monitoring. (4) Some funds would be \n     set aside to reward states for meeting the goals in their \n     agreed-upon plan. Congress might consider an automatic \n     ``performance bonus'' system similar to the mechanism used \n     in welfare reform. Congress could also consider \n     withholding the periodic release of part of a state's \n     grant pending a periodic assessment by the independent \n     monitor of the degree to which the state is accomplishing \n     the objectives specified in its covenant. Only those \n     states willing to offer proposals designed to achieve the \n     national goals would be eligible for a share of the \n     funding or for the menu of federal policy tools. A state \n     could decline to offer a proposal and remain under current \n     programs.\n       Federalism enables the states to undertake innovative \n     approaches to challenges facing the United States. Federal \n     legislation often grants states broad discretion in designing \n     even those programs for which the federal government bears \n     much or most of the cost. In health care as well as education \n     or welfare, states have been the primary innovators. But the \n     federal government limits, shapes, and facilitates such \n     innovation through regulation, taxation, and grants. Such a \n     partnership is bound to be marked by conflict and tension as \n     state and federal interests diverge.\n       A creative federalism approach of the kind we propose would \n     change the dynamics of discovering better ways to expand \n     insurance coverage, just as a version of this approach \n     triggered a radical change in the way states addressed \n     welfare dependency. By actually testing competing approaches \n     to reach common goals, rather than endlessly debating them, \n     the United States is far more likely to find the solution to \n     the perplexing and seemingly intractable problem of \n     uninsurance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/09/senate-section/article/S4224-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4224-S4225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 471--RECOGNIZING THAT, DURING NATIONAL FOSTER CARE \nMONTH, THE LEADERS OF THE FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SHOULD \nPROVIDE LEADERSHIP TO IMPROVE THE CARE GIVEN TO CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE \n                                PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. Craig) submitted the \nfollowing resolution, which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Mr. SMITH submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nhim to the bill S. 1955, to amend title I of the Employee Retirement \nSecurity Act of 1974 and the Public Health Service Act to expand health \ncare access and reduce costs through the creation of small business \nhealth plans and through modernization of the health insurance \nmarketplace; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Local Law Enforcement \n     Enhancement Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The incidence of violence motivated by the actual or \n     perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, \n     sexual orientation, or disability of the victim poses a \n     serious national problem.\n       (2) Such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of \n     communities and is deeply divisive.\n       (3) State and local authorities are now and will continue \n     to be responsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority \n     of violent crimes in the United States, including violent \n     crimes motivated by bias. These authorities can carry out \n     their responsibilities more effectively with greater Federal \n     assistance.\n       (4) Existing Federal law is inadequate to address this \n     problem.\n       (5) The prominent characteristic of a violent crime \n     motivated by bias is that it devastates not just the actual \n     victim and the family and friends of the victim, but \n     frequently savages the community sharing the traits that \n     caused the victim to be selected.\n       (6) Such violence substantially affects interstate commerce \n     in many ways, including--\n       (A) by impeding the movement of members of targeted groups \n     and forcing such members to move across State lines to escape \n     the incidence or risk of such violence; and\n       (B) by preventing members of targeted groups from \n     purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining \n     employment, or participating in other commercial activity.\n       (7) Perpetrators cross State lines to commit such violence.\n       (8) Channels, facilities, and instrumentalities of \n     interstate commerce are used to facilitate the commission of \n     such violence.\n       (9) Such violence is committed using articles that have \n     traveled in interstate commerce.\n       (10) For generations, the institutions of slavery and \n     involuntary servitude were defined by the race, color, and \n     ancestry of those held in bondage. Slavery and involuntary \n     servitude were enforced, both prior to and after the adoption \n     of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, through widespread public and private violence \n     directed at persons because of their race, color, or \n     ancestry, or perceived race, color, or ancestry. Accordingly, \n     eliminating racially motivated violence is an important means \n     of eliminating, to the extent possible, the badges, \n     incidents, and relics of slavery and involuntary \n     servitude.\n       (11) Both at the time when the 13th, 14th, and 15th \n     amendments to the Constitution of the United States were \n     adopted, and continuing to date, members of certain religious \n     and national origin groups were and are perceived to be \n     distinct ``races''. Thus, in order to eliminate, to the \n     extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of \n     slavery, it is necessary to prohibit assaults on the basis of \n     real or perceived religions or national origins, at least to \n     the extent such religions or national origins were regarded \n     as races at the time of the adoption of the 13th, 14th, and \n     15th amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n       (12) Federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes \n     motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and local \n     authorities to work together as partners in the investigation \n     and prosecution of such crimes.\n       (13) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is \n     sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in nature as \n     to warrant Federal assistance to States and local \n     jurisdictions.\n\n     SEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Need for universal coverage.--\n       (A) Currently, there are 9,000,000 children under the age \n     of 19 that are uninsured. One out of every 8 children are \n     uninsured while 1 in 5 Hispanic children and 1 in 7 African \n     American children are uninsured. Three-quarters, \n     approximately 6,800,000, of these children are eligible but \n     not enrolled in the medicaid program or the State children's \n     health insurance program (SCHIP). Long-range studies found \n     that 1 in 3 children went without health insurance for all or \n     part of 2002 and 2003.\n       (B) Low-income children are 3 times as likely as children \n     in higher income families to be uninsured. It is estimated \n     that 65 percent of uninsured children have at least 1 parent \n     working full time over the course of the year.\n       (C) It is estimated that 50 percent of all legal immigrant \n     children in families with income that is less than 200 \n     percent of the Federal poverty line are uninsured. In States \n     without programs to cover immigrant children, 57 percent of \n     non-citizen children are uninsured.\n       (D) Children in the Southern and Western parts of the \n     United States were nearly 1.7 times more likely to be \n     uninsured than children in the Northeast. In the Northeast, \n     9.4 percent of children are uninsured while in the Midwest, \n     8.3 percent are uninsured. The South's rate of uninsured \n     children is 14.3 percent while the West has an uninsured rate \n     of 13 percent.\n       (E) Children's health care needs are neglected in the \n     United States. One-quarter of young children in the United \n     States are not fully up to date on their basic immunizations. \n     One-third of children with chronic asthma do not get a \n     prescription for the necessary medications to manage the \n     disease.\n       (F) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, nearly \\1/2\\ of all uninsured children have not \n     had a well-child visit in the past year. One out of every 5 \n     children has problems accessing needed care, and 1 out of \n     every 4 children do not receive annual dental exams. One in 6 \n     uninsured children had a delayed or unmet medical need in the \n     past year. Minority children are less likely to receive \n     proven treatments such as prescription medications to treat \n     chronic disease.\n       (G) There are 7,600,000 young adults between the ages of 19 \n     and 20. In the United States, approximately 28 percent, or \n     2,100,000 individuals, of this group are uninsured.\n       (H) Chronic illness and disability among children are on \n     the rise. Children most at risk for chronic illness and \n     disability are children who are most likely to be poor and \n     uninsured.\n       (2) Role of the medicaid and state children's health \n     insurance programs.--\n       (A) The medicaid program and SCHIP serve as a crucial \n     health safety net for 30,000,000 children. During the recent \n     economic downturn and the highest number of uninsured \n     individuals ever recorded in the United States, the medicaid \n     program and SCHIP offset losses in employer-sponsored \n     coverage. While the number of children living in low-income \n     families increased by 2,000,000 between 2000 and 2003, the \n     number of uninsured children fell due to the medicaid program \n     and SCHIP.\n       (B) In 2003, 25,000,000 children were enrolled in the \n     medicaid program, accounting for \\1/2\\ of all enrollees and \n     only 19 percent of total program costs.\n       (C) The medicaid program and SCHIP do more than just fill \n     in the gaps. Gains in public coverage have reduced the \n     percentage of low-income uninsured by a \\1/3\\ from 1997 to \n     2003. In addition, a recent study found that publicly-insured \n     children are more likely to obtain medical care, preventive \n     care and dental care than similar low-income privately-\n     insured children.\n       (D) Publicly funded programs such as the medicaid program \n     and SCHIP actually improve children's health. Children who \n     are currently insured by public programs are in better health \n     than they were a year ago. Expansion of coverage for children \n     and pregnant women under the medicaid program and SCHIP \n     reduces rates of avoidable hospitalizations by 22 percent.\n       (E) Studies have found that children enrolled in public \n     insurance programs experienced a 68 percent improvement in \n     measures of school performance.\n       (F) Despite the success of expansions in general under the \n     medicaid program and SCHIP, due to current budget \n     constraints, many States have stopped doing aggressive \n     outreach and have raised premiums and cost-sharing \n     requirements on families under these programs. In addition, 8 \n     States stopped enrollment in SCHIP for a period of time \n     between April 2003 and July 2004. As a result, SCHIP \n     enrollment fell by 200,000 children for the first time in the \n     program's history.\n       (G) It is estimated that nearly 50 percent of children \n     covered through SCHIP do not remain in the program due to \n     reenrollment barriers. A recent study found that between 10 \n     and 40 percent of these children are ``lost'' in the system. \n     Difficult renewal policies and reenrollment barriers make \n     seamless coverage in SCHIP unattainable. Studies indicate \n     that as many as 67 percent of children who were eligible but \n     not enrolled for SCHIP had applied for coverage but were \n     denied due to procedural issues.\n       (H) While the medicaid program and SCHIP expansions to date \n     have done much to offset what otherwise would have been a \n     significant loss of coverage among children because of \n     declining access to employer coverage, the shortcomings of \n     previous expansions, such as the failure to enroll all \n     eligible children and caps on enrollment in SCHIP because of \n     under-funding, also are clear.\n\n    TITLE I--EXPANDED COVERAGE OF CHILDREN UNDER MEDICAID AND SCHIP\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. SMITH submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nhim to the bill S. 1955, to amend title I of the Employee Retirement \nSecurity Act of 1974 and the Public Health Service Act to expand health \ncare access and reduce costs through the creation of small business \nhealth plans and through modernization of the health insurance \nmarketplace; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Local Law Enforcement \n     Enhancement Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The incidence of violence motivated by the actual or \n     perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, \n     sexual orientation, or disability of the victim poses a \n     serious national problem.\n       (2) Such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of \n     communities and is deeply divisive.\n       (3) State and local authorities are now and will continue \n     to be responsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority \n     of violent crimes in the United States, including violent \n     crimes motivated by bias. These authorities can carry out \n     their responsibilities more effectively with greater Federal \n     assistance.\n       (4) Existing Federal law is inadequate to address this \n     problem.\n       (5) The prominent characteristic of a violent crime \n     motivated by bias is that it devastates not just the actual \n     victim and the family and friends of the victim, but \n     frequently savages the community sharing the traits that \n     caused the victim to be selected.\n       (6) Such violence substantially affects interstate commerce \n     in many ways, including--\n       (A) by impeding the movement of members of targeted groups \n     and forcing such members to move across State lines to escape \n     the incidence or risk of such violence; and\n       (B) by preventing members of targeted groups from \n     purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining \n     employment, or participating in other commercial activity.\n       (7) Perpetrators cross State lines to commit such violence.\n       (8) Channels, facilities, and instrumentalities of \n     interstate commerce are used to facilitate the commission of \n     such violence.\n       (9) Such violence is committed using articles that have \n     traveled in interstate commerce.\n       (10) For generations, the institutions of slavery and \n     involuntary servitude were defined by the race, color, and \n     ancestry of those held in bondage. Slavery and involuntary \n     servitude were enforced, both prior to and after the adoption \n     of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, through widespread public and private violence \n     directed at persons because of their race, color, or \n     ancestry, or perceived race, color, or ancestry. Accordingly, \n     eliminating racially motivated violence is an important means \n     of eliminating, to the extent possible, the badges, \n     incidents, and relics of slavery and involuntary \n     servitude.\n       (11) Both at the time when the 13th, 14th, and 15th \n     amendments to the Constitution of the United States were \n     adopted, and continuing to date, members of certain religious \n     and national origin groups were and are perceived to be \n     distinct ``races''. Thus, in order to eliminate, to the \n     extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of \n     slavery, it is necessary to prohibit assaults on the basis of \n     real or perceived religions or national origins, at least to \n     the extent such religions or national origins were regarded \n     as races at the time of the adoption of the 13th, 14th, and \n     15th amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n       (12) Federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes \n     motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and local \n     authorities to work together as partners in the investigation \n     and prosecution of such crimes.\n       (13) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is \n     sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in nature as \n     to warrant Federal assistance to States and local \n     jurisdictions.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF HATE CRIME.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``hate crime'' has the same meaning \n     as in section 280003(a) of the Violent Crime Control and Law \n     Enforcement Act of 1994 (28 U.S.C. 994 note).\n\n     SEC. 4. SUPPORT FOR CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS \n                   BY STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.\n\n       (a) Assistance Other Than Financial Assistance.--\n       (1) In general.--At the request of a law enforcement \n     official of a State or Indian tribe; the Attorney General may \n     provide technical, forensic, prosecutorial, or any other form \n     of assistance in the criminal investigation or prosecution of \n     any crime that--\n       (A) constitutes a crime of violence (as defined in section \n     16 of title 18, United States Code);\n       (B) constitutes a felony under the laws of the State or \n     Indian tribe; and\n       (C) is motivated by prejudice based on the race, color, \n     religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or \n     disability of the victim, or is a violation of the hate crime \n     laws of the State or Indian tribe.\n       (2) Priority.--In providing assistance under paragraph (1), \n     the Attorney General shall give priority to crimes committed \n     by offenders who have committed crimes in more than 1 State \n     and to rural jurisdictions that have difficulty covering the \n     extraordinary expenses relating to the investigation or \n     prosecution of the crime.\n       (b) Grants.--\n       In general.--The Attorney General may award grants to \n     assist State, local, and Indian law enforcement officials \n     with the extraordinary expenses associated with the \n     investigation and prosecution of hate crimes.\n       (2) Office of justice programs.--In implementing the grant \n     program, the Office of Justice Programs shall work closely \n     with the funded jurisdictions to ensure that the concerns and \n     needs of all affected parties, including community groups and \n     schools, colleges, and universities, are addressed through \n     the local infrastructure developed under the grants.\n       (3) Application.--\n       (A) In general.--Each State that desires a grant under this \n     subsection shall submit an application to the Attorney \n     General at such time, in such manner, and accompanied by or \n     containing such information as the Attorney General shall \n     reasonably require.\n       (B) Date for submission.--Applications submitted pursuant \n     to subparagraph (A) shall be submitted during the 60-day \n     period beginning on a date that the Attorney General shall \n     prescribe.\n\n[[Page S4226]]\n\n       (C) Requirements.--A State or political subdivision of a \n     State or tribal official applying for assistance under this \n     subsection shall--\n       (i) describe the extraordinary purposes for which the grant \n     is needed;\n       (ii) certify that the State; political subdivision, or \n     Indian tribe lacks the resources necessary to investigate or \n     prosecute the hate crime;\n       (iii) demonstrate that, in developing a plan to implement \n     the grant, the State, political subdivision, or tribal \n     official has consulted and coordinated with nonprofit, \n     nongovernmental victim services programs that have experience \n     in providing services to victims of hate crimes; and\n       (iv) certify that any Federal funds received under this \n     subsection will be used to supplement, not supplant, non-\n     Federal funds that would otherwise be available for \n     activities funded under this subsection.\n       (4) Deadline.--An application for a grant under this \n     subsection shall be approved or disapproved by the Attorney \n     General not later than 30 business days after the date on \n     which the Attorney General receives the application.\n       (5) Grant amount.--A grant under this subsection shall not \n     exceed $100,000 for any single jurisdiction within a 1 year \n     period.\n       (6) Report.--Not later than December 31, 2006, the Attorney \n     General shall submit to Congress a report describing the \n     applications submitted for grants under this subsection, the \n     award of such grants, and the purposes for which the grant \n     amounts were expended.\n       (7) Authorization of appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this subsection $5,000,000 \n     for each of fiscal years 2006 and 2007.\n\n     SEC. 5.

AUTHORIZATION FOR ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL TO ASSIST \n                   STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Department \n     of the Treasury and the Department of Justice, including the \n     Community Relations Service, for fiscal years 2006, 2007, and \n     2008 such sums as are necessary to increase the number of \n     personnel to prevent and respond to alleged violations of \n     section 249 of title 18, United States Code, as added by \n     section 7.\n\n     SEC. 7.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Need for universal coverage.--\n       (A) Currently, there are 9,000,000 children under the age \n     of 19 that are uninsured. One out of every 8 children are \n     uninsured while 1 in 5 Hispanic children and 1 in 7 African \n     American children are uninsured. Three-quarters, \n     approximately 6,800,000, of these children are eligible but \n     not enrolled in the medicaid program or the State children's \n     health insurance program (SCHIP). Long-range studies found \n     that 1 in 3 children went without health insurance for all or \n     part of 2002 and 2003.\n       (B) Low-income children are 3 times as likely as children \n     in higher income families to be uninsured. It is estimated \n     that 65 percent of uninsured children have at least 1 parent \n     working full time over the course of the year.\n       (C) It is estimated that 50 percent of all legal immigrant \n     children in families with income that is less than 200 \n     percent of the Federal poverty line are uninsured. In States \n     without programs to cover immigrant children, 57 percent of \n     non-citizen children are uninsured.\n       (D) Children in the Southern and Western parts of the \n     United States were nearly 1.7 times more likely to be \n     uninsured than children in the Northeast. In the Northeast, \n     9.4 percent of children are uninsured while in the Midwest, \n     8.3 percent are uninsured. The South's rate of uninsured \n     children is 14.3 percent while the West has an uninsured rate \n     of 13 percent.\n       (E) Children's health care needs are neglected in the \n     United States. One-quarter of young children in the United \n     States are not fully up to date on their basic immunizations. \n     One-third of children with chronic asthma do not get a \n     prescription for the necessary medications to manage the \n     disease.\n       (F) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, nearly \\1/2\\ of all uninsured children have not \n     had a well-child visit in the past year. One out of every 5 \n     children has problems accessing needed care, and 1 out of \n     every 4 children do not receive annual dental exams. One in 6 \n     uninsured children had a delayed or unmet medical need in the \n     past year. Minority children are less likely to receive \n     proven treatments such as prescription medications to treat \n     chronic disease.\n       (G) There are 7,600,000 young adults between the ages of 19 \n     and 20. In the United States, approximately 28 percent, or \n     2,100,000 individuals, of this group are uninsured.\n       (H) Chronic illness and disability among children are on \n     the rise. Children most at risk for chronic illness and \n     disability are children who are most likely to be poor and \n     uninsured.\n       (2) Role of the medicaid and state children's health \n     insurance programs.--\n       (A) The medicaid program and SCHIP serve as a crucial \n     health safety net for 30,000,000 children. During the recent \n     economic downturn and the highest number of uninsured \n     individuals ever recorded in the United States, the medicaid \n     program and SCHIP offset losses in employer-sponsored \n     coverage. While the number of children living in low-income \n     families increased by 2,000,000 between 2000 and 2003, the \n     number of uninsured children fell due to the medicaid program \n     and SCHIP.\n       (B) In 2003, 25,000,000 children were enrolled in the \n     medicaid program, accounting for \\1/2\\ of all enrollees and \n     only 19 percent of total program costs.\n       (C) The medicaid program and SCHIP do more than just fill \n     in the gaps. Gains in public coverage have reduced the \n     percentage of low-income uninsured by a \\1/3\\ from 1997 to \n     2003. In addition, a recent study found that publicly-insured \n     children are more likely to obtain medical care, preventive \n     care and dental care than similar low-income privately-\n     insured children.\n       (D) Publicly funded programs such as the medicaid program \n     and SCHIP actually improve children's health. Children who \n     are currently insured by public programs are in better health \n     than they were a year ago. Expansion of coverage for children \n     and pregnant women under the medicaid program and SCHIP \n     reduces rates of avoidable hospitalizations by 22 percent.\n       (E) Studies have found that children enrolled in public \n     insurance programs experienced a 68 percent improvement in \n     measures of school performance.\n       (F) Despite the success of expansions in general under the \n     medicaid program and SCHIP, due to current budget \n     constraints, many States have stopped doing aggressive \n     outreach and have raised premiums and cost-sharing \n     requirements on families under these programs. In addition, 8 \n     States stopped enrollment in SCHIP for a period of time \n     between April 2003 and July 2004. As a result, SCHIP \n     enrollment fell by 200,000 children for the first time in the \n     program's history.\n       (G) It is estimated that nearly 50 percent of children \n     covered through SCHIP do not remain in the program due to \n     reenrollment barriers. A recent study found that between 10 \n     and 40 percent of these children are ``lost'' in the system. \n     Difficult renewal policies and reenrollment barriers make \n     seamless coverage in SCHIP unattainable. Studies indicate \n     that as many as 67 percent of children who were eligible but \n     not enrolled for SCHIP had applied for coverage but were \n     denied due to procedural issues.\n       (H) While the medicaid program and SCHIP expansions to date \n     have done much to offset what otherwise would have been a \n     significant loss of coverage among children because of \n     declining access to employer coverage, the shortcomings of \n     previous expansions, such as the failure to enroll all \n     eligible children and caps on enrollment in SCHIP because of \n     under-funding, also are clear.\n\n    TITLE I--EXPANDED COVERAGE OF CHILDREN UNDER MEDICAID AND SCHIP\n\n     SEC. 101.
