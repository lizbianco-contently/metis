Mr. President, before I suggest the absence of a \nquorum, will the time run during the quorum call?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It will be equally divided.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to express my pleasure and \nsupport for the confirmation of Ms. Renee Bumb to the U.S. District \nCourt of New Jersey.\n  Ms. Bumb is one of four accomplished individuals from New Jersey who \nhave been nominated to vacancies on the district court.\n  Just before we left for the Memorial Day recess, the Senate \nunanimously confirmed Judge Susan Wigenton for the district court. \nJudge Wigenton has been a Federal magistrate judge since 1997. She also \nworked at a law firm, served as a public defender in Asbury Park, NJ. \nShe has been a first-rate magistrate judge. She will be an excellent \ndistrict court judge. She served the public well. We are pleased to \nhave her join the bench in New Jersey.\n  Now we discuss today's nominee, Renee Bumb. She is exceptionally well \nqualified and will be an excellent addition to the court. She is \ncurrently attorney in charge of the Camden--our southernmost city--U.S. \nAttorney's Office. She is a gifted prosecutor and has handled cases \nranging from drug trafficking to white-collar crime.\n  For 6 years, Miss Bumb has supervised all of the attorneys in the \nCamden U.S. Attorney's Office. At the same time, she has tried cases \nherself, especially those dealing with public corruption.\n  Ms. Bumb is from south Jersey. We are pleased she will be sitting as \na Federal judge in Camden. There have been\n\n[[Page S5436]]\n\nopenings there for some time. The people of south Jersey deserve judges \nwho understand that area of the State and the unique communities \ntherein. Ms. Bumb fits that bill.\n  When people look at tiny New Jersey on the map, they envision a small \nState but they are wrong. While we are relatively small geographically, \nwe have the 10th largest population in the country. New Jersey is the \nmost densely populated State in the country. While physical distance \nbetween north and south Jersey is not significant, there are \ndifferences between the two areas politically, economically, and \nculturally. The Federal Government needs to respect these distinctions.\n  Thus, we have Renee Bumb, who is a judge from South Jersey. She will \ndispense justice with the unique character her community brings--not \nhaving the large cities, and with the population density much less than \nthe north. They also lack some of the services immediately available in \nthe northern part of our State. Ms. Bumb will represent the Federal \nGovernment and represent the Judiciary extremely well.\n  At the same time, we have two other excellent nominees for vacancies \non the U.S. District Court for New Jersey. One is Noel Hillman, another \nis Peter Sheridan. These nominees have been approved by the Judiciary \nCommittee. They are ready to go. We should not delay the confirmation \nof these nominations past this week.\n  I offer thanks to Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Leahy for \nmoving these nominees so efficiently through the process. I am \nconfident these four individuals will serve the people of New Jersey \nextremely well on the Federal bench. They will bring distinction to the \ncourt. We urge their quick confirmation in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Renee Bumb to be a U.S. district judge for the District \nof New Jersey. I appreciate the opportunity to speak about this \noutstanding individual that the White House has selected to serve on \nthe Federal bench.\n  I take a moment to share with our colleagues a few of her \naccomplishments. Ms. Bumb is a graduate of Ohio State University and \nthe University of Chicago Graduate School of International Relations. \nShe attended my own alma mater, Rutgers University School of Law in \nNewark, where she served as editor in chief of the law review and has \nbeen a loyal New Jerseyan ever since.\n  Ms. Bumb's reputation in the southern New Jersey legal community is \nboth well known and exceptional. As assistant U.S. attorney, Ms. Bumb \nhas been known for many efforts and is a staunch anticorruption \nprosecutor. She is best known for her prosecution of the former Camden \nCity mayor. She has twice received the Director's Award, the highest \naward given to an assistant U.S. attorney presented by the U.S. \nAttorney General. Ms. Bumb is currently the attorney in charge of the \nU.S. Attorney's Office in Camden, NJ.\n\n  The American Bar Association has rated Ms. Bumb as well qualified for \nthe position to which she has been nominated. It is a view I share as \nwell.\n  I would also like to talk about the package of four nominees for \ndistrict judge of New Jersey that Ms. Bumb is a part of. It is a \npackage that is balanced in every sense of the word, from geographic to \ngender perspectives, as well as to quality. I should note that Ms. Bumb \nis not the first nominee of that package to be confirmed by the Senate. \nThe day before the Memorial Day district work period began, the Senate \nconfirmed Susan Wigenton to be a district court judge. Judge Wigenton \ngraduated from Norfolk State University and the Marshall-Wythe School \nof Law from the College of William and Mary. She has spent the last 8 \nyears doing an exceptional job as a U.S. magistrate judge for the \ndistrict of New Jersey, and she will do an exceptional job in the \ndistrict court.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Lautenberg, the chair and \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, and the leadership in \nbringing the nominations of the other two nominees, Noel Hillman and \nPeter Sheridan, to the Senate floor for confirmation votes. This entire \nfour-nominee package is one that every New Jerseyan can and should be \nproud of.\n  There truly is no higher calling than the calling of public service. \nThat is why I am pleased to see people of this quality who are willing \nto serve our Nation in the administration of justice. The confirmation \nof a judge to a lifetime appointment is a vital responsibility given to \nthis body by the Constitution and one I take very seriously. I join my \ncolleague, Senator Lautenberg, in support of Ms. Bumb and her \nconfirmation. I look forward to her continued service to our State and \nNation. I am confident she will put our shared Rutgers education to \ngood use.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Renee M. Bumb to \nserve on the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we resume consideration of judicial \nnominations today, it is worth taking stock of the mileposts we have \npassed and those we are working toward. Chairman Specter has now \nchaired the Judiciary Committee for 17 months. I congratulate him on \nthat. The committee has been extremely active, and we have achieved a \ngood deal working together.\n  We reported a bill to provide compensation to asbestos victims and \nbegan its consideration in the Senate. Just recently, we joined \ntogether to introduce a new version of our legislation, to note the \npassing of our friend Judge Becker and to recommit ourselves to \nfinishing this bipartisan task to provide fair compensation to asbestos \nvictims and reduce the litigation burden that asbestos cases have \nimposed on our civil justice system.\n  We worked together to report a comprehensive immigration reform bill \nand continued to work with Senators Kennedy, McCain, Hagel, Martinez, \nand others in a bipartisan coalition that culminated in Senate passage \nof S. 2611 late last month. We look forward to help from the President \nto enact that measure later this year.\n  We worked together to revive and reauthorize the expiring provisions \nof the USA PATRIOT Act. I supported the Judiciary Committee and Senate \nbill. When our bill was hijacked, I appreciated Chairman Specter's \nefforts to restore some balance and his efforts to work with those of \nus seeking improvements. Sadly, the final product insisted upon by the \nBush-Cheney administration and House Republicans was not one I could \nsupport.\n  We are working together now in a bipartisan, bicameral partnership to \nreauthorize the expiring provisions of the Voting Rights Act. We need \nto complete hearings on our bill without further delay, and I hope that \nwe can report our bipartisan bill by mid-June so that these important \nprovisions, including those in section 203 providing voting access for \nlanguage minorities, can be reauthorized this year.\n  We worked together to report privacy legislation to the Senate last \nNovember. Senate action on our bill is overdue. The recent theft of \nmillions of veterans' personal information and the growing problem of \nidentification theft remind us how important these issues are for so \nmany Americans.\n  We have also worked together on competitiveness issues including the \nNOPEC legislation to clarify that our antitrust laws should be applied \nto the OPEC cartel, our broader bill on windfall oil company profits, \nand our bill to end the antitrust exemption for the insurance industry.\n  We have made progress on several issues, but our work is far from \nover. There are only 13 weeks left in this legislative session of the \nSenate and we still have much that needs to get done. The Republican-\ncontrolled House and Senate have yet to enact a Federal budget and are \nin violation of the statutory deadline of April 15. We have yet to pass \na single appropriations bill, and we are required by law to pass 13. We \nhave yet to reconcile and enact the emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill that has been pending for months and that includes \nfunding for Iraq and Katrina victims and other matters. We have yet to \nreconcile and enact lobbying reform and ethics legislation. We have yet \nto deal with the skyrocketing cost of gasoline. We have yet to \nreconcile and enact a bipartisan and comprehensive immigration reform \nbill. We need to enact stronger privacy protection legislation, \nespecially in the wake of the theft of information on more than 26 \nmillion veterans. We have yet to enact stem cell\n\n[[Page S5437]]\n\nresearch legislation. We need to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act. We \nhave yet to enact patent reform legislation. And I hope that we will \ntake up, pass and enact our asbestos compensation legislation and my \nmeasure to speed lifesaving medicine to those in desperate need.\n  I have urged that we exercise effective oversight of the executive \nbranch, and I have supported Chairman Specter's efforts to get to the \nbottom of the NSA's unprecedented program of domestic spying on \nAmericans without warrants. We need to make more progress on this \nimportant front and to restore accountability and check and balances in \nour Government.\n  One of the most important checks and balances to unprecedented \noverreaching by the Bush-Cheney executive branch is an independent \njudiciary. With respect to judicial nominations, we worked together in \nconnection with the nominations of Chief Justice Roberts, whom I came \nto support, and Justice Alito, whom I did not. I have sought to \nexpedite consideration of qualified, consensus nominees and urged the \nPresident to work with us to make selections that unite all Americans.\n  Today we will proceed to confirm another lifetime appointment to the \nFederal courts in New Jersey. With the support of the New Jersey \nSenators, we were able to confirm Judge Susan Davis Wigenton just \nbefore the last recess. Her nomination, as well as the nomination of \nRenee Marie Bumb that we are considering today, were reported favorably \nby the Judiciary Committee to the Senate more than a month ago.\n  Rather than proceed to those nominations promptly, the Republican \nleadership of the Senate delayed their consideration while proceeding \nover time with circuit court nominations. I was cooperative in \nproceeding to the confirmation of Judge Milan Smith to the Ninth \nCircuit. His confirmation demonstrated, again, that we can work \ntogether. I was pleased for his brother, the Senator from Oregon, and \nbelieve that he will be a fine judge.\n  Regrettably, the Senate Republican leadership chose not to move to \nany of the four district court nominations from New Jersey, or the two \nnominations to district courts in Michigan that their home State \nDemocratic Senators have reached out to support. Instead, they forced \ndebate on another controversial nomination, that of a White \nHouse insider selected for a lifetime position on the DC Circuit as a \nreward for his loyalty to President Bush. I did not support \nconfirmation of Brett Kavanaugh. That was the fight that the Republican \nleader had promised the narrow special interest groups of the rightwing \nof his party.\n\n  The President and Senate Republican leadership continue to pick \nfights over judicial nominations rather than focus on filing vacancies. \nJudicial vacancies have now grown to more than 50 from the lowest \nvacancy rate in decades. More than half these vacancies are without a \nnominee. The Congressional Research Service has recently released a \nstudy showing that this President has been the slowest in decades to \nnominate and the Republican Senate among the slowest to act. If they \nwould concentrate on the needs of the courts, our Federal justice \nsystem and the needs of the American people, we would be much further \nalong.\n  Still, we have passed a milestone. When the Senate votes today to \nconfirm Renee Bumb as a district court judge, the Republican-controlled \nSenate will have this year confirmed 17 judicial nominations. That was \nthe total number of judges confirmed in the 1996 congressional session, \nwhen Republicans controlled the Senate and stalled the nominations of \nPresident Clinton. In the 1996 session, however, Republicans would not \nconfirm a single appellate court judge. All 17 confirmations were \ndistrict court nominees. That is the only session I can remember in \nwhich the Senate has simply refused to consider a single appellate \ncourt nomination. That was part of their pocket filibuster strategy to \nstall and maintain vacancies so that a Republican President could pack \nthe courts and tilt them decidedly to the right. In the important DC \nCircuit, the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh was the culmination the \nRepublicans' decade-long attempt to pack the DC Circuit that began with \nthe stalling of Merrick Garland's nomination in 1996 and continued with \nthe blocking of President Clinton's other well-qualified nominees, \nElena Kagan and Allen Snyder.\n  Of course, with the confirmation today, we will tie that record of 17 \nconfirmations for the year. It is June, and we have a few more weeks in \nwhich to make progress. There remain four more district court nominees \non the calendar whose consideration could be scheduled for debate and \nvote but are being delayed--not by Democratic opposition--but by \nRepublican control. There is also another circuit court nominee on the \ncalendar who was reported with Democratic support from the Judiciary \nCommittee and whose confirmation could be scheduled for debate and \nvote. Successful consideration of those five additional nominees will \nbring the Senate's total judicial confirmations to 22, thereby matching \nthe total achieved all last year.\n  But the road ahead is likely to be rocky. In the runup to the \nKavanaugh nomination debate, we saw that the Senate Republican \nleadership is apparently heeding the advice of The Wall Street Journal \neditorial page, which wrote, ``[a] filibuster fight would be exactly \nthe sort of political battle Republicans need to energize conservative \nvoters after their recent months of despond.'' Rich Lowery, editor of \nthe conservative National Review, listed a fight over judges as one of \nthe ways President Bush could revive his political fortunes, writing \nthat he should, ``[p]ush for the confirmation of his circuit judges \nthat are pending. Talk about them by name. The G.O.P. wins judiciary \nfights.''\n  Republican Senators are relishing picking fights over controversial \njudicial nominees. Senator Thune has said, ``A good fight on judges \ndoes nothing but energize our base . . . . Right now our folks are \nfeeling a little flat.'' Senator Cornyn has said, ``I think this is \nexcellent timing. From a political standpoint, when we talk about \njudges, we win.'' On May 8, 2006, The New York Times reported: \n``Republicans are itching for a good election-year fight. Now they are \nabout to get one: a reprise of last year's Senate showdown over \njudges.'' The Washington Post reported on May 10: ``Republicans had \nrevived debate on Kavanaugh and another Bush appellate nominee, \nTerrence Boyle, in hopes of changing the pre-election subject from \nIraq, high gasoline prices and bribery scandals.''\n  We should not stand idly by as Republicans choose to use lifetime \nfederal judgeships for partisan political advantage. In a May 11, 2006, \neditorial The Tennessean wrote:\n\n       ``[T]he nation should look with complete dismay at the \n     blatantly political angle on nominations being advocated by \n     Senate Republicans now. . . . Republicans are girding for a \n     fight on judicial nominees for no reason other than to be \n     girding for a fight. They have admitted as much in public \n     comments. . . . In other words, picking a public fight over \n     judicial nominees is, in their minds, the right thing to do \n     because it's the politically right thing to do. . . . Now, \n     Republicans are advocating a brawl for openly political \n     purposes. The appointment of judges deserves far more respect \n     than to be an admitted election-year ploy. . . . It should be \n     beneath the Senate to have such a serious matter subjected to \n     nothing but a tool for political gain.''\n\n  On May 3, 2006, The New York Times wrote in an editorial: ``The \nRepublicans have long used judicial nominations as a way of placating \nthe far right of their party, and it appears that with President Bush \nsinking in the polls, they now want to offer up some new appeals court \njudges to their conservative base.''\n  Consider the President's nomination of Judge Terrence Boyle to the \nFourth Circuit. We have learned from recent news reports that, as a \nsitting U.S. district judge and while a circuit court nominee, Judge \nBoyle ruled on multiple cases involving corporations in which he held \ninvestments. In at least one instance, he is alleged to have bought \nGeneral Electric stock while presiding over a lawsuit in which General \nElectric was accused of illegally denying disability benefits to a \nlong-time employee. Two months later, he ruled in favor of GE and \ndenied the employee's claim for long term and pension disability \nbenefits. Whether it turns out that Judge Boyle broke Federal law or \ncanons of judicial ethics, these types of conflicts of interest have no \nplace on the Federal bench. Certainly, they should not be rewarded\n\n[[Page S5438]]\n\nwith a promotion to the Fourth Circuit. Certainly, they should be \ninvestigated.\n  The President should heed the call of North Carolina Police \nBenevolent Association, the North Carolina Troopers' Association, the \nPolice Benevolent Associations from South Carolina and Virginia, the \nNational Association of Police Organizations, the Professional Fire \nFighters and Paramedics of North Carolina, as well as the advice of \nSenator John Edwards, and withdraw his ill-advised nomination of Judge \nTerrence Boyle. Law enforcement from North Carolina and law enforcement \nfrom across the country oppose the nomination. Civil rights groups \noppose the nomination. Those knowledgeable and respectful of judicial \nethics oppose this nomination. This nomination has been pending on the \ncalendar in the Republican-controlled Senate since June of last year \nwhen it was forced out of the Committee on a party-line vote. It should \nbe withdrawn.\n\n  Also on the calendar is the nomination of William Myers to the Ninth \nCircuit. This is another administration insider and lobbyist whose \nrecord has made him extremely controversial. I opposed this nomination \nwhen it was considered by the Judiciary Committee in March 2005. He was \na nominee who the so-called Gang of 14 expressly listed as someone for \nwhom they made no commitment to vote for cloture, and with good reason. \nHis anti-environmental record is reason enough to oppose his \nconfirmation. His lack of independence is another. If anyone sought to \nproceed to this nomination, there would be a need to explore his \nconnections with the lobbying scandals associated with the Interior \nDepartment and Jack Abramoff. This nomination should also be withdrawn.\n  A few months ago, the President withdrew the nomination of Judge \nJames Payne to the Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit after \ninformation became public about that nominee's rulings in a number of \ncases in which he appears, like Judge Boyle, to have had conflicts of \ninterest. Those conflicts were pointed out not by the administration's \nscreening process or by the ABA but by journalists.\n  Judge Payne joins a long list of nominations by this President that \nhave been withdrawn. Among the more well known are Bernard Kerik to \nhead the Department of Homeland Security and Harriet Miers to the \nSupreme Court. It was, as I recall, reporting in a national magazine \nthat doomed the Kerik nomination. It was opposition within the \nPresident's own party that doomed the Miers nomination.\n  During the last few months, President Bush also withdrew the \nnominations of Judge Henry Saad to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit and Judge Daniel P. Ryan to the Eastern District of Michigan \nafter his ABA rating was downgraded.\n  It is not as if we have not been victimized before by the White \nHouse's poor vetting of important nominations. If the White House had \nits way, we would already have confirmed Claude Allen to the Fourth \nCircuit. He is the Bush administration insider who recently resigned \nhis position as a top domestic policy adviser to the President. \nUltimately, we learned why he resigned when he was arrested for \nfraudulent conduct over an extended period of time. Had we Democrats \nnot objected to the White House attempt to shift a circuit judgeship \nfrom Maryland to Virginia, someone now the subject of a criminal \nprosecution for the equivalent of stealing from retail stores would be \na sitting judge on the Fourth Circuit confirmed with a Republican \nrubberstamp.\n  Yet another controversial pending nomination is that of Norman Randy \nSmith to the Ninth Circuit. This nomination is another occasion on \nwhich this President is seeking to steal a circuit court seat from one \nState and reassign it to another one, one with Republican Senators. \nThat is wrong. I support Senators Feinstein and Boxer in their \nopposition to this tactic. I have suggested a way to resolve two \ndifficult situations if the President were to renominate Mr. Smith to \nfill the Idaho vacancy on the Ninth Circuit, instead of a vacancy for a \nCalifornia seat. Regrettably, the White House has not followed up on my \nsuggestion.\n  A complicit Republican-controlled Senate remains all too eager to act \nas a rubberstamp for the Bush-Cheney administration. The nomination of \nKavanaugh was one of the few to be downgraded by the ABA upon further \nreview. Until the Republican-controlled Senate proceeded to confirm \nthis White House insider, I cannot recall anyone being confirmed after \nsuch a development. Another first, and another problematic confirmation \nthat ill serves the American people.\n  Another troubling nomination is that of William James Haynes to the \nFourth Circuit, which has been pending in the Republican-controlled \nSenate without action for 3 years. Mr. Haynes is the general counsel at \nthe Defense Department and was deeply involved developing the torture \npolicies, detention and interrogation policies, military tribunals, and \nother controversial aspects of the manner in which this administration \nhas proceeded unilaterally to make mistakes and exceed its legal \nauthority. Concerns about the Haynes nomination may not be confined to \nDemocratic Senators, according to recent press reports.\n  I trust that the Senate will not repeat the mistake it made before. \nIt was only after Jay Bybee was confirmed to a lifetime appointment to \nthe Ninth Circuit that we learned of his involvement with the infamous \nBybee memo seeking to justify torture and degrading treatment. I had \nasked him what he had worked on while head of the Department of \nJustice's Office of Legal Counsel, but he had refused to respond. This \nformer Defense Department and Justice Department insider now sits on \nthe Ninth Circuit for life.\n  Finally, there is the more recent nomination of Michael Wallace to a \nvacancy on the Fifth Circuit. Mr. Wallace received the first ABA rating \nof unanimously ``not qualified'' that I have seen for a circuit court \nnominee since President Reagan. Yet that is one of the controversial \nnominations we can expect the Republican Senate to target for action \ngiven their track record.\n  Working together we could do better. I made the point when in the 17 \nmonths I chaired the Judiciary Committee we proceeded to confirm 100 \njudicial nominees of President Bush. I urge the White House to work \nwith us. I hope that the Republican-controlled Senate will stop \nrubberstamping this President's nominees and stop using controversial \njudicial nominations to score partisan political points. Our courts are \ntoo important. The rights and liberties of the American people are too \nimportant. The courts are the only check and balance left to protect \nthe American people and provide some oversight of the actions of this \nPresident.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The hour of 10:20 having arrived, the vote is to occur on the \nnomination.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Renee Marie Bumb, of New Jersey, to be a \nUnited States District Judge for the District of New Jersey?\n  On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Tennessee (Mr. Frist), the Senator from Montana (Mr. \nBurns), the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo), the Senator from New Mexico \n(Mr. Domenici), the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Hagel), the Senator from \nUtah (Mr. Hatch), and the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Talent).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nFrist) would have voted ``yea.''\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I would like to call everybody's \nattention to the special day that today is. Today is the 6th day of \nJune. Sixty-two years ago today on the shores of France and Normandy, \nOmaha Beach, Sword Beach, American troops and allied forces invaded \nFrance, pushed back the German Army, pushed through the Battle of the \nBulge, and ultimately into Germany, and today, you and I enjoy freedom \nand liberty in this country, as Europe enjoys its freedom, and as, in \nfact, the world enjoys its freedom because of what those brave men and \nwomen did.\n  This past week, I had a unique occasion to travel with the chairman \nof the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senator Craig from Idaho, and with \nGEN Jack Nicholson, who is the chairman of the American Battle \nMonuments Commission. We traveled through Europe and northern Africa \npaying Memorial Day tributes to the men and women buried on those \nforeign shores.\n  I have to tell my colleagues, it was a life-altering experience for \nme. I am a patriotic American. I love this country more than anything \non the face of this Earth. I have teared up more than once at the \nfuneral of a friend who died in the service of this country. But I have \nnever seen the outpouring of love and respect for our country or for \nour servicemen than I saw in the Netherlands or in Belgium or outside \nof Paris or at Bellewood outside of Paris or in Tunisia at the American \ncemetery in northern Africa.\n  I think it is appropriate for us to memorialize today what those of \nus who traveled on this trip saw to hopefully inspire other Members of \nthe Senate, and hopefully every American at one point in time in their \nlife, to travel to these marvelous memorials. I have been in elected \noffice for most of the last 30 years. I have done more Memorial Day \nceremonies than one would want to count. They have all been beautiful, \nthey have all been meaningful, but, quite frankly, they usually aren't \nvery well attended because Americans more often than not take Memorial \nDay as a 3-day vacation or a 3-day weekend. But I would like to tell \nyou what the people of Margraten in the Netherlands take Memorial Day \nas.\n  When we went to the American cemetery in the Netherlands and saw the \nover 6,000 graves of the American men and women who died in liberating \nthe Netherlands, we were moved. We were more moved by the fact that \nevery one of those graves is adopted by a citizen of the Netherlands \nwho cares for that grave, leaves flowers at that grave, and attends the \nceremonies on Memorial Day, the American Memorial Day, which we \nconduct. On that day in the Netherlands there were over 7,000 \ncitizens--7,000 Dutch--who came to pay tribute to the men and women of \nthe United States of America who died on their soil so they could be \nfree. The royal Dutch Air Force did a missing man fly-over formation, \nand the senior men's choir of Holland sang ``God Bless America.'' It \nwas a moving scene unlike anything I have personally seen. It renewed, \nfor me, the faith and pride I have in all that is good about the United \nStates of America.\n  Following that visit, we went to Normandy. We saw the monument the \nFrench had erected to the Rangers who stormed the Normandy cliffs and \nmoved in and rooted out the Germans. We went to Omaha Beach and saw \nfirsthand where the American troops came across, where the Canadian \ntroops came across, where the British troops came across. We saw where \nin one day 2,500 men of America died on the beaches of Normandy so that \nall of us today can live in freedom and in hope and in peace.\n  I commend Chairman Craig for making this delegation. We found out we \nwere the first delegation that anyone could remember to ever do what we \ndid. Not only do I hope we are not the last, I hope it is an annual \noccasion where Members of the Senate go and pay their respects to the \nbrave Americans who died in the great wars of Europe, World War I and \nWorld War II; for without them, we would not enjoy what we do today, \nnor would the world enjoy the peace and the freedom and the liberty \nthat it treasures and it enjoys.\n  So on this day of June 6, 2006, 62 years after 2,500 Americans died \nand tens of thousands of Americans pursued the German Army in France, I \nknow what I will do tonight when I say my prayers. I will say a special \nprayer for those folks I never knew but without whom I never could have \nlived the life that I have, and I will say thanks. I will repeat the \npledge I made to myself on the cemetery of Normandy. I said: Before I \ndie, I am going to see to it that my children and my grandchildren get \nto visit this scene and have this experience because only through the \npreservation of the memory of what those men fought and died for will \nwe as Americans ever be able to continue to make the commitments we \nhave around the world to preserve liberty, preserve democracy, and \nprotect the people of the world's right to determine their own future \nand their own peace and their own liberty.\n  So, Mr. President, on this day, June 6, 2006, I thank God for the men \nand women of the U.S. military, for the leadership of the 20th century, \nand pray that all of us will have the courage they had to continue to \npreserve the liberty we all treasure and enjoy.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/06/senate-section/article/S5439-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5439-S5450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            MARRIAGE PROTECTION AMENDMENT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are now talking about S.J. Res. 1, the \nProtection of Marriage Amendment. We\n\n[[Page S5440]]\n\nhave an allocation of time that has been set out for the Republican \nside. Later on there will be an allocation, I understand, of the \nDemocrats' time.\n  I will allocate myself 20 minutes. Would the Presiding Officer notify \nme when I have used 17 minutes of that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will notify the Senator.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, respect for the democratic process compels \nthis Congress to protect traditional marriage in the face of a \ncoordinated effort to redefine marriage through the courts.\n  Marriage, the union between a man and a woman, has been the \nfoundation of every civilization in human history. It is incorporated \ninto the fabric of our culture and civic life. It is the platform on \nwhich children, families, and communities are nurtured.\n  Unfortunately, the U.S. Constitution is being amended to reflect a \nnew definition of marriage, not by democratically elected Members of \nCongress but by unaccountable and unelected judges.\n  As a result, I introduced S.J. Res. 1, an amendment to the \nConstitution that simply defines marriage as the ``union of a man and a \nwoman,'' while leaving State legislatures the freedom to address the \nquestion of civil unions.\n  Democracy and representative government are at the core of this \ndebate. In 2004 and 2005, voters in 14 Sates overwhelmingly passed \nconstitutional amendments protecting marriage. Today, 19 States have \nconstitutional amendments protecting marriage and another 26 have \nstatutes designed to protect traditional marriage. The will of the \npeople is clear.\n  Unfortunately, dissatisfied with the outcome of the democratic \nprocess, activists have intensified their campaign to circumvent the \ndemocratic process and redefine marriage through the courts. Currently \nnine States face lawsuits challenging traditional marriage laws. Among \nthese lawsuits are challenges to State constitutional amendments passed \nby an overwhelming majority of voters.\n  Recent decisions by activist judges not only fail to respect the \ntraditional definition of marriage, they also highlight a lack of \nrespect for the democratic process. The courts are driving a \nredefinition of marriage contrary to democratic principles.\n  The process to amend the U.S. Constitution is the most democratic in \nthe world, requiring two-thirds of Congress and three-fourths of the \nStates to ratify. It is a process the American people can trust.\n  If we fail to define marriage, the courts will not hesitate to do it \nfor us.\n  My amendment reflects my belief that the institution of marriage is \ntoo precious to surrender to the whims of a handful of unelected, \nactivist judges.\n  The will of the people should prevail.\n  Marriage is the foundation of every civilization in human history. As \nI said before, the definition of marriage crosses all bounds of race, \nreligion, culture, political party, ideology and ethnicity. Marriage is \nnot a partisan issue. Marriage is embraced and intuitively understood \nto be a union between a man and a woman by Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents alike.\n  As an expression of this cultural value, the definition of marriage \nis incorporated into the very fabric of civic policy. It is the root \nfrom which families and communities are grown. Marriage is the one bond \non which all other bonds are built.\n  Marriage is not some controversial ideology being forced upon an \nunwilling populace by the government, it is in fact the opposite. \nMarriage is the ideal held by the people and the government has long \nreflected this. The broadly embraced union of a woman and a man is \nunderstood to be the ideal union from which people live and children \nbest blossom and thrive.\n  As we have heard in hours of testimony, in eight hearings, in \nnumerous Senate committees over the last several years, marriage is a \npretty good thing. A good marriage facilitates a more stable community, \nallows kids to grow up with fewer difficulties, increases the lifespan \nand quality of life of those involved, reduces the likelihood of \nincidences of chemical abuse and violent crime, and contributes to the \noverall health of the family. It is no wonder so many single adults \nlong to be married, to raise kids, and to have families.\n  Today there are numerous efforts to redefine marriage to be something \nthat it isn't. When it comes to same-gender couples there is a problem \nof definition. Two women or two men simply do not meet the criteria for \nmarriage as it has been defined for thousands of years. Marriage is, as \nit always has been, a union between a man and a woman.\n  I believe the Framers of the Constitution felt that this would never \nbe an issue--and if they had it would have been included in the U.S. \nConstitution. Like the vast majority of Americans, it would have never \noccurred to me that the definition of marriage, or marriage itself, \nwould be the source of controversy. Not too long ago it would have been \nwholly inconceivable that this definition--this institution that is \nmarriage--would be challenged, redefined or attacked. But we are here \ntoday because it is.\n  As a result of this coordinated campaign to redefine marriage through \nthe courts, we stand here today, compelled by respect for the \ndemocratic process, to publicly debate an amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution. Again, this amendment simply reads:\n\n       Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the \n     union of a man and a woman.\n       Neither this Constitution, nor the constitution of any \n     State, shall be construed to require that marriage or the \n     legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other \n     than the union of a man and a woman.\n\n  The first sentence is straightforward: It defines marriage as an \ninstitution solely between one man and one woman--just as it has been \ndefined for thousands of years in hundreds of cultures around the \nworld.\n  The second sentence simply ensures that the people or their elected \nrepresentatives, not judges, can decide whether to confer the legal \nincidents of marriage on people. Citizens remain free to act through \ntheir legislatures to bestow whatever benefits to same-sex couples that \nthey choose. It is aimed squarely at the problem of judicial activism.\n  Just as important as what it does do, is what it does not do. I have \nsaid it time and time again and I say here again today for the record: \nThe amendment does not seek to prohibit, in any way, the lawful, \ndemocratic creation of civil unions or domestic partnerships. It does \nnot prohibit private employers from offering benefits to same-sex \ncouples. It denies no existing rights.\n  What our amendment does is to define and protect traditional marriage \nat the highest level, the U.S. Constitution. Importantly, the \nconsideration of this amendment in the Senate represents the discussion \nof marriage in America in a democratic body of elected officials. I am \nnot willing to surrender this issue to the courts.\n  I also believe it is important to make clear that on the question of \nfederalism and States' rights I stand where I always have. While an \nindisputable definition of marriage will be a part of our Constitution, \nall other questions will be left to the States.\n  Contrary to assertions of those who believe my amendment infringes on \nthe rights of the States, my amendment actually protects States' \nrights. Forty-five States have spoken with laws or constitutional \namendments designed to protect traditional marriage. Unfortunately, \nsame-sex advocates have, through the courts, systematically and \nsuccessfully trampled on laws democratically enacted in the States. If \nmarriage is redefined for anybody, it is redefined for everybody. My \namendment takes the issue out of the hands of a handful of activist \njudges and puts it squarely back in the hands of the people.\n  Now is the time for Congress to fulfill its responsibility and send a \nconstitutional amendment to the States for ratification.\n  Marrige, the union between a man and a woman, has been the foundation \nof every civilization in human history. This debate is not about \npolitics or discrimination, it is about marriage and democracy.\n  Unfortunately, the U.S. Constitution is being amended to reflect a \nnew definition of marriage--not by democratically elected Members of \nCongress but by unaccountable and unelected judges. If we fail to \ndefine marriage, the courts will not hesitate to do it for us.\n  I, for one, believe that the institution of marriage and the \nprinciples of democracy are too precious to surrender to the whims of a \nhandful of unelected, activist judges.\n\n[[Page S5441]]\n\n  Mr. President, I have behind me a number of charts I would like to go \nover for Members of the Senate. This is what the amendment is all \nabout:\n\n       Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the \n     union of a man and a woman. Neither this Constitution, nor \n     the Constitution of any State, shall be construed to require \n     that marriage or the legal incidents thereof be conferred \n     upon any union other than the union of a man and a woman.\n\n  In this very simple-to-understand chart form I have laid out for \nMembers of the Senate exactly what happens when it is sent to the \nStates and what it does to the courts. The State and Federal courts, \nwhat can they impose? They cannot redefine marriage. The courts cannot \ngo ahead and redefine civil unions or domestic partnerships. The courts \ncannot grant rights or benefits of marriage. But it doesn't affect in \nany way employee benefits offered by private businesses.\n  Then we go down and look at the legislatures. What can they do? They \ncan't redefine marriage. But they can deal with the creation of civil \nunions or domestic partnerships--that is left up to the State \nlegislatures, granting the rights or benefits of marriage. Again, that \nis left up to the State legislatures. Again, through the States, we \ndon't mandate anything that affects private businesses.\n  The next chart I would like to show to my colleagues in the Senate is \nhow America is weighing in on the issue of marriage. We have a map of \nthe United States here that clearly outlines those States where \namendments have passed--in the dark green. If we look at those results \nfrom within the States, the State that passed with the least majority \nwas Oregon with 57 percent, and the largest majority--it looks like it \nwas in Mississippi: 86 percent. But the average margin of where States \nhave enacted the constitutional amendment is greater than 70 percent.\n  Then we see that marriage amendments are expected in 2006 in a number \nof States throughout the country. The percentage of the voters who \nsupport the idea of the definition of marriage is a large percentage, a \nlarge margin.\n\n  Now I would like to go to our next chart to outline what the States \nhave done to protect traditional marriage through statutory and \nconstitutional defense of marriage acts. The blue lines show how the \nStates have acted on the definition of marriage as it was allowed to \noccur through the defense of marriage acts. Obviously, we all recall \nthat in the Senate we passed the Defense of Marriage Act by a large \npercentage and it passed the House by a large percentage. And it also \npassed in many States with a large percentage, with 45 States ending up \npassing the Defense of Marriage Act. The problem with the Defense of \nMarriage Act is it will not hold up against State challenges. Those \ncourt cases that have been brought forward could have an adverse impact \non what a large majority of State legislatures have said and what a \nlarge majority of houses have said.\n  The red reflects what has happened in regard to a constitutional \namendment. We have 19 States that have passed those constitutional \namendments and a number of amendments are pending before the States.\n  Now let me look at the following chart, and this is the number of \nStates in which marriage laws have been challenged in court. Between \n1992 and 1994, we had 5 cases that were challenged in court, and as \nthese cases have accumulated through the years, now, in 2006, we have \n22 cases that have been challenged. So we have a significant threat \nfrom the courts. This is an important issue to the American people, it \nis an important issue to the Congress, and it is something that should \nbe addressed.\n  I believe that the institution of marriage and the principles of \ndemocracy are simply too precious to surrender to the whims of a \nhandful of unelected activist judges. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin supporting the Marriage Protection Amendment.\n  I now yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 15 minutes.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I believe under a previous agreement I am recognized \nfor a period up to 20 minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no agreement. The majority controls \nthe 45 minutes remaining until the hour of 12 o'clock. The Senator from \nKansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chair. I ask if you would let me know when \nI have used 15 minutes of that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank my colleague from Colorado, Senator Allard, \nfor his carrying of this amendment. When the issue first surfaced a \ncouple of years ago, Senator Allard was the first one to put forward a \nconstitutional amendment on the issue of marriage, a very simple one to \ndefine the union of marriage as a man and a woman.\n  The issue has taken many twists and turns since that time. The \ninstitution itself has been weakened over a number of years, and this \nis an effort to help it, help strengthen that institution and to have \nthe definition of this institution done by legislative bodies and not \nby courts.\n  This is a very simple amendment. It is hard for me to understand why \nanybody would oppose it when 45 of 50 States have defined marriage as \nthe union of a man and a woman, and this simply says that if States \nwant to define it differently, they have to go through the legislative \nprocess and not the courts, so that the Court can't force it. It must \nbe done by a legislative body. And if some States decide to do that, \nthen that is provided for in this amendment. So the five States that \nhave done something different are provided for in the amendment. Yet \nthe basics of it say marriage is the union of a man and a woman, as it \nhas been as an institution for thousands of years.\n  So I thank my friend from Colorado for carrying this. It is a \ndifficult topic. I would never have dreamed in my life, in coming to \nthe Senate, that this would be a difficult topic, one that would be \ndebated. When I came into the Senate in 1996, this was not discussed at \nall in the campaigns. It was not discussed in the campaign in 1998. It \nhas only been of a recent vintage that this has come forward. Yet it \nhas come forward because of the importance of the topic.\n  I want to discuss two points. This issue is going to be defined by \nthe courts or the legislative bodies, period. We seek to have it \ndefined by legislative bodies. We think that is the appropriate thing \nwhen you are dealing with such a fundamental institution of society as \nmarriage. It should be defined by the people and the legislative bodies \nand not the courts. The situation in Europe, as it evolved, went \nthrough the court process. Therefore, we seek for these changes, if \nthey are to be made, to go through the legislative body. I believe that \nmarriage is such a foundational institution it should be defined as the \nunion of a man and woman, and I will cover that in my discussion.\n  No. 2, this is important on how we raise the next generation in the \nUnited States. That is why we have favored the institution of \ntraditional marriage, the union of a man and a woman, because we know \nin all the social data in all societies at all times that the best \nplace to raise children is in the union of a man and a woman and in \nthat sacred institution is the best place to raise your next \ngeneration, with that bonding together for life and children raised in \nthat setting.\n\n  That is something for which we have got social data, but also we know \nthat in our hearts. We know, sitting here right now, that, yes, that is \nthe best place. I know that. I know that in my own heart. Yet I want to \ntake us through what has happened to this weakened institution of \nmarriage, what has happened then to our next generation. Here I am \nusing the Moynihan principle. Senator Moynihan, who was in this body, \nsince deceased, had a basic principle that he looked at. One of the key \nthings we should look at is how we raise the next generation. It is \nsomething that any legislative body should be most concerned about \nbecause it affects what you are going to do in the future. It affects \nwhat the country is going to be in the future. And so we should \nmaximize and look with great intensity at how you are impacting that \nnext generation. I have to say, with the weakening of the institution \nof marriage over the past 30 to 40 years, with this redefining of \nmarriage, which would define marriage out of existence, which is what \nwe have seen in other countries, you are going\n\n[[Page S5442]]\n\nto harm your next generations and succeeding generations that you \nraise.\n  I want to back that up. I am going to go through a series of charts \nto paint the picture of what has happened to marriage in America today \nand why we would encourage the institution of marriage as the union of \na man and a woman.\n  This doesn't need explanation. You can see where we are. With a 4-\npercent rate of out-of-wedlock births in 1930, we are at about a third \nof the children in the United States today born to unmarried women.\n  That is not to say you cannot raise great children in this setting \nbecause you can. A number of women struggle heroically to raise \nchildren, and good children, in this setting, as they can do. As I will \nshow in these charts, it becomes far more difficult, and that is why \ninstitutions such as this and across the States, across the country, \nfavor traditional marriage because you get more adults per child \ninvolved in that child's life and they are bonded together. They are \nthick. The blood is thick. They care for each other and they work to \nraise this child as my wife and I are working together to raise our \nchildren. It is tough. It is tough raising children. You need more \nadults per child, and you need adults who are committed for life so \nthat that child does not have to worry about what is going to happen \ntomorrow or what is going to happen in the future. They know there are \ntwo parents who love that child unconditionally and are committed to \nthat child unconditionally and they are going to work for that child \nand that is why we favor the institution of marriage. Yet you can see \nwe are getting fewer and fewer children raised in that type of \nsituation.\n  Now, then I mentioned, well, OK, you can raise good children in a \nsingle-parent household. Yes, you can. But the situation becomes more \ndifficult. Developmental problems are less common in two-parent \nfamilies. Lower half of class academically, as you can see in the \ngreen, is not as high in two-parent families; developmental delays, 10 \npercent. You are looking at, again, almost double the situation, and \nyou are looking at double the problems with emotional behavior \nproblems, single-parent versus two-parent families. That doesn't mean \nthat you don't have problems in two-parent families. You do. It is just \nyour numbers go down. So when you are looking at this in a \nmacrosituation, as a Government, you are saying we want more children \nin these two-parent households.\n  The next chart shows that nearly 80 percent of all children suffering \nlong-term poverty come from broken or never married families. This is \nsomething I want to develop a little further as well. We have a \nBrookings scholar, Ron Haskin, who testified at a hearing I hosted \nabout welfare reform and the need to encourage marriage for those who \nare receiving welfare. And he says this:\n\n       There are only two ways known to man and to God to reduce \n     poverty. No. 1 is work and No. 2 is marriage.\n\n  Here's what I want to show is if people will get married and stay \nmarried the number of children suffering in long-term poverty goes down \nsubstantially, if you will do that. And I want to develop this a little \nbit further.\n  Children in poverty--this is in the year 2000. You can see, if a \nchild has been a child of a first marriage, less than 12 percent in \npoverty. You can see, if a child is in a situation where the mom has \nnever married, 67 percent of your children in poverty come in that \nsituation. Again, that is not casting aspersions on anybody. It is \nsimply saying these are the facts of what happened.\n  Now, it is a bit of a sidebar, but it points to the policy impact of \nharming marriage. In other words, if we take policies that are harmful \nto marriage, it hurts children and it hurts marriage. If we take this \npolicy move of defining marriage out of existence, saying it can be any \ntwo or more people who care for each other, it will fundamentally hurt \nyour institution of marriage by a policy move.\n  Now, I want to reflect a policy move we did in welfare. In welfare, \nbasically, we said--it is a very busy chart--we said to people if you \nget married, we are going to cut your welfare support. If you get \nmarried, we are going to cut your welfare support. What this shows are \nthe various welfare programs in the country and it is those when you \nare going from $20,000 income per year, very low, to $40,000, which is \nwhere you get if two people get married, and I will develop this \nfurther, you fall off into the abyss as far as support you get from \nchild care development funds, women and infant children, Federal \nhousing, food stamps, all these things, you fall off the cliff to the \npoint that you have an effective tax rate, if you get married and your \nincome gets to $40,000 by being married, an 88-percent maximum tax rate \nfor you getting married in the welfare system. Therefore, it is no \nwonder that the people who get married are much more in the upper \nincome and much less in the lower income.\n  This is a stark chart that should scare us all. This is income levels \nto percentage unmarried. And you can see at the lower income level, you \nare up as high as 70 percent not married, not getting married. Our \npublic policies say, if you get married, we are going to throw you off \nwelfare, and so fewer people get married. And it has an impact.\n  I want to show this final one quite quickly. This is the effective \ntax rate, maximum highest tax rate of you getting married on welfare \nand it is 88 percent, the impact of divorce on income of families with \nchildren. Again, I want to hit this pretty fast. When families \nseparate, it drives income down, hurts children generally, although not \nin all situations, but I am painting the macropicture.\n  Now, what has happened to our children in this society since, say, \n1960. The number of children--I showed an earlier chart--about a third \nare born out of wedlock. In the 1940s, it was about 4 percent. You can \nlook at 1960, the number of children, either born out of wedlock or in \nprevious years the parents were divorced, in 1960, we are up to 16, 17 \npercent, and today you are looking at over half. In America today, \nabout half of the children under age 18 will spend a significant \nportion of their life in a single-parent household. Again, you can \nraise good children in that setting, but the numbers start moving \nagainst you.\n  OK. What does that have to do with same-sex marriage. The issue is we \nare looking at the policy choice of why we define marriage as the union \nbetween a man and a woman or any sort of grouping. The experience in \nother countries has been, when you redefine marriage broadly and you \nbroaden it and say it can be any type of relationship between two or \nmore people, you get fewer marriages and you hurt your children. That \nhas been the situation.\n\n  I will go to several other countries that have redefined marriage, \ndefined marriage out of existence. In the Netherlands, since proposals \nfor same-sex marriage began to be debated, the out-of-wedlock birthrate \nhas soared. It was a fairly stable country in out-of-wedlock births and \nwas at low rate.\n  We will show in the next chart the same-sex marriage union, and the \ndiscussion, said to society: It really does not matter. The marriage \ninstitution is not a sacred institution; it is just whatever we define \nit to be. That tradition is tradition. We are going to go a different \nway.\n  What happened to out-of-wedlock birthrates? You can see the situation \nin the Netherlands, which is particularly important because it was one \nof the lowest out-of-wedlock birthrate countries in Europe for a number \nof years, shows that until 1980, below 5 percent of the population was \nborn out of wedlock. When we get the court cases which we have in the \nUnited States today saying marriage should be redefined, we see the \nimpact, as well as a Supreme Court case that rules against marriage \nbeing the union of a man and a woman. Then we get symbolic marriage \nregistration, registered partnership, same-sex unions, and now we are \nup to 35 percent as seen in this skyrocketing chart.\n  One can say, that is the way it is, this number puts children in more \ndisadvantaged situations, which is where our concerns should be, as to \nhow you raise that next generation.\n  I will show another chart. We not only know this in the Netherlands \nbut we know from Scandinavian countries, the Nordic countries that \nredefined marriage, experiences in Scandinavia and the Netherlands make \nit clear that same-sex marriage could widen the separation between \nmarriage and parenthood here in the United States.\n\n[[Page S5443]]\n\n  We know in some Nordic countries, you have counties now where 80 \npercent of the first-born children are born out of wedlock, and two-\nthirds of the second children are born out of wedlock. That has a \nsignificant impact, I argue, a devastating impact, on how that next \ngeneration is raised, given the difficulty of raising children in that \none-parent union.\n  So if we redefine marriage, and define it downward, far less \nheterosexual marriages will be the broad policy impact of doing this. \nThat has been the experience in other countries. You get more children \nraised in a sub-optimal atmosphere and you will have more difficulties \nwith that next generation of children. This is important. This is \ncritical.\n  I hear my colleagues complain, important issues? I remind my \ncolleagues we spent 2 weeks before break on immigration, which is a \ncritical topic, and we will take up the budget this next week, another \na critical topic, yet I don't think one can look at an institutional \nquestion more profound, more important and active than what is taking \nplace right now on the issue of marriage.\n  Marriage is a foundational institution. If we get more of it, we will \nhave more stronger, healthier children, raised in better situations for \nthe future of the country. If we get less of it, such as what this \npolicy decision would do if we do not define marriage as a union of a \nman and a woman, we will have more problems on a trajectory we are \nalready headed on. The institution of marriage has been weakened in the \nUnited States.\n  The institution of marriage has been weakened over the past 40 years. \nBut the answer is not to kill it. The answer is to strengthen it. And \nit takes steps like the commonsense approach Senator Allard from \nColorado is putting forward, defining marriage as a union between a man \nand a woman, saying only State legislatures, not the courts, can \nredefine it another way.\n  That should please everyone. Yet, I am afraid many of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle are going the opposite and claiming some \nsort of hyperbole about this being bigotry. It is not. It is people \ndeeply concerned about the future of the country and the future of the \nnext generation, concerned that they will say it is just politics. It \nis not. You have 45 of 50 States that have defined marriage as a union \nof a man and a woman and have spent significant resources to define and \nsupport the institution of marriage because of its importance to the \nsociety and to the Republic. This is a key, important debate.\n  I am delighted the leadership is calling this up. I hope my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle will support it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 17 minutes.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Kansas for \nhis tremendous effort and work on this very important issue. I know he \nhas held hours upon hours of committee hearings and meetings to \ninvestigate with social scientists the impact of marriage on American \nlives and how it impacts the family.\n  I, for one, greatly appreciate the Senator's effort and support. He \ntruly has been a partner in this effort to protect marriage. I \nappreciate his hard work. I recognize that in a public way.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article \npublished by the Heritage Foundation, written by Mr. Ed Meese, titled \n``Marriage Amendment Protects Federalism,'' and a Statement of \nAdministration Policy on the Senate Joint Resolution on the Marriage \nProtection Amendment, and a letter I have received from Mitt Romney, \nGovernor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, in which he made a \ncouple of statements that I will share with my colleagues.\n  First, he states in this letter:\n\n       Americans are tolerant, generous, and kind people. We all \n     oppose bigotry and disparagement, and we all wish to avoid \n     hurtful disregard of the feelings of others. But the debate \n     over same-sex marriage is not a debate over tolerance. It is \n     a debate about the purpose of the institution of marriage.\n\n  It goes further to talk of his experiences as Governor for the State \nof Massachusetts. He says:\n\n        . . . We are beginning to see the effects of the new legal \n     logic in Massachusetts just two years into our state's social \n     experiment. For instance, our birth certificate is being \n     challenged: Same sex couples want the terms ``Mother'' and \n     ``Father'' replaced with ``Parent A'' and ``Parent B.''\n\n  If the Senate will allow me to put this in context, I think the \nsignificance of his message is that marriage is being minimalized. When \nwe minimize marriage, we minimize its significance to society. As a \nresult of that, our children will suffer.\n  I thank the President for his support. I also thank Governor Mitt \nRomney for his support.\n  I ask unanimous consent these be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Marriage Amendment Protects Federalism\n\n                          (By Edwin Meese III)\n\n       July 12, 2004.--In our system of law, the powers of \n     government are divided between the federal and state \n     governments. The framers rightly left marriage policy, as so \n     many other things, with the states.\n       Yet the fundamental definition of marriage is no mere \n     policy issue. We're talking about the very integrity and \n     meaning of one of the primary elements of civil society.\n       Nor is this a matter for state-by-state experimentation. \n     Society isn't harmed when high-tax states live side by side \n     with low-tax states. The market adjusts to the inconsistency. \n     Not so with marriage. A highly integrated society such as \n     ours--with questions of property ownership, tax and economic \n     liability, inheritance, and child custody crossing state \n     lines--requires a uniform definition of marriage.\n       In a free society, certain fundamental questions must be \n     addressed and settled for the good of that society. States \n     can't impair the obligation of contracts, or coin their own \n     money, or experiment with forms of non-republican government. \n     We learned the hard way that the nation could not endure half \n     slave and half free.\n       If marriage is a fundamental social institution, then it's \n     fundamental for all of society. As such, it is not only \n     reasonable but obligatory that it be preferred and defended \n     in the law and, if necessary, protected in the U.S. \n     Constitution.\n       This doesn't mean that marriage must be completely \n     nationalized or should become the regulatory responsibility \n     of the federal government. Policy decisions concerning \n     questions such as degrees of consanguinity, the age of \n     consent, and the rules of divorce should remain with the \n     states.\n       The wisdom of extending certain benefits that stop well \n     short of marriage--that don't undermine the distinctive \n     status of marriage--are policy questions that should be the \n     responsibility of state legislatures.\n       But we must protect the integrity of the institution as \n     such by defining the societal boundaries and determining the \n     limits beyond which no part of society can go.\n       A constitutional amendment that defines marriage would \n     protect the states' capacity to regulate marriage by \n     sustaining it as an institution. In order to guard the \n     states' liberty to determine marriage policy in accord with \n     the principles of federalism, society as a whole must prevent \n     the institution itself from being redefined out of existence \n     or abolished altogether.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n               s.j. res. 1--marriage protection amendment\n\n            (Senator Allard (R) Colorado and 31 cosponsors)\n\n       The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of the \n     Marriage Protection Amendment. Recent court decisions remind \n     us that when activist judges insist on redefining the \n     fundamental institution of marriage for their States or \n     potentially for the entire country, the only alternative left \n     to make the people's voice heard is an amendment to the \n     Constitution. Without a constitutional amendment, judges and \n     local officials could continue to attempt to redefine \n     marriage. The Administration believes that the future of \n     marriage in America should be decided through the democratic \n     constitutional amendment process, rather than by the court \n     orders of a few. The Administration urges both houses to pass \n     the Marriage Protection Amendment and submit it to the States \n     for ratification.\n                                  ____\n\n         The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Executive Department, \n           State House,\n                                         Boston, MA, June 2, 2006.\n     Senator Wayne Allard,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: Next week, you will vote on a proposed \n     amendment to the United States Constitution protecting the \n     institution of marriage. As Governor of the state most \n     directly affected by this amendment, I hope my perspectives \n     will encourage you to vote ``yes.''\n       Americans are tolerant, generous, and kind people. We all \n     oppose bigotry and disparagement, and we all wish to avoid \n     hurtful disregard of the feelings of others. But the debate \n     over same sex marriage is not a debate over tolerance. It is \n     a debate about the purpose of the institution of marriage.\n\n[[Page S5444]]\n\n       Attaching the word marriage to the association of same-sex \n     individuals mistakenly presumes that marriage is principally \n     a matter of adult benefits and adult rights. In fact, \n     marriage is principally about the nurturing and development \n     of children. And the successful development of children is \n     critical to the preservation and success of our nation.\n       Our society, like all known civilizations in recorded \n     history, has favored the union of a man and a woman with the \n     special designation and benefits of marriage. In this \n     respect, it has elevated the relationship of a legally bound \n     man and woman over other relationships. This recognizes that \n     the ideal setting for nurturing and developing children is a \n     home where there is a mother and a father.\n       In order to protect the institution of marriage, we must \n     prevent it from being redefined by judges like those here in \n     Massachusetts who think that marriage is an ``evolving \n     paradigm,'' and that the traditional definition is ``rooted \n     in persistent prejudices'' and amounts to ``invidious \n     discrimination.''\n       Although the full impact of same-sex marriage may not be \n     measured for decades or generations, we are beginning to see \n     the effects of the new legal logic in Massachusetts just two \n     years into our state's social experiment. For instance, our \n     birth certificate is being challenged: same-sex couples want \n     the terms ``Mother'' and ``Father'' replaced with ``Parent \n     A'' and ``Parent B.''\n       In our schools, children are being instructed that there is \n     no difference between same-sex marriage and traditional \n     marriage. Recently, parents of a second grader in one public \n     school complained when they were not notified that their \n     son's teacher would read a fairy tale about same-sex marriage \n     to the class. In the story, a prince chooses to marry another \n     prince, instead of a princess. The parents asked for the \n     opportunity to opt their child out of hearing such stories. \n     In response, the school superintendent insisted on ``teaching \n     children about the world they live in, and in Massachusetts \n     same sex marriage is legal.'' Once a society establishes that \n     it is legally indifferent between traditional marriage and \n     same-sex marriage, how can one preserve any practice which \n     favors the union of a man and a woman?\n       Some argue that our principles of federalism and local \n     control require us to leave the issue of same sex marriage to \n     the states--which means, as a practical matter, to state \n     courts. Such an argument denies the realities of modern life \n     and would create a chaotic patchwork of inconsistent laws \n     throughout the country. Marriage is not just an activity or \n     practice which is confined to the border of anyone state. It \n     is a status that is carried from state to state. Because of \n     this, and because Americans conduct their financial and legal \n     lives in a united country bound by interstate institutions, a \n     national definition of marriage is necessary.\n       Your vote on this amendment should not be guided by a \n     concern for adult rights. This matter goes to the development \n     and well-being of children. I hope that you will make your \n     vote heard on their behalf.\n           Best regards,\n                                                      Mitt Romney,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania, who has been a \nstrong leader and who has put in a large amount of effort in trying to \nprotect the institution of marriage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank and congratulate the Senator \nfrom Colorado for his terrific work on this issue, as well as the \nSenator from Kansas, Mr. Brownback, for his great work in the committee \nin moving this constitutional amendment forward.\n  This is a very difficult debate for a lot of people. It is very hard, \nsort of sad in some respects, that we are here talking about the issue \nof marriage, that talking about marriage is somehow a difficult debate. \nBut it is for a lot of people. I know in many meetings of our \ncolleagues when the issue of marriage comes up, heads drop. It is an \nissue that people feel uncomfortable talking about, something that \nmaybe in some respects they feel like, Why is this even an issue?\n  That is a good question. Why is it an issue? I will talk about that \nin a minute.\n  There is a foundational question I would like to talk about that up \nuntil a couple of days ago I was not planning to talk about, which is, \nWhy are we doing this now? This is the big buzz in the media. Oh, this \nis being brought up for political purposes; and this is all about \npolitics and has nothing to do with the substance of the matter, and \nthe media--which loves to pawn off issues and give spin to issues--has \nadopted this approach.\n  As Senator Allard would affirm, we have been considering now for \nseveral months what the best timing would be to bring this legislation \nup. We had a very forceful voice being heard from the American public. \nIn fact, there is a chart of all the States that approved \nconstitutional amendments in the last election of 2004. We are now up \nto 19 States in the country that have spoken; the people have spoken in \nthose States.\n  There was a lot of momentum coming out of the 2004 election, so when \nwe reconvened in 2005 we thought maybe this was a good time to bring it \nup, now that we have just had an election. We thought, in looking at \nthis, it would be better if we had more court activity between the \nelection and when we bring this amendment up. That, really, the issue \nis, as we have heard repeatedly in the Senate, we are trying to bring \nabout a decision on marriage in this country through a democratic \nprocess.\n  I can't think of anything more democratic involving more people than \na constitutional amendment. It takes two-thirds of this House, two-\nthirds of the other House and three- quarters of the States; 38 States \nhave to ratify this amendment. Talk about a public debate where there \nis huge public input across America. The constitutional amendment is \nthe way to do it. It is the most democratic way of making a decision on \nanything in this country.\n  We thought it would be a good juxtaposition to see further court \nerosion, further decisions made by courts to erode the public's will on \nthe issue of marriage. I say the ``public's will'' only because we have \n19 States and many others that have said what there really is with \nrespect to marriage. So we are debating, almost month to month, and we \nhave had conversations, Is this the right time?\n  We had a Nebraska decision which has been talked about where a \nFederal court overturned the State constitutional amendment in the \nState of Nebraska. There was a case in Washington State. Washington \nState is an interesting State because, unlike Massachusetts, there is \nno residency requirement for marriage. Any couple from anywhere in the \ncountry can go to Washington and get married if the Supreme Court of \nWashington were to overturn their statute. Washington so far has not \nissued their opinion. They have had the case for 15 months and for some \nreason or another they have not decided to decide. We were waiting, \ntrying to see if this was an appropriate time.\n  Last year we decided that we were not going to wait around for courts \nand we set this date for the first of June. That is why we are here \ntoday--not for any political reason. If it was purely politics, we \nwould be debating this in September. We are debating it in June because \nwe thought we would have 3 or 4 days as opposed to being compressed to \n1 day in September. So we are here to give this the proper attention \nthis vitally important issue deserves.\n  The other question that I did want to talk about is, How did we get \nhere, not why are we doing it now, but how did this issue come about? \nThere were a couple of States that were playing around with this issue \nfor a while--Vermont and Hawaii. But the issue really got jump-started \nwith the court decision--not surprisingly, a big court decision--the \ncourt decision that occurred in Washington with the United States \nSupreme Court is the Lawrence v. Texas case.\n  Lawrence v. Texas opened the floodgates for a variety of different \nlitigation going across this country using, now, a constitutional right \nestablished by the United States Supreme Court in Lawrence. It was a \nseminal decision, there is no question about it.\n  We have a classic example of the U.S. Court forcing its will on \nestablishing a right and then giving other courts the right or the \nability to then project its power on to the people, to make decisions \nand force decisions, force legislation, as in the case of \nMassachusetts, onto the people.\n  I want to talk about that decision because I think it is important, \nbut I want to talk about the decision before that. Just a few years \nago, 15 years before Lawrence v. Texas was decided, a similar case was \ndecided, Bowers v. Hardwick. I want to take a look at Justice White who \nwrote for the majority in Bowers, saying sodomy laws were \nconstitutional, that moral laws passed by the States dealing with \nsexuality were, in fact, constitutional. There was no constitutional \nright that barred States and the public from regulating in this area. \nHe said:\n\n       The right pressed upon us here [this is what the litigants \n     in the Bowers case were\n\n[[Page S5445]]\n\n     arguing] has no similar support in the text of the \n     Constitution, it does not qualify for recognition under the \n     prevailing principles for construing the 14th amendment. Its \n     limits are also difficult to discern . . .\n\n  This limit of consensual sexual activity being a constitutional right \nwhich was made by the litigants, saying we have the right as individual \nadults under the Constitution to any kind of sexual behavior that we \ndesire and the State cannot limit us.\n  He said:\n\n       Its limits were difficult to discern . . . And if \n     respondent's submission is limited to the voluntary sexual \n     conduct between consenting adults, it would be difficult, \n     except by fiat, to limit the claimed right to homosexual \n     conduct while leaving exposed to prosecution adultery, \n     incest, and other sexual crimes even though they are \n     committed in the home. We are unwilling start down that road.\n\n  What the Court said here was that if you open up the standard, the \nlegal standard, if you change it for a constitutionally protected \nactivity from that activity within marriage to that activity between \nconsenting adults--and that was the decision here, change the standard \nfrom a Constitution that protects the marital union from State \nintrusion to consenting adults with respect to homosexual activity--in \nthis case, the Court said: No, we can't go there. Because only by fiat \ncould we then limit other activity beyond that.\n  Let's fast forward to shortly before the Lawrence v. Texas decision.\n\n       If . . . you have the right to consensual sex within your \n     home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right \n     to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right \n     to adultery. You have the right to do anything.\n\n  That comment has been reprinted probably 100,000 times in the last \nfew years as an outrageous comment made by a U.S. Senator. It was the \nsame comment that was made by Justice White in the majority opinion.\n  Let's fast forward a few months after that, Justice Scalia in the \ndissenting opinion in the Lawrence v. Texas case:\n\n       State laws against bigamy, same-sex marriage, adult incest, \n     prostitution, masturbation, adultery, fornication, \n     bestiality, and obscenity are likewise sustainable only in \n     light of Bowers' validation of laws based on moral choices. \n     Every single one of these laws is called into question by \n     today's decision; the Court makes no effort to cabin the \n     scope of its decision to exclude them from its holding.\n\n  What he is saying is that now that road which Justice White and the \nCourt back in 1986 refused to go down, this Court in Lawrence v. Texas \nhad headed us down that road.\n  Justice Scalia went on to say:\n\n       Today's opinion dismantles the structure of constitutional \n     law that has permitted a distinction to be made between \n     heterosexual and homosexual unions, insofar as formal \n     recognition in marriage is concerned. If moral disapprobation \n     of homosexual conduct is ``no legitimate state interest'' for \n     purposes of proscribing that conduct; and if, as the Court \n     coos (casting aside all pretense of neutrality), ``[w]hen \n     sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with \n     another person, the conduct can be but one element in a \n     personal bond that is more enduring,'' what justification \n     could there possibly be for denying the benefits of marriage \n     to homosexual couples exercising ``[t]he liberty protected by \n     the Constitution.'' Surely not the encouragement of \n     procreation, since the sterile and the elderly are allowed to \n     marry. The case ``does not involve'' the issue of homosexual \n     marriage only if one--\n\n  And they are quoting the majority opinion again because the majority \nopinion said this doesn't deal with marriage, Scalia says this case \ndoes not involve the issue of homosexual marriage--\n\n     entertains the belief that principle and logic have nothing \n     to do with the decisions of this Court.\n\n  The fact is, principle and logic have everything to do with judicial \ndecisions. That is the problem with them. That is why they are \ndifferent from legislative decisions. You see, when a court makes a \njudicial decision, they do so based on a judicial foundation that has a \nlogical and rational basis to it and logical consequences. The logical \nconsequence to the Lawrence v. Texas case is the next case, not a \nSupreme Court case before the U.S. Supreme Court but before involving \nMassachusetts.\n  What Massachusetts did was the logical thing from Lawrence v. Texas. \nIn fact, they cite Lawrence v. Texas 5 times in the main opinion and 11 \ntimes in the combined majority opinions. It is the basis upon which \nthey build their decision. Because unlike the majority opinion in \nLawrence v. Texas which says this has nothing to do with marriage, it \nhad everything to do with marriage.\n  The interesting thing about the Lawrence v. Texas decision--and this \ngoes even more to judicial activism--they could have decided the \nLawrence v. Texas decision for the plaintiffs in that decision. They \ncould have found that statute unconstitutional. And in fact, had they \ndone so--and in fact, they did in part of their opinion; they found it \nunconstitutional under equal protection grounds--had they limited their \nopinion to that, I would have agreed with the decision. I think the \nTexas statute probably was unconstitutional under equal protection \ngrounds. And so when they started the decision out and they said: This \nis unconstitutional because of equal protection, I said that is right.\n  Here is what the court did and, unfortunately, what courts \nincreasingly do. While we are here, we are going to establish a new \nconstitutional right. While we are here, since we have the opportunity, \nsince this case is before us, we are going to be activist jurists, and \nwe are going to create a whole new body of law that will have huge \nripples throughout society. So they did. They didn't have to, but they \ndid. We are now debating this amendment because of it. They have this \nripple effect which we are seeing throughout courts throughout the \ncountry, Federal as well as State.\n  Here in the Goodrich decision, it says:\n\n       It is clear from the quote below that the Goodrich decision \n     was considered the ``logical next step.''\n       Our concern is with the Massachusetts Constitution as a \n     charter of governance for every person properly within its \n     reach. ``Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not \n     a mandate of our own moral code.''\n\n  There they were quoting Lawrence v. Texas. It went on to note that \nthe Lawrence case ``specifically affirmed that the core concept of \ncommon human dignity protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution precludes government intrusion into the \ndeeply personal realms of consensual adult expressions of intimacy and \none's choice of an intimate partner. The Court also reaffirmed the \ncentral role that decisions whether to marry or have children bear in \nshaping one's identity.''\n  The ``logical next step,'' so the Goodrich decision is very much in \nconformity with the Lawrence v. Texas decision. That is why we are \nhere. We are here because of judicial activism.\n\n  Our plea to the Members of the Senate is to allow the people to make \nthe decision with respect to this foundational institution of our \ncountry--the traditional family, marriage--that courts who just happen \nto be deciding a case that didn't need them to decide it this way or \nuse this logic or rationale, that courts just can't decide that they \nwant to involve themselves into legislative affairs and send shock \nwaves throughout our culture without the public having a right to say \nsomething, without the public having a right to put their stamp of \napproval on what is moral and just.\n  Some have said that the States can handle this. Some have said this \nis a federalist issue; We should not have Federal legislation on this; \nThis is usurping States rights.\n  I don't know what involves the States more than having every State \nlegislature in the country debate this issue. That is not usurping \nStates rights; that is placing in the hands of the States the decision \nas to whether to move forward. Thirty-eight of the fifty States have to \naffirm this constitutional amendment. This is not an easy thing to do. \nThat is why we don't have very many amendments to the Constitution. But \nit is a purely democratic process, just like the debate in the Senate. \nI think we should give the States, the people, the right to make this \ndecision before a group of unelected judges, following the lead of the \nU.S. Supreme Court, do it for us.\n  First and foremost, this constitutional amendment is about democracy. \nIt is about the people expressing their will on potentially the \ngreatest moral issue of our time, and that is the integrity of the \ntraditional family. That is issue No. 1.\n  Issue No. 2 is an important one, also. I heard the Senator from \nKansas talk about this eloquently, so I won't spend\n\n[[Page S5446]]\n\na lot of time. He did as good a job as any on the issue. That is the \nimpact of the deconstruction of marriage on society. I heard the \nSenator from Kansas say that marriage is already in trouble in America. \nThere is certainly little to argue that that is not true. It is true, \nmarriage is in trouble. But I agree with him by saying just because \nsomething is in trouble doesn't mean you need to get rid of it \naltogether. Without question, once you change marriage from an \ninstitution whose societal purpose is focused on having children, being \nan institution that is the best place to rear future generations of \nsociety, once you change marriage from being principally about \nchildren, although not exclusively, certainly, but principally about \nchildren, to exclusively about adults, then you change marriage \nforever.\n  We did that in part 30-plus years ago with no-fault divorce laws. \nWhen they came into place, they said children will be helped by this. \nThere will be fewer unhappy homes. I don't think there is a whole lot \nof evidence out there that would suggest children have been helped by \nthe rapid increase in divorce. I know the Senator from Kansas had some \ncharts up of how children in two-parent families don't end up in \npoverty as much, do better in school. I don't know of a social \nindicator out there that doesn't suggest that being in a married home \nis not more beneficial for children. That is certainly not to say that \nchildren raised in single-parent homes can't and don't do well. Most \ndo. But the point is, society should be advocating for what is best for \nchildren and should set a standard for what is best.\n  We know what is best. We know it intrinsically, but we have \nsupporting evidence as to what is best for children--less substance \nabuse, less abuse or neglect, less criminal activity, less early sexual \nactivity, fewer out-of-wedlock births, fewer behavioral problems. It \ngoes on and on. We know marriage is inherently good for children.\n  We also know that when we destroy marriage, when we deconstruct \nmarriage, bad things happen. We saw that with no-fault divorce. More \npeople got divorced. We changed the definition of marriage, and we say \nmarriage is no longer about children, no longer about the next \ngeneration. Marriage is simply the affirmation of affection of two \nadults. Or, as Justices Scalia and White suggested, why limit it there. \nWhy not, as we see in cases now being filed all over the country, why \nnot three adults, four adults, five adults? What is the difference from \nthe standpoint of a rationale? If marriage is not about one man and one \nwoman for the purpose of a relationship of which to have children and \ncontinue society, if it is about two women and two men or two women and \nthree men, why not whatever arrangement? If gender does not matter \nanymore, why does number matter? What is the significance? What is the \nlogical argument to draw the line here? As Justice White said, it would \nbe by fiat to draw the line.\n  So we have a situation where without question, marriage would be \nundermined by this deconstruction. In fact, we see it. I have an \narticle by Stanley Kurtz on what is going on in Europe, in countries \nthat have, in fact, changed the definition of marriage. Those countries \nare now seeing dramatic declines in the number of marriages, not \nincreases in the numbers of same-sex marriages but declines in the \nnumber of heterosexual marriages and dramatic and steady increases in \nthe number of children being born out of wedlock.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the final point I want to make--and I \nwill try to come back to the floor when I have more time--is regarding \nthe impact of this movement in the country by the courts on religious \nfreedom. There was an article written, which was on the front cover of \nthe Weekly Standard, called ``Banned in Boston,'' where Maggie \nGallagher talks about Catholic Charities in Boston having to get out of \nthe adoption business because they will not consent, under their \nCatholic orthodox faith, to place children into same-sex couple homes. \nIt is against the Catholic faith to do so. There is a very clear \nmessage from Rome that this is not proper behavior. They were refused \ntheir license, and now one of the longest standing adoption agencies in \nMassachusetts no longer places children for adoption. Why? Because all \naround faith, all around churches and parachurch organizations, and \nmissionary organizations is, whether we like it or not, the Government.\n  When the Government comes down with things that are contrary to that \nfaith group there will be friction.\n  In fact, Mark Stern, who is a lawyer for the American Jewish \nCommittee, is quoted as saying:\n\n       It is going to be a train wreck, a very dangerous train \n     wreck.\n\n  So not only will this new right that the court has established in the \nfollow-on--the right of same-sex marriage--going to cause problems with \ndemocracy and problems with marriage, it is going to create huge \nproblems for our faith-based organizations. It is something that we \nneed to address. Thank you.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I just returned from my State of Nevada. For \nexample, I did an event that received a lot of attention dealing with \ngas prices. Gas prices are so significant. Nevada has the third highest \ngas prices in all the country. Unfortunately, we have been in second \nplace on occasion. It is not unusual to drive by a service station in \nNevada and see the three different prices and the bottom one is $3.40. \nThe average price last week was $3.19 a gallon.\n  What are we doing on the Senate floor today? No matter how a person \nfeels about the marriage amendment, everyone knows it is not going to \npass. It is not going to come close to passing. We voted on this a \nshort time ago and got 48 votes. It takes 67 votes for a constitutional \namendment to begin the process. This is not what the American people \nwant to talk about. All you have to do is listen to the conservative \ntalk shows, the liberal talk shows, read the newspapers, the liberal \ncolumnists, the conservative columnists. With rare exception, they say \nwe are wasting the taxpayers' time doing this.\n  We have a war in Iraq going on. Are we having a discussion on the war \nin Iraq, where yesterday 80 Iraqis were killed, 7 having their heads \ncut off and put in a marketplace in baskets? Are we talking about that? \nWe have soldiers valiantly fighting every day over there, Mr. \nPresident. We have been struggling to get a supplemental appropriations \nbill completed. They need our help.\n  In Nevada, like every other State in the Union, we have hundreds of \nthousands of people who have no health insurance. The State of Nevada \nleads the country in uninsured. The prescription drug bill was passed \ndealing with Medicare. It has been a nightmare for seniors and a gift \nfor HMOs, pharmaceuticals, and insurance companies. When I was in \ncollege, I studied, among other things, political science. I don't know \nwhy, but it stuck in my mind.\n  A professor named Harmon Judd said: Let me explain this Federal \nsystem. What it means is, you have a central whole divided among self-\ngoverning parts. That was his definition. What are those self-governing \nparts? The 50 States; originally Thirteen Colonies, now 50 States. They \nare doing a pretty good job. Almost 50 States have either passed laws \nor constitutional amendments dealing with marriage. Over the top of \nthat, we have the Defense of Marriage Act, which has been attacked \nnumerous times by people trying to knock it out. It has been upheld by \nFederal courts three times, which basically says--not basically--it \nsays a State does not have to give full faith and credit to another \nState's marriage laws. It is up to the State to determine what the \nmarriage law is. That is what federalism is all about, as set forth, \namong other places, in the Defense of Marriage Act.\n\n[[Page S5447]]\n\n  We really need to focus on stem cell research. There are hundreds of \nthousands of people crying for our help. They believe, as does the \nscientific community, that dread diseases can be moderated and cured--\nthings such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, Lou Gehrig's, and \ndiabetes. But we are not talking about that today.\n  Price gouging: Senator Cantwell had 57 or 58 votes a short time ago \non a price-gouging amendment. We could not break the logjam we had. We \ncould not get enough support from the majority.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Commerce Committee be discharged \nfrom further consideration of S. 1735, the Energy Emergency Consumer \nProtection Act, and that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration.\n  Before there is a response as to whether this would be granted, I \nsuggest to those within the sound of my voice that this is a price-\ngouging amendment. I was told it was 57 votes in the Senate. I ask \nunanimous consent that request be granted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Reserving the right to object, and I will object, this \nissue is going to come up in front of the body on the overall energy \nsituation. The Republican leadership is working on that, as well as on \na stem cell compromise, as well as on the supplemental bill, which will \nbe considered and brought forth in due order. This is not agreed to by \nthe Republican leadership to come up; therefore, I do object.\n  Mr. REID. Reclaiming my time, in due consideration, Mr. President, \neverything around here with the majority is due consideration. We are \ngoing to do an energy bill after we finish gay marriage, estate tax, \nflag burning--things that are important to people but are way down the \nlist of priorities of the people at home in Nevada. How about an energy \nbill or stem cells? We have been waiting more than a year to do \nsomething on stem cells--more than a year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Through the Chair, I ask if the Senator from Nevada is \naware that the Gallup organization, which does polling across America, \ndid a poll of 1,000 Americans in April which asked them the following \nquestion: What do you think is the most important problem facing \nAmerica today?\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Nevada if he knows where the \nissue of gay marriage came in on this poll of Americans about the most \nimportant issues facing America today?\n  Mr. REID. I really don't know.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will alert the Senator from Nevada that it tied for \n33rd in the list of priorities for America today.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada, since the Republican majority controls \nthe Senate, they set the agenda for things that we debate and vote on; \ndo they not?\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Am I correct that Senator Frist and the Republican \nmajority have decided that instead of the war in Iraq where we continue \nto lose servicemen, instead of the energy crisis which forced the price \nof gasoline to record-high levels causing hardship to families and \nindividuals resulting in laying off workers across America, instead of \ndealing with health care where over 46 million Americans have no health \ninsurance whatsoever and many have health insurance that is totally \ninadequate, instead of dealing with the cost of higher education where \nworking families are struggling to get their kids through school and \nchildren who are accepted at the best schools and universities face a \nmountain of debt, instead of dealing with those issues which rank in \nthe top 10, is it true that the Republican majority has decided we need \nto focus this entire week in the Senate on No. 33, issues involving gay \nmarriage?\n  Mr. REID. I respond to my friend that I am stunned. I am stunned that \nit has taken weeks, weeks, weeks, and weeks to even be able to deal \nwith money for our troops, the supplemental appropriations bill. I am \nin a quandary. I am so grateful that I represent the people of Nevada \nin the Senate. But I want to do things that I can talk to the folks at \nhome about that have relevance to their everyday lives, such as gas \nprices, sending their kids to school. Many academically talented \nchildren are not able to go to school because their parents are not \nrich.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for an additional question, \nthey say debate on the floor of the Senate is about the ``M'' word, \nabout marriage. It strikes me that it is not about the preservation of \nmarriage, it is about the preservation of the ``majority,'' the \nRepublican majority. That is the ``M'' word behind this debate.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada, if this issue is not creating a \nnational problem or crisis, if it ranks so low among the American \npeople, 33rd on the list of the important things facing America, why, I \nask the Senator from Nevada, has the Republican majority ignored all \nthe issues that people care about and count on us to do something \nabout? Why are they ignoring all these issues and moving to this issue \nof gay marriage and proposing a constitutional amendment?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee on \nthe floor yesterday said this issue dealing with marriage is a solution \nin search of a problem. It is being done, I believe, to divert, \ndistort, and confuse Americans as to what the real problems are. Do \nanything possible, but don't talk about gas prices because if we talk \nabout gas prices, we would have to bring out on the floor that the most \noil-friendly Presidency in the history of this country is now at 1600 \nPennsylvania Avenue. The President made his fortune in oil. Vice \nPresident Cheney is still making his fortune in oil. He made it with \nHalliburton. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was on the board of \ndirectors of Chevron. They liked her so much they named a tanker after \nher. The Secretary of Commerce made his fortune in oil. We could go on \nand on.\n  If we talk about the issues affecting the American people, then maybe \nwhat we would do is Senator Maria Cantwell's price-gouging bill. Exxon \nmade $34 billion in net profit last year, which is the most money a \ncorporation has ever made in the history of America. So, no, the \nmajority doesn't want to talk about these issues, about the tax credit \nfor sending kids to college.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Nevada will further yield for a \nquestion, I ask the Senator, is it not true that the resolution before \nus would require 67 votes in order to be approved by the Senate?\n  Mr. REID. That is true.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And the last time we considered this measure, some 48 \nSenators voted for it? It fell far short of what it needed.\n  Mr. REID. Nineteen short.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So I ask the Senator from Nevada, does he reasonably \nbelieve now there are 67 votes or near 67 votes for this resolution?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Illinois \nknows, as I know, that there isn't a person in the Senate who thinks \nthis has any chance of passing--no chance of passing. It will get 48, \n50, 51 votes. I don't know how many votes it will get. If it were a \nstraight up-or-down vote on an amendment, it would get less than that \nbecause some Republicans have said: This is a procedural vote, I am \ngoing to vote to allow it to go forward, but if it were here, I \nprobably wouldn't vote for it. So you probably have in the Senate 41 or \n42 sound votes for this.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I can ask the Senator from Nevada, how much time do we \nhave? If we take a week and spend it on a gay marriage amendment, and \nthen a week and spend it on a flag amendment, and then another week and \nspend it on, let's say, repealing the estate tax on the wealthiest \npeople in America, don't we have a lot of time left before the election \nto consider issues such as the war in Iraq, energy costs, health \ninsurance for all American families, the cost of education, and the \nappropriations bills? How much time do we have if we take 3 weeks?\n  Mr. REID. Approximately 45 legislative days, that is all.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Before the election.\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Nevada, he says we have 45 days, \nand we are going to spend 3 or 4 days this week on an amendment that \ndoesn't have any chance, that ranks 33rd in a Gallup poll when it comes \nto the interests of the American people--I return to the same basic \nquestion: Why? Why are we doing this? Why aren't we focusing on issues \nthat count if we have so little time?\n\n[[Page S5448]]\n\n  Mr. REID. One of the Democratic Senators spoke with the majority \nleader. The majority leader said these things need to come up every \nyear or two. That is the reason.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Nevada, it is a shame--I ask him, \ndoes he think that perhaps if this should come up every year, even \nthough it doesn't have a chance of passing, whether or not we should \nconsider bringing up every year an effort to make health care more \naffordable for the American people, whether we ought to consider every \nyear dealing with the war in Iraq that continues to claim American \nlives, whether we ought to be passing new ethics laws to reform the \nlobbying system in Washington? I ask the Senator from Nevada, if we are \ngoing to have an annual occurrence, if these are, in fact, perennial \nissues, aren't there some that should be as a matter of course called \nbefore the Senate?\n  Mr. REID. Maybe--I think it has been about a year; I have lost track \nof the time--maybe what we are going to be coming up with after these, \nmaybe we will have the Schiavo matter come up again. What does the \nSenator think of that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Nevada, asking this question, \nisn't it true the last time the Republican leadership got in trouble in \nthe House, when the majority leader, Tom DeLay, was in his difficulty, \nthat someone brought up the issue of intervening in the tragedy of \nTerry Schiavo in Florida, injecting the Federal courts into the \nhospital room when this poor family had spent 15 years, when this young \nwoman was on life support, that all the courts having decided that the \nfamily could make the decision, the most intimate personal decision, \nthe Republican leaders in the House and Senate said: No, we are going \nto have the Federal court step in and make the decision, take the power \naway from the doctor and the families?\n  Isn't it interesting, I ask the Senator from Nevada, that when they \nwere facing all this grief over Tom DeLay and ethical questions, they \nraised the Terry Schiavo issue, and now we find them raising the gay \nmarriage issue because the polls are so low and the election draws \nnear?\n  Mr. REID. We know, I say to my friend, what can be done in this body \nif we get a nudge from the President, a little bipartisanship. Look \nwhat we did, I say to my friend. We spent several weeks on the Senate \nfloor on a bipartisan basis passing a comprehensive immigration reform \nbill. Why were we able to do that? Because the President decided to get \ninvolved in it. He decided it was time to do comprehensive immigration \nreform, and I complimented him on that.\n  Isn't that the way we should be legislating around here, I say to my \nfriend, the distinguished Senator from Illinois? Shouldn't we be \nworking in conjunction with the White House on these issues, bills that \nwe can pass, something that has some meaning, having the President lead \na charge on health care reform, not little specks of things here? How \nabout doing something here to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. We \nuse in America 21 million barrels of oil a day--21 million barrels of \noil every day, every day, 66 percent of it is from foreign sources. We \nhave less than 3 percent, counting what is in Alaska, for the United \nStates. We can't drill our way out of our problems. I say to my friend \nfrom Illinois, maybe that is what it is all about.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I might ask through the Chair the Senator from Nevada, \nthe Democratic leader, did we not attend the State of the Union Address \njust a few months ago when the President said America was addicted to \noil? It was the lead in all the stories the next day: America is \naddicted to oil. Then we saw the gasoline prices skyrocket causing all \nthese hardships.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada: Have we received a proposal from this \nWhite House, from this administration since that famous State of the \nUnion Address suggesting how we can change America's energy policies to \nmake us less dependent on foreign oil, to protect American consumers \nand businesses, to punish profiteering, to promote the kind of energy \ninnovation which will lead to conservation, efficiency, less pollution, \nand less dependence on foreign oil? Have we heard that kind of \nleadership from the White House to contrast with what the President \ncalled for that we spend this week on a constitutional amendment which \nhas no chance of passing?\n  Mr. REID. It is a matter of priorities, I say to my friend, a matter \nof priorities, what is important to this administration. Obviously, it \nis not gas prices. Obviously, it is not college tax deduction. \nObviously, it is not this debt.\n  I say to my friend, even in our conversation this morning, we haven't \ntalked about the stagnant debt. And remember, in the last 3 years of \nthe Clinton administration, the national debt was paid down by half a \ntrillion dollars approximately. What do we have here? Red ink as far as \nyou can see. Have we heard anything from the President to lower this \ndebt?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Nevada the following question: Is \nit not true that 5 years ago--6 years now, almost 6 years now when \nPresident Bush came to office--that as the Clinton administration left, \nwe had a surplus in the Federal Treasury, that we were taking the \nsurplus revenue collected in America, paying down the long-term debt of \nSocial Security so that it would be strong for years to come? Is it not \nalso true that when President Clinton left office, the entire national \ndebt accumulated over the history of the United States was about $5.7 \ntrillion or $5.8 trillion, and that today the national debt is bumping \nup against $9 trillion, and in the 6 years since President Bush has \nbeen in office, there has been a dramatic increase in this national \ndebt?\n  Is it not also true that this President, despite a war which saps \naway $2 billion or more every week, he has called for tax cuts on the \nwealthiest people in America and continues to call for those tax cuts, \ndespite this deficit? And I ask the Senator from Nevada, is that what \nfiscal conservatism is all about?\n  Mr. REID. My only correction of the distinguished Senator is it is \n$2.5 billion a week the war is costing us, about $10 billion a month. I \nmentioned, I say to my friend, the definition I got in college about a \ncentral hole divided into self-governing parts of the States. I always \nthought the Republican majority, as it is now, believed in States \nrights. That is what federalism is all about.\n  Where in this debate, that shouldn't be taking place on the floor \nright now, is there any inkling of States rights? None. Forty-five \nStates have already, through statute or constitutional amendment, as in \nNevada--Nevada amended its constitution on this issue. But where are my \nfriends, my Republican friends? Where are they on this issue of States \nrights? This isn't the first time we have brought up issues that have \nbeen defeated, defeated, defeated.\n  Medical malpractice is something the State of Nevada took on on its \nown, set their own rules. The Governor called a special session of the \nlegislature. We now have rules in the State of Nevada dealing with \nmedical malpractice.\n  That is not good enough for this Republican majority. We have voted, \nI believe, three times on a national law dealing with medical \nmalpractice--take the States out of the picture.\n  So I ask my friend, he being involved in Government in one way or \nanother most of his adult life, does he remember the Republicans at one \ntime standing for States rights?\n  Mr. DURBIN. In query of the Senator from Nevada, I ask him, I thought \nI understood the basic difference between Democrats and Republicans, \nthat the so-called Republican conservative philosophy was for fiscal \nconservatism, avoiding debt. Now we have the largest debt in the \nhistory of the United States and getting worse without any effort by \nthe Republicans to deal with it.\n  Traditionally, the Republicans argue the Government is best that \ngoverns least and gives power to the local units of government closest \nto the people. Now we have with this amendment an attempt to amend the \nConstitution and to preempt the power of the States to establish \nstandards for marriage.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada: Did we not honor States rights with \nthe passage of the Defense of Marriage Act which said that no State \nshall be compelled to recognize gay marriage if any State should enact \nsuch a law, as Massachusetts has?\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada: Isn't the Defense of Marriage Act \nconsistent\n\n[[Page S5449]]\n\nwith States rights, and isn't the proposed constitutional amendment an \nassault on the rights of States to establish the standards for marriage \nwhich they have throughout our history?\n  Mr. REID. And I remind my friend, the Defense of Marriage Act passed \nwhen we had a Democratic President and a Democratic majority in the \nHouse and the Senate. I am quite sure that is right, at least in the \nSenate; I don't know about the House. We passed it because it was the \nright thing to do--States rights.\n  The other point I suggest is that it is a wrong-placed priority doing \nthis resolution and nothing with homeland security. Just last week, the \nSecretary of Homeland Security decided that New York, for example, \nwould lose $200 million. States all around the country will have less \nmoney to protect themselves. I would think that is worth a debate on \nthe Senate floor. Does the Senator from Illinois agree with that--\nhomeland security?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I respond to the Senator from Nevada and ask a question. \nI ask the Senator: If someone were to step back at this moment and say \nthe Senate is debating a constitutional amendment, which everyone \nconcedes will not pass, we are going to spend the whole week on it, and \nthis issue ranks 33rd on the list of priorities of the American people, \nthe States are already dealing with it directly, they have spoken to \nthis through a variety of constitutional amendments and referenda in \neach and every State, virtually every State, I ask the Senator from \nNevada, does that lead to the conclusion the cynicism the American \npeople feel toward Congress and the leadership, the Republican \nleadership, in this Senate has been verified by the agenda we are \ndealing with this week?\n  Mr. REID. Our time has expired, and I say yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if I might ask if we could extend \nthe time over here for a few minutes, maybe 5 minutes, to make a brief \nstatement on this issue.\n  Mr. REID. The recess would be delayed for 5 minutes? Is that the \nrequest?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today with respect to S.J. Res. 1.\n  When considering proposed amendments to the United States \nConstitution, I first look back to history. In the summer of 1787, 55 \nindividuals gathered in Philadelphia to write our Constitution. It was \na very hot summer, and it was a long and arduous debate, many drafts \nback and forth, but careful consideration was given. Finally, in mid \nSeptember, it was over. The Constitution they produced was a monumental \nachievement. But the Framers did not know at that time what a great \nachievement they had made, one that would enable the United States, \ntoday, these 200-plus years later, to become the oldest continuously \nsurviving Republic form of government on Earth today.\n  Article V of the U.S. Constitution lays out the process for amending \nthis magnificent document. In their wisdom, our Founding Fathers \npurposefully made the task immensely formidable. Of both Houses of \nCongress, two-thirds have to vote in favor of passing a proposed \namendment. Subsequently, three-fourths of the states have to ratify \nthat amendment over a period of time.\n  History documents that there have been many attempts to amend the \nU.S. Constitution. According to one study--since 1789, over 10,000 \namendments to the Constitution have been proposed in Congress, but only \n27 have ever been ratified.\n  With this historical framework in mind, I have reviewed S.J. Res 1--\nthe Marriage Protection Amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a document referred to as \nthe ``box chart'' be printed in the Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. The proposed constitutional amendment is simply two \nsentences. The first sentence reads that marriage in the United States \nshall only consist of the union of a man and a woman. This is a concept \nwhich I have consistently voted in support of--beginning with the \nDefense of Marriage Act in 1996, and basically on this same \nconstitutional amendment 2 years ago. The time-honored, deeply rooted \ntradition of marriage between a man and a woman ought to be protected, \nand I support that.\n  But the second sentence of the proposed amendment gives me great \nconcern. It states that neither this Constitution, nor the constitution \nof any State, shall be construed to require that marriage or the legal \nincidents thereof be conferred upon any union other than the union of a \nman and a woman. It gives me concern because I don't think the second \nsentence speaks with the clarity to which the American people are \nentitled. Any number of calls are coming into my office, as they are to \nother Members, and clearly the callers are focusing on the first \nsentence. When you try to explain the second sentence, they don't \nunderstand it.\n  My colleagues who are supportive of this proposed constitutional \namendment have stated that it is their intent that this second sentence \nwill leave to the several States the decision of whether to recognize \nrelationships other than marriage, such as civil unions or domestic \npartnerships. But if that is the case, why not simply state that in \nplain English that is understandable for the millions upon millions of \nAmericans who are interested in this amendment? It is amazing to me \nthat a little more than 2 weeks ago, this Senate overwhelmingly \napproved an amendment to make English the national language of the \nUnited States. Yet today we debate an amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution--one of the most grave responsibilities incumbent upon \nMembers of Congress--America's founding document--and the second \nsentence of that proposed amendment fails in many ways to speak with \nthe clarity of the English language to which our public is entitled.\n  Some who have spoken in support of this proposed amendment have \nemployed a box chart on the floor of the Senate, and I have asked \nunanimous consent to include that in the Record in an effort to \ndemonstrate that the resolution would protect marriage but permit \nStates to recognize relationships other than marriage. If this is the \ncase, why not simply say so? Why not simply say that the power to \nrecognize or to prohibit relationships other than marriage shall be \nreserved to the several States? Or why not simply drop the second \nsentence altogether if it is confusing? Either option would clearly \nallow the 50 States to work their will on the issues of civil unions or \ndomestic partnerships. I believe it is extremely important that we \nleave to the States that responsibility.\n  If we wrote the second sentence plainly, we wouldn't need a box chart \nto sit here on the floor and try to decipher it.\n  My own State, the Commonwealth of Virginia, is trying to work its own \nwill on these issues right now. With the lack of clarity in this \nproposed federal amendment, I have to wonder whether the proposed \nfederal amendment respects the right of the several States to act in \nthis area.\n  As the second sentence of this proposed amendment is written now, the \nintent of the amendment simply isn't clear. What if a State legislature \nwanted to pass a State constitutional amendment to allow domestic \npartnerships? As I read this proposed amendment, it would likely \npreclude a State legislature from so acting. This type of unnecessary \nconfusion will undoubtedly lead to considerable litigation if this \nproposed amendment is accepted in its current form.\n  That, it seems to me, is not the duty of the Congress of the United \nStates, to write something that just calls upon the courts to try to \ndetermine what was the intent of the Congress. Then we have to go to \nthe box charts. Well, to me, the box charts speak in plain English \nlanguage, and that is why I am hopeful that the framers of this \namendment will perhaps consider amending it.\n  Therein rests the concern I have with S.J. Res. 1. I unequivocally \nsupport the first sentence; I support protecting marriage as the union \nbetween a man and a woman. I am concerned, however,\n\n[[Page S5450]]\n\nthat the second sentence of this proposed constitutional amendment is \nunnecessarily vague and could well trample on the rights of the several \nStates of our great Republic.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                     Marriage Protection Amendment\n\n\n                              S.J. RES. 1\n\n       Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the \n     union of a man and a woman. Neither this Constitution, nor \n     the constitution of any State, shall be construed to require \n     that marriage or the legal incidents thereof be conferred \n     upon any union other than the union of a man and a woman.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                          Creation of\n                                    Redefinition of    ``Civil Unions''      Granting the      Employee Benefits\n                                       Marriage          or ``Domestic    Rights or Benefits  Offered by Private\n                                                        Partnerships''        of Marriage         Businesses\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nState or federal courts can       Sentence 1          Sentence 2          Sentence 2          Unaffected.\n impose?                           prohibits.          prohibits.          prohibits.\nLegislature can make change?

Under the previous order, the time is divided \nequally until 2:30.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nS.J. Res. 1, the Marriage Protection Amendment.\n  I have heard people say that perhaps this issue should be left to the \nStates. As a general rule, you will not find anyone who is a stronger \nsupporter of States rights than I am. But this is a national issue the \ndefinition of marriage is and has been a national issue.\n  A May 22 Gallup Poll shows that a solid majority of Americans--58 \npercent--are opposed to granting gay marriages the same legal rights as \ntraditional marriages. Additionally, same-sex couples are traveling \nacross State lines to get married; as they do so, they will become \nentangled in the legal systems of other States, due to the full faith \nand credit clause of the U.S. Constitution. A State-by-State approach \nto gay marriage will be a logistical and legal mess that will force the \nFederal courts to intervene and require all states to recognize same-\nsex marriages. This is the only possible outcome.\n  The definition of marriage must be addressed, and it must be \naddressed now. The homosexual marriage lobby, as well as the polygamist \nlobby, shares the goal of essentially breaking down all State-regulated \nmarriage requirements to just one: consent. In doing so, they are \npaving the way for legal protection of such repugnant practices as: \nhomosexual marriage, unrestricted sexual conduct between adults and \nchildren, group marriage, incest, and bestiality. Using this \nphilosophy, activist lawyers and judges are working quickly, State-by-\nState, through the courts to force same-sex marriage and other \npractices, such as polygamy, on our country.\n  In 1878, Reynolds v. United States, which upheld the \nconstitutionality of Congress's antipolygamy laws, recognized that the \none-man, one-woman family structure is a crucial foundational element \nof the American democratic society, and thus there is a compelling \ngovernmental interest in its preservation.\n  The eroding of State common-law marriage requirements comes with a \nprice--If we can remove the opposite-sex requirement today, then what \nwould keep us from removing the one-at-a-time requirement, or legal-age \nrequirement tomorrow? In June of 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court signaled \nits likely support for same-sex marriage and Federal jurisdiction over \nthe issue when it struck down a sodomy ban in Lawrence v. Texas.\n  The majority opinion extended the reach of due process and the 14th \namendment of the U.S. Constitution to protect:\n\n       . . . personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, \n     contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and \n     education,'' and then declared that ``[p]ersons in a \n     homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for these purposes, \n     just as heterosexual persons do.\n\n  In his dissent to Lawrence v. Texas, Justice Scalia pointedly \ncautioned:\n\n       This reasoning leaves on pretty shaky grounds state laws \n     limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples . . .\n\n  Additionally, there is a case pending in the Tenth Circuit where the \npetitioners are using the homosexual marriage lobby's success in \nLawrence v. Texas to bolster their claim to a ``right'' to polygamous \nconduct and marriage.\n  Not only are Federal courts ruling in favor of such marriages, State \ncourts are, too. In 2004, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that \nsame-sex couples could marry. The State's high court ruling clearly \nignored tradition-- even its own State legislature.\n  Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, in his testimony on June 22, \n2004, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, stated:\n\n       We need an amendment that restores and protects our \n     societal definition of marriage, [and] blocks judges from \n     changing that definition.\n\n  Not only has the Massachusetts court ruling affected that State, it \nhas and will continue to open the floodgate of similar decisions by \nother State courts across the country.\n  Lawsuits are now pending in nine States, including my State of \nOklahoma, asking the courts to declare that traditional marriage laws \nare unconstitutional. Same-sex couples from at least 46 States have \nreceived marriage licenses in Massachusetts, California, and Oregon and \nhave returned to their home States. Many of these couples are now suing \nto overturn their home State's marriage laws. Unfortunately, using the \nequal protection and due process clauses in the U.S. Constitution, \nState and Federal courts have begun to strike down both the Federal and \nState Defense Of Marriage Act, DOMA, laws, which define marriage as \nbetween a man and a woman. The judicial branch is making this a Federal \nissue by stripping the power from the people's elected legislatures and \nforcing recognition of same-sex marriages.\n  Today, 45 States, such as Oklahoma, have statutory and/or \nconstitutional protection for traditional marriage. On average, State \nconstitutional amendments have passed with more than 71 percent of the \nvote, including with 76 percent in Oklahoma.\n  In societies where marriage has been redefined, potential parents \nbecome less likely to marry and out-of-wedlock births increase. \nAccording to Stanley Kurtz's 2004 article in the Weekly Standard, a \nmajority of children in Sweden and Norway are born out of wedlock. \nKurtz says:\n\n       Sixty percent of first-born children in Denmark have \n     unmarried parents--not coincidentally, these countries have \n     had something close to full gay marriage for a decade or \n     more.\n\n  Just last month, May, in a National Review Online article, Stanley \nKurtz again addresses the issue saying:\n\n       Europe's most influential sociologists are saying much the \n     same things: Same-sex marriage doesn't reinforce marriage; \n     instead, it upends marriage, and helps build acceptance for a \n     host of other mutually reinforcing changes (like single \n     parenting, parental co-habitation, and multi-partner unions) \n     that only serve to weaken marriage.\n\n  In fact, liberal German sociologists, Ulrich Beck and Elisabeth Beck-\nGernsheim, have openly and honestly expressed their eagerness to expand \nthe welfare state and destroy the traditional family.\n\n  As Kurtz puts it, they want ``the government to subsidize the new, \n`experimental' forms of family that emerge in the aftermath of the \ntraditional family's collapse.''\n  When this issue was on the floor 2 years ago, many of my conservative \ncolleagues made statements and observations that sufficiently framed \nthis debate.\n  Senator Allard, the sponsor of this amendment, believes our Founding \nFathers never envisioned that we would be changing the very structure \nof marriage and that we would be changing this core structure of \nsociety when he said:\n\n       We are in danger of losing a several-thousand-year-old \n     tradition, one that has been vital to the survival of \n     civilization itself.\n\n\n[[Page S5451]]\n\n\n  As my colleague from Kansas, Senator Brownback, said: a small group \nof activists and judicial elite ``do not have a right to redefine \nmarriage and impose a radical social experiment on our entire \nsociety.''\n  And my colleague from Alabama, Senator Sessions, said: ``If there are \nnot families to raise . . . . children, who will raise them? Who will \ndo that responsibility? It will fall on the State.'' This, to me, is \none of the most troubling outcomes of the whole gay marriage debate--\nthat the State will assume the parenting role of raising and \nfinancially supporting children.\n  Even Senator Reid restated his personal view just yesterday, which he \nalso expressed in 2004, when he said:\n\n       I'm personally opposed to same-sex marriage. I think a \n     marriage should be between a man and woman.\n\n  So when 70 percent of the voters in Nevada amended their State \nconstitution to restrict marriage to a man and a woman, and when they \nfurther amended it in 2002 with a State defense of marriage provision, \nwith Senator Reid's full support, some of us are confused now that \nSenator Reid thinks restricting marriage to a man and a woman is \n``writ[ing] discrimination into the Constitution.''\n  I would also like to point out that several prominent, respected \nreligious voices in our country have spoken out against the idea of gay \nmarriage and in support of the traditional definition.\n  According to ``Focus on the Family,'' headed by Dr. James Dobson, \nfamily is the fundamental building block of all human civilizations.\n  Chuck Colson, a man who most people in this body know quite well, was \nthe founder of Prison Fellowship. He has this to say about the prospect \nof gay marriage:\n\n       The redefiners of marriage are working tirelessly. Their \n     agenda is to tear down traditional marriage and make it \n     meaningless by removing its distinctives.\n\n  The Reverend Billy Graham's son, Franklin Graham, acknowledged that:\n\n       There is a real movement for same-sex marriage. We could \n     lose marriage in this country the way that we know it.\n\n  Finally, Dr. Jay Alan Sekulow, chief counsel for the American Center \nfor Law and Justice, who has argued numerous cases before the Supreme \nCourt recognizes that ``for centuries marriage has been defined as a \nunion between one man and one woman.''\n  That is really what this is all about--marriage is between a man and \na woman.\n  Civil authority did not create marriage. Marriage predates the state.\n  Civil authority chose to recognize it as the preferred union between \na man and a woman, because it is reproductive in nature and propagates \nthe survival of civilization itself.\n  We can dance around it and try to cater to certain groups, but I find \nsomething that has served me well for a number of years when something \nlike this comes up, and that is to go back to the Law, go back to the \nScriptures.\n  In Genesis 2:18, 21-24, God said:\n\n       It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a \n     helper comparable to him. . . . and the Lord God caused a \n     deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of \n     his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. Then the rib \n     which the Lord God had taken from man He made into a woman, \n     and He brought her to the man.\n       And Adam said, ``This is now bone of my bones and flesh of \n     my flesh. She shall be called woman, because she was taken \n     out of man.'' Therefore a man shall leave his father and \n     mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one \n     flesh. . . .\n\n  In Matthew 19:4-6, Jesus said:\n\n       Have you not read that He who made them at the beginning \n     made them male and female, and for this reason a man shall \n     leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and \n     the two shall become one flesh? So then, they are no longer \n     two but one flesh\n\n  The reason I read these two Scriptures is because they were quoted at \na very significant event that took place over 47 years ago. It was when \nmy wife and I were married.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I start off with a question. The \nquestion is, Why are we spending time on the floor of the Senate \ndiscussing this issue at this time? Is there anyone here unaware of the \nfact that Americans are bleeding in Iraq and Afghanistan? Why aren't we \ntalking about that war?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the Senator asked a question. I will be \nglad to respond to that question.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will not at this point accept a question. I want to \nmake my remarks just as the Senator from Oklahoma had a chance to make \nhis remarks. Perhaps when we are finished I will be able to accommodate \nthe Senator.\n  Why are we not focused on soaring gasoline prices and the toll it \ntakes on family budgets? People who plan their lives in my area, New \nJersey--a very crowded area--have had to buy their houses some distance \nfrom their jobs because they couldn't afford the housing. They \ncalculated the fact they would have to drive an hour each way--not \nunusual--10 hours a week behind the wheel of the car. Now, with gas \nprices as they are, the advantage they had by buying a home at a \ndistance is evaporating in front of them. Why aren't we talking about \nthat?\n  Why aren't we talking about 46 million Americans without health \ninsurance, every one of them worried about whether the next sickness is \ngoing to deprive them of their job, deprive them of their ability to \nfeed and clothe their children and take care of them? Why aren't we \ntalking about those things?\n  Why aren't we talking about extending stem cell research? I don't \nknow whether other Senators have had the same experience that I have. \nFamilies come in with children who are sick with juvenile diabetes. If \nyou ask those children what they want out of life, they say: I want to \nstop having to stick my finger all the time with a needle. I want to be \nable to do things just like other children.\n  I had a group of families with children with diabetes. I seated them \naround a table. By the way, the faces on these children are so \nbeautiful. In their expressions they say: We would love you if you can \nhelp us. That is what they say. That is how I respond.\n  I am a professional grandfather. I have 10 grandchildren, the oldest \nof whom is 12 and the youngest of whom is 2. What do I want? My whole \nlife is focused on what I can do for those kids as they grow and \ndevelop. When I look at those children, I ask the parents: Why are \ntheir faces so beautiful? They say: Because they are faces of want and \nneed in a child, expressing that in that kind of face.\n  It tells you something about what we ought to be talking about and \nnot spending our time on depriving somebody of an option that they are \nfree to choose in this life. Why aren't we debating a measure to make \nsure the Government is ready for the next Katrina? They are worried \nabout levees in California. They are worried about levees in other low-\nland States where they have some exposure. We are not talking about \nthat. Who can forget the picture of the people on the roofs of their \nhouses begging for someone to do something to save them? No, we are not \ntalking about that. We do not want to talk about that.\n\n  Why aren't we preparing for a possible bird flu epidemic? We know \nthat is a very serious topic.\n  Forget those topics, we are told. President Bush and the Republican \nleadership want Congress to drop everything to debate gay marriage. I \nhave lots of visitors in my offices in New Jersey and here. Not one of \nthem came to talk to me about gay marriage. They came to talk to me \nabout health insurance. They came to talk to me about their pensions \ndisappearing. They talk to me about their inability to afford their \nchildren's education when they want to prepare for a career. They talk \nabout the burden of gas prices. That is what they want us to do \nsomething about. They are not discussing gay marriage. They are not in \nthere discussing opening up the Constitution to amendment.\n  If we pass this amendment, history will record for the first time \never that we wrote discrimination into the United States Constitution. \nThink about that, the first time we have ever put discrimination \nagainst anyone in our Constitution.\n  In the Bill of Rights, every amendment is written to expand \nindividual rights. That is what our Constitution is about. It is a \nwonder, the thinking of our forefathers. The Bill of Rights was first \nsigned in New Jersey. If you look at all the amendments to the \nConstitution, only once did we restrict rights. That was Prohibition. \nAnd it did not take long to repeal that. The American people were not \ngoing to obey the law.\n\n[[Page S5452]]\n\nThey violated it in every way. Why create laws that cannot mean \nanything to people?\n  President Bush held an event on Monday night with supporters of this \namendment. At that event, the President did something totally \nirresponsible. It is hard to believe a President of the United States \nsaid what he said. He rallied his right-wing audience against our \nNation's court system.\n  Now, we talk here about separation of powers and how important it is \nthat the three legs of Government are able to exercise their \nobligations. The President went so far as to say that the American \ncourts are ``imposing their arbitrary will on the people.'' How about \nwhen the Court imposed its arbitrary will on the election of a \nPresident? What was said then? To suddenly say that the courts have no \njurisdiction of their own, free of criticism from the President of the \nUnited States, is the President saying our courts do not follow the \nlaw? Could people quote the President to justify ignoring a court \ndecision, just to score political points with a narrow interest group?\n  The President chooses to undermine our Nation's system of courts and \nlaws. It is a dangerous form of political pandering.\n  This constitutional amendment would not just ban same-sex marriages. \nIt also threatens civil unions, domestic partnership laws, laws passed \nby States to recognize relationships and conferring legal rights \nbetween partners. Is our goal to strip all of these relationships of \ntheir dignity?\n  Once the Federal Government starts regulating marriage, what is next? \nWhat is going to stop Congress from acting as the morality police and \nprohibit people from getting married unless they pledge to have \nchildren or unless they pledge to restrict the number of children they \nhave? What is going to stop this body from outlawing divorce?\n  I don't think the actual motive for this amendment is morality. The \nmotive, as I see in this amendment, is pure raw politics. Republicans \nhave their backs against the wall. So look what the people think of the \nPresident of the United States and the job he is doing. They think \npoorly of him. If they had the right, they would fire him.\n  When I was running a company, before I was running for the Senate, if \nI thought so poorly of someone, I would fire him. I would not keep him.\n  No, this is a salvage operation for the Republican Party. We are \ndebating this amendment now because it is an election year. That is \nwhy. Why did we have this debate in 2004 and this year but not in 2005? \nLet's defer this until 2007. I am willing to do that. We can discuss it \nin a year, when there is not an election in the offing.\n  This is simply political gay-bashing. That is the mission, try to \n``husband'' the resources you have, the support you have, and pick on a \ngroup of people. The backers of this amendment want to drum up hysteria \nwhere none currently exists. They want to change the subject away from \nthe issues such as Iraq and gas prices. It is a shameful attempt to \ndivide the American people for political gain.\n  Today, the 6th of June, is the anniversary of D-Day. On June 6, 1944, \nAmericans from every corner of our country fought to protect our values \nand our families. Today, we are tarnishing the memory of D-Day by \nworking to amend our Constitution to restrict individual freedoms.\n  I was wearing a uniform that day. I was overseas. I was not on the \ncombat line, but I knew what I was doing was good for my country. \nSixteen million of us served in the military in World War II.\n  I had visitors just last Thursday night at my office in New Jersey, \nabout 10 people. One person lost their son. This woman was angry. I had \nspoken to her when his death was announced over a year ago. She was \nangry. He was a second lieutenant. His assignment that day was to \ndiffuse bombs. She said: My son was trained to man a gun in the \nartillery. That is what his mission was. He was diffusing a bomb and he \nlost his life: The country that sent my son overseas is a country that \nhelped my son die.\n  There was a woman with tears running down her face: Our son has been \nwounded once; they say he is ready to go back to combat. He has a \nPurple Heart. I don't want him to go back. Crying bitterly, in front of \nme.\n  There was a couple whose son is due for a second tour of duty. People \nin this unit were lost in the first tour. Why, now, they ask, is he \ngoing back to this war that does not do anything for America?\n  No, we do not want to discuss that in the Senate. That is too \nserious. That brings home the toll and the anguish that exists with our \ntime in Iraq. We ought to be talking about what we do to get out of \nthere safely and quickly. That is what we ought to do. But, no, we are \ntalking about gay marriage. I can just see the people in arms across \nthis country saying, The first thing I want you to do is make sure \nthere is no gay marriage in this country. The devil with my kids \neducation, the devil with my need for health care, the devil with our \nability to be able to afford to live now in the country. Two people \nworking so many jobs, just about keeping their heads above water.\n\n  Every Senator in this Senate values the institution of marriage. In \nmy view, the way to honor marriage is to provide families with economic \nopportunity, good schooling for their children, a clean environment to \nlive in, health care they can afford and funding for medical research \nthat can help fight the diseases that plague children, such as juvenile \ndiabetes, autism, or asthma. There are so many problems we could help \nprevent.\n  The amendment before the Senate today is not about protecting \nmarriage. It is about directing people's lives, about making sure you \nbehave in a particular way. Those of us who are talking against this do \nnot necessarily support gay marriage. What we support is freedom, \nfreedom to choose your lifestyle. That is what we are talking about. In \nState after State they are writing their own laws, what they think is \nappropriate for the people in their State--not to restrict them but to \nopen their opportunity.\n  I hope my colleagues will reject this divisive amendment. Let's get \non with far more pressing issues facing our Nation that can improve our \nnational health, can improve our national will, can improve our \nnational morale.\n  Those are the things I would like to do instead of looking and seeing \nwhat people really think about all of us in this place, all of us, from \nthe White House, to the Senate, to the House. What do the American \npeople think about the work we are doing? They do not think a heck of a \nlot of good is coming out of here. Frankly, we give them good cause \nbecause what we are paying attention to is what matters least to most \nAmericans. What matters most in these Chambers, unfortunately, at this \ntime is politics and elections. Too bad, America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, first let me praise the Senator from New \nJersey and associate myself with his excellent remarks in opposition to \nthis amendment both on marriage and with regard to the obvious point \nthat we should be working on issues affecting the American people.\n  The Constitution of the United States is a historic guarantee of \nindividual freedom. For over two centuries, it has served as a beacon \nof hope, an example to people around the world who yearn to be free and \nto live their lives without Government interference, with their most \nbasic personal decisions.\n  I, like everyone else in the Senate, took an oath when I joined this \nbody to support and defend the Constitution. I am saddened, therefore, \nto be once again debating an amendment to our Constitution that is so \ninconsistent with our Nation's history of expanding and protecting \nfreedom.\n  There are serious issues facing this Congress. The fight against \nterrorism, the war in Iraq, health care, high gas prices, relief and \nrecovery after Hurricane Katrina, the economy. These are the issues \nupon which the American people are demanding that Congress act. But \ninstead, we are spending much of this week debating the poorly thought \nout, divisive, and politically motivated constitutional amendment that \neveryone knows has no chance of success in the Senate.\n  The proposed constitutional amendment before the Senate today, Senate \nJoint Resolution 1, has no better chance of getting a two-thirds \nmajority\n\n[[Page S5453]]\n\nin the Senate than it did in 2004, which was another election year. \nThere are no new court decisions that supporters of the amendment can \nlegitimately argue make it any more imperative now than it was then \nthat such an amendment be passed. Yet the Judiciary Committee was \nordered to mark up this amendment to fit a schedule announced by the \nmajority leader months ago.\n  This is pure politics, an election-year gambit. We should not play \npolitics with the Constitution, nor should we play politics with the \nlives of gay and lesbian Americans who correctly see this \nconstitutional amendment as an effort to make them permanent second-\nclass citizens.\n  The amendment we are all debating will not pass, but it still risks \nstoking fear and divisiveness at a time when we should be trying to \nunite Americans. Gay and lesbian Americans are our friends, our family \nmembers, our neighbors, our colleagues. They should not be used as \npawns in a cynical political exercise.\n\n  Backers of the amendment say they want to support marriage. But this \ndebate is not really about supporting marriage. We all agree that good \nand strong marriages should be supported and celebrated. I happen to \nbelieve that two adults who love each other and want to make a lifelong \ncommitment to each other, with all of the responsibilities that that \nentails, should be able to do so, regardless of their sex. I know \nothers strongly disagree.\n  The debate we are having in the Senate, however, is not about whether \nStates should permit same-sex marriage. The debate is about whether we \nshould amend the Constitution of the United States to define marriage. \nThe answer to that question has to be ``no.'' It is unnecessary and \nwrong for Congress to legislate for all States, for all time, on a \nmatter that has been traditionally handled by the States and religious \ninstitutions since the founding of our Nation. For that reason alone, \nthis amendment should be defeated.\n  There is no doubt that the proposed Federal marriage amendment would \nalter the basic principles of federalism that have served our Nation \nwell for over 200 years. The Framers of our Constitution granted \nlimited, enumerated powers to the Federal Government, while reserving \nthe remaining powers of government, including family law, to State \ngovernments. Marriage has traditionally been regulated by the States. \nAs Professor Dale Carpenter told the Constitution Subcommittee in its \nfirst hearing on this topic nearly three years ago, ``never before have \nwe adopted a constitutional amendment to limit the States' ability to \ncontrol their own family law.'' That is exactly what this proposed \namendment would do. It would permanently restrict the ability of States \nto define and recognize marriage or any legally sanctioned unions as \nthey see fit.\n  One of our distinguished former colleagues, Republican Senator Alan \nSimpson, opposes an amendment to the Constitution on marriage. In an \nop-ed in the Washington Post, he stated:\n\n       In our system of government, laws affecting family life are \n     under the jurisdiction of the states, not the federal \n     government. This is as it should be. . . . [Our Founders] saw \n     that contentious social issues would be best handled in the \n     legislatures of the states, where debates could be held \n     closest to home. That's why we should let the states decide \n     how best to define and recognize any legally sanctioned \n     unions--marriage or otherwise.\n\n  Columnist William Safire has also urged his conservative colleagues \nto refrain from amending the Constitution in this way. Commentator \nGeorge Will takes the same position.\n  I recognize that the current debate on same-sex marriage was hastened \nby a decision of the highest court in Massachusetts issued in late \n2003. That decision, in a case called Goodrich, said that the State \nmust issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. But the court did not \nsay that other States must do so, nor could it. And it did not say that \nchurches, synagogues, mosques, or other religious institutions must \nrecognize same-sex unions, nor could it. Even Governor Romney of \nMassachusetts, who testified before the Judiciary Committee in 2004, \nadmitted that the court's decision in no way requires religious \ninstitutions to recognize same-sex unions. No religious institution is \nrequired to recognize same-sex unions in Massachusetts or elsewhere. \nThat was true before the Goodrich decision, and it remains true today.\n  Indeed, as time has passed since the Massachusetts court ruling, I \nthink it has become clear that passing a constitutional amendment would \nbe an extreme and unnecessary reaction. States are in the process of \naddressing the issue of how to define marriage. Voters in several \nStates passed marriage initiatives in the last election. The \nlegislature in Connecticut recently passed a civil union bill and the \nGovernor signed it. In California, a bill passed by the legislature to \npermit same-sex marriages was vetoed but new protections for domestic \npartners were signed into law. The States are addressing the issue in \ndifferent ways, which is how our Federal system generally works. I may \nagree with some State actions and disagree with others, but it would be \na tragic mistake to cut this process off prematurely.\n  I was particularly struck by reports on what happened recently in the \nMassachusetts Legislature. The legislature narrowly passed a \nconstitutional amendment in 2004 to prohibit same-sex marriage, but \nwhen the amendment returned in 2005, as the Massachusetts Constitution \nrequires in order to put it on the ballot, the legislature rejected it \nby a vote of 157 to 39. Many supporters of the amendment apparently \nchanged their minds.\n  So we should think long and hard about pre-empting State legislatures \nor State initiative processes through a Federal constitutional \namendment that freezes in place a single, restrictive definition of \nmarriage.\n  The supporters of the Federal marriage amendment would have Americans \nbelieve that the courts are poised to strike down marriage laws. They \nsuggest that we will soon see courts in States other than Massachusetts \nrequiring those States to recognize same-sex marriages, too. Of course, \nno such thing has happened in the 2 years since the Goodrich decision \nwent into effect in May 2004. So this is a purely hypothetical issue--\nhardly a sound basis for amending our Nation's governing charter. And \neven if another State followed Massachusetts, either by legislative \naction or a judicial ruling, I believe it would be a grave mistake for \nCongress to step in.\n  As Professor Lea Brilmayer testified before the Constitution \nSubcommittee in 2004, and as remains true today, no court has required \na State to recognize a same-sex marriage performed in another State. \nAnd as Professor Carpenter testified:\n\n     the Full Faith and Credit Clause has never been understood to \n     mean that every state must recognize every marriage performed \n     in every other state. Each state may refuse to recognize a \n     marriage performed in another state if that marriage would \n     violate the public policy of that state.\n\n  In fact, Congress and many States have already taken steps to \nreaffirm this principle. In 1996, Congress passed the Defense of \nMarriage Act, a bill I did not support, but that is now the law. \nSection 2 of DOMA is effectively a reaffirmation of the full faith and \ncredit clause as applied to marriage. It states that no State shall be \nforced to recognize a same-sex marriage authorized by another State.\n  In addition, 38 States have passed what have come to be called \n``State DOMAs,'' declaring as a matter of public policy that they will \nnot recognize same-sex marriages.\n  There has not yet been a successful constitutional challenge to the \nFederal or State DOMAs. In fact, three such challenges have already \nfailed. Of course, it is possible that the situation could change. A \ncase could be brought challenging the Federal DOMA or a State DOMA, and \nthe Supreme Court could strike it down. But do we really want to amend \nthe Constitution simply to prevent the Supreme Court from reaching a \nparticular result in the future? What kind of precedent would such a \npreemptive strike against the governing document of this Nation set?\n  Former Representative Bob Barr, the author of the Federal DOMA, \nstrongly opposes amending the Constitution on this issue. He believes \nthat amending the Constitution with publicly contested social policies \nwould ``cheapen the sacrosanct nature of that document.''\n  He also warned:\n\n       We meddle with the Constitution to our own peril. If we \n     begin to treat the Constitution as our personal sandbox, in \n     which to build and destroy castles as we please, we risk \n     diluting the grandeur of having a Constitution in the first \n     place.\n\n\n[[Page S5454]]\n\n\n  My colleagues, those are the words of the author of the Federal DOMA \nstatute. That is what he said about the wisdom of trying to amend the \nConstitution in this manner. I have spoken with Mr. Barr about this. He \nand I disagree about many things. But we agree wholeheartedly that the \nConstitution is a very special document and that amending it to enact \nthe social policy of the moment would be a grave mistake.\n  So far I have been discussing the general arguments against a Federal \nconstitutional amendment defining marriage. I think they are \ncompelling. But I also want to take some time today to discuss the \nspecific text we are now considering: S.J. Res. 1, the so-called \nMarriage Protection Amendment. The amendment states:\n\n       Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the \n     union of a man and a woman.\n\n  That is what we have come to refer to as sentence one. The amendment \ncontinues in sentence two:\n\n       Neither this Constitution, nor the constitution of any \n     State, shall be construed to require that marriage or the \n     legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other \n     than the union of a man and a woman.\n\n  Before I discuss some of the ambiguities in this language, let me \nfirst remind my colleagues that this whole effort has often been \nportrayed by its proponents as a reaction to so-called ``liberal \nactivist judges'' reinterpreting marriage. Time after time, we are told \nthat judges have made law, in cases like the Supreme Court's decision \nin Lawrence v. Texas that State sodomy laws are unconstitutional, in \nthe Massachusetts decision in Goodrich, and in the Vermont State court \ndecision that forced the State legislature to adopt a civil unions law. \nThis amendment is needed, we are told, to counteract and correct those \nmissteps and to make sure they don't happen again. Keep that underlying \nconcern in mind as we discuss the ambiguities of this language and who \nwill ultimately decide how they are to be resolved.\n  A question that is important to many Senators, and to many Americans, \nas they consider this constitutional amendment is how it will apply to \nlaws passed by State or local governments granting same-sex couples the \nright to enter into civil unions or domestic partnerships to become \neligible for government recognition of their relationships and for \ncertain benefits. One of the witnesses at the last hearing we held in \nthe Subcommittee on the Constitution, Professor Michael Seidman, from \nGeorgetown University Law Center, testified quite convincingly about \nthe ambiguity of the language of this amendment on that question. And \nso chairman of the subcommittee asked if he had thought about how to \ndraft the amendment to, as he put it, ``hit the mark.''\n  Professor Seidman responded:\n\n       Part of the problem is I think the people behind the \n     amendment themselves are not in agreement on how to go. . . . \n     So with respect, Senator, I think you guys have to get \n     straight what you want before you tell me how to go about \n     drafting it.\n\n  At the last subcommittee hearing on this topic, I asked the witnesses \nthat subcommittee Chairman Brownback had called some specific questions \nabout this issue and then I asked them to respond to written questions \nabout how they believe S.J. Res. 1 would apply to a challenge brought \nagainst specific State legislative actions. I have asked these \nquestions of previous witnesses as well, and I have seen statements \nfrom many of the supporters of the amendment. I think Professor Seidman \nis absolutely right. It is simply not clear what the sponsors of this \namendment intend.\n\n  Let's start with civil unions. Would this amendment outlaw civil \nunions? Specifically, would the recently passed Connecticut statute \nthat establishes civil unions in that State be unconstitutional under \nthis amendment? The Connecticut statute provides as follows:\n\n       Parties to a civil union shall have all the same benefits, \n     protections and responsibilities under law, whether derived \n     from the general statutes, administrative regulations or \n     court rules, policy, common law or any other source of civil \n     law, as are granted to spouses in a marriage, which is \n     defined as the union of one man and one woman.\n\n  Professor Richard Wilkins, from Brigham Young University, whom I \nunderstand was consulted in the drafting of the amendment, answered my \nwritten question as follows: ``The language quoted from Section 14 of \nthe Connecticut statute would not be unconstitutional under the \nproposed amendment.'' But Professor Gerard Bradley, from Notre Dame, \nanother drafter of the amendment, testified as follows at our hearing \nin April:\n\n       The amendment leaves it wide open for legislatures to \n     extend some, many, most, perhaps all but one, I suppose, \n     benefit of marriage to unmarried people, but I would say if \n     it is a marriage in all but name, that is ruled out by the \n     definition of marriage in the first sentence.\n\n  And Professor Christopher Wolfe, from Marquette University, another \nwitness from the subcommittee's last hearing, agrees with Professor \nBradley. He said the following in answer to my written question:\n\n       I think Connecticut's civil union scheme, which was enacted \n     by the General Assembly without any judicial involvement, \n     would be unconstitutional under the Marriage Protection \n     Amendment, because it effectively authorizes marriage for \n     unions of two men or two women, since the only difference \n     between civil unions and marriage is the name.\n\n  Groups supporting the amendment like the Alliance for Marriage and \nConcerned Women for America seem to think the amendment will permit \nlegislatures to enact civil union legislation. In a radio interview \nduring the Senate's consideration of the amendment in 2004, Bob Knight, \nthe head of that Concerned Women for America, suggested that wasn't \nsuch a good thing. He said:\n\n       The second sentence was so convoluted that many legal \n     scholars disagreed about what it actually meant, and its \n     backers assured everyone that it meant States could pass \n     civil unions, which is not the way to protect marriage. Civil \n     unions are gay marriage by another name.\n\n  As recently as November 2005, the Web site of the Alliance for \nMarriage had the following explanation of a chart in which it says that \n``quasi-marital schemes'' such as civil unions would be permitted if \nadopted by a State legislature rather than imposed by court:\n\n       The second sentence ensures that the democratic process at \n     the state level will continue to determine the allocation of \n     the benefits associated with marriage.\n\n  Interestingly, this chart no longer appears on the Web site. I won't \nspeculate about why that is, but it does seem like an important \nquestion for supporters of this amendment to get their stories straight \non. There are States in the country today that authorize civil unions. \nHow would this constitutional amendment affect those laws? We know what \nthe supporters of the amendment intended with respect to the law in \nMassachusetts, but what about in Vermont, and Connecticut, and \nCalifornia, and New Jersey? What are duly elected State legislatures, \nin the exercise of their responsibility to enact laws consistent with \nthe values and preferences of their citizens, allowed to do, and what \nare they prohibited from doing? Don't they deserve to know?\n  I could go on and on here, but let me mention Professor Scott \nFitzgibbon of Boston College Law School, who also testified in support \nof the amendment at the subcommittee's last hearing. Mr. Fitzgibbon \nsimply declined to answer when I asked him at the hearing whether the \namendment would allow a State employer to give benefits to unmarried \ndomestic partners of its employees. And he also refused to answer a \nfollowup written question about whether Connecticut's civil union law \nwould be constitutional. But he did say the following at the hearing:\n\n       I am just going to say that the degree of ambiguity . . . \n     isn't such a terrible thing. This isn't part of the tax code. \n     It is proposedly [sic] a part of the United States \n     Constitution and constitutional provisions rightly leave some \n     scope for later determination.\n\n  So there you have it, Mr. President. The supporters and drafters of \nthis amendment can't agree on how it would affect civil union laws like \nthe one recently enacted by the democratically elected legislature of \nthe State of Connecticut. And at least one of them says that ambiguity \nis not such a terrible thing. It is normal for constitutional \nprovisions to leave ``some scope for later determination'' he says.\n  So who will decide this question, which everyone can anticipate will \nbe raised if this amendment becomes part of the Constitution? Who is \nresponsible in our legal system for making a ``later\n\n[[Page S5455]]\n\ndetermination,'' as Professor Fitzgibbon calls it, of the meaning of a \nconstitutional amendment? You guessed it. It is the courts! Given how \nthis whole exercise of trying to define marriage in the governing \ndocument of our country started--outrage over a State court's \ninterpretation of a State constitution and fear of supposedly \n``activist judges'' taking it upon themselves to redefine marriage--\nthat is ironic indeed.\n  Now Professor Wolfe had an interesting suggestion when he answered my \nwritten questions concerning the California and New Jersey domestic \npartner statutes. Last summer, the California Legislature enacted a \nstatute that grants all the same rights to domestic partners as it does \nto married spouses, except the right to file a joint tax return. All \nthe rights and benefits but one. Under Professor Bradley's \ninterpretation, that's probably okay. Professor Wilkins agrees that \nCalifornia's statute would survive a challenge. The chart that used to \nbe on the Alliance for Marriage's Web site also agrees. I think a few \nof my colleagues made similar statements yesterday on the floor. But \nProfessor Wolfe isn't so sure. He says in his written response to my \nquestion:\n\n       It could be argued that it is unconstitutional under the \n     Marriage Protection Amendment for the same reason that the \n     Connecticut civil union law is unconstitutional, since--even \n     though one provision provides one exception--the general \n     principle of the law (in Sec. 4) defines the domestic \n     partnership as being equivalent to marriage. The single \n     exception could easily be viewed as merely an evasive \n     maneuver to avoid a pure equivalence that would make the \n     statute constitutionally vulnerable.\n       It could also be argued, however, that there is a \n     difference between this domestic partnership law and marriage \n     (beyond just the name), and therefore domestic partnership is \n     not marriage in everything but name, and therefore it is \n     within the constitutional power of the California legislature \n     to pass. . . . In a close case like this, I think the \n     legislative history would be likely to play a determinative \n     role in the final decision.\n\n  He goes on in an answer concerning the New Jersey domestic \npartnership statute to make his suggestion:\n\n       Of course, it would be desirable to clarify this question, \n     if possible. For example, offering an unambiguous statement \n     of the meaning of the amendment in the legislative history \n     (e.g., the committee report on the amendment, and \n     representations--uncontradicted by other supporters of the \n     amendment--of the amendment's sponsors in floor debate) would \n     be likely to have a substantial impact on how the amendment \n     would be understood by those who have to vote on it, in \n     Congress and in State legislatures.\n\n  Well there's a novel idea. Let's have an ``unambiguous statement'' of \nthe meaning of the amendment, uncontradicted by other supporters of the \namendment. But Professor Wolfe, a supporter of the amendment, doesn't \nknow what it is. He answered my questions as if they were a law school \nexam hypothetical. This amendment has been around for nearly 3 years \nand we still don't have that unambiguous statement. Will we get one in \nthis debate on the floor? I don't know. I do know that some of the most \nardent supporters of the amendment in the Senate are strongly opposed \nto civil unions as well. But will the amendment they wrote to \nsupposedly protect marriage outlaw civil unions and domestic \npartnerships? It is not clear to me yet, and when we are talking about \namending the Constitution of the United States, I think it should be.\n  The Senate and State legislatures--not to mention the American \npeople--deserve clear and reliable answers to these questions before \nthey are asked to decide whether to amend the Constitution. So I would \nhope that every Senator who is planning to vote ``yes'' on this \namendment today will tell us before we conclude this debate what he or \nshe thinks the amendment means and how it would apply to State statutes \nalready on the books, as well as others that might be passed. Maybe we \nwill get that unambiguous statement we have waited so long for. Then \nagain, maybe we won't.\n  Even though Professor Wolfe answered my question as if it were a law \nschool exam--saying ``it could be argued on the one hand. . . . But on \nthe other hand''--this is not just an academic exercise. It will have \nan impact on the lives of millions of Americans.\n\n  Mr. President, as you can tell, I am very concerned about the Senate \nconsidering this amendment on the floor without any certainty about \nwhat it means or how it will be applied. Fortunately, it seems clear \nthat supporters of this amendment don't have the votes to pass it in \nthe Senate. So the lack of clarity has no real world repercussions for \nnow. But it is extremely disappointing that we may vote in the United \nStates Senate on an amendment to the Constitution of the United States \nwith such basic questions unresolved.\n  The Judiciary Committee should have fully explored these questions. \nInstead, because of the rigid schedule to bring this matter to the \nfloor, the committee considered the amendment hastily and out of the \npublic eye, without cameras, without microphones, with only a handful \nof press and no members of the public present. That is no way to treat \nany important legislative matter, let alone an amendment to the basic \ngoverning charter of our country, the Constitution. As a result, the \namendment did not receive the kind of searching inquiry and debate that \na constitutional amendment should receive. Our hearings in the \nSubcommittee on the Constitution exposed serious questions about the \nmeaning and effect of the amendment, including the conflicting answers \nto written questions that I have discussed. Further work in the \ncommittee might have shed light on those questions for our colleagues \nin the Senate who are now faced with having to vote on the amendment. \nBut it seems that politics often trumps reason in this body during an \nelection year. And when the majority leader has promised interest \ngroups supporting this amendment that there will be a floor \nconsideration on a particular day, there is apparently nothing that can \nstand in the way of that promise being kept. Not even respect for the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  We should not write discrimination and prejudice into the \nConstitution. And we should not prematurely cut off the important \ndebates taking place in States across the country about how to define \nmarriage by putting in place a permanent, restrictive Federal \ndefinition of marriage.\n  As we sit here today, there are Americans across our country out of \nwork, struggling to pay the month's bills, worrying about their lack of \nhealth insurance or their ability to put their kids through college. \nInstead of spending our limited time this session on a proposal that is \ndestined to fail and will only divide Americans from one another, we \nshould be addressing the issues that will make our Nation more secure, \nour communities stronger, and the future of our families brighter.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this unnecessary, mean-spirited, \ndivisive and poorly thought out constitutional amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to respond. First \nof all, the States are trying to handle the issue of marriage. The \nproblem is that the courts are changing those actions. Even worse than \nthat, we have citizens who initiated issues on marriage within the \nStates, and now we have the courts overturning that when those issues \nhave passed by 70 percent or more.\n  I felt that needed to be clarified.\n  I think the amendment is very clear, particularly the second \nsentence, when you know that refers to the courts and we are limiting \nthe powers of the courts. We have not done anything to restrict the \npower of the legislature, except on the definition of marriage which is \nbetween a man and a woman.\n  This is an important issue, and I think we need to assure that the \nStates will have a key role as far as handling issues related to \nmarriage. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I stand in strong support of this proposed \namendment to the U.S. Constitution to uphold and affirm traditional \nmarriage.\n  Several years ago, when folks who were focused on the health of \nmarriage and the upbringing of children from around the country \ngathered to begin to attack this problem, they came to the Congress \nwith the idea of proposing a constitutional amendment. They\n\n[[Page S5456]]\n\nwent to certain Members of both the House and Senate, Republicans and \nDemocrats. I was in the House at the time, and I was honored that I was \none of the four House Republicans--there were eight House Members in \nall, four Republicans and four Democrats--whom these leaders approached \nto be original coauthors of this constitutional amendment. I \nimmediately agreed and have been very involved in the debate and the \nfight ever since then.\n  I am very happy to bring this work to the Senate with so many other \nleaders such as Senator Allard, who has been leading the effort for \nsome time. This is a very important effort because--it is often said, \nbut it is very true and it is worth repeating--marriage is truly the \nmost fundamental institution in human history. Think about that \nstatement and the significance of it: It is the single most fundamental \nsocial institution in human history.\n  Certainly, we should not rush, as we are at the present time through \nactivist courts, to radically redefine it after thousands and thousands \nof years of living under the traditional definition.\n  Mr. President, often in the Senate we get very wrapped up in our \ndebate and our laws and proposals and Government programs. We think so \nmuch is changed by that and so much hinges on that. Yet what is so much \nmore important and more fundamental are those enduring--hopefully \nenduring--social institutions such as marriage, community, church, and \nfaith communities. We need to realize how central those sorts of \ninstitutions are and how important they are in terms of influencing \nbehavior in our society--good and bad behavior. When we look at so many \nof the social ills we try to address in Congress with Government \nprograms and proposals, serious social problems such as drug abuse, \nteenage pregnancy, and the like, perhaps the single biggest predictor \nof good results versus bad results is whether kids come from a stable, \nloving, nurturing, two-parent family, a mother and a father. That \ndoesn't mean you cannot have success raising a child in other \nenvironments, such as in a struggling one-parent household. It means \nthat the odds are so much more stacked against you when you move to \nthat other sort of environment.\n  So I think it is very appropriate and well overdue that we in the \nSenate focus on nurturing, upholding, preserving, and protecting such a \nfundamental social institution as traditional marriage. A lot of folks \nin Washington don't fully understand that. But I can tell you that real \npeople in the real world, certainly including in Louisiana, get it. \nThat is why 2 years ago, in 2004, we passed a State constitutional \nmarriage amendment in Louisiana to uphold traditional marriage. We \npassed it with 78 percent of the vote. Folks in Louisiana want those \nvalues upheld. They don't want them redefined radically by activist \ncourts, particularly people in courts in other States such as \nMassachusetts. And make no mistake, that is what is happening. That \ntrend would have an impact not just in isolated States such as \nMassachusetts but throughout the country as marriage is redefined by \nliberal activist judges and others. So the people in Louisiana and a \nsolid majority of people around the country want us to address this \nissue nationally through a constitutional amendment once and for all. \nThat is why I strongly support this effort.\n  I thank the Senator from Colorado and others again for leading this \nfight in the Senate. I was proud to help lead it in the House when I \nwas there. I am proud to join other allies on the floor of the Senate. \nAgain, rather than focus on all these new Government programs, new \nlittle ideas that we run to the floor of the Senate with every day, \nlet's take time to remember and focus on truly significant, enduring \nsocial institutions, which are the greatest predictors and factors in \nterms of encouraging good behavior and success, discouraging bad \nbehavior and failure. This is the way we can have the most impact on \nthose problems we debate endlessly, such as drug abuse, teenage \npregnancy, and the like. I urge all of my colleagues to join us in this \neffort.\n  I predict that, while we may not reach the two-thirds vote we \nultimately need with this vote this week, we will make important \nprogress, we will pick up votes since the last time the Congress voted \non this issue in 2004. I am one small example of that progress because \nmy election in 2004 meant that this vote went from a ``no'' vote of my \npredecessor, John Breaux, to a proud ``yes'' vote of the junior Senator \nfrom Louisiana now. I look forward to casting that vote. I urge my \ncolleagues to rally around enduring, positive social institutions that \nare so essential for the health of families, kids being brought up and, \nindeed, our society.\n\n  With that, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, when I first ran for office to represent my \nfolks out in Utah, I announced my candidacy because of my deep love for \nmy country and my State. My appreciation for both has only deepened \nover the years. Perhaps the most remarkable characteristic of this \ncountry--one that, in my opinion, is distinctly American--is our \ntolerance, our willingness to accommodate the very beliefs of our \nfellow citizens. After all, our country's motto is E Pluribus Unum--out \nof many, one.\n  But we accept these differences because we share so much else. We \nsometimes forget it around here, but we agree more than we disagree, or \nat least that is what I hope for. We all believe in the dignity of the \nhuman person. We all believe that men and women were endowed by their \nCreator with certain inalienable rights, and the Government exists to \nsecure those rights. For us, and for our constituents, this is common \nsense. The same is not true in many other countries, where these basic \nideas are debated by all and rejected by some.\n  We should remember this heritage of respect when we debate the \nmarriage protection amendment. There are strong feelings on both sides \nof this issue.\n  I support this amendment. Marriage and family life are the bedrock of \nAmerican society--the schoolhouse of American citizenship--and judges \nshould not be altering this fundamental institution.\n  I understand that some of my colleagues believe we should be debating \nsomething that they see as of greater consequence. But for many in this \nbody, and for millions of people throughout the country, including in \nUtah, no issue is more important. During this debate, we should treat \neach other fairly, with respect, and with an openness to the good-faith \narguments on both sides of this amendment.\n  There is precedent for this. A few weeks ago, the Senate passed an \nimmigration bill. I voted against it, but I agreed with the sentiments \nof my colleagues who concluded, after the die was cast, that the Senate \nhad behaved admirably. Tensions ran high, but we had a respectful and \nserious debate about the issues. We voted amendments up and down. I am \nnot saying I saw any Websters, Clays, or Calhouns on the floor, but our \nrespect for one another's opinions and well-intentioned debate \ncertainly did them proud. This is not to say that I was happy with the \nfinal product. Even as a purported compromise, it left so much to be \ndesired that I was compelled to vote against it. Yet, I was encouraged \nby the process and the respect that we showed for the deeply held \nopinions of fellow Senators.\n  Unfortunately, the debate over the marriage amendment seems to be \nunfolding quite differently. You would not know it from the arguments \nof the opponents, and you would not know it from the lack of treatment \nit has received in some news outlets; but this is an important issue to \nAmericans. This might not be a major issue for those who live inside \nthe beltway, but for my neighbors in Salt Lake City, my constituents \nthroughout Utah, and good, decent Americans across the country, this is \na critical issue.\n  This debate is not some sideshow for a small sliver of activist \ngroups. Majorities of Americans across the Nation support the \nprotection of traditional marriage laws. This support is not limited to \nred or blue American. States in every region of the country have worked \nin recent years to reaffirm the traditional definition of marriage. \nForty-five States have either a State constitutional amendment or a \nstatute that preserves traditional marriage laws. Nineteen States have \ncodified the\n\n[[Page S5457]]\n\ndefinition of marriage in their State constitutions. In 2004, 13 \nStates, including Utah, overwhelmingly passed their own constitutional \namendments to preserve traditional marriage. I was proud to join the \nmajority of my fellow citizens in supporting the adoption of Utah's \nmeasure to protect traditional marriage. Seven more States will vote on \ntheir amendments this year.\n  Yet, for those opposed to this amendment, these constituent concerns \nare not worth our time. I disagree. Yesterday the distinguished \nDemocratic leader came to the floor--a dear friend of mine--with a \nlaundry list of issues that we could be addressing instead of this \namendment. Along with the Democratic whip, he did so again today. \nUltimately, I think we are capable of chewing gum and walking at the \nsame time. In 2 days, we will be taking up floor time to debate a bill \nto create a race-based government for the State of Hawaii. I will not \nhold my breath waiting for these same folks to argue then that we \nshould be discussing more pressing issues.\n  I wish those dismissing the importance of this issue would let us \nlook at their phone logs. I know that in my office our phones have been \nringing off the hook. Utah is a pretty conservative State, but I don't \ndoubt that other members from across the country are hearing the same \nthing. The constituents who support this amendment, and others like it \nin the States, understand something that the sophisticated proponents \nof same-sex marriage do not--our marriage laws permeate our entire \nculture and we need to be wary about letting the judiciary foist some \nuntested and, frankly, unwanted social experiment on an entire Nation.\n  Unless we allow an the American people to decide this issue \nthemselves through the amendment process, it is only a matter of time \nbefore some renegade judges take it upon themselves to decide it for \nthe American people.\n  Yet, some in this body apparently prefer to put their heads in the \nsand.\n  They know that this is an important issue. But they are tied in \nknots. A few weeks ago, Howard Dean, the Chairman of Democratic \nNational Committee was for traditional marriage before he was against \nit. One day the Democratic Party was for traditional marriage. The next \nday, efforts to protect traditional marriage were tantamount to \ndiscrimination.\n  The bottom line is that some liberal interest groups are attempting a \nredefinition of marriage, and they are out there all alone on this \nissue. Vast majorities of Americans support traditional marriage. But \nsome of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are so dependent \non these activist groups for support that they sometimes feel they \ncannot go against them. I think this is why we are having a cloture \nvote, rather than an up- or-down vote on this amendment. At the end of \nthe day, many of the same people who deny the necessity of this \namendment do not want to have a vote it on their record.\n  So, rather than take on the other side's arguments, they avoid the \nissues and challenge the motives of those who support this amendment. \nMy friends on the other side of the aisle claim that this amendment is \ndiscriminatory. My colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, is a \ngood man. But he is out of line to say as he has that a vote for this \namendment is a vote for bigotry pure and simple. Over half of his \ncolleagues will vote for cloture on this amendment. Does he really want \nto suggest that over half of the United States Senate is a crew of \nbigots?\n  This is Dr. Dean's subtle diagnosis. Democrats are committed to \nfighting this hateful, divisive amendment and to fighting similarly \ndiscriminatory ballot initiatives in states across the country. We \nstrongly oppose any attempt to write discrimination into law--whether \nit be at the local or state levels or in the United States \nConstitution.\n  Never--not once in any State--have the people's popularly elected \nrepresentatives decided to amend traditional marriage laws to include \nsame-sex couples. When given the chance, they affirm traditional \nmarriage. In Vermont, in California, and in Washington there is \nstatutory language preserving the traditional definition. Are the \nlegislators and citizens who supported these laws engaged in \ndiscrimination?\n  Let me give you another example.\n  When Nevada considered a State constitutional amendment to preserve \ntraditional marriage, a vast majority of the State's citizens supported \nthe measure. For Nevadans, preserving traditional marriage was not a \nwedge issue. Divisive issues do not gamer 70 percent of the vote, as it \ndid in 2000.\n  And so it was no surprise that the State's foremost public servant \nwholeheartedly supported this effort. Nevadans wanted to amend the \nState's constitution merely to affirm what has always been the law in \nNevada and in the other States--that marriage is between one man and \none woman.\n  That was then.\n  This is now.\n  Today, the Democratic Leader, who I count as a friend, has jumped on \nthis bandwagon and said that this amendment would write discrimination \ninto the Constitution.\n  So he supports unequivocally a State constitutional amendment to \nprotect traditional marriage, but he claims that it is discrimination \nat the national level.\n  Let me get this straight.\n  Since the colonies were first settled, traditional marriage has been \nthe norm in this country. It remains so today with the exception of \nMassachusetts. In recent years the American people have reasserted in \nState after State their strong desire to maintain traditional marriage \nlaws. So the beliefs of most Americans are discriminatory?\n  Was it discrimination when members supported their State \nconstitutional amendments to protect traditional marriage?\n  Was it discrimination when 85 members of this body, including 32 \nDemocrats, voted for DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act?\n  Was it discrimination when President Bill Clinton signed it?\n  Is it discrimination for our religious leaders to support traditional \nmarriage?\n  The Catholic Church opposes same-sex marriage. Does the Pope believe \nin discrimination?\n  Seventeen Catholic Bishops and all eight American Cardinals support \nthis amendment. Do they support discrimination? That is what some of my \ncolleagues are suggesting.\n  Is every parish priest who refuses to marry a same-sex couple engaged \nin discrimination?\n  My church supports traditional marriage. So do many other religions \nthat recognize the importance of marriage between a man and a woman.\n  I do not think that some of my colleagues opposing this amendment \nhave considered the full ramifications of a Federal court decision \ncommanding same-sex marriage on the States. What happens to the tax \nstatus of a church that our courts have determined to be engaged in \ndiscriminatory conduct that cuts against the public policy of the \nState? We have seen a preview with the experience of Catholic Charities \nin Massachusetts. For decades, this noble organization has provided \nadoption services for hard-to-place children. Yet the State recently \npresented this organization with the catch-22 of abandoning the \nchurch's traditional teaching on human sexuality or abandoning their \nreligious commitment to works of mercy. This is not a choice our \nchurches and religious citizens should face, but it is, I fear, a \nchoice that they will have to make unless we act.\n  Our history as a nation is dotted with instances of some outlier, \nactivist judges who ignored their institutional limitations in order to \nreplace their own public policy judgments for those of the American \npeople and their representatives. It is hardly a surprise that some \nelite judges might underestimate the political and social consequences \nof their efforts to alter the legal framework of marriage. After all, \nmost of the people that they know may be in favor of such changes.\n  Well, they are about to find out that there are people outside of \ntheir small universe of liberal opinion. If a few renegade judges \ndetermine that traditional marriage is unconstitutional, our previous \npolitical debates over improper judicial decisions will pale by \ncomparison.\n  The fact remains that some judges are eager to replace the opinions \nof the American people with their own. Since the cloture vote on the \nmarriage amendment in the 108th Congress, State trial courts in \nWashington, New\n\n[[Page S5458]]\n\nYork, California, and Maryland have struck down traditional marriage \nlaws. The marriage laws of Connecticut have been challenged. The laws \nin Iowa have been challenged. A lawsuit has been filed in Federal court \nin Oklahoma that challenges not only a State constitutional amendment \nto preserve traditional marriage, but also the Federal Defense of \nMarriage Act. The Supreme Court of New Jersey seems poised to overturn \nthe State's traditional marriage laws. A Federal court in Nebraska \nalready struck down the State's constitutional amendment to protect \ntraditional marriage. Just a few weeks ago, a judge in Georgia \ninvalidated an amendment passed by the State's voters in 2004.\n  Those who oppose traditional marriage are not playing by the rules. \nThey are not convincing their fellow citizens of the merits of their \ncause. They are not taking their arguments to the legislatures. Rather, \nthey are taking the easy way out. Just convince a few elite judges that \nthey are on the side of justice, and traditional marriage laws will go \nthe way of the dinosaurs.\n  According to this amendment's opponents, when well-funded liberal \nactivist groups ask judges to subvert the will of the people in every \nState, they are not playing politics. When they ask a bare majority of \njudges to overturn traditional marriage laws and declare them \ndiscriminatory, they are merely seeking justice. Yet when the people's \nelected representatives attempt to preserve traditional marriage in \nthis country, we are playing politics.\n  We must be respectful of homosexual citizens. They are our fellow \ncitizens. And they, no less than we, are endowed with the rights that \nThomas Jefferson elaborated in the Declaration of Independence. But we \nalso live in a democracy. And in democracies the people get to \ndetermine social policy, not judges. We should take this opportunity to \nrestore the authority of the people over public policy and their own \nconstitutions. We should remind these judges that the judiciary does \nnot have a method of reasoning superior to the people or their elected \nrepresentatives. Judges are good at deciding cases. They are good at \napplying law. But when it comes to moral reasoning, there is nothing in \ntheir legal training or in our laws that gives a few activist judges a \nright to make wholesale social change at the expense of the traditions \nof the American people.\n  I support this amendment. It is merely a congressional affirmation of \nwhat the vast majority of citizens in Utah and across the country \nalready believe--marriage should be between one man and one woman.\n  We have a long way to go, but as even this amendment's opponents \nknow, the fact that legislation will not pass is no reason to avoid a \ndebate. Only by debating can you build a consensus. The American people \nhave already arrived at a consensus on this issue. They want to see \ntraditional marriage remain the law of the land. I agree with that \nsentiment, and so I will be voting for cloture. I urge my colleagues to \ndo the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his hard \nwork on this issue. He is a dedicated Senator and an honorable one. We \nappreciate him taking the time to address the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I now ask that Senator Thune be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to join the debate and express \nmy strong support for the marriage protection amendment, of which I am \na cosponsor. Amending the Constitution of the United States, as many \nhave noted, is serious business and is something we should only \nundertake when we have a compelling rationale.\n  This amendment meets that high standard. Nothing is more fundamental, \nnothing is more important to the fabric of American society than the \nfamily. And that is what this debate is really all about.\n  Every Member of this body, every citizen of this Nation understands, \nor at least should understand, that the traditional family is the glue \nthat binds our communities, the building block on which our Nation is \nconstructed. It is something that I as a father of two daughters and a \nhusband of 20 years understand and appreciate.\n  Yet today, this pillar of our society is under attack by some who are \npursuing a narrow social agenda designed to destroy the definition of \nmarriage that has existed since the birth of civilization. They are \ntrying to convince us that what virtually all Americans have understood \nfor more than two centuries as self evident, is wrong.\n\n  People ask why do we need to do this now? Why is it necessary? As has \nbeen noted, despite widespread public disapproval, activist judges are \neroding the different State laws that define marriage as a sacred union \nbetween a man and a woman.\n  Currently nine States face lawsuits challenging their marriage laws. \nCalifornia, Maryland, New York, and Washington State trial courts have \nfollowed Massachusetts and found State marriage laws unconstitutional. \nThe State supreme courts in New Jersey, Washington State, and New York \ncould decide marriage cases this year.\n  The only sure way to prevent the courts from redefining marriage is \nto send to the States a Federal constitutional amendment that affirms \nmarriage and prevents activist judges from hijacking that definition.\n  There have been those who have come to the floor and said that this \nreally is not an issue the American people care about. Well, I beg to \ndiffer, if you look at what has happened in 19 States. Nineteen \ndifferent States in this country have adopted constitutional \namendments, by public vote, defining marriage as a union between a man \nand a woman.\n  That very initiative, that very vote will be on the ballot this fall \nin South Dakota. I predict that we will get a very comfortable margin \nin favor of that.\n  In fact, if you look at the average in all of these places around the \ncountry, all of the States that have debated this issue and voted on \nit, the average vote has been 70 percent. Seventy percent of the \nAmerican people have a different way of deciding what they care about \nand what is important and that is sometimes different than politicians \nhere in Washington.\n  Some have said there are more important issues we need to deal with. \nHowever, the fact of the matter is if you look at the agenda we have \nbeen talking about for the past several weeks right here in the U.S. \nSenate we have been dealing with those issues.\n  Yesterday several Democrat Senators expressed their frustration about \nthis debate taking place, a sentiment that has been repeated throughout \nthe course of the day by more of their Democratic colleagues. They say \nthere are more important issues that need to be debated during this \ntime instead of marriage. Putting aside the fact that protecting \ntraditional marriage and families is an important topic, they seem to \nforget what has been occurring on the Senate floor.\n  They say we need to focus on health care, an issue that is very \nimportant to me and my constituents in South Dakota. However, they \nforget that when this issue was brought to the floor just a few short \nweeks ago, they filibustered not one, not two, but three solutions to \nthe health care crisis that faces our country; namely two types of \nmedical liability reform and the Health Insurance Marketplace \nModernization and Affordability Act.\n  They say we need to tackle the high price of gasoline that has \naffected this entire country, something that again affects profoundly \nthe people I represent in South Dakota. However, they must forget the \nbattle that has been occurring since the early 1990s to open up the \nAlaska National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR, to oil exploration. It is \nsomething that has been debated consistently and repeatedly here and \nblocked from consideration. Once developed, ANWR could provide about \none million barrels of oil each day for the next 30 years, a good first \nstep toward solving this complicated problem. However, what we have run \ninto is continued filibusters on what is a very commonsense step toward \nreducing our energy dependence.\n  They are right, there are many important issues facing Americans \nthroughout this country. However, they are pointing their fingers at \nthe wrong people. If they are so serious about solving America's \nproblems, they should let the Senate vote on these issues, including \nthe Marriage Protection Amendment.\n\n[[Page S5459]]\n\n  One of the other issues which has been raised throughout the course \nof this debate is that we should not trivialize the Constitution with \nthis amendment, that somehow marriage does not meet the threshold or \nthe criteria of the liberal elites to warrant discussion as an \namendment to the Constitution.\n  Well, there again, if you look at just the last 20 years here in the \nU.S. Senate, there have been a whole range of constitutional amendments \nthat have been proposed by our colleagues on the other side. In fact, \nthere are over 100 constitutional amendments that have been proposed \nright here in the U.S. Senate by our colleagues on the other side.\n  I was listening earlier to the debate on the floor when the Senator \nfrom Illinois, the Democrat whip, and the Senator from Nevada, the \nDemocrat leader, were talking again about how we ought to be talking \nabout other issues. It is interesting to note if you look at some of \nthe constitutional amendments that have been introduced here in the \nU.S. Senate, both of those particular Members, as well as others of our \ncolleagues on the Democrat side, have cosponsored many of those \namendments.\n  They have cosponsored amendments dealing with physical desecration of \nthe flag, of which I am also a cosponsor, as well as an amendment \ndealing with the regulation of contributions and expenditures intended \nto affect elections. There was an amendment proposed by the Senator \nfrom Illinois that would abolish the electoral college and provide for \nthe direct popular election of the President and Vice President of the \nUnited States. There was a constitutional amendment offered by the \nSenator from Nevada that proposes repealing the 22nd amendment which \nestablishes Presidential term limitations.\n  There are always constitutional amendments offered here in the U.S. \nSenate, and there are always those on both sides of the aisle who have \nvarying levels of interest in those. But the reality is, that is what \nour Founders gave us. This is the mechanism they gave us whereby we can \ndeal with some of these issues when there are constitutional questions.\n\n  What has prompted this debate in the U.S. Senate is the fact that \nStates across this country, and in the Federal Government right here in \nWashington with the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, have all taken \naction on the issue of marriage. Yet, we have courts across the country \nthat are challenging the will of the people in each of those respective \ndecisions and going their own way. They are trying to redefine marriage \nin a way that is contrary to what I believe is the tradition of this \ncountry, not only the tradition of this country, but since the \nbeginning of time.\n  This is an important issue. It is an important debate. It is a debate \nthat I believe we need to have in this country.\n  The other thing that has been said by our colleagues on the other \nside is, Why debate something if you know it is not going to have the \nvotes for passage? Well, we may not get to 67 votes this time around \nand I was not here in 2004 when the Senator from Colorado brought this \namendment to the floor and it was voted on previously, but I am told it \ngot somewhere around 48 votes. I think we will get more votes for it \nthis time.\n  But the point is, why would we not debate meaningful issues here in \nthe U.S. Senate? That is what we are here for. If we just brought \nlegislation to the floor of the U.S. Senate that we knew we had the \nvotes to pass, we would not be debating very much.\n  We had a lot of amendments to the immigration bill that we debated in \nthe last couple of weeks that failed by large margins. Yet, I did not \nsee anybody here saying we should not debate them because we know we do \nnot have the votes here to pass it.\n  The Senator from Illinois was talking about this earlier today \nsaying: We should not be debating this because we know it is not going \nto pass. The last amendment he offered to the immigration bill, that \nwas debated in the last couple of weeks in the U.S. Senate, got just 34 \nvotes. Well, I think he has a right to debate that in the U.S. Senate, \njust like I think the people across this country who care passionately \nabout the defense of marriage have the right to do so as well.\n  The other thing that gets stated a lot in this debate is that we \nshould not in any way erode States rights, that somehow this amendment \nsteps on States rights. That is wrong. Think about it. This is what our \nFounders gave us. This is the mechanism whereby the people of this \ncountry can amend the Constitution.\n  It requires the active participation of people all across the \ncountry, through their elected Representatives here in the U.S. Senate \nwhere it takes a two-thirds vote and the House of Representatives where \nit takes a two-thirds vote. And then it goes to the States. Three-\nfourths of the States, 38 States, would have to ratify this in order \nfor it to become a part of our Constitution. That is about as much \npublic participation as you could possibly ask for.\n  Not to mention the fact, as I indicated earlier, that we have already \nhad votes all across the country. Nineteen States have put it on the \nballot. Nineteen States, by an average of 70 percent, have affirmed \ntraditional marriage as the union between a man and a woman.\n  It seems to me the States ultimately are going to decide this issue. \nIf in fact this body and the U.S. House get the two-thirds votes that \nare necessary to send it to the States, 50 State legislatures are going \nto be debating this. Thirty-eight of them are going to have to decide \nif it is the right thing to do before it ultimately becomes part of the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  Very simply, the reason for this debate is that people in this \ncountry want to know that we care enough about the institution of \nmarriage to step up and defend it against attacks from liberal activist \njudges, against courts that have decided that they want to redefine \nwhat we have known to be true about marriage for the past several \nhundred years. That is where this debate ought to be heard.\n  It ought to be heard by the people of the United States of America. \nIt has been in legislatures around the country. It is being heard here \nin the U.S. Senate today. The people's voice is what we do. We give \nvoice to the issues that the people in this country care about, and I \nhappen to believe that this is one of those issues.\n  That is fundamentally what this debate is about. It is not about \nwhether or not there are enough votes to pass it. It is not about \nwhether or not this warrants the threshold of what is worthy for a \ndebate on a constitutional amendment.\n  As I said earlier, our colleagues on the other side who are objecting \nto that have offered over 100 constitutional amendments over the past \n20 years in this institution. It seems to me that the definition of \nmarriage, that fundamental foundational building block of American \nsociety, is certainly worthy and warrants discussion and the time of \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  So I commend the Senator from Colorado for bringing this to the \nfloor. I look forward to voting in favor of it. I urge my colleagues to \ndo the same, because I believe that is what the American people would \nhave us do.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand I am recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority controls the time until 4 \no'clock.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe that the institution of marriage \ncan serve its public purposes only when it is understood as being a \nunion between one man and one woman. It is this understanding that \noffers public reinforcement to the vital and unique roles played by \nmothers and fathers in the raising of their children. It is this \nunderstanding that offers a foundation for principled objections to \nthose who would pursue the imprudent agenda of dismantling an \ninstitution that has served us well, and replacing it with newer and \nmore flexible understandings that are of questionable public value.\n  I also believe in the institution of republican government as \ndescribed in the U.S. Constitution. This, too, is an institution that \nhas served us well, founded upon the precept that the American people \nspeak through their elected representatives, and these representatives \nremain at all times answerable and accountable to the people whom they \nserve. Today, on the question of marriage, we are told by advocates on \nboth sides of the debate that\n\n[[Page S5460]]\n\nthese two institutions, as they are currently understood, cannot be \nreconciled, and that one or the other must be changed. I do not agree, \nand thus I do not at this time support the proposed Marriage Protection \nAmendment.\n  The proposed amendment would establish in our Constitution a \npermanent resolution of a debate that is currently and properly being \nresolved in different ways, in 50 different States, by the people's \nelected representatives. Our system of federalism is not easily \nseparable from our commitment to republican government, because it is \ndriven by the idea that we are best governed when those who represent \nus live where we live, and share the values that we share. It is this \nunderstanding that has allowed us the strength, as a Nation, to time \nand again preserve our unity and confront our challenges in times of \ncrisis, no matter how great our differences on issues that are the \nsubject of heated public debate. The continued vitality of America's \ncommitment to federalism and republican government offers a hopeful \nexample to strife-torn areas of our world where conflicts are \ntragically settled with bullets rather than ballots. The constitutional \nvalue of federalism is doubly important in the area of family law, \nbecause power to legislate in this area has traditionally been reserved \nto the states, and because issues of family structure affect the fabric \nof the broader community, creating the opportunity for approaches that \nreflect the values of the States that form our Nation.\n  Most Americans believe, as do I, that the institution of marriage \nshould be reserved for the union of a man and a woman. Wherever the \nquestion of same-sex marriage has been put to the test of public \napproval, it has been decisively rejected. Presently, 19 States protect \nin their constitutions traditional definitions of marriage. In 2004, \namendments to State constitutions preserving the institution of \nmarriage exclusively as the union of a man and woman were placed on the \nballot in 13 States. All 13 passed by substantial margins. Thus far, \nseven States have a constitutional amendment on the ballot this year. \nThere is little doubt they will all prevail. Proponents of an amendment \nto my State's constitution, which I support, are working hard to \ncollect the required number of signatures to secure a place on the \nNovember ballot. If we succeed, I am certain Arizonans will adopt it \noverwhelmingly.\n  There can be little doubt that a sizeable majority of the American \npeople, whatever their views on other questions involving the rights of \nhomosexuals in our society, strongly support reserving the institution \nof marriage for the union of one man and one woman. That majority \nincludes, I am confident, majorities in every State in the Union. It \nincludes Americans of both political parties, whose voting habits and \ngeneral political philosophy range from conservative to moderate to \nliberal.\n  It is obvious that there is a broad consensus in this country in \nsupport of the traditional definition of marriage. And when the \nAmerican people are so decided in a public debate, their elected \nrepresentatives will defend that consensus. Forty-five States have \neither constitutional protections or statutes on the books defining \nmarriage in traditional terms. In 1996, Congress passed and President \nClinton signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act, which allows each \nState to deny within its boundaries the status of marriage to the union \nof a same-sex couple that may have been recognized in another State. To \ndate, the Defense of Marriage Act has not been successfully challenged \nin Federal court.\n  The broad consensus in support of traditional marriage does not yet \nextend to support for the measure we are debating today, an amendment \nto the Federal Constitution defining marriage as the union between a \nman and a woman. I suspect that is because most Americans are not yet \nconvinced that their elected representatives or the judiciary are \nlikely to expand decisively the definition of marriage to include same-\nsex couples.\n  Obviously, the Massachusetts Supreme Court's ruling in 2003 \neffectively extended lawful marriage to same-sex couples even though it \nis apparent that a majority of Massachusetts residents do not support \nthat change in the interpretation of the State's marriage laws. But \nthere are political remedies to what, I believe, can be fairly \ncriticized as judicial activism that ignored the will of the people and \ndenied a State government its long established right to regulate \nmarriage. In Massachusetts, more than 120,000 voters signed a petition \nto place on the ballot an amendment to the Commonwealth's constitution \nrestoring the traditional definition of marriage. A constitutional \nconvention to consider amending the Massachusetts constitution is \nscheduled to convene on July 12.\n  The Nebraska decision is under review by the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Eighth Circuit, which has already heard oral arguments in the \ncase, and might issue a ruling as early as this summer. Most analysts, \non both sides of the debate, believe the lower court's decision will be \nreversed, and the exclusive protections for traditional marriage that \nthe people of Nebraska adopted in 2000 by a vote of 70 percent will be \nrestored to their constitution. Nebraska's attorney General has not \neven felt it necessary to ask for a stay of the district court's \ndecision pending the outcome of the appeal, which would almost \ncertainly have been granted. I assume this is because Nebraska still \nhas a defense of marriage law on the books, and there are no same-sex \nmarriage cases pending in Nebraska courts or same-sex marriage \nlegislation pending in the Nebraska Legislature.\n  I understand that the precipitous Massachusetts decision as well as \nthe unlawful granting of marriage licenses to same-sex couples in a few \nlocalities outside Massachusetts, challenges to traditional marriage \nlaws in other States, and the decision last year by the Federal \ndistrict court in Nebraska that struck down an amendment to Nebraska's \nconstitution restricting marriage to a man and a woman have added to \nthe support for a Federal marriage amendment. While that support does \nnot mirror the broad national consensus in support of traditional \nmarriage, it is substantial and passionate. I understand that and I \nrespect it, and I agree that marriage a uniquely important institution \nshould be protected. But I do not agree that all the above \ncircumstances have made it necessary to usurp from the States, by means \nof an amendment to Federal Constitution, their traditional role in \nregulating marriage. I'm reluctant to abandon the federalism that is \npart of the essence of conservative political thought in our country. \nAnd I am very wary of the unintended consequences that might follow \nfrom making an exception to our federalist principles for the sake of \naddressing a threat to the institution of marriage that may still, \nindeed, seems likely to be, defeated by means far less precedent \nsetting than amending our Nation's Constitution.\n  Of course, while I disagree that the current constitutional structure \nprovides insufficient mechanisms for ensuring that the public meaning \nof marriage is not tampered with by activist judges, it would be \ndisingenuous to argue that those who support the proposed amendment \nhave no grounds for their concern. In recent decades there have been \ntoo many occasions on which the Federal Courts, including the Supreme \nCourt, have forgotten their proper role, and abandoned the virtues of \nfederalism and republican government in favor of imposing their own \npolicy preferences in the guise constitutional interpretation. \nDecisions such as Roe v. Wade continue to distort the democratic \nprocess in ways large and small to this very day. It is a telling \ncommentary on those who seek to change the longstanding public meaning \nof marriage that in many instances they have chosen to pursue their \nagenda through the courts rather than taking their case to the people. \nThose who wish to engage the issue in good faith should reject out-of-\nhand attempts to read into the Constitution a right to same-sex \nmarriage, because the Constitution says absolutely nothing about it, \nand because the longstanding traditions of American society have \ndefined legal marriage as a union between one man and one woman. \nIndeed, yet another reason I am reluctant to support the proposed \namendment at this point in time is that I do not accept the proposition \nthat the current Constitution could ever reasonably be read to contain \na supposed ``right'' that it plainly does not contain.\n\n[[Page S5461]]\n\n  It is just not clear to me that threats to the institution of \nmarriage that have arisen in recent times have become a permanent \nbreach of State authorities' traditional role in regulating and \ndefining marriage as the people of their States and their elected \nrepresentatives see fit. My confidence that the public meaning of \nmarriage will be decided in the context of federalism and republican \ngovernment rather than by judicial fiat is strengthened by the recent \nconfirmations of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, and I hope \nthat future appointments to that State and Federal courts give us \njudges who share a similar understanding of the courts' proper role in \nour constitutional system.\n  However, if I am wrong, and the Nebraska decision were to be upheld \non appeal; or were other challenges to State marriage laws made and \nupheld; or if majority sentiment and legislative remedies in affected \nStates fail to overcome peremptory judicial intrusions into the \npolitical process of defining marriage; or if the Supreme Court were to \nreject the Defense of Marriage Act, then, and only then, would the \nproblem justify Congress making the momentous decision to amend the \nmost enduring and successful political compact in human history as the \nonly recourse means to restore the public's right to define, according \nto the values and concerns of our communities, a critically important \nfoundation of our society.\n\n  Let me pose a hypothetical situation to illustrate why we should be \nreluctant to impose a constitutional remedy to a problem that will \nprobably be resolved in an ordinary, State by State political process, \nconsistent with the respect for federalism we Republicans have long \nclaimed as one of our virtues. Those of us who consider ourselves pro-\nlife would welcome the Supreme Court's reversal of the Roe v. Wade \ndecision that found a constitutional right to an abortion. The result \nof that reversal would be to return the regulation of abortion to the \nStates, where the values of local communities would be influential. \nNow, further suppose that abortion rights advocates held majorities in \nboth houses of Congress, and rather than argue State by State for \nliberal abortion laws, they decided to usurp the States' authority by \nmeans of a constitutional amendment protecting abortion. Wouldn't we \nwho consider ourselves federalists loudly protest such a move? Wouldn't \nwe all line up on the floor to quote Mr. Madison from Federalist Paper \n45, that:\n\n       The powers reserved to the several states will extend to \n     all the objects, which, in the ordinary course of affairs, \n     concern the lives, liberties and properties of the people, \n     and the internal order, improvement and prosperity of the \n     State.\n\n  Yes, we would, Mr. President, yes, we would.\n  I believe that in the ``ordinary course of affairs,'' the American \npeople's clear preference to retain intact the institution of marriage, \ndefined according to the values of our communities as the union of one \nman and one woman, will prevail, and that attempts to ignore the \npeople's will, either by judicial fiat or by the occasional \nenterprising politician will, in due course, be overcome. I might be \nwrong, and I respect the concerns of Americans who believe current \ncircumstances urgently require the constitutional protection of \ntraditionally defined marriage. But I do not believe that recent \ndevelopments yet pose a threat to marriage that cannot be overcome by \nmeans short of a constitutional amendment.\n  While I will vote in opposition to this amendment, I believe its \nadvocates should be reassured that if in the future the public meaning \nof marriage is taken from the hands of the people and altered by judges \nwho claim falsely to speak before all others for the people's \nconstitutional ideals, then it will be the people, acting through their \nelected representatives in this Chamber, who will at that time have the \nfinal word. Until then, however, I will trust in the American people \nand the elected representatives closest to them to pass and enforce \nlaws upholding the institution of marriage in accord with the values of \ntheir communities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S.J. Res. 1, the \nMarriage Protection Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. I support this \namendment because traditional marriage is the bedrock institution of \nour society and its integrity must be maintained. The people and State \nlegislatures around the country have approved laws and constitutional \nprovisions to protect traditional marriage, but courts persist in \nreinterpreting their State constitutions to redefine the institution. I \nbelieve that, to prevent that kind of judicial activism from spreading, \nand to guarantee that people and the States can decide the issue, \nCongress should approve the marriage amendment and send it to the \nStates for ratification.\n  In my brief remarks, I will address two basic questions. First, is \nmarriage worth defending? And second, is a constitutional amendment \nnecessary, or can this question be handled through the states?\n  On the first question, the answer should be clear to all. Traditional \nmarriage--marriage between a man and a woman--is the fundamental \ninstitution of our society. That is primarily because marriage is the \nbest environment for the protection and nurturing of children. \nTraditional families are where we hope that children will be born and \nraised and where we expect them to receive their values. If we want our \nNation's children to do well, we need to do everything we can to ensure \nthat children grow up with mothers and fathers. And the place where \nthat happens best is where mothers and fathers properly unite, in \nmarriage. The state sanctions and encourages marriage not only because \nit wants to validate a lifelong personal relationship, but, more \nimportantly, because we need a stable institution for child-rearing. \nThat is why this issue is of such great importance.\n  We send a very important message to our children when we stand up for \nthe institution of marriage. We tell them that marriage matters--that \ntraditional family life is a thing to be honored, valued, and \nprotected. We tell them that marriage is the best environment for the \nraising of children. We tell them that every child deserves a mother \nand a father. We point them to the ideal. We simply cannot strip \nmarriage of its core--that it be the union of a man and a woman--and \nexpect the institution to survive in its present form. The law of \nunintended consequences certainly applies here, as in all things. We \ncannot strip the institution of its essence and expect no adverse \nconsequences.\n  That leads me to the second question: is a constitutional amendment \nnecessary, or can the future of marriage be handled at the state level? \nI have heard some of my colleagues argue that this issue is best left \nto the States. They argue that family law is traditionally a State \nissue, and that the States are best equipped to manage family law \nmatters. They say that Congress should do nothing, and just let each \njurisdiction sort this out on its own.\n  First, just as a matter of history, some like to say that the \ndefinition of marriage is only a State issue, but history shows that \nthe question is a bit more complicated. For example, when Congress \nadmitted Utah as a State in 1896, it expressly required Utah to ban \npolygamy. In other words, the Federal Government imposed the \ntraditional definition of marriage, because Members of Congress \nbelieved that the issue was of national importance. And in general, at \nleast since the Civil War, we have moved increasingly towards a system \nin which the core questions about how to order our society are answered \non a national level.\n  Second, we should focus on what ``federalism'' actually means. Many \nopponents of this constitutional amendment suggest that our federalist \nprinciples require us to sit on our hands and do nothing. Respectfully, \nI believe that the underlying principle that gives federalism its power \nis being misunderstood and misapplied. In fact, I think exactly the \nopposite is true: a genuine examination of the principles of federalism \nand States' rights should lead one to support this amendment.\n  The purpose of federalism is to empower the American people and to \nbolster democratic participation by ensuring that questions are decided \nat the local level, wherever possible.\n  We do not want the Federal Government deciding questions of purely \nlocal\n\n[[Page S5462]]\n\nimportance, so we have limits on Federal power. These limitations are \ndesigned not so much to protect State governments, but to ensure that \ndemocracy works more efficiently and that policy is set by the American \npeople through the officials that they know better and who are \nphysically closer to them. Thus, federalism is not a dry question of \nallocating power among governments and politicians. It is about finding \nthe best way to enhance the power of the people themselves.\n  A vote against this amendment does nothing to enhance the power of \nthe American people. The only thing it does is enhance the power of the \ncourts. To hear this talk of ``States' rights'' and ``federalism,'' you \nmight think that the American people are clamoring for same-sex \nmarriage. In fact, just the opposite is true. Opinion polls \nconsistently show nearly 60 percent opposition to same-sex marriage. \nMoreover, when citizens are given the opportunity to vote on State \nconstitutional amendments, they support those amendments by an average \nof 70 percent.\n  No, as we all know, the danger here is not State legislatures, but \njudicial activism from the courts. The American people are not deciding \nthis question; the courts are. The alternative to a Federal \nconstitutional amendment is not one in which the people are left to \noperate their States as laboratories, as Justice Brandeis once \nsuggested, but one in which the people are robbed of any ability to \ncontrol this issue.\n  So let us deal with the facts on the ground, so to speak. This is not \nbeing ``handled'' by the States today. It is being handled by the \ncourts. Even in the ``reddest of the red'' States such as Nebraska and \nOklahoma, each of which adopted State constitutional amendments to \nprotect traditional marriage, the activists have sued Federal court and \nsaid those State amendments are unconstitutional under Federal law. The \ncitizens of these States are not being permitted to decide this \nquestion. ``States rights'' implies not courts, but the people, making \nthese decisions.\n  Let's look at what is happening in the courts, with special attention \nto what has happened since we last debated this amendment.\n  First, since July 2004, State trial courts in Washington, New York, \nCalifornia, and Maryland all have struck down traditional marriage \nlaws. Those cases are now on appeal. So, compare today versus 2 years \nago. In July 2004, we were looking only at Massachusetts. Today, State \ncourts in four other States have followed Massachusetts' lead.\n\n  Second, even more State court lawsuits have been filed. In \nConnecticut and Iowa, same-sex marriage advocates argue that each \nState's traditional marriage law is unconstitutional, and that the \ncourts must redefine the institution to include same-sex couples.\n  Third, there has been increased action in Federal courts. In \nparticular, a Federal district court in Nebraska struck down the \nState's constitutional amendment protecting traditional  marriage. The \ncase is on appeal to the  Eighth Circuit, and a decision is likely \nsometime this summer. Regardless of how the case comes out, it shows \nthe aggressiveness of the advocates for same-sex marriage. In Nebraska, \n70 percent of voters adopted a constitutional amendment stating clearly \nthat they wanted marriage to be preserved in its present, traditional \nform. Yet the ACLU still sued.\n  There has been other Federal court action as well. For example, \nactivists filed a lawsuit in Federal court in Oklahoma challenging the \nState constitutional amendment enacted by voters, as well as Federal \nDOMA itself. DOMA also came under fire in California, where a Ninth \nCircuit panel dismissed a constitutional challenge on technical, \nstanding grounds. Some good news came in Florida, where a Federal \ndistrict court upheld DOMA's traditional definition of marriage for \npurposes of Federal law.\n  So, in summary, there are currently 9 States facing lawsuits \nchallenging their marriage laws--California, Connecticut, Iowa, \nMaryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, and Washington. I \nshould add that State supreme courts are expected to rule in New Jersey \nand Washington sometime this year.\n  I mention all these cases because they show the folly of relying on \n``federalism'' or ``States' rights'' to resolve this national debate. \nThe people are not deciding these lawsuits; judges are. If we do \nnothing--if we stand aside and let the States work it out, as some of \nmy friends argue, then the American people will see the institution of \nmarriage redefined against their will. It is happening now, and it is \ngoing to continue happening for as long as this body punts on this \nissue.\n  If we want to stand up for federalism--not to mention traditional \nmarriage--then let's look at how a constitutional amendment works. The \nconstitutional amendment process outlined in Article V of the \nConstitution is the most democratic, the most grass roots, and the most \nrespectful process available for the establishment of national policy. \nA constitutional amendment requires the support of \\2/3\\ of both houses \nof Congress. Then it requires the support of the legislatures of \\3/4\\ \nof the States in the Union. Then, and only then, can the amendment \nbecome effective. This is a very high hurdle, but it guarantees that \nthe American people have a full and complete opportunity to speak to \nthe issue, that they can express their views to their Senators, their \nCongressmen, and their State legislators. It takes time. But in the \nend, if a constitutional amendment passes, we know that the American \npeople want it.\n\n  In other words, Mr. President, the constitutional amendment process \nenhances federalism and States' rights. It ensures that there is a \nnational consensus on this question, and it pushes the decisionmaking \ndown to the most representative political leaders in our system, rather \nthan allowing a few judges to amend the Constitution by overturning two \ncenturies of our common understanding.\n  I have much more to say, especially regarding the meaning of this \namendment and the political situation in the States, but time is short, \nso I will ask unanimous consent at the conclusion of my remarks to have \nprinted excerpts from a policy paper that I issued as Chairman of the \nSenate Republican Policy Committee, ``Why a Marriage Amendment is Still \nNecessary,'' which was published back on March 28.\n  To cite ``federalism'' or ``States' rights'' is to avoid the issue as \nit is actually playing out. Instead, we must decide whether this \nquestion belongs in the courts, where it is now, or whether it belongs \nin the legislatures and before the people. I submit that we should not \nstand in the way of the American people's right to speak on this \nquestion. I have faith that this constitutional amendment process will \nwork--that the difficult social and cultural questions posed by same-\nsex marriage can be resolved satisfactorily through the democratic \nprocess of passing this constitutional amendment.\n  But I am even more sure that, if we fail to send this amendment to \nthe people, and if the courts continue on their current path, our \nNation will face decades of division that will make current \nfrustrations with judicial activism seem quaint in comparison. If we \nrefuse to act, the big loser will be not only traditional marriage, but \nthe people's respect for the judicial system and for the rule of law \nitself. Such a breakdown would be disastrous, but it is avoidable. It \nis avoidable if Congress votes ``yes'' and sends this amendment to the \nStates for ratification.\n  Mr. President, again, it should go without saying that traditional \nmarriage as we understand it between men and women is a fundamental \ninstitution of our society and that we should do everything we can to \nensure its preservation. The reason that is so is primarily because \nmarriage is the best environment for the protection and the nurturing \nof children. We send a very important message to our children when we \nstand up for this institution. We tell them that marriage matters, that \ntraditional family life is a thing to be honored and valued and \nprotected. We tell them that marriage is the best environment for \nraising of children, that every child deserves a mother and a father. \nWe point them to this ideal. We simply cannot strip marriage of its \ncore, that it be the union of a man and a woman, and expect the \ninstitution to survive in its current form. The law of unintended \nconsequences certainly applies here as in all things. We can't strip \nthe institution of its essence and expect no adverse consequences.\n\n[[Page S5463]]\n\n  That brings us to the second core question: Is a Federal \nconstitutional amendment necessary to preserve this institution? I have \ncome to the conclusion that it is. The question is whether this matter \ncan be and is properly being handled at the State level, as some of our \ncolleagues have contended. It is being handled at the State level to be \nsure, but the question is whether it is being handled by the people or \nby their elected representatives or whether in effect the Constitution \nis being rewritten by the courts, whether a couple of centuries of \ntradition about a common understanding of what traditional marriage \nmeant is being eroded by court decisions rather than the will of the \npeople.\n  Opinion polls consistently show nearly 60 percent opposition to same-\nsex marriage, and when citizens are given the opportunity to vote on \nState constitutional amendments, they approve them by an average of \nabout 70 percent. So the danger here is not State legislatures but \njudicial activism from the courts. The American people are not deciding \nthis question; the courts are. That is why the notion that we need to \npreserve federalism or States rights is, in my view, misplaced.\n  The alternative to a Federal constitutional amendment is not one in \nwhich the people are left to operate their States as laboratories, as \nJustice Brandeis once suggested, but one in which the people are robbed \nof any ability to control the issue because it is being resolved in the \ncourts. Even in the reddest of the red States, such as Nebraska and \nOklahoma, each of which adopted State constitutional amendments to \nprotect traditional marriage, the activists have sued in Federal court \nand said that those amendments are unconstitutional under Federal law. \nSo the citizens of these States are not being permitted to decide the \nquestion. States rights implies not the courts but the people making \nthe decisions. That will not be what happens if these constitutional \nprovisions are thrown out by the courts.\n  Look at what happened in just the last couple of years here, since we \nlast debated the amendment. In 2004, State trial courts in Washington, \nNew York, California, and Maryland all struck down traditional marriage \nlaws. Those cases are now on appeal. So compare today versus 2 years \nago. In July 2004, we were looking only at Massachusetts. Today, State \ncourts in four other States have followed Massachusetts' lead. So the \nconcern about the courts intruding into this area is not a hypothetical \nfuture concern but a reality today.\n  Even more State court lawsuits have been filed--for example, in \nConnecticut and Iowa. In addition to that, there is increased action in \nFederal courts. In particular, the Federal district court in Nebraska \nstruck down a State's constitutional amendment protecting traditional \nmarriage, as I mentioned a moment ago. That case is on appeal to the \nEighth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, would I be out of order if I asked for \nunanimous consent for 1 more minute to conclude my remarks?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. In summary, to summarize these cases, there are currently \nnine States facing lawsuits challenging their marriage laws--\nCalifornia, Connecticut, Iowa, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, New \nYork, Oklahoma, and Washington--and the State supreme courts are \nexpected to rule in New Jersey and Washington sometime this year.\n  So the bottom line is this: The people are not deciding the \nConstitution, the judges are. If we do not do anything, if we stand \naside and let the States work it out, as some of my friends have \nsuggested, then the American people are likely to see the institution \nof marriage redefined against their will, and it will be much more \ndifficult to adopt a constitutional amendment after these rulings are \nin place than it is to do so before they are in place.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed at the \nconclusion of my remarks excerpts from a policy paper that was issued \nby the Senate Republican Policy Committee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The following are excerpts from a policy paper titled ``Why \n     a Marriage Amendment is Necessary,'' released by the Senate \n     Republican Policy Committee on March 28, 2006. Footnotes and \n     citations are omitted.\n\n                      Summary of Pending Lawsuits\n\n       As predicted at the time, the Massachusetts decision in \n     Goodridge proved the catalyst for a flood of new lawsuits. As \n     of March 2006, nine states face active lawsuits challenging \n     their traditional marriage laws: California, Connecticut, \n     Iowa, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, and \n     Washington. Those cases are summarized below:\n\n\n       status of pending lawsuits challenging state marriage laws\n\n       California: Direct challenge to state marriage laws. \n     Plaintiffs seek redefinition of marriage to allow same-sex \n     marriage. Filed in 2004. Plaintiffs won in trial court in \n     April 2005. Appeal is now pending in state court of appeals \n     in San Francisco. A complete timeline is unclear, but no \n     final decision from state supreme court is expected until \n     2007 at the earliest.\n       Connecticut: Direct challenge to state marriage laws. \n     Plaintiffs seek redefinition of marriage to allow same-sex \n     marriage. Filed in 2004. Case is pending in state trial court \n     in New Haven. A complete timeline is unclear, but no final \n     decision from state supreme court is expected until 2007 at \n     the earliest.\n       Iowa: Direct challenge to state marriage laws. Plaintiffs \n     seek redefinition of marriage to allow same-sex marriage. \n     Filed in 2005. Case is pending in state trial court.

Filed in 2004.

State courts in \n     Hawaii, Alaska, and Oregon had previously done the same, but \n     state constitutional amendments subsequently reversed those \n     decisions.\n\n                    The Increase in Legal Challenges\n\n       These current lawsuits are part of a growing trend. Until \n     recently, very few states had seen attacks on their marriage \n     laws. As of 1992, lawsuits had been filed in Minnesota \n     (1970), Kentucky (1973), Washington (1974), Colorado (1980), \n     and Hawaii (1990). As the Hawaii case gained traction, \n     activists filed new lawsuits in Alaska (1995), Vermont \n     (1997), Massachusetts (2001), New Jersey (2002), Indiana \n     (2002), Arizona (2003), and Nebraska (2003). Since the \n     Massachusetts high court struck down traditional marriage \n     laws in 2003, cases were filed in Alabama, California, \n     Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, \n     Oklahoma, and West Virginia in 2004, and in Iowa in 2005. In \n     many of these states, such as Florida, California, and New \n     York, more than one lawsuit was filed. The number of states \n     that have faced challenges to their marriage laws has more \n     than quadrupled since the early 1990s.\n\nThe Common Thread in the Lawsuits Challenging Traditional Marriage Laws\n\n       These lawsuits are brought under a variety of state \n     constitutions or, in the federal cases, they are based on the \n     U.S. Constitution, but the cases' substance are very similar.\n       First, nearly all the lawsuits are brought by the same \n     cadre of legal activists at the\n\n[[Page S5464]]\n\n     American Civil Liberties Union, the Gay & Lesbian Advocates & \n     Defenders, Lambda Legal Defense & Education Fund, and the \n     Freedom to Marry coalition. This is a coordinated and well-\n     funded national campaign.\n       Second, on substance, these advocates regularly argue that \n     civil marriage is a fundamental right; that denying civil \n     marriage to same-sex couples violates their right to equal \n     treatment based on sex and sexual orientation; and that the \n     state can offer no legitimate justification for not \n     redefining marriage to include same-sex couples.\n       Third, the advocates frequently rely on the U.S. Supreme \n     Court's decisions in Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003) \n     (holding that sodomy bans are unconstitutional) and Romer v. \n     Evans 517 U.S. 620 (1996) (holding unconstitutional a \n     Colorado state constitutional amendment barring enactment of \n     laws aimed at benefiting homosexuals), as general support for \n     the transformation of equal protection and due process \n     jurisprudence to require same-sex marriage. Even those \n     challenges that purportedly rely on state law also look to \n     federal cases for support.\n       Finally, the advocates often rely on the Massachusetts \n     decision in Goodridge as persuasive authority, along with the \n     similar trial court opinions in Washington and New York. \n     Thus, in our integrated legal system, court cases in one \n     state affect litigation elsewhere; one cannot argue that what \n     happens in Massachusetts has no extraterritorial impact.\n\n          Citizens Are Fighting To Protect State Marriage Laws\n\n       When the advocates began this effort in Hawaii in the early \n     1990s, only a few states had expressly defined marriage as \n     between a man and a woman (although state common law \n     typically assumed it). Moreover, no states had amended their \n     constitutions to protect against state court judicial \n     activism. After the Hawaii court attempted to redefine \n     marriage, however, citizens became politically engaged to \n     ensure that their states' laws were clear. After Americans \n     saw just how far judges would go--striking down the basic \n     definition of marriage, and calling for its \n     ``eradicate[ion]''--they stepped up their activity and began \n     to enact constitutional amendments that would shield the \n     marriage definition from the judges.\n       The only states without statutory protections for \n     traditional marriage are Massachusetts, New Jersey, New \n     Mexico, New York, and Rhode Island. Moreover, voters in at \n     least seven states will consider state constitutional \n     amendments in 2006, including Alabama, Idaho, South Carolina, \n     South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Other \n     states with more cumbersome constitutional amendment \n     processes, such as Indiana, are following their state-\n     specific processes to ensure that their state constitutions \n     are amended as soon as possible.\n       Not only have nearly all states enacted some form of \n     protection for traditional marriage, but they have done so \n     with supermajority support. In the 19 states that have \n     considered state constitutional amendments, all have passed, \n     and with an average support of 71.5 percent. It is worth \n     noting that the support for constitutional protections for \n     marriage laws was strong regardless of whether the elections \n     occurred in conjunction with higher-turnout elections such as \n     November 2004 or state primary or special elections (in \n     Louisiana, Missouri, and Kansas).\n\n    Federal DOMA Is Inadequate To Protect Traditional Marriage Laws\n\n       Perhaps the most common misunderstanding about the same-sex \n     marriage debate is the notion that the federal Defense of \n     Marriage Act, Pub. L. 104-199, 100 Stat. 2419 (September 21, \n     1996) (``federal DOMA'' or ``DOMA'') is a sufficient \n     guarantor of traditional marriage laws. It is not, nor was it \n     designed as a comprehensive solution to judicial activism on \n     the same-sex marriage question.\n\n\n                     what doma does and does not do\n\n       DOMA was a limited law passed to address two distinct \n     issues--forced interstate recognition and the definition of \n     marriage for the purposes of federal laws and regulations.\n       Interstate recognition: DOMA's primary purpose was to \n     bolster state courts' preexisting power to refuse recognition \n     to out-of-state marriages that do not comply with the state's \n     laws and public policy. DOMA did this by making clear that \n     the Constitution's Full Faith & Credit clause should not be \n     read to require interstate recognition of same-sex marriages. \n     See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1738C. However, it is crucial to \n     understand that, as a matter of tradition and comity, states \n     regularly recognize marriages that were solemnized in other \n     states. It is also well established that a state court \n     may refuse to recognize an out-of-state marriage if doing \n     so would contravene local ``public policy.'' At least in \n     the 45 states with laws defining marriage as man-woman, \n     the public policy preferences should be clear, and state \n     courts, therefore, should be constrained to refuse \n     recognition of out-of-state same-sex marriages.\n       DOMA's effect on interstate recognition is, therefore, \n     quite limited. It just addresses the situation in which a \n     state court refuses to abide by its state public policy and \n     relies on the Full Faith & Credit clause in recognizing an \n     out-of-state, same-sex marriage. However, DOMA will not have \n     any effect on a case in which an out-of-state, same-sex \n     marriage is recognized because the judge believes that the \n     equal protection or due process clauses require it. DOMA does \n     not ``prevent'' any court from recognizing out-of-state \n     marriages; it merely removes one of several rationales that a \n     court could use in doing so.\n       Definition of marriage for purposes of federal law: DOMA \n     had a second purpose: to define marriage for purposes of \n     federal law. Section 2 of DOMA states that, for the purposes \n     of federal statutes or any ruling, regulation, or \n     interpretation of federal administrative action, ``the word \n     `marriage' means only a legal union between one man and one \n     woman as husband and wife, and the word `spouse' refers only \n     to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or wife.'' \n     See 1 U.S.C. 7. A well-known effect of this language is to \n     ensure that only persons in traditional marriage can file \n     income tax returns as married couples, but the reach is much \n     broader. The General Accounting Office has found that, ``as \n     of December 31, 2003, our research identified a total of \n     1,138 federal statutory provisions classified to the United \n     States Code in which marital status is a factor in \n     determining or receiving benefits, rights, and privileges.''\n\n\n                 the constitutional challenges to DOMA\n\n       Both provisions of federal DOMA have been challenged in \n     federal court. For example, activists have challenged the \n     interstate recognition provision in a case pending before the \n     U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, although the \n     district court held the plaintiff lacked standing to \n     challenge that provision. The section defining marriage for \n     federal purposes is being challenged in that same Ninth \n     Circuit case, as well as in federal cases pending in Oklahoma \n     and Washington state. In each case, the plaintiffs argue that \n     the U.S. Constitution's equal protection and due process \n     guarantees require the recognition of same-sex marriages, and \n     that efforts to limit the interstate reach of same-sex \n     marriage or to limit marriage to heterosexual unions for \n     purposes of federal law are unconstitutional. To date, the \n     federal government has been successful in defending DOMA, for \n     example, by prevailing in federal district court in Florida. \n     Nevertheless, same-sex marriage advocates have made clear \n     that they believe DOMA is unconstitutional and that they will \n     continue to press their position in federal courts.\n       These lawsuits involving federal DOMA do not form the \n     ``core'' of the campaign in the courts. Instead, same-sex \n     marriage advocates are focusing on direct attacks on state \n     marriage laws, both through state court challenges to \n     statutory DOMAs, and through federal court challenges to \n     state constitutional amendments. The key to the expansion of \n     same-sex marriage in the courts is not striking down federal \n     DOMA, but convincing courts at all levels that same-sex \n     marriage is a fundamental right that cannot be denied.\n\n                 What Happens if Congress Does Nothing?\n\n       Failing to act to protect traditional marriage laws by a \n     constitutional amendment will, in the end, likely result in \n     the judicial imposition of same-sex marriage on a nationwide \n     basis. First, some state supreme courts undoubtedly will \n     strike down state marriage laws. Second, cultural and legal \n     confusion will develop over a period of years as the nation \n     struggles unsuccessfully to deal with a patchwork, state-by-\n     state approach. Third, federal courts will be forced to \n     address fundamental questions of due process and equal \n     protection that will emerge. And, as a result of certain \n     liberal-leaning precedents, the final step could be a U.S. \n     Supreme Court ruling that marriage laws be rewritten to \n     require same-sex marriage in all states.\n\n\n     Step No. 1: State-by-State Fragmentation via Judicial Activism\n\n       At present, legal activists are not asking the courts to \n     impose same-sex marriage on a nationwide basis. Instead, they \n     are targeting their efforts on particular states. As noted \n     above, nine states face challenges to their marriage laws, \n     and as one same-sex marriage advocate wrote earlier this \n     month, it is highly likely that one or more of these state \n     supreme courts will overturn traditional marriage laws. Evan \n     Wolfson, one of the premier gay marriage advocates in the \n     nation, recently told The American Prospect that the \n     movement's strategy over the next several years is to have 10 \n     states legalize same-sex marriage.\n       Thus, the near-term tactical goal of these activists is not \n     national cohesion, but national fragmentation of marriage \n     definitions. Same-sex marriage will be legal in some states, \n     but illegal in neighboring states. The results will not \n     necessarily be regional, either. For example, Washington and \n     California courts may impose same-sex marriage on their \n     states, but Oregon's citizens have already protected \n     themselves for now by state constitutional amendment. A \n     Maryland court has already struck down the states' laws, \n     while Virginia will soon adopt a state constitutional \n     amendment. Moreover, lawsuits are pending in Iowa, Nebraska, \n     and Oklahoma, and more could spring up in the American \n     heartland. Same-sex marriage, already a reality in \n     Massachusetts, will crop up throughout the nation.\n\n\n Step No. 2: Legal and Cultural Confusion Develops Due to Fragmentation\n\n       The state-by-state fragmentation of the nation serves the \n     goals of same-sex marriage advocates because the result will \n     be confusion and chaos that cannot long endure.\n       First, marriage is a fundamental aspect of American \n     culture. The nation has a variety\n\n[[Page S5465]]\n\n     of regional and state-by-state cultural variations, but it \n     also has core values and standards that apply on a national \n     level. Marriage's core components--two people, husband and \n     wife--should be common throughout the nation. This need for \n     cohesion on the nature of marriage was imperative 100 years \n     ago, when Congress required Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, \n     and Utah to include in their state constitutions express \n     provisions banning polygamy ``forever'' before they could be \n     admitted to the Union. It is even more so today, when the \n     American experience is much more national than regional. As \n     Evan Wolfson has written, ``America is one country, not fifty \n     separate kingdoms. If you're married, you're married.'' \n     Wolfson is correct, and he and his allies are counting on \n     same-sex marriage in a few states (especially large and \n     culturally influential states such as California, New York, \n     and Massachusetts) to pave the way for the spread of the \n     institution throughout the nation. Resistance to this growth \n     will be strong, as the state-level DOMA activity shows. The \n     inevitable result will be increased social and cultural \n     division.\n       Second, the resulting cultural division will inevitably end \n     up playing out in the courts, as same-sex marriage puts new \n     stresses on the legal system. Homosexual couples who have \n     marriage licenses have every right to move anywhere they want \n     in the nation; it is a fundamental right protected under the \n     Constitution. Many of these lawsuits will have unique fact \n     patterns that cannot be anticipated, because same-sex couples \n     will have many of the same day-to-day interactions with the \n     world as heterosexual couples do. Some will get divorced when \n     their marriage fails. They will execute and enforce wills \n     when one dies. They will open businesses, engage in the \n     economy as a household, and face occasional legal conflicts. \n     Child custody battles will occur, as will cases involving \n     run-of-the-mill torts and contract disputes. But as courts \n     struggle to fit their legal relationships into existing state \n     legal systems, the cases will take on a constitutional \n     dimension.\n       Consider an example of a complicated case involving \n     recognition of same-sex marriage that is already before the \n     courts. Two Washington state women received a marriage \n     license in Canada and later declared bankruptcy back in \n     Washington. They filed their petition jointly, citing their \n     Canadian marriage license. Because bankruptcy law is federal, \n     and because DOMA directly addresses the definition of \n     ``spouse,'' the bankruptcy court was required to rule on the \n     constitutionality of DOMA as applied to this bankruptcy \n     petition. In 2004, the bankruptcy court upheld DOMA's federal \n     definition, and an appeal was taken to the federal district \n     court, where it is pending today. The federal district court \n     has stayed consideration of the case until the Washington \n     Supreme Court rules on whether same-sex marriage should be \n     mandated in that state, which, the petitioner argues, could \n     impact how the bankruptcy petition should be treated.\n       This bankruptcy case is one example of the many ways in \n     which same-sex ``married'' couples living in non-same-sex-\n     marriage states can end up in the legal system. Although 45 \n     states have an expressed policy of opposition to same-sex \n     marriage, and the courts in those states should uphold that \n     policy, new fact patterns will constantly arise. Matters \n     involving everything from divorce to child custody to health \n     care to probate will be more complicated and require case-by-\n     case analyses in the courts. Inevitably, courts will reach \n     different conclusions on how to integrate same-sex couples \n     with marriage licenses into the legal and governmental \n     structures of non-same-sex-marriage states. The rules will \n     vary dramatically across state lines, and reasonable \n     questions of fundamental fairness will be raised by those \n     couples.\n\n\n    Step No. 3: Courts Must Step in and Set National Marriage Policy\n\n       Such a fragmented legal system cannot survive indefinitely. \n     Yet the solution to that confusion and chaos is not likely to \n     be the state or federal legislatures, but the courts that are \n     confronting these problems on a routine basis. Federal courts \n     will become increasingly involved (as they already are), and \n     splits in the federal courts will develop. The legal \n     advocates will renew their challenges to DOMA's federal \n     definition of marriage, and they will press courts to \n     recognize out-of-state marriages--first for limited purposes, \n     and then on a wholesale basis. (As discussed above, DOMA's \n     interstate recognition provisions will not bar any court from \n     forcing recognition of those marriages if that decision is \n     based on other parts of the Constitution.)\n       As federal constitutional cases develop, it is likely that \n     different circuit courts of appeals will resolve some of the \n     core constitutional questions differently. Eventually, then, \n     a question regarding the federal definition of marriage and/\n     or interstate recognition will go to the Supreme Court. Which \n     way will the Supreme Court rule? Nothing in the Constitution \n     prohibits same-sex marriage, and, in our current \n     constitutional system, the various applications of marriage \n     law are typically left to the states. Consequently, it would \n     be exceedingly unlikely for the Supreme Court actually to \n     invalidate same-sex marriages. On the other hand, it will \n     have a duty to assist the lower courts in the management of \n     the plethora of thorny legal problems that same-sex marriage \n     will have created in a patchwork system. The Court will be \n     under enormous pressure to craft a national solution. The \n     problem for traditional marriage supporters is that the \n     Supreme Court has expanded (or distorted, in some views) the \n     Constitution's equal protection and due process clause enough \n     that a majority would have precedents to stretch and \n     manipulate if it were so inclined. Justice Scalia, in \n     particular, has warned that the Supreme Court's decisions in \n     Lawrence v. Texas and Romer v. Evans now give same-sex \n     marriage advocates non-trivial arguments in favor of judicial \n     imposition.\n       In summary, a patchwork of definitions is not likely to \n     endure; to think that it will is little more than wishful \n     thinking. If Congress leaves this question to the state \n     courts, then the ultimate arbiter will be the Supreme Court. \n     And over time, given the existing precedents and the threat \n     that some Supreme Court Justices would twist the case law for \n     social engineering purposes, it is unrealistic to rely on the \n     high court to be a bulwark in defense of traditional marriage \n     laws.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's no surprise that the American people \nare frustrated with the Republican Senate these days. They deserve and \nwant action on the enormous challenges we face as a Nation--the endless \nand costly war in Iraq, the many dangers to our national security, \nskyrocketing gas prices, soaring health care costs, the upcoming \nhurricane season. How we can have safer schools and better care for our \nchildren, and so many other urgent issues. But instead of dealing with \nthese real priorities, the Senate Republican leadership is asking us to \nspend time writing bigotry into the Constitution.\n  Why aren't we taking up the defense authorization bill, which is so \nvital to our national security? It provides the authorization for the \nsalaries for our troops in the field, including a 2.2 percent pay \nraise. It provides urgently needed equipment for our troops to carry \nout their missions in Humvees with safer body armor. It authorizes the \nfood and supplies our troops need in Iraq and Afghanistan. It contains \nfunds to care for those who are injured or wounded, or who may be \nsuffering from posttraumatic stress disorder when they come home. But \nthe Republican leadership of the Senate has told us that supporting our \ntroops has to wait.\n  Let's be clear about what this debate is really about. It is a \nblatant effort to deny some members of our society the right to receive \nthe same benefits and protections that married couples now have. Like \nthis Senate's intrusion into the Terry Schiavo case, it is a cynical \nattempt to score political points by overriding state courts and \nintruding into individuals' private lives and most personal decisions. \nIt's the politics of prejudice and division at its worst.\n  Make no mistake--a vote in support of this amendment has nothing to \ndo with the ``protection of marriage.'' A vote for it is a vote against \ncivil unions, against domestic partnerships, and against all other \nefforts by States to treat gays and lesbians fairly under the law. It's \na vote to impose discrimination on all 50 States, and to deny them \ntheir right to write and interpret their own State constitutions and \nState laws. It's a vote to deny States the right to define what \nmarriage equality means.\n  Marriage is a solemn commitment to plan a future together, to share \nin life's celebrations, to be there as a source of comfort to ease \nlife's burdens and pains. This impacts real families with real-life \nstruggles. When the citizens of a State have decided to recognize those \nfamilies--through their State constitution or State laws--the Senate \nhas no business undermining their personal, private decisions.\n  Some even claim that our recent action in Massachusetts is a threat \nto the rest of the Nation. Over 8,000 couples have celebrated their \ncommitment to each other since our Supreme Judicial Court ruled that \nthe State constitution requires marriage equality.\n  In ruling to allow same-sex marriage, our State's Supreme Judicial \nCourt was interpreting the Massachusetts constitution, not the U.S. \nConstitution. The court ruled that our State's constitution forbids the \ncreation of second-class citizens. It concluded that the State could \nnot deny the protections, benefits and obligations of civil marriage to \ntwo individuals--regardless of gender--who wish to marry.\n  Far from being a right created--as our opponents like to say--by \nactivist judges, the right of all our citizens to\n\n[[Page S5466]]\n\nhave equal treatment under Massachusetts State laws was granted and \napproved by the people of Massachusetts when they voted on and adopted \nour State constitution. The people said that our State's constitution \nforbids the creation of second-class citizens, and our courts affirmed \nequality for all.\n  In Massachusetts, civil marriage brings all the benefits of a \nmarriage license--and equal status under the marriage laws, which touch \nupon nearly every aspect of life and death. In addition to all the \nintangible benefits of marriage, a civil marriage is a contract--it \ngrants valuable property rights--protection against creditors and the \nautomatic entitlement to the property of their spouse's estate when he \nor she dies.\n  Under State laws in Massachusetts and many other States, marriage \nconfers property rights. And the specific property rights vary from \nState to State. Some States have a community property regime. Others, \nlike Massachusetts, do not.\n  But it has always been a bedrock principle of our form of government \nthat the kind of State property rights flowing from a civil marriage \ncontract is a matter of State law, not Federal law. And the laws \ngoverning the property rights of a married couple have always varied \nfrom State to State.\n  For example, a couple married in Louisiana will have all property \nowned in that State subject to the community property laws of that \nState. But if they own property in another State, that property is \ngoverned by the laws where the land is owned.\n  Now some of our colleagues want to federalize the rights flowing from \ncivil marriage and overrule individual State laws. How odd that the \nsame people who oppose Federal regulation in almost every other area \nnow want a Federal constitutional amendment to eviscerate State \ncontract and property laws, but only when they grant benefits to same-\nsex couples. That is discrimination, and it's wrong.\n  In Massachusetts, marriage--and the stability and security it brings \nto families--is alive and well. Indeed, Massachusetts has the lowest \ndivorce rate in the Nation. We're having plenty of public debate and \ndemocratic process. The sky is not falling. Indeed, even the Boston \nHerald editorial page called this week's Senate debate what it really \nis ``pandering on a hot-button issue.''\n  I'm proud that Massachusetts continues to be a leader on marriage \nequality. Being part of a family is a basic right, and I look forward \nto the day when every State accepts this basic principle of fairness.\n  Obviously, those who disagree with Massachusetts law have a first \namendment right to express their views. But there's no justification \nfor undermining the separation of church and State in our society, or \nfor writing discrimination into the U.S. Constitution.\n  Supporters of the amendment claim that religious freedom is somehow \nunder attack. It is--but the attack comes from this Federal marriage \namendment--not from what's happening in the States. This amendment is \nan Anti-Marriage Amendment. It tells churches they cannot recognize a \nsame-sex marriage, even though many churches are now doing so.\n  No church in Massachusetts is required to recognize any civil \nmarriage. Indeed, my own Catholic Church does not recognize most \npostdivorce second marriages between a man and a woman, and that's \ntheir legal prerogative. By the same token, they are not required to \nrecognize same-sex marriages. The law of each church is what determines \nthe religious aspects of a sacramental marriage. But the law of the \nStates is what determines the civil aspects and property rights flowing \nfrom a marriage contract.\n  We cannot--and should not--require any religion or any church to \naccept any marriage as sacramental. That's up to the particular \nreligion. But it is wrong for our civil laws to deny any American the \nbasic right to be part of a family, to have loved ones with whom to \nbuild a secure future and share life's joys and tears, and to be free \nfrom the stain of bigotry and discrimination.\n  According to the 2000 Census, same-sex couples live in virtually \nevery county in the country. That's almost 600,000 households. Nearly \none-quarter of these couples are raising children. That's an estimated \n8 to 10 million children being raised in gay and lesbian partnered \nhomes. As many as 14 million children in America have a gay or lesbian \nparent.\n  Despite these growing numbers, many here in the Senate want to \ndeprive these men and women--these children--and their families--of the \nlegal protections and benefits associated with marriage. These families \nstand up to private bigotry and prejudice in their ordinary \nactivities--why would the Federal Government make their lives harder by \nwriting discrimination into the Constitution? It's wrong for Congress \nto add another burden to these families already struggling to live \ntheir lives and take care of each other.\n  The General Accounting Office has identified 1,138 protections and \nbenefits provided by the Federal Government on the basis of marital \nstatus. Many of these are laws relating to family and medical leave, \nsocial security benefits, and tax benefits. Gay and lesbian couples \ndeserve the same rights as married couples, including the right to be \ntreated fairly by the tax laws, to share insurance coverage, to visit \nloved ones in the hospital, and to have health benefits, family leave \nbenefits, and the many other benefits that automatically flow from \nmarriage.\n  Supporters of the Federal marriage amendment claim the need to stop \nactivist judges. Our colleagues should recall the words of another \nactivist court:\n\n       The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the \n     most vital personal property rights essential to the orderly \n     pursuit of happiness.\n\n  The activist judges stating this fundamental belief were part of the \nSupreme Court's 1967 decision in the landmark case Loving v. Virginia, \nwhich held that marriage is a basic civil right, and that freedom to \nmarry a person of another race may not be restricted by racial \ndiscrimination.\n  Now, nearly 40 years later, I urge the Senate not to turn back the \nclock on this progress, or start writing discrimination into our \ncountry's most cherished document. The framers never wanted it to be \nused for short-term political games--that's why it is so difficult to \namend. As Chief Justice John Marshall said, the Constitution is \n``intended to endure for ages to come.''\n  Two years ago, we defeated a disgraceful attempt to force this right \nwing agenda into the Constitution and we're prepared to do so again. \nThere is too much at stake to let the politics of bigotry prevail. I \nurge the Senate to reject this so-called Federal marriage amendment, \nand get back immediately to the real business of the Nation. Save the \npandering for rightwing supporters on the campaign trail.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I am honored to follow the great Senator \nfrom Massachusetts and join with him and others in opposing this \nproposed constitutional amendment. I do so because it is un-American, \nun-Christian, and unnecessary.\n  Let us be clear that this proposal is not about protecting marriage \nin America.\n  Marriage may need more people to practice it, but it does not need \nthe Senate to protect it. The Founders of this great Nation exercised \ntremendous wisdom by designing a system in which Government would stay \nout of the private lives of its citizens and a system in which \nGovernment would stay out of the province of religion. This amendment \nwould violate both.\n  This country was founded on the principle that all men and women are \ncreated equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain \nunalienable rights. Among them are life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness. To secure those rights, our Founders wrote a Constitution \nwhich guarantees every law-abiding American citizen the same equal \nrights and protections. Our country's Founders were not perfect. In \nfact, they were highly discriminatory. They initially denied those full \nand equal rights to women and to African Americans. This country's \nsocial progress has been highlighted by removing those constitutional \ndiscriminations based on gender or race or anything else.\n  Now, for the first time in our Nation's history, the proponents of \nthis amendment would add discrimination to our Constitution. They would \ntell one group of people, a social minority, that equal rights and \nequal protections\n\n[[Page S5467]]\n\ndo not apply to them, not only by the laws which exist today, Federal \nand State laws which ban gay marriages, not only by the social \nconventions which deny their recognition, but by an unprecedented \namendment to the U.S. Constitution which targets gays and lesbians \nalone, which says that of all the social practices in this country, \ntheirs alone are supposedly so abhorrent, theirs alone are supposedly \nsuch a threat to our social order that they must be singled out for \nthis unique form of discrimination.\n  Unfortunately, the proponents of this constitutional amendment have \nit mixed up. It is the Constitution that needs to be protected--from \nthem. It is the foundation of our democracy that needs to be saved--\nfrom them. The foundational principle of a democracy is its tolerance \nof individual differences. Even the most repressive totalitarian \ngovernment in the world allows individual behaviors that it agrees \nwith. The true test of a democracy is the government's allowance for \ndifferences. That doesn't mean that we agree with those differences. It \ndoesn't mean that we like them. It doesn't mean that we would choose \nthem for ourselves or wish them for our children. In fact, the \nopposite. We can disagree with them, dislike them, and reject them for \nourselves and our children.\n  But if we are a democracy--if we are a democracy--we allow other \ncitizens to be different from ourselves, to be unlike us. We grant them \nthe liberty to pursue their own form of personal, private happiness so \nlong as it does not interfere with our own. Which other adults, \nAmerican adults are attracted to, want to live with or commit to is \ntheir business and their right, not the business of 100 politicians in \nthe Senate. That is why this amendment would not only alter the U.S. \nConstitution, it would alter our democracy in a way that is destructive \nto both.\n  In addition to being un-American, this amendment is also Un-\nChristian. I hesitate to bring religion into this debate. I am highly \nskeptical of politicians who do so. Giving a Bible to a politician is \nakin to giving a blowtorch to a pyromaniac. However, I reread the New \nTestament in preparation for this debate. I cannot find a single \ninstance in any of the four gospels in which my saviour Jesus Christ \nspeaks a single word against same-sex marriages or even same-sex \nrelationships. He intones 6 times against divorce and 12 times against \nadultery. Yet I am not aware of any proposed constitutional amendments \nto ban either of them, nor would I support them.\n  What I also know is that he preached for love and acceptance and \nagainst hatred and discrimination. He said the great commandment was to \nlove God and the second was like unto it, to love thy neighbor as \nthyself, not just your family member, not just your friend, but to love \nyour neighbor, whoever happens to be living beside you, as you would \nyourself.\n  There is no love in this constitutional amendment. There is \ndiscrimination, and underneath discrimination lies judgment and hatred. \nJesus said also to beware of false prophets and charlatans, the fake \ngood doers. He said the way to tell the difference is that the true \nbelievers practice love, while the false prophets preach hate. That is \nwhy this amendment is un-Christian.\n  It is also unnecessary. There is no rampaging threat to the \ninstitution of marriage, as the amendment's proponents pretend. There \nare no rabid activist judges raging unchecked across the legal \nlandscape. They are figments of unchecked imaginations or clever \ncontrivances by master public manipulators who have conjured up some \nnonexistent threat and now present themselves as the saviours of \ncivilization.\n  We are spending 3 days on the floor of the Senate to indulge their \npolitical pandering. We haven't spent 3 days debating the war in Iraq \nduring this entire session of Congress, nor Iran's development of \nnuclear weapons, nor this year the gasoline price crisis afflicting our \ncitizens. No, the Senate's Republican leadership is avoiding the real \nthreats to our country and focusing instead on the divisive, \ndestructive nonexistent ones.\n\n  Existing Federal law, the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, defines \nmarriage nationwide as between a man and a woman and states that no \nState need recognize a same-sex marriage. My State of Minnesota is 1 of \n45 States that have passed similar State restrictions. This proposed \nconstitutional amendment is unnecessary overkill. It is predatory \npolitics, preying upon a minority of American citizens who are of the \nmost discriminated against in our society today. I don't understand why \nthis Senate would want to exploit the prejudice and even hatred which \nstill exists in our society against GLBT men and women. I am not a \npsychiatrist. I will leave it to them to explain why homophobia trumps \nracism, sexism, nationalism, and religious intolerance, but it does.\n  The discrimination against people because of their sexual \norientations they were born with or acquired indelibly early in life is \nvicious, ugly, and cruel. It is the immoral and it should be illegal. \nAnd it should not be practiced in the Senate.\n  I sympathize with the many decent-minded, well-intentioned, nd \nreligiously devout Americans who struggle with their personal feelings \ntoward homosexuality. Many have grown in understanding and acceptance. \nThey want to do what is right, even if it doesn't feel entirely right \nto them. They and their feelings are being unnecessarily used in this \ncharade. But I have no sympathy and I have no respect for the \ncharlatans who are using them for their own self-serving political \npurposes, who are spreading prejudice and discrimination, who claim the \nmoral high ground while they reach into their emotional cesspools and \nhurl their slime at decent and innocent human beings who are trying to \nlive their private lives as God created them and under the promises of \nthis American democracy.\n  What we ought to do is leave marriage up to God. In the religious \nmarriage services of my faith, the minister says that marriage is an \ninstitution created by God. Thus, we should leave the definition of \nmarriage to those ordained by God, the leaders of the respective \norganized religions, and we should redefine the legal term for marriage \nto civil union or some other words and make that legal contract, with \nits rights, protections, and responsibilities, available equally to any \ntwo adult citizens as the equal protection clauses of our Constitution \nrequire.\n  That would be an American, a Christian, and a just resolution to this \nsituation, one that elevates and enlightens us, one that continues the \nprogress in our country toward acceptance and understanding, one that \nhonors our common humanity.\n  Those are the reasons I urge my colleagues to oppose and defeat this \ncruel amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to add my \nvoice to the rising chorus of people both here in the Senate and back \nin my home State of Iowa who are fed up with the misplaced priorities \nof the Republican leadership in this Congress. Our country faces \nmounting challenges: High energy prices, skyrocketing health care \ncosts, tens of millions of Americans without health insurance, the cost \nof college tuition going through the roof, individuals with minimum \nwage jobs going nearly a decade without a raise. So how does the \nleadership here respond to these challenges? By squandering a week of \nthe Senate's time debating a constitutional marriage amendment that has \nalready been soundly rejected by the Senate and by debating repeal of \nthe estate tax which would benefit only about 3 out of every 1,000 \npeople in America at the most and would add $1 trillion to the deficit \nin the coming years, so that the superrich can get yet another tax \nbreak, a tax break that won't build one additional school, would not \nprovide one new additional job, while working families get absolutely \nnothing.\n  Again, the great majority of American people are getting madder and \nmadder about this. All you have to do is look at the polls of Congress. \nThe\n\n[[Page S5468]]\n\nonly thing lower than President Bush's polls is the standing of \nCongress. You wonder why? Look at what we are debating while all of \nthese issues go by the wayside. What about the real needs and concerns \nof working Americans and their families.\n  Let me give one case in point. The majority leader cannot find time \nto bring H.R. 810 to the floor. It is pending at the desk. It was \npassed by a bipartisan majority in the House of Representatives--a bill \nto lift restrictions on embryonic stem cell research. Evidently, we \ndon't have time. No time? Well, the majority party found plenty of time \nthis week for these two dubious, devisive measures. But when it comes \nto the No. 1 research priority of the American people--embryonic stem \ncell research--the majority leader refuses to bring it to the floor; we \ndon't have the time.\n\n  This is outrageous. No wonder the American people say Congress is not \ndoing anything. We are not doing anything to address the real needs of \nour people.\n  Two weeks ago, on May 24, we reached the 1-year anniversary of the \nHouse passage of H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. This \nbill is supported by the majority of Senators on a bipartisan basis. It \nenjoys the support of large majorities in every public opinion poll. \nYet we cannot bring it up. Removing the straitjacket on embryonic stem \ncell research is a matter of life and death for millions of Americans. \nAs the Senate squanders yet another week, people we love are dying from \nParkinson's and Lou Gehrig's disease and juvenile diabetes. People are \nunable to walk due to spinal cord injuries. These Americans are \ndesperate for progress on embryonic stem cell research, which is being \nblocked by the majority leader's failure to allow H.R. 810 to come to \nthe floor for debate and a vote. No time. Yet we have time to debate \nthis constitutional amendment on marriage, which has been soundly \nrejected already by the Senate, and which everybody knows will be \nsoundly rejected again, or we will have time to bring up for a vote the \nrepeal of the estate tax, benefiting only the richest of the rich in \nour country. We have time for that, but we don't have time to bring up \na bill to open the doors of medical research that hold such promise for \npeople with incurable diseases.\n  There are also other urgent priorities being sidetracked. Forty-five \nmillion Americans have no health insurance. The majority leader says \nthere is no time to debate this. There is no time to consider a measure \nthat would make it possible for small companies to offer employees a \nhealth care plan similar to the one we have in Congress. Indeed, we \nDemocrats were prevented from getting an up-or-down vote on this during \nthe so-called Health Care Week last month.\n  In the Midwest, we have a bill that is very important not only for \nthe Midwest but for the rest of the country, which is the Water \nResources Development Act. We have 81 signatures on a letter, \nRepublicans and Democrats, to the majority leader supporting this bill, \nasking that it be brought up. That is not only more than it takes to \nbreak a filibuster, if this was one--and I don't think there is one \npending on it or to override a veto--that is more than two-thirds. Yet \nno action on it. I guess we don't have time.\n  The majority leader says we have time this week to consider a mammoth \ntax cut for the wealthiest Americans, but we don't have any time to \nconsider a bill to raise the minimum wage for Americans at the bottom. \nThe minimum wage has been stuck at the low level of $5.15 for more than \n9 years. During those 9 years, Members of this Senate have voted seven \ntimes to raise their salaries. Yet for those at the bottom, we don't \nhave the time to bring a minimum wage increase bill to the floor of the \nSenate.\n  If we can keep this up, the approval of Congress will go into the \nnegatives. At least it is in the positives now. It is maybe 10 or 12 \npercent. If that happens, it will be the first time in history that it \nwill be in the negatives. I don't blame the American people for having \nthat opinion of Congress.\n  Last month, we learned that some 26 million Americans--most \nveterans--had personal information stolen, including names, birth \ndates, Social Security numbers. This puts every one of these veterans \nin jeopardy of identity theft and fraud. Why are we not this week \nbringing to the floor the urgently needed Veterans Identity Protection \nAct? This bill would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to \nprovide 1 year of credit monitoring to each affected person and one \nadditional free credit report each year for the following 2 years. This \nbill would make a real difference for millions of veterans. Why is it \nbeing ignored? It seems to have bipartisan support. Why is it not being \nhotlined, as they say around here, for immediate consideration on the \nfloor? We should bring it up this week. We should be debating that \ntoday. I guess we don't have time for that.\n  One other matter. I don't think we have a higher priority right now \nin terms of our national economy and our national well-being than \nending our addiction to foreign oil. Senator Lugar, a Republican, and I \nhave a bill that would dramatically ramp up ethanol and biodiesel \nproduction. It would make these home-grown fuels available and usable \nat the pump and in communities all across the United States. Our \nnational security is at stake. Why isn't this bill being brought to the \nfloor on an expedited basis this week?\n  The answer, Mr. President, is that we are not addressing the real \nconcerns and priorities of the American people because the majority \nleader--and I assume his party--are putting their own narrow special \ninterest priorities first. Apparently, it is more important to cater to \na narrow vocal base of the Republican Party than to listen to the broad \nmajority of the American people.\n  It boggles the mind that the Republicans have once again brought the \nso-called Federal marriage amendment to the floor. It will fail this \nweek for the same reason it failed the last time. It is because deep \ndown inside we all know it is wrong. It is just basically wrong.\n  Yesterday, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Specter, said this amendment is ``a solution in search of a \nproblem.'' He is exactly right. For more than two centuries, our States \nhave done an excellent job of making their own laws governing marriage \nwithout Federal interference. The last time the Senate debated this \namendment, the cloture vote on the motion to proceed garnered only 48 \nvotes--12 votes short of the 60 needed to invoke cloture, and far short \nof the 67 votes needed to pass a constitutional amendment. You have to \nhave 67 votes. There isn't one person here who thinks they are even \nclose to that. They cannot even get a majority. It is not surprising.\n  The amendment tramples on the authority of each State to regulate the \ncivil laws of marriage within its borders--authority, by the way, I \npoint out, that the Congress strengthened by passing the Defense of \nMarriage Act, which prevents any State from being forced or required to \nrecognize a same-sex marriage in another State. Wait a minute. The \nCongress passed a law saying that we, the Federal Government, cannot \nrequire a State to recognize a contractual agreement in another State \ndealing with same-sex marriage. Well, guess what. No State has been \nforced to recognize a same-sex marriage or civil union joined in \nanother State.\n\n  Yet now the Republicans would have us force upon each State a \nconstitutional amendment that would take away the right of those States \nto enact their own contractual laws. It seems to me that what is \nhappening is we are going down a road rapidly of more and more power to \nthe President of the United States, less and less power to the Congress \nand the courts, more and more power to the Federal Government under a \nPresident.\n  The last time I looked, that could have been called something like a \nmonarchy. Come to think of it, that is what we overthrew a couple \nhundred years ago. Most people tend to forget that when we declared our \nindependence from Great Britain and fought the Revolutionary War and \nestablished our Constitution, England had a Parliament. But guess what. \nThe King reigned supreme. It was King George at that time. So we \nrecognized that. We recognized the inherent inability of the Parliament \nin England to go up against the King. So when we devised our \nConstitution, that is why we had the separation of powers--the courts, \nthe Congress, and the President, all separate\n\n[[Page S5469]]\n\nand equal. Then we reserved to the States certain powers not enumerated \nin the Constitution. One of the powers is the right to set contractual \nlaws. Now this Republican Congress wants to take that away. It is \nalmost like we are going full circle back to the monarchy of Great \nBritain--a Congress that lays prone before the President--a President \nthat is able to tap your phones, read your e-mails under some guise of \na power that, since we are at war, he can do whatever he wants, taking \naway our civil rights and liberties. What does Congress do? Nothing. We \nsit back and let it go on. Now we are going to take another step to \ntake away power from the States.\n  Well, again, this is something that is inherently wrong. It is wrong \nto take away this power from the States, take away the authority to set \nup their own contractual framework. As Senator Kennedy said, I think \neloquently, a few moments ago, it should be the right of every \nreligion, under the freedom of religion, to decide the sacramental laws \nof marriage as defined by that religion. But when it comes to the \ncontractual right, the civil right, that is determined by the State. \nThat is why when you go to get married, you do two things--find a \nminister, a rabbi, a priest, whatever, but then you have to go to the \ncourthouse of your State and get a license. Why? Because you are \nentering a contractual relationship. That is what this amendment would \ntake away. Again, I would defend to the death the right of a religion \nto determine its own sacramental laws of what it determines a marriage \nto be, but also defend the right of a State to set up its own \ncontractual laws within and under the umbrella of equal rights for all \nand nondiscrimination under the Constitution of the United States.\n  Senator Kennedy referred to it, and I will refer to it again. It \nwasn't too long ago where people of different races could not get \nmarried in this country. States had laws that said a Black person could \nnot marry a White American, or an Oriental could not marry a Black or a \nWhite. You could not marry someone of another race. It is not too long \nago in my own lifetime, but that was true.\n  Discrimination is what it was. The courts struck it down. Would these \nsame Republicans who keep coming here saying the courts should not be \ninterfering in this say the courts should not have interfered there, \ntoo; that we should have left those discriminatory laws intact under \nthe Constitution of the United States?\n  I keep hearing all this stuff about protecting the American family. I \nsubmit to my friends on the other side, if they really want to do that, \nhow about raising the minimum wage? That would do more to protect the \nAmerican family than anything they are talking about here.\n\n  How about addressing the skyrocketing health care costs? How about \nthe high cost of gasoline? If they want to defend the American family, \nhow about giving access to health insurance to 45 million people a day \nwho can't afford it? If they want to defend the American family, how \nabout doing something about the rising cost of college tuition in this \ncountry and helping low and moderate families meet those costs of \ncollege education? In other words, if Majority Leader Frist and his \nparty want to protect the American family, why don't they deal with the \nreal challenges confronting families instead of wasting the Senate's \ntime on this cynical, trumped-up issue of same-sex marriage? Why can't \nwe make bipartisan progress on issues such as providing access to \nhealth insurance and raising the minimum wage?\n  I close by making one point very clear: If the Democrats were in \ncharge of the Senate, if we were setting the agenda, we would be \ncharting a different course for our Nation. We would not be wasting the \nSenate's time on divisive, partisan constitutional amendments which \nseek to divide our people, pit families one against another, pit \nAmericans one against another by dividing us. We would not be passing \nyet another mammoth tax cut for the wealthiest in our society called \nthe estate tax, a tax we can't afford for people who don't need it.\n  If we could set the agenda, we would have the minimum wage issue out \nhere. We would have a health care issue out here. We would have issues \nout here that provide for families getting a college education for \ntheir kids. We would have bills on the floor addressing the addiction \nto oil and moving us to more energy independence.\n  Every day it is becoming clearer and clearer to the American people \nthat they face a choice: We can stay the current course--more \ndivisiveness, more deficits, more debt, more drift--or a new direction \nfor our country. If the majority party wants to continue to squander \nour time and taxpayers' money, as they are doing this week, well, that \nis their choice. But the American people get to choose, too. The \nAmerican people are eager to cut out this divisiveness, to move on to \nthe real agenda that confronts our country, to move in a very different \ndirection, and I say it is time to do that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, last week our country celebrated a very \nimportant event--Memorial Day. Every Member of the Senate went home to \nservices where we heard about the sacrifices of men and women who \nserved in conflicts throughout this Nation's history, most recently in \nIraq and Afghanistan where we have now lost close to 2,500 of our \nNation's best and brightest.\n  I listened to those speeches, and I heard about the sacrifices these \nmen and women have made. I heard the rhetoric about making sure we take \ncare of their families, making sure we take care of those who are \nwounded when they come home, making sure we have the ability to care \nfor those we ask to serve this country so honorably as we celebrated \nMemorial Day last week. I went throughout my State. I listened to \npeople wanting to make sure we did not forget those people who served \nus. I came back to the Senate last night confident that we should be \ntalking about those issues.\n  It is deeply disconcerting to me that we are not talking about the \nwar in Iraq or Afghanistan, we are not talking about the sacrifices our \nsoldiers have made, we are not talking about the tremendous \nresponsibility we have as the Senate and Congress to make sure we have \nthe funds for those men and women who have served us, both while they \nare overseas and when they come home. We are here instead on a \ncompletely different priority, and I have to ask the question of this \nSenate: Why are we spending time on political games when we have \nsoldiers in harm's way who are serving us honorably around the world? \nDon't they deserve better than this? Why is the Senate bringing up \ndivisive issues when we need right now more than ever to come together \nas a country and address the challenges that confront us? Maybe it is \nbecause those people who are in charge, those people who make a \ndecision about what issues we discuss here, just have the wrong \npriorities. And I see the wrong priorities being debated in the Senate \nnot just for this week but for apparently the coming weeks.\n  Last week, I traveled through communities in my home State of \nWashington. Everywhere I went, I heard a growing anger and frustration \nthat American troops are being wounded and dying in Iraq, and my \nconstituents want to know why. They want to know where we are going. \nThey want to know what they are doing. They want to know why we are \nthere. They want to know what will make us successful and how we can \nbring our troops home successfully. But here we are in Washington, DC, \nwhere the Bush administration doesn't have a plan they have outlined \nfor success, and here we are in Congress not demanding answers.\n  My constituents are very frustrated, and they have good reason to be \nso. They, like all of us, are watching what is happening in Iraq on \ntheir TVs every night. They see personally what these deployments are \ndoing to their communities at home, their friends, their neighbors, \ntheir coworkers, being called up not just once but twice, three times, \nto head to Iraq and come back. They see the terrible consequences for \nfamilies who are left behind, and they see these veterans, when they go \nto get the treatment they need, being told they have to wait in line \nbecause we haven't adequately funded our Veterans' Administration.\n\n  And by the way, many of these same veterans just in the last week \nwere told\n\n[[Page S5470]]\n\nthat because of lack of oversight at the VA, 26.5 million of these \nveterans who served our country honorably have now lost their \nidentities, and we are not dealing with that in the Senate right now? \nHow are we going to make sure every one of these veterans gets the care \nthey need, and how are we going to make sure now that 26.5 million \nveterans get the help they need as their identities have been stolen? \nThat is going to cost money. It is not free. We have a responsibility \nto help every single one of them. They should not be treated like this \nas veterans in the United States today.\n  I see what these deployments are doing in our communities, just as my \nconstituents do, and they see the challenges these veterans are facing \nwhen they come home and their families while they are deployed. They \ndon't see a plan about how we are going forward in Iraq today. And what \nthey importantly don't see is us in Congress on the Senate floor \nstanding up and talking about what is going on, demanding answers from \nthe Bush administration and the Pentagon.\n  We can only make the good decisions about how we go forward if we \nhave a discussion in the Senate about what is happening on the ground, \nwhat the impacts are, what our choices are, how we can help both the \nPentagon and the Bush administration and our constituents make a good \ndecision about whether our troops should come home or whether they \nshould stay or what is happening. We need to demand answers in the \nSenate from this administration and the Pentagon about what is \nhappening on the ground. That is the discussion I wish we were having \nin the Senate today. That has meaning to every single one of my \nconstituents. They want to know what we are doing, where we are going, \nhow we are going to pay for it, and how we can be successful so we can \nknow when our troops are coming home.\n  I have watched now for 3 years as our soldiers went to war in Iraq, \nand at every possible juncture in this war, the Bush administration has \nchosen the wrong path. When they were advised to build a stronger \nmultinational coalition, they decided to go it alone. When the Army's \nChief of Staff said it would take several hundred thousand troops to \nstabilize Iraq after the war, they ignored his advice and they fired \nhim. When sectarian violence started boiling over and undermining the \nstability of Iraq and the safety of our troops, they pronounced the \ninsurgency was in its last throes. Well, they were wrong.\n  We can't continue to watch what is happening in Iraq without \nanswering questions in the Senate. For too long, we have watched \ndecisions being made that have sent us in the wrong direction, and for \ntoo long, I say to my colleagues in the Senate, we have given them a \npass on these monumental failures, and that has to change.\n  Families I represent want Congress to demand accountability, and they \nwant us to get to the bottom of this. But that is not what they are \ngetting here. Instead, we see the Republican leadership playing \npolitics with debates on gay marriage and flag burning. What are we not \ndoing while we spend our time on this issue? We are not having hearings \non Iraq. We are not having discussions about what is happening on the \nground. We are not hearing from our generals so that we can make good \ndecisions about when and how our troops can come home successfully. \nInstead, we are seeing political distractions that are simply meant to \ndivide our country at a time when we ought to be together, Republicans \nand Democrats, having serious discussions about what we can do as \nleaders of this Nation to bring us success, if it is possible, in Iraq.\n  Back home, people want us to talk about Iraq. They want answers. But \nin the Senate, the Iraq war is the proverbial elephant in the room. It \nis right there, everyone can see it, but no one talks about it. No one \ntalks about it in the Senate of America. No one is talking about the \nIraq war. I will tell my colleagues, we are not going to get better \nresults in Iraq if we ignore it in Congress.\n  In all the time I have served in the Senate, I believe this is the \nweakest oversight I have ever seen from a Congress during military \nconflict. We were not sent here to just rubberstamp this administration \nor any administration. I served under the Clinton administration during \nthe war in Bosnia when we required generals to come up here almost on a \ndaily basis, to obtain answers from them about what was happening on \nthe ground, how we were proceeding forward, what we needed to do; and \nyes, at the time, there were calls to bring our troops home, no boots \non the ground, all the different points we are hearing today, but we at \nleast had generals in front of us so we could ask questions and go home \nand respond to our constituents and feel confident in whatever decision \nwe made in how we were to move forward.\n  We were sent here as Senators to develop policy to help our country \nmove forward. And in this time, this place, this war, I can't think of \na more important time that as Republicans and Democrats we should sit \ndown together and put our cards on the table and say: How should we \nmove forward and how can we do it safely and how can we do it \neffectively? Yet here we are in the Senate talking about gay marriage \nand flag burning. We are not talking about a conflict that has consumed \nour Nation, that has sent our youngest, best, and brightest to a war \nwhere we have almost 2,500 military families that have suffered the \nloss of a loved one, where we have thousands and thousands of young men \nand women who have lost limbs, have had head injuries, and are now \nbeing serviced in our veterans hospitals for years to come, and yet we \nhaven't talked about how we are going to pay for that.\n  There is a huge disconnect between the families at home and what is \nhappening on the Senate floor. There is no surprise they are frustrated \nand angry and demanding answers. They are surprised and shocked that we \nare talking about gay marriage and flag burning because the discussion \nthey have at their dinner tables when they are home at night is what is \nhappening in our world; how can we protect our children; how can we \nmake sure our families are safe; how can we make sure our loved ones \nwho are serving us overseas are protected while they are there; how can \nwe make sure we win a war in Iraq, if that is possible; how can we make \nsure that those people we send to serve us overseas have the services \nthey need when they come home.\n  I was shocked to see an article in the ``Psychiatric News'' just a \nfew weeks ago that says our veterans are not getting the help they need \nfor mental health care and substance abuse. I wish to quote Frances \nMurphy, M.D., Under Secretary for Health Policy Coordination at our \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, who said that the growing number of \nveterans seeking mental health care has put emphasis on areas in which \nimprovement is needed, and she noted that some VA clinics do not \nprovide mental health or substance abuse care, or if they do----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. She says, ``waiting lists render that care virtually \ninaccessible.''\n  Our soldiers who are serving in a 24/7 war in Iraq deserve to have \nmental health care when they come home. They are not getting it today, \nand the Senate is not dealing with that issue. I think we can do a lot \nbetter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wanted to spend a few minutes here to \nrespond to the allegations made on the other side of the aisle that the \nprotection of marriage is not important enough for the U.S. Senate to \ntake a day or two to debate and then to vote on a constitutional \namendment. I really am astonished to hear our friends on the other side \nof the aisle take that position because, frankly, I think the American \npeople disagree with them and agree that marriage is important. I think \nthey agree that when it comes to social experimentation by our courts, \nby a handful of activist judges who think they know better than the \nAmerican people what is good for us, that they want that kind of \nexperimentation to stop unless, of course, it is authorized by a vote \nof we, the people, rather than imposed upon us from on high by judges. \nThis kind of experimentation when it comes to living arrangements and \nnow with the institution of\n\n[[Page S5471]]\n\nmarriage are not without costs, and, most often, the individuals who \npay the price for that kind of experimentation are America's children.\n  I just can't disagree more with our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle who seem to think that the preservation of our society's most \nbasic institution--the institution of marriage--isn't important enough \nfor our time and it is not important enough to take the time to discuss \nthis issue and talk about what the solution might be to preserve the \npower of we, the people, to determine the laws and policies that affect \nour lives, and certainly the next generation of our children. I think \nthis time is important, this issue is important, and we will find out \nwhen we vote on this issue who it is that believes that the American \npeople should make these sorts of decisions and not a handful of \nactivist judges such as occurred in Massachusetts, and now with a \ndecision out of the Federal court in Nebraska holding that State's \nconstitutional provision that limits marriage to one man and one woman \nunconstitutional under the Federal Constitution.\n  I don't know who it was that woke up 200 years or more after the \nConstitution was written and decided that the Founding Fathers wrote \ninto the Constitution discrimination when it comes to marriage between \none man and one woman. Obviously this is an issue that we have not \ninitiated, we haven't brought up, but this is a fight that has been \nbrought to us, those of us who believe it is important to preserve \ntraditional marriage.\n  Mr. President, I would ask if I might be notified after 15 minutes of \nour 30-minute allotment has been used.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The Chair will so advise.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would also like to spend just a few \nminutes examining what our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhave said. For example, this morning our Democratic leader has said \nthat Nevada has the third highest gas prices in the whole country, and \nhe says that taking care of gas prices is more important than \npreserving marriage between a man and a woman. But I would like to \npoint out that it is because of obstruction on the other side of the \naisle that we have been unable to address the importance of access to \ndomestic production of oil and gas in this country. And, because of \nobstruction on the other side of the aisle, we have been unable to \ncreate new refinery capacity that would make more gasoline, increase \nthe supply and necessarily then, under the economic laws, bring down \nthe price. It has been because of the obstruction that we have seen on \nthe other side of the aisle that we have been unable to address that \nissue. Again, another example of block and blame.\n  Then we are told that somehow we should be talking about solving the \nhealth care needs of the American people. It was just a few weeks ago \nwhen our colleagues on the other side of the aisle denied sufficient \nvotes to allow us to consider a small business comprehensive health \nplan brought up by the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi. If our friends \non the other side of the aisle were serious about solving America's \nhealth care problems and providing greater access to health insurance, \nthey wouldn't have voted against that bill just a few short weeks ago. \nYet, now they want to change the subject, saying we shouldn't be \ntalking about marriage; we should be talking about health care. The \nfact is they are the ones who blocked our ability to proceed on that \nimportant issue and to find a real solution to that problem. But again, \nit is an instance of block and blame.\n  Then the Democratic leader this morning said, we ought to be doing \nsomething about health care costs. We tried to bring up the issue of \nhealth care costs earlier as well, in a case where we have said there \nought to be some reasonable limits on noneconomic damages in medical \nliability cases. That has been tried in my State, the State of Texas, \nand we have seen medical liability insurance go down into the double-\ndigit range. We have seen more doctors coming into communities where \nthey have been afraid to practice, and we have seen greater access to \nhealth care as a result of those efforts. Yet when we tried to change \nthat here in the U.S. Senate, again, we were blocked by our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle and then blamed when we are debating \nabout the preservation of the institution of marriage and not \naddressing medical costs by dealing with the medical liability crisis.\n\n  Of course, then they also claim that really they ought to be the ones \nto control the legislative agenda, and that is really what this is all \nabout. But they mentioned the war in Iraq, the energy crisis, the price \nof gasoline, health care, and said that the priorities of the \nRepublican leadership are misplaced when it comes to addressing \nAmerica's real needs, but neglecting all the while in pointing out that \nthey themselves are the ones who are the primary reasons why we have \nbeen unsuccessful in addressing some critical improvements and reforms \nin those areas.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle need to make up their \nminds. They are literally schizophrenic--of two minds--when it comes to \nwhat to do about our energy crisis in America. They blocked building \nnew refineries; they held up an energy bill for 3 years; they blocked \nexploration for domestic production in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge, which we know, given modern exploration and drilling \ntechniques, can be done in an environmentally friendly sort of way; and \nthey blocked the President's Clear Skies initiative, which is designed \nto cut down on emissions and protect the environment.\n  Rather than demagog the issue, rather than to try and pin blame on \nthe President or the Republican leadership, our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle would be better served, and certainly the American \npeople would be better served, by working with this side of the aisle \nin trying to find real solutions, particularly when it comes to our \nenergy needs, to reduce America's dependence on foreign sources of \nenergy and help reduce gas prices. If they are really concerned about \nenergy costs, then they would have made it easier by working together \nwith us to expand clean nuclear energy.\n  On the issue of the marriage amendment, the Democratic leader this \nmorning said this is an issue that ought to be left to the States. \nCertainly many States, including my State, have passed a constitutional \namendment protecting traditional marriage. The problem is some Federal \ncourts, notably one in Nebraska most recently, held that very State \nsolution is itself in violation of the Federal Constitution.\n  The Democratic leader is a distinguished lawyer in his own right. He \nunderstands that a Federal court which holds that the Federal \nConstitution violates the State Constitution, that the Federal decision \npreempts the State constitutional solution. So again, this is not an \nissue that we have gratuitously brought up; this is one that has been \nforced upon us. I think what our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle would prefer is if we would just be quiet and gradually allow the \nConstitution of the United States to be amended, but not as it turns \nout by the American people by voting on a constitutional amendment, but \nrather by a handful of activist judges who have somehow taken it upon \nthemselves to define what is good for us and in fact what is and is not \nunlawful discrimination when it comes to our traditional marriage laws.\n  We know what happens when the American people have a chance to vote \non these issues. Overwhelmingly, they vote in favor of preserving \ntraditional marriage because instinctively they know it is the best \nsolution for our society and certainly in the best interests of our \nchildren. We have seen too many of our children suffer as a result of \nsocial experimentation, certainly by the courts, and we ought to make \nsure that we preserve the right for we, the people, to make those \nimportant decisions rather than allow them to be made by judges who \nwould amend the Constitution themselves under the guise of interpreting \nthe Constitution. How is it that someone can decide after 200 years or \nmore that the U.S. Constitution or even a State constitution modeled \nafter the U.S. Constitution would result in a decision that traditional \nmarriage laws are somehow discrimination is really just beyond me.\n  As I said yesterday on this floor, it is almost surreal. It is almost \nas if we have been asked to voluntarily suspend our powers of \ndisbelief. The American people know what we are talking about\n\n[[Page S5472]]\n\nis important. They know what we are talking about here in terms of \npreserving marriage and a better future for our children is fundamental \nto our way of life. It is not frivolous. It is not politics. It is \nabsolutely essential that we do so. They try to raise red herrings \nlike: Well, we ought to be talking about health care, or we ought to be \ntalking about the energy crisis, or we ought to be talking about the \nmedical liability crisis, when the truth is they blocked every \nopportunity we have had recently to try to do something about those \nissues. The truth is what they want to do is to try to score political \npoints rather than solve the very real problems that confront our \nNation.\n  Finally, let me just add that recently I know the Democratic \nleadership in the other House criticized--if you can believe this--\ncriticized the performance of the economy. Are they really complaining \nthat 75,000 new jobs last month, not to mention 33 consecutive months \nof job gains and more than 5.3 million new jobs created since August of \n2003, is the wrong direction for this country? The fact is the economy \nis doing well. But we need to continue to try to make sure that America \nremains competitive in a global economy by making sure that we keep \ntaxes as low as possible, and by making sure that we keep our \nregulatory environment one that can protect us but, at the same time, \nnot kill good business opportunities and job creation in this country. \nWe need to look at our litigation system and make sure that we are not \nimposing a litigation tax on the American consumer and making it harder \nfor legitimate employers to create those jobs. We need to make sure \nthat we continue to try to work together to solve the very real \nproblems that confront our Nation.\n  I don't apologize for a minute in saying that I believe we should \nvote on a constitutional amendment to protect traditional marriage. I \ndon't think it is a waste of time. I think we can spend a day or two \ntalking about this issue and its impact on our children and on the next \ngeneration. I think that is as weighty an issue as we will ever \nconsider here, because it may well determine the long-term direction of \nour society and the welfare certainly of the next generation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be recognized \nfor 5 minutes to speak on the issue of S.J. Res. 1.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I am pleased to follow the distinguished \nSenator from Texas in talking about this issue that is very important \nto the American people. I, like he, believe that it is a bit of a \n``dodge and weave'' to suggest we should not be talking about this. It \nis much easier to talk about all the things that maybe we ought to be \ntalking about, things that we have talked about in the weeks past and \nwill be talking about in weeks to come, but let's not talk about this \none because it is too hard. It is easier to have a collateral way of \nlooking at it by saying: Oh, gosh, we should not talk about this \nbecause frankly we would just as soon not debate or discuss the merits \nof what is before us.\n  S.J. Res. 1 is rather simple. Today is one of those days when we can \nactually read what it is we are debating. This is all we would add to \nthe U.S. Constitution, this is all it would say, if this amendment to \nthe Constitution were to be approved. It says:\n\n       Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the \n     union of a man and a woman. Neither this Constitution, nor \n     the constitution of any State, shall be construed to require \n     that marriage or the legal incidents thereof be conferred \n     upon any union other than the union of a man and a woman.\n\n  To suggest that is not an important issue for our Nation, to suggest \nthat somehow that is some out-of-the-mainstream language, to suggest \nthat is only from some sect or far extreme point of view--to so \ncharacterize what I believe is the mainstream of American thought is \nsimply not to be dealing with this subject truthfully.\n  A number of States have already spoken on this matter through their \nelected officials, but activist judges have interpreted both the \nFederal Constitution and the State constitutions very broadly. They \nhave done this in order to overturn the will of the people regarding \nsame-sex marriage. That is the reason we have to act. The Constitution \nhas been improperly interpreted to impose same-sex marriage on the \npeople of the United States.\n  As the Senator from Texas said, the fact is, it is the action of \njudges that have precipitated the need for us to be discussing this \nissue in the Senate today. It is the activism of some judges, who have \ntaken away the right of State constitutions to be amended to include \nthis very simple language, that has brought us to this moment. The \nConstitution has been improperly interpreted to impose same-sex \nmarriage on the people of the United States. It is proper for the \npeople to continue to speak on this issue through their elected \nofficials by amending the Constitution to ensure that the sanctity of \nmarriage will be protected from these activist courts.\n  Marriage, as defined as this amendment would define it, as between a \nman and a woman, hardly needs to be suggested as the most basic \ninstitution of society throughout history. It is foundational to the \nstructure of what we know leads to the successful family, to the \nraising of children. Our traditional and religious understanding of \nmarriage is under attack by those who wish to redefine the meaning of \nmarriage and family. That is what is at stake, whether in fact the \ntraditional view of family and marriage will prevail or whether, \nthrough the acts of judicial activism, we will redefine it to something \nother than that.\n  They have sought to go to the courts to overturn properly enacted \nState laws or constitutional amendments defining marriage as between a \nman and a woman. Only through bypassing democratically elected \nlegislatures and the rule of law can same-sex marriage advocates enact \ntheir vision of American society.\n  The only way to prevent marriage from being redefined by activist \ncourts is to pass a constitutional amendment that clearly establishes \nthe will of the people on this foundational issue for our society.\n  I also want to address the concerns expressed by some regarding \nfederalism. It is true that in our Federal Republic, in our system, the \nregulation of marriage has traditionally been left to State \ngovernments. Based on this principle of federalism, the States have \nbeen free to enact family policies that have allowed experimentation \nand reflect the different values that Americans have in each of their \nrespective States.\n  While federalism is a general principle that promotes liberty within \nour Republic, we also have the overriding fundamental principle of \nAmerican Government that governments derive their just powers from the \nconsent of the governed. An essential element of republican government \nis that those who are subject to law also determine the law by which \nthey are governed.\n  The recent strain of judicial decisions and cases on the part of \nsame-sex marriage proponents, however, not only threatens the \ninstitution of marriage but denies the people of the individual States \nthe freedom to define their own basic legal and social institutions.\n  I believe this marriage amendment takes a measured and reasonable \napproach to the problem of courts redefining marriage. It prohibits \nsame-sex marriage in the United States while preserving the concept of \nfederalism by leaving to the States the authority to enact State laws \nregarding legal benefits to unmarried, including same-sex couples.\n  Our judiciary is respected throughout the world, and I believe that \nis because our judges for the most part have been above politics and \nhave always been committed to the rule of law. When our courts enact \ntheir political will over the proper policy decisions of legislatures, \nsuch respect is in jeopardy. A judge's personal political views have \nabsolutely no place in performing their judicial role in our \nconstitutional structure. Rather, the Constitution, statutes and \ncontrolling prior decisions as applied to the facts of the case at hand \nare the sole basis for judicial determination.\n  Therefore, today I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment and \ngive control of the foundational institutions of marriage back to the \npeople of our country where it rightfully belongs.\n\n[[Page S5473]]\n\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will please call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, a couple of my colleagues have spoken \nin favor of the constitutional amendment that is up today. They have \ngiven eloquent statements. We have others who are coming.\n  What I wanted to do while we wait on additional Members who are \ncoming over to the floor is cover a couple of points I believe have \nbeen touched upon, but I think they deserve emphasis. I appreciate my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle raising a number of issues \nthat they are saying we are not dealing with. I urge them to vote for \ncloture on these issues when they come up because we will bring these \nissues up--on the budget; the supplemental is in a conference; we will \nhave an Energy bill that is going to be coming up. I hope they will \nvote for cloture to go to that Energy bill so we can actually get it up \nto vote on it on the floor.\n  I know a number of them are supportive of the Native Hawaiian issue \nand are complaining because these issues are not in the top 20 issues \nin the United States, of the people's concern. Yet they are not raising \nthe Native Hawaiian issue which will come up this week as well. I urge \nthem to vote against that if they think it is not a high-priority \nissue.\n  I do think there is some speaking out of both sides of the mouth when \nyou raise all these issues we should be covering and then vote against \ncloture, preventing us from covering those issues, and then complain \nabout a marriage amendment that they are saying doesn't rise to the \nlevel of interest in the United States.\n  I think it is of a high interest in the United States or you wouldn't \nhave seen all these States that covered it.\n  There is another issue that has been covered some. I hope we can \naddress that issue. It is the issue of religious freedom. If you do not \ndefine marriage as the union of a man and a woman, but define it to \nrequire that you have to recognize same-sex unions, that is the basis--\none of the bases on which Catholic Charities was driven out of the \nadoption business in Boston. They were required by law to do something \nagainst the tenets of their faith. I hope that can be developed some a \nlittle later on.\n  My colleague from Missouri is here. He is one of the strong \nsupporters of this amendment. I yield the floor to the Senator from \nMissouri, Senator Talent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments today to \nspeak in favor of the Marriage Protection Amendment. This is an \nimportant measure, and the people are entitled to see who in this body \nis for protecting traditional marriage and who is not, because nothing \nless than that is at stake.\n  Some courts in this country are engaged in a process by which they \nare going to force the people, whether they like it or not, to accept a \nfundamental change in the basic building block of our society. I think \nthat is wrong; under our constitutional process the people shouldn't \naccept that and don't have to and that's why this amendment is here \nbefore us.\n  Marriage is our oldest social institution. It is older than our \nsystem of property. It is older than our system of justice. It \ncertainly predates our political institutions and our Constitution. And \nmarriage may be the most important of all these institutions because it \nrepresents the accumulated wisdom of literally hundreds of generations \nover thousands of years about how best to lay the foundation of a home \nin which we can raise and socialize our children.\n  Now it isn't always possible to raise children through marriage, and \ncertainly single parents around this country do heroic jobs nurturing \nchildren in difficult circumstances. We should give them credit and \ncertainly we should give them as much help as we can. One of the ways \nwe can do that is by affirming the social standard in favor of \ntraditional marriage, which helps create a climate within our culture \nof stability and order for our children.\n  The social scientists have figured this out too. As a result of \ndecades of accumulated data, family scientists from the fields of \nsociology, psychology and economics, have concluded children and adults \non average experience the highest level of overall well-being in the \ncontext of healthy marital relationships.\n  We know what happens when societies abandon the model of traditional \nmarriage. The Scandinavian countries legalized same-sex marriage years \nago, and the result is that fewer and fewer people in those countries \nget married at all, and more and more children are born out of wedlock. \nThat is not a good thing for their children. In short, the minimum we \ncan say is that the evidence is not even close to showing that we can \nfeel comfortable making a fundamental change in how we define marriage \nso as to include same-sex marriage within the definition.\n  The other issue at stake is who should decide these questions. The \nfirst and most basic right which our people possess is the right to \ngovern themselves.\n  The Framers thought that right was self-evident. It means that the \nonly just government is the one that derives its powers from the \nconsent of the governed. That means that every act of any governmental \nbody has to be the result of a process in which the people have, at \nsome time, consented.\n  Despite this right, some judges have decided to attempt to change the \ndefinition of marriage without reference to the will of the people.\n  Right now, nine States face lawsuits challenging traditional marriage \nlaws--California, Connecticut, Iowa, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, \nNew York, Oklahoma, and Washington. In four of those States--\nCalifornia, Maryland, New York, and Washington--trial courts have found \na right to same-sex marriage in State constitutional provisions--in \neach case relying in part on the Massachusetts decision. State supreme \ncourts are expected to decide appeals of those decisions in 2006 or \n2007.\n  And in Nebraska, a Federal district court in 2005 found \nunconstitutional a State constitutional amendment passed by 70 percent \nof Nebraska voters.\n  In short, it is clear that there is a well organized and deliberate \nmovement in this country to redefine marriage--to change our most \nfundamental social institution--without regard to the right of our \npeople to govern themselves.\n  Unless we pass a constitutional amendment, we will allow the courts \nof this country to disenfranchise tens of millions of Americans on an \nissue that is of greater importance to them on a day-to-day basis \nbecause it involves the way in which their children and other people's \nchildren are going to be raised than most of the legislation we debate \nhere.\n  If we cannot agree in this Senate on anything else, we should be able \nto agree on this: Everyone should have the right to advance their point \nof view in the legislative process on this issue; and we can trust the \ngood sense of the American people to produce the right result in the \nend.\n  The only way we can do that is by passing a constitutional amendment. \nThat is what this debate is about. That is why I will be supporting the \namendment before the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen seconds remains on the side of the \nSenator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from Missouri \nputting this forward. We will have further debate this evening from 6 \nto 6:30, and hopefully some a little later on.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the Marriage \nProtection Amendment to the Constitution. It is my fundamental belief \nthat\n\n[[Page S5474]]\n\nthe Constitution is not a document that denies rights. As a matter of \nfact, it is a document that protects those rights once earned.\n  With all the problems in the world today, the Senate is spending \nvaluable time debating a bill which we know does not have the votes for \ncloture, which is divisive and which I believe does not belong on the \nnational agenda.\n  The fact is, all family law has historically been relegated to the \nStates; that is, marriage, divorce, adoption, custody, all aspects of \nfamily law and domestic relations have been the province of the States. \nThat is what the Supreme Court has said in case after case from In Re \nBurrus in 1890 to Rose v. Rose in 1982. In that 1982 case, the court \naffirmed the holding of In Re Burrus that:\n\n       [t]he whole subject of the domestic relations of husband \n     and wife, parent and child, belongs to the laws of the \n     states, and not to the laws of the United States.\n\n  Similarly, in Sosna v. Illinois, in 1975 the Supreme Court wrote:\n\n       Domestic relations [is] an area that has long been regarded \n     as a virtually exclusive province of the States.\n\n  In 1982, then Associate Justice Rehnquist, dissenting in Santosky v. \nKramer, wrote:\n\n       The area of domestic relations . . . has been left to the \n     States from time immemorial, and not without good reason.\n\n  And just this past November, in a television interview, Justice \nStephen Breyer stated very simply:\n\n       Family law is State law.\n\n  It is clear domestic relations have been the jurisdiction of States. \nThat is where they should remain.\n  I deeply believe this Senate should not be involved in putting \namendments in the Constitution dealing with any aspect of marriage, of \ndivorce, of families, of adoption, of any of those areas. The States \nreign supreme.\n  Why is it when Republicans are all for reducing the Federal \nGovernment's impact on people's lives, until it comes to the stinging \nlitmus test issues--from gay marriage or end of life--they suddenly \nwant the Federal Government to intervene?\n  For the life of me, I don't understand why this keeps coming before \nthis Senate. It is extraordinarily difficult to pass a constitutional \namendment. We all know that. Both Houses have to pass it by a two-\nthirds vote, and then over a 7-year period it goes out to the States \nwhere it has to be ratified by three-quarters of the States. The last \nconstitutional amendment that went on to be ratified by the States was \nthe Equal Rights Amendment, a simple 25-word amendment that said:\n\n       Equal rights under the law shall not be abridged based on \n     sex.\n\n  Guess what. They were not able to get the necessary three-quarters of \nthe States over a 7-year period.\n  So I don't believe this constitutional amendment would be successful \neven if passed out of this Senate. I have not seen one passed in 13 \nyears. It is extraordinarily difficult to get one ratified.\n  Family law is, indeed, the purview of the States, so there is no need \nfor a constitutional amendment. This proposed constitutional amendment \nstrikes at the heart of States rights in the area of family law and, in \ndoing so, it actually undermines our Constitution. Moreover, I believe \nAmericans believe the States should deal with same-sex marriage as the \nStates see fit. And so do I.\n  Americans are especially concerned about amending this Constitution \nif it means closing the door on civil unions.\n  Why do I say this? How do I know this? Mr. President, 53 percent of \nAmericans polled recently would oppose a constitutional amendment that \nalso bans civil unions and domestic partnerships such as we have \nestablished in California. Many legal experts believe this amendment \nwould do just that. The language in the second sentence of the \namendment is ambiguous. It is ambiguous, at best, stating that:\n       Neither this Constitution, nor the constitution of any \n     State, shall be construed to require that marriage or the \n     legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other \n     than the union of a man and a woman.\n\n  Now, some on the other side have argued that the amendment would \nstill allow for legal unions passed by State legislatures, not just \nthose instituted by the courts. However, when similar amendments were \npassed in States such as Michigan, Ohio, and Utah, domestic violence \nlaw and health care plans for couples, both gay and straight, were \ntaken away. So we know it has an effect.\n  I believe to put this on the Constitution, if it were to prevail, if \nit were to be ratified by three-quarters of the States, it is very \nlikely all domestic partnerships and domestic unions of any civil kind \nwould be wiped out, as well. That does not make any sense at all.\n  States are well able to handle the issue of marriage on their own \nwithout the heavy hand of the Federal Government intervening in \npeople's private lives.\n  What is currently happening in States indicates to me they are, in \nfact, actively engaged on this issue. The numbers speak for themselves. \nTo date, 45 States have acted to restrict marriage to only one man and \none woman; 18 of those have done so by amending their State \nconstitutions. So why are we doing this?\n  This year, seven more states are poised to join them when they hold \nstatewide votes on a constitutional same-sex marriage ban: Alabama in \nJune, and Idaho, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia and \nWisconsin in November. In addition, at least nine other States may take \nup similar amendments in the not-so-distant future: Arizona, Colorado, \nDelaware, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, and \nPennsylvania. In fact, only one State, Massachusetts, recognizes same-\nsex marriage. One State, that is it.\n  So why all the fuss? Why is the Senate devoting its time to this \nissue when one State has taken action? I say based on the laws of this \nland that is the prerogative of that State or any other State. So there \nis no need to be considering a Federal constitutional amendment, \nparticularly when we have important global and national problems to \naddress.\n  We have an enormous deficit in this country. We do not spend much \ntime on it.\n  In Iraq, things are going from bad to worse. Just this morning we \nread about an unrelenting kidnapping campaign happening in the streets \nof Baghdad. Thousands of Iraqi citizens are being snatched from the \nstreets, 56 just yesterday, all rounded up by gunmen dressed in Iraqi \nuniforms.\n  North Korea has announced it possesses nuclear weapons. Iran is \ntrying to become a nuclear power. Stem cell research, passed by the \nHouse a year ago, still is not on the floor of the Senate.\n  Why, why, why, are we doing this now when we could be doing stem cell \nresearch, when we could possibly provide the hope for juvenile \ndiabetes, for Alzheimer's victims, for cancer victims, for spinal cord \nseverance victims?\n  As to appropriations, the Senate has not taken up and approved any of \nthe 12 appropriations bills that it must complete by the end of the \nsession, and it is already June.\n  I cannot understand why we are doing this. We have the defense \nauthorization and intelligence authorization bills. These are critical \nbills at a time when our Nation continues to be fighting in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and the global war of terror, and we have not passed these \nbills.\n  Gas prices. When I was in Los Angeles last week, it cost more than \n$3.50 a gallon to fill up a tank of gas. We have not taken steps to \ndeal with that.\n  There are dozens of critical issues, including the mandatory business \nof this Senate in 2 major authorization bills and 12 major \nappropriations bills that we have not addressed, and 45 States have \ntaken action. Yet this Senate seems pressed to defend the Nation, to \namend the Constitution, to provide something which is within the \npurview of the States and which the States are handling.\n  To me, it makes no sense other than this is an election year. It \nmakes no sense other than throwing red meat to a certain constituency. \nIt certainly is not what the Constitution of the United States is all \nabout.\n  I hope we will vote no on cloture. I hope we will return to business \nthat is important to the American people. I do not believe this issue \nmerits the time of this Senate at this time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I listen to the debate over this \nconstitutional amendment, I am struck by the\n\n[[Page S5475]]\n\ncircular and contradictory arguments offered by some supporters of this \nmeasure. It is clear even to a casual listener that the arguments from \nsome proponents of this effort to use the Constitution to restrict \nindividual freedom for the first time ever actually make the case for \nwhy there is no necessity for it. They must acknowledge that the \nFederal Defense of Marriage Act remains on the books and has been \nupheld by every Federal court that has considered it, including the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals. Their talking points proclaim that 45 \nStates already passed legislation or contain provisions in their State \nconstitutions that define marriage as a union between a man and a \nwoman. They point out that 19 States have in the last 10 years passed \nreferendums to amend their State constitutions and that decisive \nmajorities approved a definition of marriage. These arguments beg the \nquestion as to why we are spending several days of a waning session on \nan amendment that is not only divisive but also unnecessary.\n  To propose a constitutional amendment, two-thirds of each House of \nCongress must ``deem it necessary.'' That is the constitutional \nstandard for proposing a constitutional amendment. How, in light of \nthis record, could Senators who value individual liberty, respect the \nStates, and understand the Constitution vote any way other than against \nproceeding to this measure?\n  The Constitution is not some all-purpose bulletin board on which to \nhang political posters or to post bumper stickers. Our Constitution is \nthe foundation of our rights and freedoms. The Bill of Rights, the \nfirst 10 amendments to the Constitution, were adopted to ensure limits \non the Government and to protect the liberties of Americans. Vermont \ndid not and would not become a State until 1791, the year the Bill of \nRights was ratified. The structure of the Constitution, with its \nseparation of powers and checks and balances, was designed by the \nFounders to protect our rights.\n  Sadly, the Bush-Cheney administration, with the acquiescence of a \nRepublican Congress, has done much to remove those protections to the \ndetriment of the rights of all Americans. In this regard, I note the \nrecent report of the CATO Institute entitled, ``Power Surge: The \nConstitutional Record of George W. Bush.'' This report criticizes this \nadministration for not upholding the text, history, and structure of \nthe Constitution and recognizing the limits on Presidential power.\n  As congressional Republicans have returned time and again to use \nconstitutional amendments as election year rallying cries to excite the \npassions of some voters, those in Congress who respect the Constitution \nand honor our oath of office to ``support and defend the Constitution \nof the United States'' are cast in the unpopular role of seeking to \nconserve the Constitution and constitutional principles in the face of \ndemagogic proposals.\n  Several years ago a bipartisan group was formed to inject some reason \ninto these debates. The Constitution Project has worked long and hard \nto develop guidelines for when constitutional amendments are \nappropriate. They have noted: ``The Founders created a Constitution \nthat is difficult to amend, thus insuring a stable constitutional \nstructure. In The Federalist No. 47, James Madison highlighted this \nvery point. He argued that the Constitution should only be altered on \n`great and extraordinary occasions.' '' Proponents have not shown how \nthis proposal meets those sensible guidelines, nor could they.\n  Recently, the CATO Institute and the Center for American Progress \njointly held a symposium lending further support to rejecting this \nproposed amendment for a variety of reasons from across a wide spectrum \nof opinion.\n  All this raises the obvious question why this is the Republican \nleadership's priority in the face of an unfinished agenda of \nlegislative matters that deeply concern Americans, ranging from \nescalating gas prices and health care costs to the ongoing violence in \nIraq to homeland security. While the news articles and editorials \ncharacterizing this effort as crassly political are too numerous to \ninclude in the Record, I do ask consent to include a few that are \nrepresentative. I ask that copies of the USA Today editorial from June \n1, 2006, the New York Times editorials of June 5 and June 1, 2006, and \nthe Washington Post editorial of May 24, 2006, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From USA Today, June 1, 2006]\n\n                          Just Say ``I Don't''\n\n       Apparently, issues such as immigration, corruption, gas \n     prices, the budget deficit, the war in Iraq and the prospect \n     of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons aren't substantial enough \n     to occupy members of Congress.\n       When senators return from their Memorial Day recess next \n     week, their thoughts will turn to June weddings. They plan to \n     spend their time on a bitter, divisive and unnecessary debate \n     over a proposed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.\n       Even supporters of the Marriage Protection Amendment \n     readily concede that the measure to ban same-sex marriage \n     nationwide has virtually no chance of becoming part of the \n     Constitution. (It would need approval from two-thirds of both \n     chambers of Congress, plus ratification by three-fourths of \n     the states.)\n       So why bother?\n       Well, Election Day is a few months off. Supporters hope the \n     controversy will energize their base of social and religious \n     conservatives opposed to same-sex marriage.\n       Their plan could well backfire. Polls show that Americans \n     are evenly divided about the amendment. Religious activist \n     groups are annoyed that President Bush, who supports the \n     amendment, isn't lobbying hard enough for it.\n       At the same time, the 31 Republican sponsors risk \n     alienating moderate and independent voters who are turned off \n     by the pandering for a futile effort that will further divide \n     the nation.\n       The gay-marriage issue exploded when Massachusetts' highest \n     court ruled in November 2003 that same-sex couples have a \n     right to marry. Since then, more than 7,300 gay couples there \n     have done so. The commonwealth has survived.\n       But the public backlash elsewhere has been strong. Nineteen \n     states have amended their constitutions to ban gay marriage. \n     Most other states prohibit it as well.\n       The state activity makes the proposed constitutional \n     amendment all the more unnecessary. It would take away the \n     traditional authority of states to regulate marriage and \n     impose a one-size-fits-all edict on a nation still grappling \n     with the issue.\n       Most partisan drives to write social policy into our \n     enduring Constitution have, fortunately, failed. The \n     prohibition of alcohol was such a disaster that it was \n     repealed 14 years later. The Framers purposely made it \n     difficult to amend the Constitution so that intense passions \n     of the day wouldn't lead to laws that might last forever.\n       Supporters of the amendment trumpet the need to protect the \n     ``sanctity'' of marriage. But preserving the authority of \n     states to decide how to handle same-sex unions--whether \n     through marriage or some domestic partnership or civil union \n     law that protects the basic financial, health and legal \n     rights that heterosexual couples take for granted--doesn't \n     affect anyone else's marriage. And the 1996 federal Defense \n     of Marriage Act already says states may refuse to recognize \n     same-sex marriages performed in other states.\n       The proposed amendment would squelch the important debate \n     going on at the state level and poison political dialogue. It \n     should be jilted and left at the altar.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 5, 2006]\n\n                     Divide and Conquer the Voters\n\n       President Bush devoted his Saturday radio speech to a \n     cynical boost for a constitutional amendment banning gay \n     marriage, It was depressing in the extreme to hear the chief \n     executive trying to pretend, at this moment in American \n     history, that this was a critical priority.\n       Mr. Bush's central point was that the nation is under siege \n     from ``activist judges'' who are striking down anti-gay-\n     marriage laws that conflict with their own state \n     constitutions. That's their job, just as it is the job of \n     state legislators to either fix the laws or change their \n     constitutions.\n       If there's anything the country should have learned over \n     the past five years, it is that Mr. Bush and his supporters \n     have no problem with judicial decisions, no matter how \n     cutting edge, that endorse their political positions. They \n     trot out the ``activist judge'' threat only when they're \n     worried about getting out their base on Election Day.\n       The aim of the president's radio address--which darkly \n     warned that Massachusetts and San Francisco (nudge, nudge) \n     are going to destroy marriage--is the same as the Republican \n     leadership's plans to trot out one cultural hot button after \n     another in the coming weeks. After gay marriage comes the \n     push for a constitutional ban on flag burning, a solution in \n     search of a problem if there ever was one.\n       All this effort to divert the nation's attention to issues \n     that divide and distract would be bad enough if the country \n     were not facing real, disastrous problems at home and abroad. \n     But then, if that weren't the case, Mr. Bush probably \n     wouldn't feel moved to stoop so low.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 1, 2006]\n\n                      On the Low Road to November\n\n       Republicans are trying to rally their far-right base for \n     the fall elections with a mean-\n\n[[Page S5476]]\n\n     spirited sideshow threatening to the Constitution: a ban on \n     same-sex marriage.\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee has endorsed the amendment, \n     which would write bigotry into the nation's charter, by a 10-\n     to-8 vote along party lines, and the full Senate is expected \n     to take it up soon. Since the measure's language covers not \n     only marriage but the ``legal incidents'' of marriage, its \n     approval could jeopardize civil unions, domestic partnerships \n     and other legal protections that many state and local \n     governments now provide for same-sex couples and their \n     children.\n       No one, including the G.O.P. strategists urging it's fast-\n     tracking, expects the amendment to get the two-thirds \n     Congressional approval needed to send it to the states for \n     consideration. Two years ago, when Republicans staged a \n     Senate vote on the same dismal amendment just before the \n     Democratic convention, it ran into unexpectedly broad \n     opposition. Some conservatives correctly opposed grabbing \n     power from the states by suddenly federalizing marriage law. \n     Supporters of the amendment could muster only 48 votes, well \n     shy of the 60 required to cut off debate and avoid a \n     filibuster.\n       Plainly, the real purpose of this rerun is to provide red \n     meat to social conservatives, and fodder for commercials \n     aimed at senators who vote to block the atrocious amendment.\n       It is sad that Senator Arlen Specter, the Republican \n     chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who personally opposes \n     the measure, chose to lend his gavel and vote to speed it to \n     the floor. He got angry when Senator Russell Feingold, the \n     Wisconsin Democrat, objected in forceful terms to both the \n     amendment and the politically motivated scheduling. Mr. \n     Specter and the other members of his committee who approved \n     the amendment have no reason to be angry--just ashamed.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 24, 2006]\n\n  Running Against Gays; As an Election Approaches, Can a Vote to Ban \n                    Same-Sex Marriage Be Far Behind?\n\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee last week churned out a \n     transparent effort to energize the restive Republican \n     electoral base by picking on gays and lesbians. It reported, \n     on a 10 to 8 vote along party lines, a federal constitutional \n     amendment stating that ``Marriage in the United States shall \n     consist only of the union of a man and a woman''; the \n     amendment would prevent federal and state constitutions alike \n     from being ``construed to require that marriage or the legal \n     incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other than the \n     union of a man and a woman,'' Senate Republican leaders are \n     determined to promptly bring up the resolution on the floor, \n     though it has no chance of passage. Its purpose, at this \n     stage anyway, is simply to make a statement--of solidarity \n     with socially conservative voters, of hostility toward \n     marriage equality for gays and lesbians, and of contempt for \n     state governments that might choose to move toward a more \n     inclusive conception of marriage.\n       Senators will indeed make an important statement with their \n     votes on this amendment--just not about the ``sanctity of \n     marriage,'' The vote, rather, will tally each member's \n     willingness to deform the U.S. Constitution.\n       On the merits, there is simply no case for an amendment \n     that would write into the Constitution an express command to \n     every state and federal official to discriminate against a \n     class of people. Marriage has always been a state matter in \n     the American system, and nothing about the advent of gay \n     marriage in a single state should change that. Opponents of \n     same-sex marriage outside of Massachusetts have no cause for \n     complaint. What goes on in that state doesn't concern them, \n     and they have shown themselves perfectly capable of \n     organizing in many other states to nip marriage rights for \n     same-sex couples in the bud. What's more, federal law already \n     guarantees that no state need recognize same-sex marriages \n     performed in any other. So the only purpose of a federal \n     amendment would be to prevent states that wish to move toward \n     marriage equality from doing so. Even within Massachusetts, \n     where opposition to same-sex marriage is hardly overwhelming, \n     the experiment with it will not succeed if a majority of \n     citizens over time believe strongly that the decision by the \n     state's high court creating marriage equality should be \n     overturned.\n       What exactly is the problem that requires upsetting 200 \n     years of constitutional norms? The question answers itself.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when we began this debate on Monday \nafternoon I referred to the important discussion that occurred in \nVermont several years ago. In that statement I referred to the \nextraordinary example set of Senator Robert Stafford. I will ask that \nthe Rutland Herald editorial from November 2, 2000, entitled \n``Stafford's Gift,'' be printed in the Record. This editorial \nmemorializes the bipartisan call for respect and tolerance to which \nVermonters responded. Senator Jeffords and I were honored to join \nSenator Stafford in rejecting vitriolic attacks during Vermont's \nexperience with this debate. The Rutland Herald's series of civil \neditorials that examined these issues during Vermont's debate earned \nthe Pulitzer Prize for the newspaper and its editorial page editor, \nDavid Moats.\n  The fairness and equality that resulted from passage of Vermont's \ncivil union law has not threatened the marriages of the Green Mountain \nState or any other State in this country. It has not led to the parade \nof horribles threatened by the proponents of this divisive \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Recently, I was contacted by a number of physicians in Vermont who \nvoiced their strong opposition to the constitutional amendment that we \nare debating. These pediatricians are concerned that the proposed \namendment will deprive children ``of the benefits of both parents being \nable to provide health insurance, take time off from work to care for \ntheir children, authorize medical care, or stay with their children in \nthe hospital.'' I will ask that their letter be printed in the Record.\n  Hundreds of thousands of American children are being raised by \ncommitted same-sex couples. I am gravely concerned that the so-called \nMarriage Protection Amendment would prevent States from providing \nbenefits and protections to these dedicated parents and their families.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include two recent editorials opposing the \nproposed amendment from the Brattleboro Reformer from May 24, 2006, and \nthe Rutland Herald from June 6, 2006, in addition to the aforementioned \nmaterials.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Rutland Herald, Nov. 2, 2000]\n\n                            Stafford's Gift\n\n       Robert Stafford was never a politician who wore his heart \n     on his sleeve. He served Vermont with distinction over five \n     decades, beginning as Rutland County state's attorney, later \n     becoming governor of Vermont and later U.S. senator.\n       He is now 87 years old, and he lives in Rutland Town. \n     During his career he focused on getting the job done, and \n     millions of Americans who are able to use Stafford loans to \n     finance their higher education have Robert Stafford to thank.\n       So when Stafford came forward on Tuesday to speak about the \n     climate of intolerance that has arisen during the present \n     election campaign, it was because he was moved by a profound \n     conviction. He was not alone. Sens. Patrick Leahy and James \n     Jeffords and Rep. Bernard Sanders were with him to request a \n     return to the atmosphere of respect that has traditionally \n     characterized the state of Vermont.\n       Stafford described his marriage of many years to his wife, \n     Helen, and of the love they have shared. ``I believe that \n     love is one of the great forces in our society and in the \n     state of Vermont,'' he said. ``And everyone in this country \n     is better off living in a society based on love.''\n       The civil union law has confronted many Vermonters with the \n     reality that gay and lesbian couples also share love. That \n     reality prompted a question from Stafford: ``If a same-sex \n     couple unites with true love,'' he said, ``what is the harm \n     in that? What is the harm?''\n       Conscientious people disagree on the moral questions \n     surrounding homosexuality and civil unions. The point is not \n     that everyone should agree; it is seldom the case that \n     everyone will agree on any issue.\n       The important distinction is between those who disagree \n     with civil unions and those who take their disagreement a \n     step further, using offensive language, shouting down \n     opponents, and employing tactics of character assassination \n     like those being used in Chittenden County.\n       Disagreement must be respected. But when disagreement turns \n     into denigration, it creates the atmosphere that Stafford, \n     Leahy, Jeffords, and Sanders came to Rutland to deplore.\n       Stafford and Jeffords are the two senior Republican leaders \n     in the state, and it is good that leading Republicans have \n     chosen to speak up about the extremism that has tarred the \n     debate over civil unions. If the Republicans intend to help \n     heal the wounds caused by the bigotry of a few, they have to \n     be willing to distance themselves from some of the attacks \n     that are made in their name.\n       Jeffords had harsh words for the ``tone of intolerance and \n     hate'' this year. And he spoke of the need for respect. \n     ``When individuals with narrow minds seek to vilify public \n     servants in the name of religion, it's time to take a step \n     back.''\n       A flier distributed by a religious group in Chittenden \n     County warned that because of the civil union law, Vermont \n     would become ``a San Francisco-like rural haven.''\n       Leahy called such fears ``vitrolic nonsense.''\n       The issue inevitably comes back to Stafford's point, which \n     asks us to look at the reality of human relationships. In \n     homosexual relations, just as in heterosexual relations, \n     there are respectful, loving relationships, and there are \n     relationships that are less.\n       And as Stafford said, in simple, heartfelt language, when \n     it comes to love, what is the harm?\n\n[[Page S5477]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                     Pro-Family Pediatricians,\n\n                                Burlington, Vermont, June 5, 2006.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Jeffords: As Vermont pediatricians \n     dedicated to the care of infants, children, adolescents, and \n     young adults, we strongly urge you to oppose amending the \n     Constitution to forever deny gay and lesbian couples and \n     their children the same protections available to other \n     families. A discriminatory constitutional amendment would \n     have a particularly severe impact on the health and security \n     of the hundreds of thousands of children whose parents are \n     same-sex couples.\n       On a daily basis, we care for sick children in the context \n     of their families. Children deserve all the love, care, and \n     emotional and financial security their families can provide. \n     Any constitutional amendment that throws obstacles in the way \n     of two parents being able to provide the full measure of \n     security for their children that the law allows is clearly \n     not in the best interest of children. The best result for \n     children is the defeat of the Federal Marriage Amendment.\n       As demonstrated by census and other data, there are \n     literally hundreds of thousands of children whose parents are \n     gay or lesbian couples. According to the 2000 census, same-\n     sex couples are raising children in at least 96 percent of \n     all counties in the U.S. These children go to school, play in \n     sports, sing in choirs, go to worship services, play at the \n     beach, get hugs from their parents and grandparents--and get \n     sick--just like children of opposite-sex couples or single \n     parents. And when these children are sick, their parents come \n     to doctor visits together, take time off from work to stay \n     home with the sick child, worry about paying the medical \n     bills, and if serious enough, stay at the hospital together \n     with their child, take turns holding an oxygen mask or \n     meeting with doctors and nurses.\n       Whether the problem is as medically simple as a bad cold or \n     a broken finger or as serious as leukemia or a life-\n     threatening heart condition, a child's illness or injury \n     strains both the child and his or her parents. No parents who \n     are already under the emotional stress of caring for their \n     sick or injured child should also have to worry about whether \n     the Constitution will deprive their child of the benefits of \n     both parents being able to provide health insurance, take \n     time off from work to care for their child, authorize medical \n     care, or stay with their child in the hospital. Adding to the \n     worries of already strained parents is simply wrong.\n       The American Academy of Pediatrics has found that ``a \n     considerable body of professional literature provides \n     evidence that children with parents who are homosexual can \n     have the same advantages and the same expectations for \n     health, adjustment, and development as can children whose \n     parents are heterosexual. When two adults participate in \n     parenting a child, they and the child deserve the serenity \n     that comes with legal recognition.''\n       We urge you to find ways to make the lives of all children \n     happier, healthier, and safer. There are lots of good ideas, \n     and good legislation, to meet these goals. But the Federal \n     Marriage Amendment will do the opposite. It will make the \n     lives of children more difficult and make the assurance of \n     the best health care a broken promise. We strongly urge you \n     to protect children by defeating the Federal Marriage \n     Amendment.\n           Very truly yours,\n       Dr. Garrick Applebee, Attending Physician, Vermont \n     Children's Hospital, Burlington, Vermont.\n       Dr. Wendy S.

They have begun threatening the \n     Republicans that they will stay home in November if progress \n     is not made on banning abortion, same-sex marriage and flag \n     burning.\n       A poll conducted in March by four groups representing \n     evangelical Christians found that 63 percent of so-called \n     ``values voters''--the evangelicals who oppose abortion and \n     same-sex marriage--believe that, in the words of the poll, \n     ``Congress has not kept its promises to act on a pro-family \n     agenda.''\n       So, between now and November, you can expect to see these \n     ``values'' issues trotted out by Republicans in Congress to \n     convince the religious right they are still on their side.\n       It's not like the GOP has anything else to run on. They \n     can't run on national security, not with Iraq in a bloody \n     civil war. They can't run on ethics, not with the growing \n     list of indictments filed against GOP members of Congress. \n     They can't run on the economy, not with $3 a gallon gasoline, \n     rising interest rates and stagnant wage growth.\n       No, all they have left is the hope that voter turnout will \n     be low and the most extreme members of their constituency \n     will show up to vote.\n       Mid-term elections are usually decided by turnout, and \n     usually only the most motivated voters from each party show \n     up on Election Day. While pandering to religious extremists \n     may seem like a smart short-term strategy, in the long term, \n     it alienates the rest of the population.\n       Given the bigger issues facing this nation--out-of-control \n     energy and health care costs, the criminally slow response to \n     the Gulf Coast's plight after Katrina, the lack of an exit \n     strategy from Iraq, the threat of another war in Iran and a \n     president who shows no respect for the rule of law--arguing \n     about flag burning and gay marriage is ridiculous.\n       But that's the legislative agenda that the Republicans are \n     working on. Even though the gay marriage ban has no chance of \n     receiving the required two-thirds majority which will move \n     the proposed amendment to the states to ratify, the goal is \n     to get both houses to vote on it next month. Likewise for \n     flag burning and more restrictions on abortions.\n       In short, the GOP would rather devote its energies to \n     pointless and divisive legislation than address the real \n     problems facing the nation.\n       We do not think this is not going to work this November.\n       As weapons, the powers of fear and divisiveness, the two \n     biggest guns in the GOP arsenal, are no longer as powerful as \n     they were in 2002 or 2004. More and more Americans, liberals \n     and conservatives alike, are on to the Republican game. This \n     growing awareness that the GOP has nothing going for it other \n     than fear and divisiveness may lead to big victories for \n     Democrats in November. And Republicans will only have \n     themselves to blame.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Rutland (VT) Herald, June 6, 2006]\n\n                           The Bully's Pulpit\n\n       George Bush is a bully and a coward.\n       How else to explain this weekend's performance by the \n     president, who used his weekly radio address to push for a \n     constitutional amendment banning gay marriage?\n       His cowardice is long established, from using his family's \n     influence to duck military service during Vietnam to hiding \n     behind underlings while in the Oval Office. He's never seen a \n     fair fight he can't run from or pay someone else to fight for \n     him.\n       Now he's beaten down in the polls, with both his foreign \n     and domestic policy initiatives in tatters, already a lame \n     duck and staring at a legacy as a war president during a \n     losing fight. His next-best shot at being remembered by \n     history is as the president who single-handedly bankrupted \n     the country, going from a surplus to record deficits almost \n     overnight.\n       So what did Bush do? What any schoolyard bully does when \n     they feel threatened: He picked on someone he perceives as an \n     easy target.\n       In this case, the target is gay marriage. While the country \n     is generally more accepting of homosexuals than it was a \n     generation ago, there is still a taboo against using the word \n     marriage to define homosexual relationships.\n       The GOP used the same gay-bashing tactic to get out the \n     vote in the last election, and their strategists are clearly \n     banking on a repeat performance to revitalize support for the \n     president, and for the party headed into\n\n[[Page S5478]]\n\n     the fall elections. Bill Frist, the Senate majority leader, \n     claimed an amendment is needed to protect the other 49 states \n     from Massachusetts' recognition of gay marriage in an opinion \n     piece released over the weekend.\n       Oddly, the tactic may backfire on the GOP. While the states \n     that have voted on defining marriage as the union of a man \n     and a woman have been unanimous in supporting the measures, \n     using the Constitution as a tool must strike many as a large, \n     blunt instrument.\n       Amending the Constitution is not easy; it is not meant to \n     be so. That choice by the framers, reinforced through the \n     centuries, makes rational people pull back from cheap \n     grandstanding with this nation's most-cherished document. And \n     the latest move is nothing if not a grandstand play.\n       In fact, true conservatives may find themselves in conflict \n     over whether cheapening the importance of a constitutional \n     amendment is too steep a price to pay, seeing as the country \n     already has the Defense of Marriage Act, which already does \n     what the amendment promises. And they must despair at seeing \n     a raid on states' rights, a conservative touchstone.\n       But surely, surely the move must backfire in Vermont. Any \n     candidate who does not immediately and publicly renounce a \n     constitutional amendment against gay marriage will alienate \n     the state's open-minded middle of the road, as well as its \n     substantial liberal population. But any candidate who opposes \n     the amendment will alienate the right wing of the Republican \n     Party. So Bush and Frist have put moderates into a tough \n     spot.\n       Regardless, it is time for Vermont's candidates in this \n     fall's election to stand up and be counted on the issue. No \n     ducking or excuses, please.\n       Martha Rainville and Richard Tarrant are running as \n     moderate Republicans; it is their party's leadership that has \n     put the issue on the table; it is their time to speak. They \n     both say they are independent thinkers in the Vermont \n     tradition, who will not simply repeat the party line.\n       Now they can prove that claim or they can follow the lead \n     of their boss, the coward. It's a clear, if not simple, \n     choice.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise tonight as a cosponsor and a strong \nsupporter of the Marriage Protection Amendment before the Senate.\n  If you had told me 10 years ago, or even 5 years ago, that I would be \nstanding before the Senate advocating a constitutional amendment that \ndefines marriage as a union between a man and a woman, I would have \nthought you had lost your mind. Why in the world would you ever need to \ndo that, I would have asked? Doesn't it go without saying that men and \nwomen get married? Yet tonight I do stand in the Senate advocating a \nconstitutional amendment that defines marriage as a union between a man \nand a woman, nothing else. What was once thought preposterous is now \nreality. We are faced with this new reality because activist judges \nthroughout the Nation have decided to redefine marriage.\n  The courts, not the people, not the States, are redefining a \nfundamental institution of our society, the very foundation of our \ncivilization.\n  Ironically, this new definition of marriage runs contrary to what a \nmajority of Americans believe. In fact, 45 of the 50 States have either \na State constitutional amendment or a statute defining marriage as the \nunion between a man and a woman, nothing else. On average, those \nmeasures have passed with more than 70 percent of the voters' support.\n  Today, the voters in my home State of Alabama--and we will know the \noutcome later tonight--will vote on a State constitutional amendment \nregarding marriage. I think I know what the outcome will be in my \nState. Regardless, no judge should be able to impose his or her will on \nAlabama or any other State if the voters have decided otherwise.\n  What appears to be a broad consensus throughout the country for \nprotecting the institution of marriage is being undermined and \nredefined by activist judges. These judges have struck down numerous \nState laws intended to protect the traditional definition of marriage. \nState courts in California, Georgia, Maryland, New York, and Washington \nhave overturned laws or amendments protecting marriage, and a Federal \njudge in Nebraska invalidated a State amendment prohibiting same-sex \nmarriage.\n  I have long thought that it was the role of the judiciary to \ninterpret the law, not make the law. However, these activist judges \nacross the country have taken it upon themselves to make laws that, in \nmany cases, redefine the definition of marriage. These judges have \ntaken it upon themselves to make decisions reserved for State \nlegislatures who have worked to be responsive to their constituencies \nand to define marriage in the traditional sense. The difference is that \nthese activist judges do not have to be responsive to anyone and are \naccountable to no one.\n  Abraham Lincoln reminded us in the Gettysburg Address that we have a \ngovernment of the people, by the people, and for the people. Activist \njudges, accountable to no one, should not be allowed to govern this \ncountry. The basic foundation of our Constitution does not invest total \ncontrol in the judiciary. It is not government by the judiciary; \nrather, it is a government by the people. On this issue, the people \nhave spoken and will speak again.\n  Activist judges should not be permitted to redefine the sacred bond \nof marriage. For generations, humanity has defined marriage as the \nunion between a man and a woman upon which families are built. It is \nthe institution of marriage upon which our society has flourished.\n  Mr. President, States, in my judgment, must be allowed to continue to \nexercise their will. States that pass laws on constitutional amendments \nshould not be overridden by an overactive judiciary that believes it \nhas the power to redefine the moral character upon which our Nation was \nbuilt. I believe the President recently summed it up when he said:\n\n       The union of a man and a woman in marriage is the most \n     enduring and important human institution. For ages, in every \n     culture, human beings have understood that marriage is \n     critical to the well-being of families. And because families \n     pass along values and shape character, marriage is also \n     critical to the health of society. Our policies should aim to \n     strengthen families, not undermine them. And changing the \n     definition of marriage would undermine the family structure.\n\n  Therefore, tonight I stand before you in strong support of this \nconstitutional amendment to define marriage as a union between a man \nand a woman.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama for \nhis support for the marriage amendment. I note, as he knows, that \nAlabama is voting on this very day on this subject. I feel confident \nthat it, along with the other 19 States--this will make 20--will \nsupport marriage as a union between a man and a woman.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I believe that is going to happen today.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If it doesn't----\n  Mr. SHELBY. Oh, it will.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. That is another indication that 20 States have \ndirectly voted on this issue. If we would have Senators who follow what \nthe States have done, we would have 90 votes for a constitutional \namendment to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman. I \nthank my colleague for his strong support. I believe the people of \nAlabama are going to do it today as well.\n  I have another colleague who will be speaking shortly. In the \ninterim, I want to develop an argument that has been put forward but I \nthink is an important one to further raise and develop. It is one I \nhave mentioned previously on religious freedom. We have the article \nthat has been mentioned by several by Maggie Gallagher on why Catholic \nCharities was run out of Boston because they didn't support homosexual \nadoptions. Rather than breaking one of the tenets of their faith, they \nsaid we can no longer do adoptions. There is an argument that churches \nthat do not perform same-sex unions will not be allowed to perform any \nmarriages. I think this bears looking at because it is a serious issue \nthat has a legal history and pedigree to it. It is one we should be \nconcerned about taking place.\n  I was in a church last Saturday night. My oldest daughter was the \nmaid of honor in a wedding. It was a beautiful ceremony. That church \nhas a very clear conviction that marriage is between a man and a woman. \nThey\n\n[[Page S5479]]\n\nwould not agree to doing marriages between same-sex couples. Then does \nthat mean that they cannot perform any marriages? OK, some say it is \ntoo strong of an argument. Yet you have that history in the adoption \nfield, and you have a legal pedigree that is there to develop on top of \nthat. I think that bears watching.\n\n  There is another argument I want to further develop while my \ncolleagues are coming to the floor; that is, this one on ``slippery \nslope.'' People say this is one that isn't going to happen. It is not \ngoing to develop. Yet I think the legal pedigree is there for a \nslippery slope to develop. Some will be recognizing different groups \nthat have stepped forward already to say that if two people of the same \nsex can be married, why can't there be additional people? What is the \nlegal bias against having more than two people in a marital \narrangement? This even has a term now, polyamorist. They have already \nhad one court case trying to gain recognition for a marriage of a woman \nand two men. They say in some of their advocacy that they are waiting \nfor same-sex marriage to pass to begin agitation to legalize more than \ntwo people getting married.\n  If you think that is not going to happen, you had the minority \nopinion in the Supreme Court case that recognized that, what is your \nlegal basis of stopping that, too, if it can be two men or two women? \nWhy is it only two? That is what this group is starting to agitate for. \nThey are saying that granting same-sex marriage is supported on equal \nprotection grounds. How is the court going to deny them? There are \nplenty of polyamorists out there.\n  The problem goes further. We have an advocacy group called the \nAlternatives to Marriage Project which supports polyamory and other \ninnovations to parental cohabitation. The Alternatives to Marriage \nProject is quoted frequently in the mainstream media. Believe it or \nnot, some of the most powerful factions of family law scholars in the \nlaw schools favor legal recognition of both polyamory and parental \ncohabitation. Even law review articles have been published advocating \nfor both. Again, they argue that if two men can get married and two \nwomen can get married, if this is an equal protection argument, why is \nit limited to just two? What is the legal basis or foundational basis \nin society for this?\n  I raise that as a point because this area of law is starting to \ndevelop. Even the influential American Law Institute came out with \nproposals that would grant nearly equal recognition to cohabitation. So \nthis is developing in the law.\n  I raise these items as issues knowing that some people will scoff at \nit. You can look at what happened in the world in the past year or so \nas well. Sweden passed the first same-sex partnership plan in the world \nand had serious proposals floated by parties on the left to abolish \nmarriage and legalize multipartner unions. So this is out there and it \nis one of those things we should watch.\n  My colleague from Alabama has arrived. I yield the floor to him for \nhis comments on the constitutional amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Brownback. He is such a \nchampion on this issue and has raised so many important matters for us \nto think about. I believe the debate we are having is a very important \ndebate. I remember the hearings we had in the Judiciary Committee. The \nSenator had several--I believe he had one in the Commerce Committee \nmaybe, and I had one in the Judiciary Committee on marriage.\n  One of the things we found was that almost every category of \nindividual character and wellness was better if you were married. That \nis just the way it was. You had a longer lifespan, you ended up with \nmore wealth, you had better health, you were happier, and there was \nless drug use, less criminality, and less suicide. All of those things \nare so taken for granted in the committed, historic marriage \nrelationship.\n  I believe this issue is an important one that is before us. I want to \nshare a few thoughts on the matter that deals with certain issues that \nare important to me, which I think are important. We are not here, let \nme say, first of all, because of some band of Christian conservatives. \nIndeed, virtually every religious organization in America cares about \nthis issue. It is not that we wanted to enter into some sort of \nargument with the gay community or with those who favor same-sex \nmarriage. We are not here because of a political agenda.\n  Traditional mainstream Americans were going about their business when \ncourts began a pattern of rulings that subverted democratic principles \non the long held meaning of marriage. As the cases and lawsuits have \nmounted and scholars reviewed the opinions and pondered their \nimplications, it became clear that this activist movement was bold and \nfar reaching in scope. Their design was to effect a complete change in \nthe meaning of marriage, altering an institution that is thousands of \nyears old. The lawyers who filed these cases had a simple plan: They \nwould file a lawsuit attacking the traditional definition of marriage \nas a union between a man and a woman. They would urge the courts to \ndeclare, based on some subjective constitutional theory such as \nevolving standards of decency, that the Constitution of the United \nStates--they sought to have the courts declare that the Constitution of \nthe State or the United States requires that marriage be redefined to \ninclude same-sex marriage.\n  When the people complained about this usurpation, what did you hear \nback from those who promote these ideas?\n  They all lift their noses and respond: ``All we are doing is being \nfaithful to the Constitution. Don't you respect the Constitution? We \nknow you have deeply held beliefs, and we understand that, but we all \nmust yield to the requirements of the Constitution, don't you know?''\n  That is kind of the feedback we get on this issue. But the American \npeople are not so easily fooled. They chose not to go quietly this \ntime. They have chosen to fight, and it is going to be a long battle. \nAnd well they should have made that decision since the question here \nraises the nature of marriage and the usurpation of judicial power to \neffect a political or social agenda, which are matters that go to the \nheart of this Republic and our governing structure.\n  So let's make some things clear. One, those who believe in the \ntraditional definition of marriage did not start this fight. The debate \nis not a distraction from important issues; it is an important issue. \nIt is not about wedge politics.\n  Let me state the plain truth. We are here debating this issue because \nthere has been a deliberate and sustained effort by leftists in America \nto alter the definition of marriage to include a union of two men or a \nunion of two women. This action has been, to some degree, successful, \nas shown by rulings in a number of important cases. So the matter is \nreal. It is not a theoretical matter; it is very real, right now.\n  I do not agree with these changes in marriage. I favor the \ntraditional approach for many reasons. More importantly, the American \npeople overwhelmingly oppose this idea. There has been no support in \nthe Senate, no support in the House of Representatives or the State \nlegislatures for such actions. This new marriage concept has been \nrejected by legislative branches all over the Nation and has been \nrejected in, I think, 19 statewide votes, averaging about 70 percent \neach time.\n  These social activists have always known they have no chance to get \nelected officials to adopt their concept of marriage. It will not be \nvoted in. So they have looked through the Constitution and decided \ntheir goal could only be achieved by arguing before activist judges \nthat denying same-sex couples the right to marry is a denial of the \nconstitutional guarantee of due process or equal protection or ideas \nsuch as that.\n  The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts flatly agreed with those \nlawyers. This court declared that the constitution of Massachusetts, \nadopted in 1780, requires that same-sex unions be given the same \nrecognition as a union of a man and a woman. They found that a \nconstitutional requirement. This is activism, pure and simple. It is \nthe very definition of activism.\n  The drafters of that constitution in 1780 would never have imagined \ntheir\n\n[[Page S5480]]\n\nconstitution would some day be so twisted. The Massachusetts Supreme \nJudicial Court plainly reached, I believe, a political, social, and \ncultural conclusion about homosexual unions. And they took language out \nof their State constitution that was never, ever crafted, designed, or \nexpected to cover such a situation as this, and they just declared that \nthe long established concept of marriage violated the constitution of \nMassachusetts. They just did it. These judges don't have to stand for \nelection--certainly Federal judges do not--and they are not accountable \nto the American people. If judges do not show their personal restraint, \nmodesty, and fidelity to the Constitution--whether or not they like the \nConstitution--then democracy is thwarted. So this is no small matter, I \nsay to my colleagues.\n  Some will argue that the problem is a problem for Massachusetts only \nand that each State can decide these issues. But the U.S. Constitution \nprovides that every State must give full faith and credit to the \nmarriages of another State. In other words, the U.S. Constitution \nordinarily requires that each State must recognize the marriages of \nother States.\n  But what about DOMA? We passed DOMA, the Federal Defense of Marriage \nAct, in this Congress a number of years ago. It was passed to deal with \nwhat was perceived as a problem a decade or so ago. Didn't DOMA fix the \nproblem?\n  The simple answer is no. To understand why, let's look at the Supreme \nCourt's ruling in Lawrence v. Texas. I was attorney general of the \nState of Alabama. This deals with one of the things you do as an \nattorney general of a State: you defend the laws of that State when \nthey are challenged in the Supreme Court of the United States. So I can \nidentify with Texas in this matter.\n  Without regard to established law, the Supreme Court reversed their \nown opinion on a very similar case in Georgia just 17 years earlier and \nfollowed a new vision of social justice, masquerading, I suggest, as \nconstitutional law. In Lawrence v. Texas, the Supreme Court reversed \ntheir opinion in Bowers v. Hardwick, a Georgia case, and said all State \nsodomy laws are unconstitutional.\n  This is most certainly not a discussion concerning sodomy laws or the \nwisdom of such statutes. This debate is about the Constitution, what it \nmeans, and who controls the legal and social policy in America. Some \nstatutes and ordinances certainly are unconstitutional and should be \ndeclared so. A city ordinance that required Rosa Parks to sit at the \nback of a bus simply because of the color of her skin did violate--\nclearly violated--the command of the U.S. Constitution that everyone be \nprovided equal protection of the laws, and Judge Frank M. Johnson and \nthe U.S. Supreme Court were correct to strike it down as \ndiscriminatory. That decision was not activism. It was a new commitment \nto the plain meaning of the existing Constitution that had been the law \nall along.\n  The situation is quite different in Lawrence. It is instructive to \nreview how five members--only five, really, because Justice O'Connor \nonly concurred in the result, not in the reasoning--of the Supreme \nCourt came to reverse Bowers, which had upheld Georgia's law just 17 \nyears before.\n\n  So what changed? Certainly not the law. Certainly not the \nConstitution. This is why our American people need to pay close \nattention to these issues, or the judicial sleight of hand that is \nbeginning to occur too often will succeed. No doubt the American people \nare paying closer attention today than they have in the past.\n  The majority opinion in Lawrence divorced morality from law. The \nCourt flatly held that morality, even long established, objectively \ndetermined moral values, cannot be a basis for law, so they struck down \nthe Texas law. The Court said the law was a product of morality, which \nthey found was without value as a justification for law. I kid you not, \nthat is what they did.\n  Remember, the Court is examining now a long-established provision of \ncriminal law, a provision that had been recently upheld as \nconstitutional. Remember also, the issue is not whether you approve or \nwould vote for such a law but whether it stands without any basis such \nthat it becomes the duty of the Supreme Court to strike it down as \nviolative of the U.S. Constitution. Lawrence was troubling, with far-\nreaching ramifications.\n  What does Lawrence have to do with the marriage amendment? A great \ndeal, unfortunately. If the Supreme Court were to hold that marriage \nshould no longer be limited to a union of a man and a woman and a court \nfinds as they did in Lawrence that such is required by some word or \nphrase in the Constitution, than any Federal law, such as DOMA, or any \nState constitutional provision--we are voting on one in Alabama today \nto protect marriage, and I assure you it is going to pass--but any \nState constitutional provision would be erased from the books, held for \nnaught, and struck down if found to be in violation of the Constitution \nbecause the Constitution is the supreme law of the land and its \nprovisions trump all other laws and State constitutional provisions.\n  In Lawrence, the U.S. Supreme Court used very broad language that by \nfair deduction would suggest that the majority's reasoning would be \nsupportive of redefining marriage. While not denying the logic of this \npossibility, the Court in its opinion in dicta did note that Lawrence \n``does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition \nto any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter.''\n  So the facts did not involve that, but the opinion did not deny that \nthis same reasoning could be used in the future in cases such as the \nMassachusetts marriage case. It was obvious, of course, that the issue \nof same-sex marriages was not before the Court in Lawrence, but they \nwere aware of that.\n  Justice Scalia was not beguiled by this language. His brilliant \ndissent went right to that point, and it is the issue before us today. \nJustice Scalia aptly stated:\n\n       This case ``does not involve'' the issue of homosexual \n     marriage only if one entertains the belief that principle and \n     logic have nothing to do with the decisions of this Court.\n\n  It doesn't involve the issue of homosexual marriage only if logic and \nprinciple have nothing to do with the opinions of the Court. What he is \nsaying quite plainly is, following the logic and principle of the \nopinion in Lawrence, marriage, as we know it, is in jeopardy today, and \nhe dissented. Justice Scalia is a brilliant jurist. He loves the law \nand believes in being faithful to the law as written, not as he may \nwish it to be.\n  This debate in the Senate about activism is important. It is a debate \nthat was raised aggressively in recent elections in Senate races and \nthe Presidential election. President Bush said he admired Justice \nScalia and he wanted more judges on the Court such as Justice Scalia.\n  Justice Scalia's dissent reflects one of the critical issues that \nhighlight the difference between an activist judge and one who is \nrespectful of the people's branch of Government, the legislative \nbranches of Federal and State government.\n  In large part, the Massachusetts marriage case and Lawrence v. Texas \nare the kinds of rulings that have caused so much controversy, rulings \nwhere a slim majority of an aging group of justices--four maybe in some \ncourts, five on the U.S. Supreme Court--allow personal views on some \nsubject to cloud their thinking to such an extent that they delve into \nthe Constitution in order to find some phrase they can use to impose \nthat view on the people, all the while insisting they are merely \nfollowing the commands of the Constitution.\n  In fact, our Supreme Court Justices have created a double standard. \nThey have plainly held that the legislative branches--the Congress, our \nState legislatures--elected by the people, cannot base a law on an \nestablished, objective moral code, but they--the enlightened judicial \nbranch, the one branch of our Government unaccountable to the people--\nmay strike down congressionally passed laws if the Justices conclude \nthat the legislative laws do not comply with what the judges find are \n``evolving standards of decency.''\n  ``Evolving standards of decency'' is a phrase activist judges often \nuse, and it can mean anything. Who can say what that means? ``Evolving \nstandards of decency'' is not a proper legal standard. It lacks the \nprecision needed for a legal standard. It is, in fact, not a standard\n\n[[Page S5481]]\n\nat all. In truth, it is a license to the court. It can allow as few as \nfive Supreme Court Justices to roam the world to find European law or \nsome other foreign law or some study or some report which they base \ntheir opinion upon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair. I ask unanimous consent for 5 more \nminutes.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I will have to object to that. I agree to \n1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 1 \nmore minute.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would just say this: that we are at a \npoint in our history where it is now the opportunity of this Senate to \nallow the American people an opportunity to have their views heard on \nthe question of the definition of marriage. It has been eroded by \ncourts improperly, in my view, but it is being eroded nevertheless. By \nvoting for this constitutional amendment, we will not make any \nconstitutional amendment become a reality. We will simply send the \nmatter to the States. And if three-fourths of the State legislatures \nagree, only then will this amendment become law. Why would we want to \ndeny the American people the right through their representatives to \nadopt this amendment? I do not know, and I do not think we should. I \nthink we should support the amendment.\n  How should the people properly respond to this real or perceived \nabuse and, in particular, to this very real threat to traditional \nmarriage?\n  The proper answer is for the people to ask their elected \nrepresentatives to pass a constitutional amendment to fix the problem, \nor the potential problem.\n  It is the right way, the lawful way, for the people and the Congress \nto respond.\n  Amazingly, it has been suggested by those who oppose the right of the \npeople to have their voice heard on this matter, that the Marriage \nProtection Act violates the Constitution. How silly is that? The \nMarriage Protection Act would become a part of the Constitution. How \ncould it violate the Constitution?\n  More importantly, the court rulings that have created this crisis are \nthemselves, in my view and the view of many, contrary to the \nConstitution. Regardless of whether such rulings are sound, the people \nhave a right to have their voice heard on the matter of marriage.\n  Some here argue that we should not have an amendment that decides the \nquestion here in the Senate but should allow the States to do it. But, \nthat is the problem.\n  The States, and the people, are having their decisions overturned by \ncourts. On May 16, a Georgia judge struck down that State's law that \nprohibits same-sex marriage. At least nine States are facing similar \nlawsuits. And if Lawrence is any indication, the U.S. Supreme Court \nseems poised to make a similar ruling.\n  This is why the American people are rightly concerned and want us to \ndo something to stop this trend by the undemocratic branch of \ngovernment from altering marriage, a cornerstone of our civilization.\n  Of course, if this Congress were to pass the Marriage Protection \nAmendment, it does not then become law. It then would go to the States \nwhere three-fourths of the State legislatures would have to agree, for \nit to become part of our Constitution.\n  Thus, our vote today is the key step in allowing the States to \nexpress the will of their people.\n  Thus vote against the Marriage Protection Amendment by those who say \nthey oppose same-sex marriage, would deny the States the authority they \nneed to protect their laws from judicial activism.\n  Finally, some argue that marriage is not an issue of such importance \nthat it should be placed in our Constitution or even have debate time \nallotted to it. They are wrong. This is a huge issue, one of great \nimportance. The real question is, why deny the right of the American \npeople through their legislatures the right to vote on this issue? What \nharm is there in letting the people speak? I suspect the real concern \nof many is that if this amendment were to get to the States, it would \npass. Those who openly or surreptitiously favor same-sex marriage \nsurely would not want the Marriage Protection Amendment to go to the \nStates.\n  And, there is nothing unusual about constitutional amendments that \naddress specific problems.\n  We have passed amendments that are quite specific as well as broad.\n  The 27th amendment, ratified May 27, 1992, provides that Congress \ncan't raise the pay of members of the House or Senate until the next \nelection in the House.\n  The 26th amendment, ratified July 1, 1971, provides that eighteen-\nyear-olds must be allowed to vote.\n  The 25th amendment, ratified February 10, 1967, provides for \npresidential succession.\n  The 24th amendment, ratified January 23, 1964, abolished the poll \ntax.\n  To my mind, the Marriage Protection Act is a wonderful way to allow \nthe American people to have their voices heard on a matter that is very \nimportant to them and our Nation.\n  The courts have gotten it wrong. Wrong as a matter of law and wrong \nas to policy. They are not higher beings. They make mistakes and they \nneed to be held to account so that good law and good policy are \nrestored. A narrowly drafted constitutional amendment that deals with \nthis one, single issue, is the proper way to give legitimate voice to \nour citizens.\n  The traditional understanding and law of marriage are being \noverturned. The sounds of the conflict can be heard in Lexington and in \nOmaha. Why stand we here idle? Let's authorize the Marriage Protection \nAmendment to go to the States so the people's will may be accomplished. \nAfter all, our founders created a democracy, not an oligarchy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, my friend from Alabama has just called for \nthe Senate to vote and the House to vote, two-thirds majorities to vote \nto send to the States the question of whether or not our U.S. \nConstitution should be amended with respect to marriage being only \nbetween a man and a woman. Actually, in my State and in 45 other States \naround the country, we have had the opportunity to debate this issue, \nto consider this issue, and to pass laws with respect to marriage as \nbetween a man and a woman.\n  Personally, I believe that it is. As Governor of Delaware, a number \nof years ago I signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act in my State \nthat says marriage is something that occurs between a man and a woman. \nNot only did I sign that law, but I supported the Federal law which was \nenacted here, signed by former President Clinton, which said States \nlike my own and those other 45 States, to the extent that we define \nmarriage as being between a man and a woman, our State law, respective \nState laws, cannot be violated by the actions of some other State.\n  I will give an example. If we have a same-sex couple in Delaware who \ndecide to go to another country or another place where same-sex \nmarriages are allowed, and then that same-sex couple comes back to \nDelaware and claims they are married, they are not married in my State. \nIt is not a marriage that we recognize. In fact, for the over 200 years \nthat we have been around as a country, States such as Delaware or \nCalifornia or Georgia or Alabama or Kansas have set the rules for \nmarriage. We don't say to the Federal Government: You determine who can \nget married, at what age people can get married, or what kind of \nwaiting period there has to be, or can first cousins marry or second \ncousins; we don't say what the rules of the road are with respect to \ndivorce, with respect to alimony, with respect to child support. For \nover 200 years we have left those issues to the States.\n  Today we have said very clearly in my own State, marriage is between \na man and a woman, a view that is reflected in almost all of the other \nStates in this country.\n  If we get to the point where our ability to maintain that position in \nmy State or in the other 45 States that have adopted similar laws, \nwhere those laws are threatened or basically rendered ineffective, then \nI think the idea of visiting a constitutional amendment is something we \nmay want to do. But I\n\n[[Page S5482]]\n\ndon't know that it is needed. I am not convinced that it is needed for \nus to amend the Constitution to do something that I believe we already \nhave done by changing our own State laws, and those State laws are \nprotected by a Federal law.\n  We have not amended the Constitution a whole lot of times. We have \namended the Constitution 17 times; since 1791, 17 times. I am 59 years \nold. We have amended the Constitution just six times in my own \nlifetime. We have amended the Constitution for good and valid reasons. \nWe have amended the Constitution to protect our freedom of speech, to \nprotect our ability to worship God as we see fit. We have amended the \nConstitution to ensure that we have the right to bear arms, to ensure \nthe right of a trial by a jury of our peers. Other constitutional \namendments have been to protect us from unlawful searches of our homes \nand have guaranteed our rights to assemble in Washington and in Dover \nand across this country to present our grievances to those who serve \nus. Constitutional amendments have abolished slavery. They have \nprovided women the right to vote. They have provided 18-year-old young \nmen and women with the right to vote, and they have limited our \nPresidents to serving only two terms. They decided through a \nconstitutional amendment that if we don't have a Vice President for \nsome reason, how one would be selected. All of those are important, and \nsome would say urgent, pressing needs that have been addressed and have \nbeen put into our Constitution.\n  I am not convinced given the actions of my own State and 45 other \nStates, the actions of the Congress and former President Clinton \nsigning the Defense of Marriage Act, that we need to enshrine in the \nConstitution today what we have already enshrined in State laws and \nFederal laws with respect to the fact that marriage is between a man \nand a woman.\n  I do know what some would say: that this is election year politics. \nWe do this every 2 years, and it happens sort of coincidentally like 5 \nmonths, 4 months before an election, and it is through the efforts of \none party or the other to try to energize their base.\n  I don't know if that is part of this. I do know this: There are \nplenty of other important issues that we need to be addressing.\n  We have a war in Iraq where the going is tough. We are losing people, \nincluding some young men from my own State just last month, and we are \nsuffering tragic and sad losses of life. We have a situation in \nAfghanistan which is not going as well as some of us would like and had \nhoped for. We are a nation today where almost 60 percent of our energy \ndepends on foreign sources, a lot of it controlled by people who don't \nlike us very much. And we aren't convinced that when we take our money \nto fill up our tanks with gas that they will not use our money to hurt \nus.\n\n  Our dependence on foreign oil continues to grow, not abate. The cost \nof health care is killing us in terms of our ability to compete. As a \nnation, we spend more money--companies such as General Motors--on \nhealth care than is spent on all capital investments around the world. \nWe have people who are sick and dying from asbestos poisoning, and they \nare not getting and their families are not getting the money they \ndeserve. Meanwhile, other folks who have been exposed to asbestos but \ndon't have asbestosis and have never had it, will never have it, they \nget money. We live on a planet where the air is becoming warmer, and we \nare threatened by more hurricanes, tougher and stronger hurricanes and \ntyphoons and cyclones as we have ever seen in recent years.\n  We have a Tax Code where literally, last year, $290 billion was owed \nin taxes. We know who owes it, and we know how much they owe, but it \nwasn't collected. Federal agencies made over $50 billion of improper \npayments last year, most of those overpayments. We have government-\nsponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that don't \nhave the kind of regulation they need. We have data breaches where the \nVeterans' Administration is literally turning over to unscrupulous \npeople data for 25 million, 26 million of our veterans. We have a \npassenger rail system in this country which is, compared to the rest of \nthe world, just sad, and we aren't doing anything about it. We have \nlegislation that passed 93 to 6 last year to reauthorize and improve \npassenger rail service and nothing has happened to it. Nothing has \nhappened to it. We have a postal system that literally is a relic of \nthe 1970s trying to operate in the 21st century. We have plenty to do. \nWe have 45 legislative days ahead of us to do all of that, and we are \nspending 3 of those legislative days on this.\n  I know there is a need that some Republicans feel to bring up this \nissue again, and I respect the fact that you are in the majority; it is \nyour right. I understand later this month we will deal with some other \ncontentious issues. I have had the opportunity to meet with the \nRepublican leadership. Some of us have had the opportunity to meet with \nthe Republican leaders. We are self-described centrists. I call us the \nflaming moderates. But we have sort of reached out to the Republican \nleadership to say there is a whole list of things that we need to focus \non: deficit reduction, budget deficit reduction, trade deficit \nreduction, energy independence, you name it. There is a whole long list \nof what we ought to be doing, and we should be focusing on that agenda, \nnot just on this.\n  That is not to say marriage isn't important; it is hugely important. \nIt is the basic building block of our society. We know families are in \ntrouble and hurting in a lot of ways. One of the things I would like to \nsee us do and put a lot more emphasis on is ratcheting down unwed \nmothers and teen pregnancies. We ought to do a heck of a lot more in \nchildhood education to reduce the likelihood that young women will \nbring children into the world and that young guys are going to \nimpregnate them. We need to do a whole lot more in that regard. That is \nthe kind of agenda that we need to be working on and looking to across \nthe aisle.\n  That having been said, I have used my time. I will close with this: \nIn my view, marriage is between a man and a woman. In Delaware's view, \nmarriage is something that is between a man and a woman. We passed a \nlaw that says that. We are not the only State that did that. Forty-five \nother States did the same thing. We have a Federal Government, this \nbody, the House of Representatives, and the former President who signed \na Federal law that said what we have done in Delaware and 45 other \nStates is good and is not going to be overridden. It is not going to be \njust pushed aside. Until that happens, I am convinced that the proper \nthing for us to do is to uphold marriage, to honor marriage, and to \ncontinue to work as we have in our States to pass good State laws \naffecting marriage, affecting the raising of our children, but not \nnecessarily to ask the Federal Government to do that because until I am \nconvinced and until most of us are convinced that, frankly, we need \nFederal intervention, then I think let's stick with what has worked for \nus for over 200 years, and that is allowing the States to do this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \naddress the Senate until 7 p.m. tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I wanted to \nsay to my colleague from Delaware that he painted a very strong case of \nwhat we ought to be doing on the Senate floor. Without reading a note, \nhe ticked off a list of six or seven things or eight things that we \nreally need to take care of, and I just wanted to thank him very much.\n  I rise today to oppose the proposed constitutional amendment on \nmarriage. I oppose it. I think it is divisive. I think it is \nunnecessary. I want to lay out the reasons.\n  First of all, the proposed amendment is nothing more than a cynical \nelection year ploy. I truly believe that, and I think if anyone has \nfollowed this every-couple-of-year debate, they know it is true. It \npops up like clockwork around election time.\n  Second, the definition of marriage, as has been stated by Senator \nCarper from Delaware, who was the Governor of that State, has been \ndetermined by the States, and indeed the States are acting in many ways \nto decide whether they want to legalize gay marriage or legalize \ndomestic partnerships or civil\n\n[[Page S5483]]\n\nunions or outlaw all of these things. So States are making their \ndecisions, and they should be respected.\n  On a personal note, let me say that I have been married for 44 years \nto the same person. I have to say as someone married for that length of \ntime, the fact that two gay people decide they want to take care of \neach other for the rest of their lives and care about each other for \nthe rest of their lives, that doesn't threaten my marriage one bit. It \ndoesn't threaten me. It doesn't make me worry about my marriage. My \nmarriage is too strong for that. The fact is, if someone feels their \nmarriage is threatened because two gay people care about each other, \nthen their problems go way deeper than they are caring to admit.\n  Throughout our Nation's history, we have only amended the \nConstitution to extend rights and equality, and that is an important \npoint. So I think we have established in this debate that the States \nare taking care of this issue, and they are coming out in all different \nplaces. That is the way it ought to be.\n\n  So here we are, June 2006, with only a few precious months left on \nthe Senate calendar, and we are facing some very serious issues at a \ncritical time in our history. It is our duty to respond to the American \npeople and their needs. I truly believe that this President and the \nRepublican leadership are ignoring the needs of the American people, \nand that is why we see the lowest ratings ever--I think ever--for this \nparticular Congress and very low ratings for the President.\n  For example, what do President Bush and the Republican leadership say \nto the families of our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan who want to \nknow when their loved ones will be coming home? Why aren't we talking \nabout that instead of an issue that is being handled by the States? \nMaybe they don't answer that question because they don't want to say \nthat the war in Iraq has killed and wounded over 20,000 American \nsoldiers, and there is no end in sight to the war.\n  That brings up an issue that I care a lot about, which is the state \nof our military men and women. If you want to talk about their \nmarriages for a minute, why don't we do that? Divorces are up, way up, \namong families who are deployed to these war zones. Families are \nsuffering. The divorce rate between 2000 and 2004 nearly doubled in the \nArmy, and it did not double in the Army because two people who happen \nto be of the same sex care about each other and want to take care of \neach other for the rest of their lives. That is not why military \nmarriages are failing. They are under stress, impossible stress, the \nhard-to-imagine stress of being deployed again and again and again, \ngoing out on a battlefield with antidepressants being handed out to \nthem. That is why they are suffering. That is why we see their \nmarriages breaking up and their children crying themselves to sleep \nevery night. But, oh no, we are not talking about that. We are talking \nabout an issue that is being handled by the States.\n  I don't understand why this administration will not talk about these \nissues. Why won't they talk about the fact that we have lost our focus \nin Afghanistan, despite the fact that a resurgent Taliban has vowed to \nstep up attacks during coming months and we are seeing such a \nresurgence of the Taliban there. Why aren't we discussing that instead \nof a cynical and divisive and unnecessary constitutional amendment \nabout something that is being taken care of by the States?\n  What do President Bush and the Republican leadership say about our \nsecurity here at home? What they don't want to say is that nearly 5 \nyears after 9/11 they still have not adopted the recommendations of the \n9/11 Commission. Shouldn't we be discussing ways to secure our ports \nand our rails, and ways to track foreign visitors in the U.S., instead \nof this cynical, divisive and unnecessary constitutional amendment on a \nsubject that is being handled by the Governors and by the States?\n  Why do President Bush and the Republican leadership say nothing about \ngas prices? Why are they doing nothing about gas prices? Maybe it is \nbecause they don't want to say that they don't have any solutions--like \nraising fuel economy standards in a meaningful way or strongly \npromoting the use of hybrid cars or flex-fuel vehicles so we use less \ngasoline. This President tomorrow could issue an Executive order that \nsays all the cars that are bought by Federal taxpayers for the Federal \nfleet have to be the most fuel efficient cars available. They are not \ndoing that. They would rather talk about this amendment, which is about \na subject that is being handled by the States.\n  What does the President and what do the Republicans and the \nleadership say to the millions of Americans who need access to \naffordable health care? They don't want to talk about that. They want \nto talk about this divisive amendment. Maybe it is because they have no \nclue of what to do, even though health care costs continue to be a \ntremendous burden on our small businesses and our individuals and our \nfamilies, and the prescription drug benefit is rife with problems.\n  Tomorrow we could vote to give Medicare the power and the authority \nto negotiate for lower drug prices, which would save that program \nmillions, and we would be able to make the program stronger and not put \na halt to the benefits, which is called a doughnut hole, just when the \nsickest patients need more. Oh, no, they would rather talk about an \namendment on a divisive subject that is being handled by the States.\n  Why don't they talk about the fact that our families are struggling \nto pay for college tuition for their children? They don't want to talk \nabout that because they have failed to help America's families pay for \ncollege, despite the fact that tuition is becoming hugely expensive and \nmore expensive each and every year. As a matter of fact, President Bush \njust signed a tax law that makes college loans more expensive. But, oh \nno, we can't talk about that. We are going to talk about a divisive \namendment on a subject that is being handled by the States.\n  Why don't they want to talk about our fiscal situation? Why don't \nthey? They don't want to say that as a result of their policies, the \npolicies of this administration and my Republican friends, we now have \nseen the surpluses that were left to them, to their stewardship, turn \ninto deficits as far as the eye could see. They are projected to hit \nwell over $300 billion, and the public debt stands at an eye-popping \n$8.4 trillion. When they got the reins of Government there were going \nto be surpluses as far as the eye can see. Now there are deficits as \nfar as the eye can see.\n  They don't want to say that it is this administration's failed \npolicies that will leave our children and grandchildren with a bill for \nthe tax cuts to the wealthiest people, tax cuts that we can't afford.\n  How do they really respond to the concerns and the anxieties of the \nAmerican people, anxieties and concerns that we see in poll after poll? \nThis is not Democratic polls or Republican polls, these are everybody's \npolls. People are worried. They say we are on the wrong track.\n\n  But this is what this administration says, and this Congress, they \nsay: Sorry, America, please hold. Please hold, America, while the \nSenate takes time to consider a constitutional amendment that has \nnothing to do with the most serious issues you face today. Why? Because \nthey need to score political points. Please hold, America, because, \nalthough we have been elected to serve you and unite you, we would \nrather divide you for our own partisan interests.\n  If I were a conservative I would be insulted today, insulted by the \nfact that I am being used as a political pawn by this President and the \nRepublican leadership. I would be insulted.\n  The issue of marriage has been determined by the States. For those \npeople who worried about it, there was DOMA, the Defense of Marriage \nAct. I believed at the time that wasn't even necessary because I \nbelieve the States have the right to make decisions about marriage. But \nit passed and it has been upheld. So what is the problem? There is not \na problem.\n  From the party that says let the States decide, suddenly the States \ndo not know as much as these Senators here. They know everything, and \nthey are going to amend the Constitution on something that the States \nare handling.\n  This, in many ways, is a telling moment for this Senate. With all the \nissues I have laid out and the issues\n\n[[Page S5484]]\n\nthat Senator Carper has laid out, there is no planning for these \nissues. So this Senate is being used as part of a political campaign. I \nresent that, when we have men and women dying every single day in Iraq, \nnewspaper reporters being blown up. But we have to talk about a subject \nthat is being handled by the States.\n  As I said before, we have never amended our Constitution to take away \nrights. We don't do that in America. We are too strong for that. We are \ntoo good for that. We are a model of freedom because of that. But that \nis precisely what is being proposed here, an amendment that is \nunnecessary because the States are handling this and all this does is \ndivide us instead of uniting us.\n  Look at some of the great examples of our constitutional amendments.\n  The Bill of Rights--the first ten amendments--guarantee important \nliberties to Americans, from freedom of speech to freedom from \nunwarranted search and seizure to freedom of religion. And the 10th \namendment reserves for the States all powers not specifically given to \nthe Federal Government.\n  The 13th, 14th and 15th amendments corrected the horrific injustices \nof slavery by giving African-Americans the right to vote and equal \nprotection under the law.\n  The 19th amendment gave women the right to vote, and the 26th \namendment gave 18-year-olds the right to vote.\n  This short but impressive list of amendments demonstrates that our \nConstitution is meant to expand, not restrict, freedom and equality.\n  I want to say to my colleagues that there is something about this \ndebate that has bothered me. As I have listened to some of my \ncolleagues comment in support of this proposed amendment--which is \ntheir total right to support--I have been troubled by the suggestion \nthat gay Americans are responsible for a host of problems in our \nsociety, from children born out of wedlock to poverty to divorce. These \ncomments are wrong. These comments are wrong. It is wrong to find \nscapegoats in our great country. Gays and lesbians, they are God's \nchildren too. They wake up every morning, they try to do the best to \nlive their lives, the best for the people they love. And they live \ntheir lives one day at a time.\n  We can solve problems such as unintended pregnancies, poverty, \ndivorce, and adoption without stooping to scapegoat and hurt so many \npeople.\n  If we want to strengthen families, let's strengthen families. Let's \nhelp families with their college tuition. Let's help families with \ntheir child care. Let's help them by raising the minimum wage. Let's \nclean up Superfund sites that are near schools. Let's help the 44 \nmillion Americans who need health insurance. Let's help those who are \nreaching retirement age, who are so frightened because the promise of \nthe golden years is not there.\n  Let's reach out to each other and do that instead of being forced to \ndeal with manufactured political issues which, again, pop up every \nelection year. That sends false hopes out to some Americans who really \nwant this constitutional amendment. They are being used. It also sends \nout fear and sadness to so many other Americans.\n  We can do better. We must do better for all Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/06/senate-section/article/S5484-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, among the beautiful, rolling-green hills of \nnorthern West Virginia is a little town with a big history. I am \nspeaking of the town of West Union, the county seat of Doddridge \nCounty.\n  Once a center for railroading and other forms of transportation, as \nwell as oil drilling, coal mining, and and other forms of businesses \nand manufacturing, West Union was an important and thriving commercial \ncenter in the late nineteenth century. Unfortunately, like too many \nsmall towns in West Virginia and across the country, West Union has \nfallen into some hard times.\n  Nevertheless, West Union retains its rich and colorful history. \nIndeed, the entire downtown district of West Union has been placed on \nthe National Register of Historic Places. The downtown section contains \nbuildings that feature a wealth of architectural styles, with four of \nthem having been listed on the National Register. These historic \nbuildings include the Doddridge County Court House with its Romanesque \narchitecture, and the Silas Smith Opera House which was built at the \nturn of the last century and now serves as the county library.\n  For a small town in the hills of West Virginia, the town of West \nUnion has been the home of a number of prominent American citizens. \nGeneral Bantz Craddock, who rose to be the Commander of U.S. Southern \nCommand and is responsible for military operations in the Caribbean, \nCentral America, and South America, was raised in West Union.\n  For many years, West Union was the home to Clyde Ware, a novelist who \nhas been actively involved in television and film production. In fact, \nMr. Ware wrote and directed many episodes of what was one of my \nfavorite television series, ``Gunsmoke.''\n  The town's most famous historic resident was the legendary Ephriam \nBee. Mr. Bee was a pioneer, a blacksmith, the U.S. Postmaster for West \nUnion, and the owner of a highly popular inn and restaurant, \nappropriately referred to as the ``Bee-Hive.'' At the age of 60, Mr. \nBee served as captain of the Doddridge militia which protected the area \nfrom Confederate forces, thieves, and outlaws.\n  In 1863, Mr. Bee was elected to the West Virginia State Legislature, \ndefeating Joseph H. Diss Debar, the person who later designed the State \nseal of West Virginia, which is still in use today, without change.\n  Another contest that Mr. Bee won was being named the Ugliest Man in \nthe State of West Virginia. For that victory, he was awarded a \nbeautiful pocket knife, a proud possession which he was forced to \nrelinquish a few years later when the State found a man whom it deemed \nto be even uglier.\n  In 1845, Mr. Bee originated the Ancient and Honorable Order of E. \nClampus Vitus, ECV, of which he became Grand Lama. ECV was originally \nformed as a secret order for playing practical jokes, but as it spread \nacross the country, it took on different purposes and missions. Today, \nECV has become an important historic preservation society, with more \nthan 100,000 members.\n  Mr. Bee also operated an important station on the underground \nrailroad. He hid his guests in a nearby cave until it was filled, then, \nit appears, he used ECV to create a diversion so that the escaped \nslaves could be sent on their way to freedom.\n  What became the town of West Union was originally settled in 1807. It \nwas incorporated on July 20, 1881, which means the town of West Union \nwill be celebrating its 125th anniversary this summer. The town will be \nusing this milestone anniversary in an effort to promote and celebrate \nthe town's history and as a jump start toward the economic \nrevitalization of the town. The festivities are planned for July 22, \nand they promise to be a time of fun, entertainment, and education as \nthe town wants to share its unique and colorful history with the world.\n  The town of West Union has adopted as a slogan, ``We love our \nhistory--that's why we're still making it!'' With its history--and its \nenergetic, creative residents, I am confident that the town of West \nUnion will be making history for a long time into the future.\n  I wish them the best on their 125th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/06/senate-section/article/S5484-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5484-S5485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING RETIRING JOURNALIST DICK KAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dick Kay, a man of \ngreat journalistic integrity. Many things have changed in the past 40 \nyears, but from Martin Luther King, Jr., to Adlai Stevenson, from Iraq \nto the Daleys, from Watergate to the 1985 Bears, there has been one \nvoice Chicagoans have consistently trusted for an objective and \nthoughtful perspective. Dick Kay has established\n\n[[Page S5485]]\n\nhimself as an institution in our television news. Over his 46-year \ncareer in the TV business, Dick has proven himself to be a professional \nnewsman--a reporter with no motive other than to give his viewers an \ninsight on the news.\n  Dick's distinguished career began modestly. A high school dropout at \nthe age of 14, he worked to support himself. He once said, ``the \nexperience of those years taught me the most valuable lessons of my \nlife: that I would never achieve any real success without an \neducation.'' He enlisted in the U.S. Navy at the age of 17, earning a \nGED. certificate. After his discharge, Dick realized his dream of an \neducation by graduating from Bradley University in Peoria through the \nGI bill, receiving a B.S. in speech education in 1962.\n  Dick remained in Peoria to work on TV and radio programs before \ngetting his big break as the news director of WFRV-TV in Green Bay, WI. \nAfter 3 years in the ``Dairy State,'' he relocated to Chicago in 1968 \nas a producer and writer for WMAQ-NBC 5. He was tested immediately, as \none of his first assignments was the tumultuous 1968 Democratic \nNational Convention in Chicago. Within 2 years, Dick had worked his way \nup to full-time reporter and eventually political editor. He became \nhost of the weekly news show ``City Desk.'' This Sunday morning \nbroadcast became a Chicagoland staple--a ``must-see'' for everyone \nfollowing the political scene. Dick's questions were often tough but \nalways fair. Political guests knew that a visit to ``City Desk'' would \nalways be memorable.\n  Dick's achievements include a long list of honors and awards. His \n1984 9-month investigation of the Illinois General Assembly's so-called \nLegislative Study Commissions earned him the George Foster Peabody \nmedallion, the most prestigious honor in television broadcasting. The \nreport also won him a National Headliner Award and the Jacob Scher \nAward for investigative reporting. Dick's numerous accolades include 11 \nEmmys; induction into the Television Academy's Silver Circle Hall of \nFame; Commentator of the Year from the Joint Civic Committee of \nItalian-Americans; as well as multiple awards courtesy of the \nAssociated Press, the Chicago Headline Club, and the Society of \nProfessional Journalists. Perhaps one of Dick's proudest moments was \nbeing honored as a Bradley University Distinguished Alumnus. He has \nsurely come a long way since shining shoes at the age of 14 in \nEvansville, IN.\n  Mr. President, after nearly a half century of reporting the news, \nDick says that he is ready to ``smell the roses,'' and he has certainly \nearned it. Dick Kay has played an important role in reporting the \nexciting news stories of our time and has left his mark on the ``Land \nof Lincoln.'' I wish a restful and happy retirement to Dick Kay, one of \nIllinois' and Chicago's premier newsmen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/06/senate-section/article/S5485-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                W. RALPH BASHAM, COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today President George W. Bush witnessed \nthe swearing-in of W. Ralph Basham to serve as Commissioner of Customs \nin the Department of Homeland Security. Mr. Basham's nomination was \nfavorably reported out of the Finance Committee on May 18, 2006, and he \nwas confirmed by the Senate on May 26, 2006.\n  The President nominated an outstanding individual to be Commissioner \nof Customs. Ralph Basham has served as Director of the Secret Service \nand is a 29-year veteran of the Secret Service. He has also served as \nchief of staff for the Transportation Security Administration and as \ndirector of the Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, GA. His \ndemonstrated commitment to public service is admirable. And the breadth \nof his experiences will be an important asset as he assumes his new \nresponsibilities.\n  The Commissioner of Customs serves in a critical and demanding role. \nThe Commissioner of Customs must ensure that the dual demands of \nsecuring our borders and facilitating the smooth flow of international \ntrade are each fully met. As part of his confirmation process Mr. \nBasham appeared before the Finance Committee, which I chair. During his \nhearing, I was impressed with Mr. Basham's appreciation of the \nimportance of maintaining an appropriate balance in meeting those dual \ndemands.\n  More broadly, the Commissioner of Customs heads a bureau of over \n40,000 employees. Those Government employees are on the front line for \nenforcing laws related to over 40 agencies. At the same time, they \nprocess $1.7 trillion worth of imports and collect about $28 dollars in \nduties and fees. This trade is critical to our economy. For example, \nthe 10-day strike at the port of Long Beach a few years ago is \nestimated to have cost our economy between $1 billion to $2 billion \neach day. That illustrates why maintaining an appropriate balance \nbetween trade security and trade facilitation is so important.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Finance, with jurisdiction over \ncustoms and international trade, I look forward to working with Mr. \nBasham to advance a robust customs and trade agenda now that he's taken \nover as Commissioner of Customs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/06/senate-section/article/S5485-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5485-S5486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 DARFUR\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while the Senate, with the encouragement of \na White House in full campaign mode, debates a constitutional amendment \nto ban gay marriage--a debate which will consume days of the Senate's \ntime and is all about scoring political points in an election year--the \ndisaster in Darfur rages on.\n  It has been nearly 4 weeks since a peace agreement was signed between \nthe Sudanese Government and one of the rebel groups, but violence, \nhunger and disease continue to claim innocent lives.\n  Jan Egeland, United Nations Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian \nAffairs, recently described the humanitarian situation in Darfur as \nbeing on the verge of collapse.\n  In the midst of this calamity, the Senate is focused on other \nmatters. Gay marriage. Next it will be flag burning. And then full \nrepeal of the estate tax, to benefit the wealthiest of the wealthy. \nSolutions in search of a problem, while whole villages burn, their \ninhabitants are slaughtered, and relief organizations in Darfur \nstruggle to cope without adequate resources.\n  Between a quarter of a million and half a million people have \nperished in Darfur--mostly civilians whose villages have been reduced \nto ashes. Many, who escaped being shot or hacked to death, have died \nfrom hunger and disease.\n  The Sudanese Government has obstructed the deployment of a U.N. \npeacekeeping force in Darfur. The African Union has done its best, but \nwith only 7,000 troops, inadequate resources, and a weak mandate to \npatrol a vast area with few roads, it has been unable to provide \ncivilians with the protection they need.\n  I am so very proud that two high school students in Vermont are \nsetting a moral example for all Americans. Ben Rome and Brian Banks, \nseniors at Essex High School, outraged over the tragedy that is \nunfolding half a world away, felt compelled to do something about it. \nThey have organized a public rally in Burlington, VT, for this coming \nSunday to bring Vermonters together to speak out about one of the worst \nhuman disasters in recent memory. I look forward to joining Ben and \nBrian and other concerned Vermonters this weekend.\n  The supplemental appropriations bill for Iraq, Afghanistan, Hurricane \nKatrina recovery, and Sudan, which should be completed this week--and I \nhope we can find the time to pass it--contains additional funds to \nsupport the current level of peacekeepers in Darfur through the \nremainder of this year. This will help, but twice that amount is \nneeded.\n  The supplemental also provides additional funds for food and other \nhumanitarian aid. It should shame the White House and the Congress to \nreflect on the fact that we know we are not doing enough.\n  We also provide funds to support a Presidential special envoy for \nSudan, to work in pursuit of peace in Darfur and stability throughout \nSudan, northern Uganda, and Chad. We need someone of the caliber of \nSenator Danforth to be working continuously to help solve the Darfur \ncrisis.\n  A tragedy like this is bigger than any of us as individuals, but it \nis not too big if we join together in constructive action--as \nindividuals, as private relief organizations, and as nations.\n\n[[Page S5486]]\n\n  America is a great and good nation with the power to help stop this. \nBut it will take sustained attention, and it will take the efforts of \ncommitted citizens like Brian Banks and Ben Rome who, one by one, are \nopening the world's eyes to a tragedy that must be stopped.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/06/senate-section/article/S5486-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL HUNGER AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today is National Hunger Awareness Day, \nand it is an opportunity for all of us to pledge a greater effort to \ndeal more effectively with this festering problem that shames our \nNation and has become even more serious in recent years. Surely we can \nall do more to care for neighbors and fellow citizens who fall on hard \ntimes.\n  The number of Americans living in hunger or on the brink of hunger \nnow totals 38 million--5 million more than when President Bush took \noffice. That total includes almost 14 million children, 972,000 more \nsince 2000.\n  America's Second Harvest, the nation's largest network of emergency \nfood providers, recently conducted a series of interviews with its \nclients, and the report is astounding. Its emergency food providers \nserve 4.5 million different people a week--and 24 to 27 million people \na year.\n  Over 36 percent of its clients are children under 18 years old, and \n10 percent are elderly. Another 36 percent of its clients live in \nhouseholds with at least one employed adult.\n  These statistics are shameful. Our Nation's neediest individuals \nshould not be forced to choose between paying for food and paying the \nrent or paying for medicine.\n  In Massachusetts, the Greater Boston Food Bank serves over 320,000 \npeople a year--34 percent of them are under 18. All of us in the \nCommonwealth are grateful that we have food providers like the Greater \nBoston Food Bank, but they should not have to wage the battle alone. \nGovernment can't stand idle in the face of this great tragedy. We have \nprograms in place to fight hunger, but they continue to be underfunded \nand underused.\n  Day in and day out, the needs of millions of Americans living in \nhunger are ignored, and too often their voices have been silenced. \nTheir battle is a constant ongoing struggle. It undermines their \nproductivity, their earning power, and their health. It keeps their \nchildren from concentrating and learning in school. We all need to do \nmore to combat it. Government, corporations, communities, and citizens \nmust work together to develop better policies and faster responses.\n  In 1996, the Clinton administration pledged to begin an effort to cut \nhunger in half in the United States by 2010, and the strong economy \nenabled us to make significant progress toward that goal. Hunger \ndecreased steadily through 2000. We now have 4 years left to fulfill \nthat commitment.\n  The fastest, most direct way to reduce hunger in the Nation is to \nimprove and expand current Federal nutrition programs. Sadly, the \ncurrent administration proposes to change proven and effective programs \nsuch as food stamps and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for \nWomen, Infants, and Children. The administration also proposes to \neliminate the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which provides \nmodest food packages to low-income seniors and to mothers with children \nup to age 6.\n  It is time to do more for the most vulnerable in our society. \nNational Hunger Awareness Day is our chance to pledge to eradicate \nhunger in America--and to mean it when we say it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/06/senate-section/article/S5486-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HOLD ON S. 2012\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, up and down the coast of Oregon, fishermen, \ntheir families and communities are suffering from the actions of the \nSecretary of Commerce in curtailing the Klamath salmon fishery without \noffering the assistance they need to cope with this disaster. Months \nago the Pacific Fishery Management Council recommended to the Secretary \nof Commerce that this salmon fishery be drastically curtailed. The \nSecretary responded to the Council's recommendation by slashing the \nquotas and limiting the number of days and areas that could be fished. \nBut despite numerous pleas for help from the affected communities, the \nSecretary has done nothing for months and months to help out the \nfishers whose livelihood depends on the Klamath salmon stocks.\n  The Secretary's continued inaction is not acceptable, and so I am \nobjecting to any unanimous consent request for the Senate to proceed to \nor adopt S. 2012, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \nManagement Reauthorization Act of 2005 until the Senate can consider \nlegislative steps that will help fishermen in Oregon and California \nsurvive this disastrous fishing season. I make this objection \nconsistent with my policy of always announcing ``holds'' I may place on \nlegislation or nominations.\n  The State of Oregon is seeking a Presidential emergency declaration \nfor those affected by this Federal action, and I intend to work closely \nwith the State and my colleagues here in the Senate to make sure \nOregon's fishing communities are not forgotten and that they receive \nthe aid they will require to make it through this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/06/senate-section/article/S5486-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5486-S5487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TWENTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST REPORTED AIDS CASE\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise to recognize a bittersweet occasion: \nthe 25th anniversary of the first reported AIDS case. June 5 will \nforever be a day to reflect upon the lives that have been impacted by \nthe HIV/AIDS virus and the significant progress we have made in its \ndetection, control, and treatment. While much ground has been gained \nover the last quarter of a century, there remains a great deal of work \nto be done. That is why I stand today to pledge a sustained commitment \nto the global fight against HIV/AIDS--a fight that we cannot abandon \nuntil and effective cure is discovered.\n  Twenty-five years ago, Dr. Michael Gottlieb with the UCLA Hospital \nreported an extremely rare pneumonia in five young gay men to the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC. One of these men, \nnamed ``Chuck,'' was from Oregon. Unbeknownst to Dr. Gottlieb, this \nseemingly insignificant incident ultimately evolved into one of the \nmost significant health events of the modern era. It was 3 years later \nthat the cause of this mysterious outbreak of pneumonia was attributed \nto the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, HIV. Sadly, for ``Chuck'' this \ndiscovery was made too late; he passed away shortly after he fell ill.\n  Since 1981, an estimated 25 million individuals have died from the \nAIDS virus worldwide. What is even more alarming is that 16,000 new \ncases of HIV are diagnosed every day, quickly adding to the 40 million \npeople who have already contracted the virus. Statistics such as these \nare disheartening given the scientific and medical progress we have \nmade since the first cases of the illness were reported.\n  In the United States, an estimated 1.039 million to 1.185 million \npeople were living with HIV at the end of 2003, a 20-percent increase \nover the estimated number of cases at the end of 2002. While the number \nof persons with HIV in Oregon is small relative to other States, we \nnevertheless saw an 85-percent increase in the number of HIV-reported \ncases between 2002 and 2003. Not since the height of the AIDS epidemic \nin the 1980s has there been so many Americans living with this terrible \nillness.\n  Congress has a great opportunity to further the domestic fight \nagainst HIV/AIDS this year. Reauthorization of the Ryan White CARE Act \ncurrently is underway, and I am confident that the House and the Senate \ncan pass a bill by the end of this Congress that improves the scope and \nquality of services provided to those living with HIV/AIDS. As \ndeliberations continue, it is important that we focus upon improving \nthe equitable distribution of resources to States, municipalities, and \ncommunity-based organizations, and that we not arbitrarily restrict \ntheir ability to provide the best care possible to those who need it. \nNonprofit groups such as Cascade AIDS in Portland, OR, rely upon Ryan \nWhite CARE funds to offer a wide-range of both medical and social \nsupport services, like emergency housing and nutritional assistance. We \nmust ensure that the changes we make to the CARE Act strengthen--not \nharm--the ability of organizations like Cascade AIDS to serve those \nliving with HIV/AIDS.\n  As we move forward with the annual appropriations process, it is \nimportant\n\n[[Page S5487]]\n\nthat we provide a much needed increase in funding to all Ryan White \nCARE Act programs, but especially the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, \nADAP. A key component to the defense against HIV/AIDS is access to \ncutting-edge pharmaceutical treatments. These lifesaving medications \nare often so expensive that they remain out of reach to low-income and \nuninsured individuals. ADAP bridges that gap and provides \nantiretroviral drugs and important medical care to over 150,000 people \neach year. Unfortunately, ADAP's historical underfunding has \naccumulated to a point where almost $200 million is needed to meet \noutstanding need in the program. Congress must commit the necessary \nresources to meet the entire demand for ADAP's services. We cannot \nafford to lose the ground we have gained in the fight against HIV/AIDS \nby restricting access to critical pharmaceutical treatments.\n  As successful as ADAP has been at keeping individuals healthy and \nproductive, critical gaps in our approach to HIV treatment and \nprevention remain. For example, HIV positive individuals have access to \ntreatment under Medicaid only after they have developed full-blown \nAIDS. To remedy this oversight, I introduced the Early Treatment for \nHIV Act, ETHA, S. 311, along with Senator Hillary Clinton. By providing \naccess to HIV therapies and important medical care before such persons \ndevelop AIDS, ETHA would reduce overall Medicaid costs and, as \nimportant, improve the quality of life of those living with the virus. \nI ask my colleagues to consider this legislation before the end of this \nsession of Congress, so we can begin saving lives and dollars by \nincreasing access to more effective and efficient HIV/AIDS medical \ncare.\n  We have much to be proud of on the 25th anniversary of the first \nreported AIDS case. The virus responsible for the epidemic has been \nidentified; appropriate treatments have been developed as a result of \ninnovate medical research; and governments and other organizations \nacross the globe have committed significant resources to the continued \nfight against the disease. I am confident that in the near future we \nwill be able to commemorate this day by celebrating the eradication of \nthe pain and suffering that has been caused by HIV/AIDS since its \ndiscovery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/06/senate-section/article/S5487-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               125TH ANNIVERSARY OF HUNTER, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD.

A bill to authorize major medical facility projects and \nmajor medical facility leases for the Department of Veterans Affairs \nfor fiscal years 2006 and 2007, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to introduce \nlegislation to authorize major medical facility projects and major \nmedical facility leases for the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA. \nMost VA hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, and research facilities have \nongoing needs for maintenance, repair, and modernization to promote \npatient and employee safety and provide a higher standard of care for \nour Nation's veterans. Earlier this month, I held a hearing of the \nSenate Committee on Veterans' Affairs on these needs, at which VA and a \nservice organization representative delivered testimony about what is \nrequired in the next phase of addressing the needs of health care \nfacilities for our Nation's veterans. In addition, several committee \nmembers and noncommittee colleagues remarked about the significance of \nthese projects to their States. It is my belief that this bill will \nexpand VA's ability to provide health care services to this group of \ndeserving Americans. I will take a few moments now to explain the \nprovisions of this legislation.\n  First, the bill authorizes three major medical facility projects in \nimmediate need of fiscal year 2006 authorization; the restoration of \nVA's health care infrastructure in the Biloxi and New Orleans areas \nfollowing Hurricane Katrina, and the cost of land acquisition for \nreplacement of the current Denver VA Medical Center with a new facility \nat the former Fitzsimons Army Medical Center. The Denver facility was \nconstructed over a half-century ago and many of the core facilities \nhave been deemed to be past or near the end of their useful life.\n  Second, this legislation reauthorizes 18 major medical facility \nconstruction projects that were authorized under Public Law 108-170, \nbut for which it is unlikely that contract awards will be accomplished \nby September 30, 2006, as required by that law. Therefore, for each of \nthese projects, the draft bill extends the date by which contracts must \nbe awarded, from September 30, 2006, September 20, 2009. These projects \nwere identified and prioritized under the capital asset realignment for \nenhanced services process. CARES, as it has become known, is a market-\nbased national assessment of infrastructure needs that VA has developed \ninto a schedule for completion. These projects represent the most \npressing CARES-identified needs that VA has undertaken in order to \nimprove access-to-care and provide services in areas of recent, \ncurrent, and projected growth in veterans population, such as Las Vegas \nand Orlando. To allow a lapse in VA's authority to move forward on \nthese projects would result in tremendous setbacks, and conceivably, \nadditional taxpayer expense.\n\n  Third, the legislation authorizes major medical facility leases that \ndid not receive. authorization in the current fiscal for outpatient \nclinics in Baltimore, MD, Marion, IL, and the Dallas, TX, area. In \naddition, five major medical facility leases fiscal year 2007 are \nincluded for outpatient clinics in Austin, TX, Lowell, MA, Grand \nRapids, MI, Las Vegas, NV, and Parma, OH.\n  This legislation represents the administration's request of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee and the Congress, with a significant \nexception. I have chosen not to authorize the six requested fiscal year \n2007 major medical facility construction projects at this time. I want \nto make it clear to my colleagues that my intent is not to micromanage \nVA's construction budget or to delay the Department's capital plan. And \nno one in the Senate is more committed to seeing that we are not \ndiverting important resources away from facilities that are extremely \nimportant to our veterans. But as chairman of this committee, my \napproach\n\n[[Page S5493]]\n\nputs Congress on record as expecting progress with the 18 CARES \nprojects on which we are extending authorizations, attaching a \nreasonable amount of money to those efforts, and then monitoring the \nprogress closely from the Veterans' Committee. As we have seen with the \nneed for significant and expensive Katrina-related construction, VA's \ncapital plan requires consistent monitoring, frequent review and, at \ntimes, significant modification. But VA must finish some of what it has \nstarted before taking on new major projects.\n  Over the next several weeks, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs will \nbe taking up this bill and other legislation introduced to improve the \nrange of services and benefits available to our Nation's veterans. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues throughout the rest of this \nCongress on these and other important efforts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3421\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the tax treatment of income received \nin connection with the litigation concerning the Exxon Valdez oil \nspill; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that will \nhelp the commercial fishermen and others whose livelihoods were \nnegatively impacted by the Exxon Valdez oilspill.\n  As all of us know, the Exxon Valdez ran aground on March 23, 1989, \nspilling 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound in Alaska. \nA class action jury trial was held in Federal court in Anchorage, AK, \nin 1994. The plaintiffs included 32,000 fishermen among others whose \nlivelihoods were gravely affected by this disaster. The jury awarded $5 \nbillion in punitive\n\n[[Page S5494]]\n\ndamages to the plaintiff class. The punitive damage award has been on \nrepeated appeal by the Exxon Corporation since 1994. Many of the \noriginal plaintiffs, possibly more than 1,000 people, have already \ndied.\n  Once the punitive damage award of the Exxon Valdez litigation is \nsettled, many fishermen will receive payments to reimburse them for \nfishing income lost due to the environmental consequences of the Exxon \nValdez oilspill. It is estimated that the eventual settlement could be \n$6.75 billion or more.\n  My bill gives the affected fishermen, as well as other plaintiffs in \nthis case, a fair shake when it comes to contributions to retirement \nplans and averaging of income for tax purposes.\n  With respect to retirement plan contributions, my bill increases the \ncaps on both deductions and income for traditional IRAs to the extent \nof the income a plaintiff receives from the settlement or judgment. \nAlso, it allows the plaintiffs to make contributions to Roth IRAs and \nother retirement plans to the extent of the income received from the \nsettlement or judgment.\n  Fishermen are currently allowed to average their income over a \nseveral year period due to the often inconsistent nature of the fishing \nbusiness. The litigation stemming from the Exxon Valdez oilspill poses \nan even more unique situation since fishermen and other plaintiffs have \nbeen waiting to receive lost income--in the form of a settlement or \njudgment--for 12 years. My bill allows plaintiffs to average their \nincome for the period of time between December 31 of the year they \nreceive the settlement or judgment payment and January 1, 1994--the \nyear of the original jury award in Federal court.\n  It is imperative that we address this important issue soon. The Exxon \nCorporation has appealed this case and a decision is expected later \nthis year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3422\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TAX TREATMENT OF INCOME RECEIVED IN CONNECTION \n                   WITH THE EXXON VALDEZ LITIGATION.\n\n       (a) Income Averaging of Amounts Received From the Exxon \n     Valdez Litigation.--\n       (1) In general.--At the election of a qualified taxpayer \n     who receives qualified settlement income during a taxable \n     year, the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 for such taxable year shall be equal to the sum \n     of--\n       (A) the tax which would be imposed under such chapter if--\n       (i) no amount of elected qualified settlement income were \n     included in gross income for such year, and\n       (ii) no deduction were allowed for such year for expenses \n     (otherwise allowable as a deduction to the taxpayer for such \n     year) attributable to such elected qualified settlement \n     income, plus\n       (B) the increase in tax under such chapter which would \n     result if taxable income for each of the years in the \n     applicable period were increased by an amount equal to the \n     applicable fraction of the elected qualified settlement \n     income reduced by any expenses (otherwise allowable as a \n     deduction to the taxpayer) attributable to such elected \n     qualified settlement income.\n\n     Any adjustment under this section for any taxable year shall \n     be taken into account in applying this section for any \n     subsequent taxable year.\n       (2) Coordination with farm income averaging.--If a \n     qualified taxpayer makes an election with respect to any \n     qualified settlement income under paragraph (1) for any \n     taxable year, such taxpayer may not elect to treat such \n     amount as elected farm income under section 1301 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (3) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection--\n       (A) Applicable period.--The term ``applicable period'' \n     means the period beginning on January 1, 1994, and ending on \n     December 31 of the year in which the elected qualified \n     settlement income is received.\n       (B) Applicable fraction.--The term ``applicable fraction'' \n     means the fraction the numerator of which is one and the \n     denominator of which is the number of years in the applicable \n     period.\n       (C) Elected qualified settlement income.--The term \n     ``elected qualified settlement income'' means so much of the \n     taxable income for the taxable year which is--\n       (i) qualified settlement income, and\n       (ii) specified under the election under paragraph (1).\n       (b) Contributions of Amounts Received to Retirement \n     Accounts.--\n       (1) In general.--Any qualified taxpayer who receives \n     qualified settlement income during the taxable year may, at \n     any time before the end of the taxable year in which such \n     income was received, make one or more contributions to an \n     eligible retirement plan of which such qualified taxpayer is \n     a beneficiary in an aggregate amount not to exceed the amount \n     of qualified settlement income received during such year.\n       (2) Time when contributions deemed made.--For purposes of \n     paragraph (1), a qualified taxpayer shall be deemed to have \n     made a contribution to an eligible retirement plan on the \n     last day of the taxable year in which such income is received \n     if the contribution is made on account of such taxable year \n     and is made not later than the time prescribed by law for \n     filing the return for such taxable year (not including \n     extensions thereof).\n       (3) Treatment of contributions to eligible retirement \n     plans.--For purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, if \n     a contribution is made pursuant to paragraph (1) with respect \n     to qualified settlement income, then--\n       (A) except as provided in paragraph (4)--\n       (i) to the extent of such contribution, the qualified \n     settlement income shall not be included in taxable income, \n     and\n       (ii) for purposes of section 72 of such Code, such \n     contribution shall not be considered to be investment in the \n     contract, and\n       (B) the qualified taxpayer shall, to the extent of the \n     amount of the contribution, be treated--\n       (i) as having received the qualified settlement income--\n\n       (I) in the case of a contribution to an individual \n     retirement plan (as defined under section 7701(a)(37) such \n     Code), in a distribution described in section 408(d)(3) of \n     such Code, and\n       (II) in the case of any other eligible retirement plan, in \n     an eligible rollover distribution (as defined under section \n     402(f)(2) of such Code), and\n\n       (ii) as having transferred the amount to the eligible \n     retirement plan in a direct trustee to trustee transfer \n     within 60 days of the distribution.\n       (4) Special rule for roth iras and roth 401(k)s.--For \n     purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, if a \n     contribution is made pursuant to paragraph (1) with respect \n     to qualified settlement income to a Roth IRA (as defined \n     under section 408A(b) of such Code) or as a designated Roth \n     contribution to an applicable retirement plan (within the \n     meaning of section 402A of such Code), then--\n       (A) the qualified settlement income shall be includible in \n     taxable income, and\n       (B) for purposes of section 72 of such Code, such \n     contribution shall be considered to be investment in the \n     contract.\n       (5) Eligible retirement plan.--For purpose of this \n     subsection, the term ``eligible retirement plan'' has the \n     meaning given such term under section 402(c)(8)(B) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (c) Qualified Settlement Income Not Included in SECA.--For \n     purposes of chapter 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     and section 211 of the Social Security Act, no portion of \n     qualified settlement income shall be treated as gross income \n     derived from a trade or business carried on by a qualified \n     taxpayer.\n       (d) Qualified Taxpayer.--For purposes of this section, the \n     term ``qualified taxpayer'' means any plaintiff in the civil \n     action In re Exxon Valdez, No. 89-095-CV (HRH) (Consolidated) \n     (D. Alaska).\n       (e) Qualified Settlement Income.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``qualified settlement income'' means \n     income received (whether as lump sums or periodic payments) \n     in connection with the civil action In re Exxon Valdez, No. \n     89-095-CV (HRH) (Consolidated) (D. Alaska).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 3432. A bill to protect children from exploitation by adults over \nthe Internet, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, over the past few years, we have heard \nthe tragic stories of how sexual predators have targeted children in \nour states. We have seen troubling headlines from Pennsylvania and \nacross the country, and the frequency seems to be increasing rather \nthan decreasing. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children \nin partnership with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Bureau of \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Postal \nInspection Service, state and local law enforcement, and Internet \nCrimes Against Children Task Forces operates the CyberTipline. The \nnumber of referrals to the ICAC task forces has increased from 2,002 \nreferrals in January-March 2005 to 3,392 referrals in January-March \n2006. Additionally, the prosecutions in child pornography and child \nabuse cases have increased nearly every year since 1995.\n  Recently Congress has heard disturbing and saddening accounts of how \nthese predators have used the Internet to exploit our children. As a \nfather of six, I am keenly aware of the dangers\n\n[[Page S5495]]\n\nto our children and the concerns of parents across Pennsylvania and the \nNation. In February, the Department of Justice launched Project Safe \nChildhood, a initiative to ``combat the proliferation of technology-\nfacilitated sexual exploitation crimes against children.''\n  ``Project Safe Childhood'' has five main purposes. First, it seeks to \nintegrate Federal, State, and local efforts to investigate and \nprosecute child exploitation cases including partnerships by each U.S. \nAttorney with each Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force in their \ndistrict, other Federal, State, and local law enforcement, and \ncommunity and faith-based organizations to develop district-specific \nstrategic plans to combat and prosecute child exploitation crimes. \nSecond, the Project allows major case coordination by the Department of \nJustice or other appropriate Federal agency. Third, it increases \nFederal involvement in child exploitation cases by providing additional \ninvestigative tools and increased penalties available under Federal \nlaw. Fourth, the Project provides increased training of Federal, State, \nand local law enforcement regarding the investigation and prosecution \nof computer-facilitated crimes against children. Finally, it promotes \ncommunity awareness and educational programs to raise national \nawareness about the threat of online sexual predators and to provide \ninformation to families on how to report possible violations.\n  According to recent Congressional testimony from Alice S. Fisher, \nAssistant U.S. Attorney in charge of the Criminal Division, and from \nWilliam W. Mercer, Principle Associate Deputy Attorney General noted, \nthis initiative is working.\n  On May 17, 2006, the Department of Justice released a document that \noutlines the need for this project, an overview of the program and \nguides for how law enforcement, parents, teachers, and communities can \ncome together to implement this program effectively. While I am \nencouraged by the DOJ actions to raise the profile and enforcement \nthrough Project Safe Childhood--and appreciate all that many at the \nDepartment of Justice and the State and local levels are doing to catch \nand prosecute these predators--I am concerned that this program does \nnot have the legislative authorization or dedicated funding that it \nneeds to accomplish its goal of protecting our children.\n  I intend to work to help the Department of Justice fully implement \nand expand this initiative, therefore, I am introducing the Project \nSafe Childhood Authorization Act. Specifically, the bill will authorize \nand expand Project Safe Childhood; add new elements regarding child \nexploitation crimes that have been requested by the Department of \nJustice to strengthen the requirements to effectively report child \npornography, require warning labels on commercial Websites that contain \nsexually explicit material, and prohibit the embedding of words or \nimages on a Website in order to deceive individuals into viewing \nobscenity or material harmful to minors; increase penalties for \nregistered sex offenders, child sex trafficking and sexual abuse, and \nother child exploitation crimes; create Children's Safety Online \nAwareness Campaigns; and authorize grants for online child safety \nprograms.\n  The bill authorizes $18 million for fiscal year 2007 for the initial \nimplementation of Project Safe Childhood, and up to $29 million for the \nexpansion of the program for fiscal year 2007, and such sums as may be \nnecessary for each of the 5 succeeding fiscal years.\n  I know all of us--particularly those of us with children--want to \nknow how to keep our children safe, and want to know that anyone that \nendangers or harms our children will be punished. I am glad to be here \nto take this important step in protecting our children. I hope my \ncolleagues will agree with me and we will pass the Project Safe \nChildhood Authorization Act this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 3449. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve the \nquality and availability of mental health services for children and \nadolescents; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions,\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that seeks \nto meet the mental health needs of children and adolescents.\n  I believe that the task of ensuring the emotional well-being and \nresiliency of our young people is one of paramount importance. We all \nknow that mental health is a critical component contributing to a \nchild's general health and ability to grow--both intellectually and \nphysically. Yet, the task of ensuring the mental health of children and \nadolescents is not an easy one. In fact, it is arguably one of the most \ndifficult and largely unspoken tasks facing our Nation today.\n  According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration, one in ten children and adolescents suffers from mental \nhealth disorders serious enough to cause some level of impairment. Out \nof these young people, only one in five receives the specialty mental \nhealth services they require.\n  These startling statistics prompted former Surgeon General Dr. David \nSatcher to convene a conference in 1999 that examined the mental health \nneeds of children. The conference--composed of some of the Nation's \nleading experts in mental and public health--published a seminal report \nthat concluded that\n`` . . . the burden of suffering experienced by children with mental \nillness and their families has created a health crisis in this \ncountry.'' The report further concluded that ``. . . there is broad \nevidence that the Nation lacks a unified infrastructure to help \nchildren suffering from mental illness.''\n  I would like to submit for the Record personal testimony offered by \nthree families in Connecticut. I believe their words and experiences \nspeak most directly to the ``burden of suffering'' described in Surgeon \nGeneral Satcher's report--a burden endured by millions of children, \nadolescents, and then families nationwide. I ask unanimous consent that \nthis testimony be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Testimony\n\n       Dear Senator Dodd, I wanted to take a moment to share with \n     you what my experience has been navigating services for my \n     son who has been diagnosed with severe psychosis and bipolar \n     disorder. Due to the lack of psychiatric services when the \n     extended day program my son attended was closed down, my son \n     as well as seven other kids where left without the services \n     they so needed. After a couple of weeks they started to have \n     meltdowns. My son was one of them. The fact that he attended \n     a therapeutic school didn't at this point make a difference. \n     After two short hospitalizations (one was for two weeks the \n     other four weeks) my son, who is 12 years old, has been \n     sitting at [a mental health services facility] for the past 9 \n     weeks awaiting availability for sub-acute care. In the \n     meantime he is not receiving the level of care that he needs.\n       Services are so limited at this point in time that because \n     of time of delivery children who may have benefitted from \n     less intensive intervention are being put in a position where \n     by the time they receive care they are in need of higher \n     level care that to me doesn't seem very cost effective when \n     you look at long term care. I often think about what would be \n     different if my child was diabetic. Would he only receive \n     services when available, and would they be appropriate to his \n     medical needs?\n       I can't explain in one letter what my son's illness has \n     done to our family and how difficult it is for all of us. \n     Mental Health is a cruel monster who enters your life in \n     sometimes undetected ways and when it finally attacks the \n     blow can be fatal. The media has succeeded in painting a \n     picture of individuals like my son as real dangers to society \n     if not in proper treatment but what they have failed to shed \n     light on is the lack of such services. My son deserves a \n     better quality of services as well as a better quality of \n     life.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Dodd, The following is to share some of what \n     my family is struggling with due to my son's mental illness. \n     My son has been diagnosed with severe depression and mood \n     disorder; he has mutilated himself various times and is a \n     cutter. [My son] has been hospitalized three times due to \n     this ongoing behavior; he is in need of sub-acute treatment \n     but has only received stabilization services and out-patient \n     services because the level of treatment that he needs is not \n     available for boys 14 years or older. In the meantime we have \n     extended day programs, voluntary services as well as systems \n     of care in place yet the services he needs are not available. \n     For a mother with three additional children with special \n     needs I have serious concerns for my son's safety. Who will \n     be accountable if at some point my son succeeds in taking his \n     own life when I have seeked services and I am told over \n     and over again that they are not available?\n       I really would like Congress to take a look at the great \n     deal of families fighting our own personal battles with these \n     unseen enemies.\n\n[[Page S5496]]\n\n     We need weapons if we are to win these battles. We need more \n     psychiatric services made available to all of our children \n     regardless of age or gender.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Dodd, My son was always ``different,'' \n     ``difficult,'' and ``didn't socialize well with the other \n     children,'' according to the daycare centers, camps, after \n     school programs and even in the early part of kindergarten. \n     His kindergarten school teacher was concerned enough to refer \n     us to the school social worker when he held a plastic knife \n     up to a fellow classmates throat and said he was going to \n     slit it. She suggested parenting classes and perhaps family \n     therapy. Since it was only my son and I as I was divorced and \n     his father was not in the picture, of course I eagerly \n     complied. I brought him to his pediatrician as well, who \n     suggested behavior modification and consistency. No one was \n     more consistent than I was a parent. I learned this early on \n     with my son.\n       I sat through hours of parenting tapes, learning nothing \n     new, while my son played with Legos and puppets. This service \n     was on a sliding fee scale offered by our town and even so \n     all I could afford to go was every other week. When my son \n     was seven years old I woke up in the wee hours of the morning \n     to find him standing in the middle of the kitchen surrounded \n     by knives holding onto one in each hand. Although I was \n     shocked and more scared than I had ever been in my entire \n     life I instinctively knew I had to stay calm, that this was \n     something beyond his control. I asked him what he was doing \n     up, maintaining eye contact, and he said that there was a \n     devil on one side telling him to hurt himself and an angel on \n     the other telling him not to. I gathered up the knives as he \n     was talking and spoke gently to my son who was so clearly in \n     such pain. He gave me the knives without even realizing he \n     was doing it, and I scooped him up and we waited for his \n     psychiatrist's office to open. He had been seeing a \n     psychiatrist for 6 months or so, and was on stimulants for \n     ADHD (the first diagnosis of choice as usual for children).\n       The doctor immediately added depression with psychotic \n     features as another diagnosis and suggested hospitalization. \n     The first of many hospitalizations my son would experience \n     and the doctor also added an antipsychotic and antidepressant \n     medication to the regiment. My son was in the hospital for 10 \n     days and was no better, so additional diagnoses were added, \n     oppositional defiant disorder, impulse control disorder and \n     anxiety disorder as well as more medications. He started \n     individual therapy regularly, seeing the psychiatrist and \n     along with the medications the co-pays were more than I could \n     afford, I applied for HUSKY. I was accepted, thankfully I \n     thought at the time.\n       My son was rapidly becoming worse, so I went to the \n     Department of Children and Families for help through \n     Voluntary Services. This is insulting to caring parents \n     trying to find help for their children as the request has to \n     be made via the Hotline and is an embarrassment. However, it \n     is the only way to gain access to certain services in the \n     State that are not offered through private insurance \n     companies. By now, my son is almost ten years old and has \n     been hospitalized many times, in several partial \n     hospitalizations, intensive outpatient hospitalization \n     programs and extended day treatment programs. He has also \n     been removed from the public school systems special \n     education program and out-placed into a therapeutic day \n     program for school out of district.\n       I made a call to the head of a psychiatric unit at a \n     hospital who I had come to know through my work to ask for a \n     referral for my son as I thought perhaps this was something \n     more than what the doctors were saying. He referred me to \n     Mass. General's Pediatric Psychopharmacology Unit. I called, \n     my son was seen within 3 weeks and a diagnosis of Early Onset \n     Bipolar Disorder as well as Major Multiple Anxiety Disorder \n     was given. My son had already had an appointment with a new \n     psychiatrist within the next couple of weeks and medications \n     were changed to reflect the new diagnosis--unfortunately, too \n     little too late.\n       My son, ended up in the hospital for 3 months and then in a \n     sub-acute unit 4\\1/2\\ months, despite all of the in-home \n     services we had on board, partially because the waiting time \n     between services were detrimental and the length of the \n     services were not long enough. When the service finally \n     started to work, it was time to pull out. My son never \n     engaged in any service because he knew if he got attached to \n     anyone they were going to be gone in a short time anyway and \n     his attitude was why bother? I can't say I blamed him. For a \n     child who needed consistency in his life there wasn't a lot \n     of it with the providers. He went to a residential setting \n     for 18 months following the sub-acute unit and finally came \n     back home. On his last day at the residential treatment \n     center he was assaulted by a staff member who was found \n     guilty and fired. At the same time, HUSKY notified me, that \n     my premium would increase to 221.00 per month as I was over \n     the income limit by 200.00 for a family of 2. I called and \n     tried to plead my case, as they were unaware of my living \n     expenses, such as rent, past medical bills I was trying to \n     catch up on, etc. but they go by gross income and don't take \n     into account any other issues. I placed my son on my work \n     insurance once again. Try as I might, I ended up filing for \n     bankruptcy two years later, the ultimate embarrassment as far \n     as I was concerned.\n       When my son came home, the discharge plan was to send him \n     to a summer program called the Wilderness School for the \n     summer. Unbeknownst to us this program was for juvenile \n     delinquents who were in trouble with the law for the majority \n     of their lives and in and out of the system. My son was \n     petrified, and refused to stay, even saying he would hurt \n     himself if they made him stay. I picked him up 1\\1/2\\ days \n     after dropping him off and scrambled to find childcare for \n     the summer once again.\n       Whether a family uses their own insurance or State \n     insurance and services, it is a catch 22. With private \n     insurance, services are extremely limited; both time limited \n     and the type of service that is available is limited. With \n     HUSKY, finding providers is extremely difficult. There are no \n     specialists that will take HUSKY patients, dentists, \n     orthodontists, neuropsychologists, psychiatrists, therapists \n     and the list goes on. As a parent trying to do the best for \n     her child it was very frustrating getting the door shut in my \n     face no matter where I turned for help. All I wanted was to \n     get my son the medical attention he so desperately needed, \n     and I had to fight for everything. In an already traumatic \n     time in my little family's life, this was an unnecessary \n     added burden.\n       My son is now a junior, still in special education, but in \n     a public high school. He's doing remarkably and I can say \n     that it isn't due to the services that he received but to his \n     own strength and courage to fight his way back and make it on \n     his own. His is truly an incredible young man and I am so \n     proud of him. I have a bumper sticker that reads, ``I am a \n     proud parent of an honor roll student'' which I never thought \n     I would have. He earned that on his own.\n       Thank you for this opportunity to share my story.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I thank these families for sharing their personal \nexperiences with me, and for following me to share their experiences \npublicly. More importantly, I commend their tenacity in facing the \nchallenges they face each and every day in caring for their children. \nTheir stories, along with the stories I have heard from other families \nin Connecticut and elsewhere in the country, have fueled my belief that \nchild and adolescent mental health needs to be a top priority.\n  Recognizing the fragmentation of the Nation's mental health delivery \nsystem, Surgeon General Satcher's report concluded that one fundamental \nway to meet the mental--health needs of children and adolescents is to \n``. . . move towards a community-based mental health delivery system \nthat balances health promotion, disease prevention, early detection, \nand universal access to care.'' The report further stated eight goals \nto ensure the resiliency of children and adolescents. These goals were: \nfirst, to promote public awareness of children's mental health issues \nand reduce stigma associated with mental illness; second, to continue \nto develop, disseminate, and implement scientifically-proven prevention \nand treatment services in the field of children's mental health; third, \nto improve the assessment of and recognition of mental health needs in \nchildren; fourth, to eliminate racial, ethnic and socioeconomic \ndisparities in access to mental health care services; fifth, to improve \nthe infrastructure for children's mental health services, including \nsupport for scientifically-proven interventions across professions; \nsixth, to increase access to and coordination of quality mental health \ncare services; seventh, to train frontline providers to recognize and \nmanage mental health issues, and educate mental healthcare providers \nabout scientifically-proven prevention and treatment services, and; \nfinally, to monitor the access to and coordination of quality mental \nhealth care services.\n\n  In 2002, President Bush established the President's New Freedom \nCommission on Mental Health to study three obstacles identified by the \nPresident that prevent Americans with mental illness from getting the \ncare they require. These obstacles were identified as the stigma that \nsurrounds mental health care, a lack of mental health parity, and the \nfragmented mental health delivery system. In 2003, the President's New \nFreedom Commission issued a report that made a series of \nrecommendations on how the Nation's mental health system could be \ntransformed for the better. Like Surgeon General Satcher's report, this \npublication also set forth a series of goals. They were: first, to \nensure Americans understand that mental health is essential to overall \nhealth; second, to ensure that mental health care is consumer- and \nfamily-driven; third, to eliminate disparities in mental health care \nservices; fourth, to ensure that\n\n[[Page S5497]]\n\nearly mental health screening, assessment, and referral services are \ncommon practices; fifth, to ensure that excellent mental health care is \ndelivered and research is accelerated, and; finally, to ensure that \ntechnology is used to access mental health care and information.\n  I describe these two reports because the legislation I am introducing \ntoday seeks to address the recommendations they espouse. My \nlegislation, the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Resiliency Act of \n2006, authorizes $210 million in an effort to meet five principal \nobjectives.\n  The first objective is to increase access to, and improve the quality \nof, mental health care services delivered to children and adolescents. \nMy legislation seeks to meet this objective in several ways.\n  First, it authorizes a new grant of $50 million for States to develop \nand implement a comprehensive mental health plan exclusively for \nchildren and adolescents that provides community-based mental health \nearly intervention and prevention services and relevant support \nservices, such as primary health care, education, transportation and \nhousing. The plan would have to meet a set of core operational and \nevaluative requirements and would have to be developed through \nextensive outside consultation with children and adolescents, their \nfamilies, advocates and health professionals.\n  Second, my legislation authorizes two matching grants of $22.5 \nmillion each for community health centers--many of which primarily \nserve low-income populations and primary health care facilities, such \nas a pediatrician's office, to provide community-based mental health \nservices in coordination with community mental health centers and/or \ntrained mental health professionals.\n  Third, my legislation authorizes a new grant of $22.5 million for \nStates, localities and private nonprofit organizations--e.g., school \ndistricts--to provide community-based mental health services in schools \nappropriate mental health training activities to relevant school and \nhealth professionals.\n  Fourth, my legislation authorizes a new grant of $20 million for \nStates, localities and private nonprofit organizations to provide \ncommunity-based mental health services specifically for at-risk mothers \nand their children.\n  Fifth, my legislation authorizes a new grant of $10 million for \nStates, localities and private nonprofit organizations to provide \ncommunity-based mental health services for children and adolescents in \njuvenile justice systems.\n  Sixth, my legislation authorizes $10 million for the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to establish, run and evaluate a \ndemonstration project that improves the ability of local case managers \nto work across the mental health, public health, substance abuse, child \nwelfare, education, juvenile justice and social services systems in a \nState.\n  Finally, my legislation requires States to meet their statutory \nobligations to fund fully mental health screening services under the \nEarly and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment Services \nProgram. It also requires current successful initiatives, such as the \nComprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children with \nSerious Emotional Disturbance Program, the Community Mental Health \nServices Performance Partnership Block Grant, the Community Mental \nHealth Services Block Grant, and the Jail Diversion Program, to expand \ntheir scope with respect to certain reporting, evaluative, and service \nactivities.\n  The second objective my legislation seeks to meet is ensuring greater \npublic awareness and greater family participation in mental health \nservices decision-making. Towards this end, my legislation does the \nfollowing:\n  First, it authorizes a new grant of $10 million for States, \nlocalities and private nonprofit organizations to develop policies that \nenable families of children and adolescents with mental health \ndisorders to have increased control and choice over mental health \nservices provided and received through a publicly-funded mental health \nsystem.\n  Second, it authorizes a new grant of $10 million for private \nnonprofit organizations to provide information on child and adolescent \nmental health disorders, services, support services and respite care to \nfamilies of children and adolescents with or who are at risk for mental \nhealth disorders.\n\n  Third, it authorizes a new grant of $10 million for private nonprofit \norganizations to develop community coalitions and public education \nactivities that promote child and adolescent resiliency.\n  In addition, my legislation authorizes $10 million to establish two \nnew technical assistance centers. These centers are designed to collect \nand disseminate information on mental health disorders, mental health \ndisorder risk factors, mental health services, mental health service \naccess, relevant support services, reducing seclusion and restraints, \nand family participation in mental health service decision-making--\nexclusively for children and adolescents with or at risk of mental \nhealth disorders.\n  The third objective that this legislation seeks to meet is for the \nFederal Government to develop a policy specifically designed to meet \nthe unique mental health needs of children and adolescents. The \nlegislation authorizes $10 million for the establishment of an \ninteragency coordinating committee consisting of all Federal officials \nwhose departments or agencies oversee mental health activities for \nchildren and adolescents. Modeled after language in the Garrett Lee \nSmith Memorial Act, my legislation requires the coordinating committee \nto consult with outside parties, develop a Federal policy exclusively \npertaining to child and adolescent mental health, and report annually \nto Congress on specific challenges and solutions associated with \ncomprehensively addressing the mental health needs of children and \nadolescents.\n  The fourth and final objective that this legislation seeks to meet is \nincreasing the amount of research into child and adolescent mental \nhealth. Only through intensive research can we develop evidence-based \nbest practices that allow us to develop services that fully meet the \nmental health needs of our children. Towards that end, my legislation \nauthorizes a new grant of $12.5 million for States, localities, \ninstitutions of higher education and private nonprofit organizations to \nidentify and research current service, training and information \nawareness gaps in mental health delivery systems for children and \nadolescents. My legislation also authorizes $12.5 million to enhance \ncomprehensive Federal research and evaluation of promising best \npractices, existing disparities, psychotropic medications, trauma, \nrecovery and rehabilitation, and co-occurring disorders as they relate \nto child and adolescent mental health.\n  My colleague on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, \nChairman Enzi, has indicated a desire to bring up the Substance Abuse \nand Mental Health Services Administration reauthorization measure soon. \nIt is my hope that this legislation can contribute to that \nreauthorization effort.\n  I would like to conclude by saying that this legislation, while \ncomprehensive, is a first step--not a complete solution--towards fully \nmeeting the challenge of ensuring the resiliency of our children and \nadolescents. We need to continue working together--young people, \nfamilies, doctors, counselors, nurses, teachers, advocates, and \npolicymakers--since we all have a stake, either professional or \npersonal--in this issue. Only by working together can we develop \neffective and compassionate ways through which every young person in \nthis nation is given a solid foundation upon which to reach his or her \ndreams in life.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3449\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the Surgeon General's Conference on \n     Children's Mental Health: A National Action Agenda, mental \n     health is a critical component of children's learning and \n     general health.\n       (2) According to the Surgeon General's Conference on \n     Children's Mental Health: A National Action Agenda, one in 10 \n     children and adolescents suffer from mental illness severe \n     enough to cause some level of impairment.\n       (3) According to the Surgeon General's Conference on \n     Children's Mental Health: A National Action Agenda, only one \n     in five children and adolescents who suffer from severe \n     mental illness receive the specialty mental health services \n     they require.\n       (4) According to the World Health Organization, childhood \n     neuropsychiatric disorders will rise by over 50 percent by \n     2020, internationally, to become one of the five most common \n     causes of morbidity, mortality, and disability among \n     children.\n       (5) According to the Surgeon General's Conference on \n     Children's Mental Health: A National Action Agenda, the \n     burden of suffering experienced by children with mental \n     illness and their families has created a health crisis in \n     this country.\n       (6) According to the Surgeon General's Conference on \n     Children's Mental Health: A National Action Agenda, there is \n     broad evidence that the nation lacks a unified infrastructure \n     to help children suffering from mental illness;\n       (7) According to the President's New Freedom Commission on \n     Mental Health, President George Bush identified three \n     obstacles preventing Americans with mental illness from \n     getting the care they require: stigma that surrounds mental \n     illness; unfair treatment limitations and financial \n     requirements placed on mental health benefits in private \n     health insurance, and; the fragmented mental health service \n     delivery system.\n       (8) According to the Surgeon General's Conference on \n     Children's Mental Health: A National Action Agenda, one way \n     to ensure that the country's health system meets the mental \n     health needs of children is to move towards a community-based \n     mental health delivery system that balances health promotion, \n     disease prevention, early detection, and universal access to \n     care.\n       (9) According to the President's New Freedom Commission on \n     Mental Health, transforming the country's mental health \n     delivery system rests on two principles: services and \n     treatments must be consumer and family-centered, and; care \n     must focus on increasing a person's ability to successfully \n     cope with life's challenges, on facilitating recovery, and \n     building resiliency.\n       (10) According to the Surgeon General's Conference on \n     Children's Mental Health: A National Action Agenda, the \n     mental health and resiliency of children can be ensured by \n     methods that: promote public awareness of children's mental \n     health issues and reduce stigma associated with mental \n     illness; continue to develop, disseminate, and implement \n     scientifically-proven prevention and treatment services in \n     the field of children's mental health; improve the assessment \n     of and recognition of mental health needs in children; \n     eliminate racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in \n     access to mental healthcare services; improve the \n     infrastructure for children's mental health services, \n     including support for scientifically-proven interventions \n     across professions; increase access to and coordination of \n     quality mental healthcare services; train frontline providers \n     to recognize and manage mental health issues, and educate \n     mental healthcare providers about scientifically-proven \n     prevention and treatment services, and; monitor the access to \n     and coordination of quality mental healthcare services.\n       (11) According to the President's New Freedom Commission on \n     Mental Health, the country's mental health delivery system \n     can be successfully transformed by methods that: ensure \n     Americans understand that mental health is essential to \n     overall health; ensure mental health care is consumer and \n     family-driven; eliminate disparities in mental healthcare \n     services; ensure early mental health screening, assessment, \n     and referral services are common practices; ensure that \n     excellent mental health care is delivered and research is \n     accelerated, and; technology is used to access mental health \n     care and information.\n\nTITLE I--STATE AND COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES CONCERNING THE MENTAL HEALTH OF \n                        CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve \nthe exchange of healthcare information through the use of technology, \nto encourage the creation, use and maintenance of lifetime electronic \nhealth records that may contain health plan and debit card \nfunctionality in independent health record banks, to use such records \nto build a nationwide health information technology infrastructure, and \nto promote participation in health information exchange by consumers \nthrough tax incentives and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would address one of the most critical issues facing Americans \ntoday, that of rising health care costs. America's collective health \ncare bill represents an increasing percentage of the GDP and, at the \nsame time, mortality rates remain stubbornly high. It is apparent that \nthe time has come for innovative health care solutions that will save \nmoney and save lives.\n  Today, I am introducing the Independent Health Record Bank Act of \n2006, a market-driven approach that will save both money and lives by \ncreating a self-sustaining National Health Information Network for \ndoctors and patients. Rather than continuing to get by with a patchwork \nsystem of paper records that contributes to medical errors and high \ncost, this legislation creates a nationwide system of secure electronic \nhealth records. Under the Independent Health Record Bank Act, ownership \nof the record is truly independent and consumer-focused, as this type \nof bank provides the objective service of sustaining individual \nelectronic health records, much like the way financial institutions \nmaintain assets. This consumer-driven approach will offer Americans \nportable and electronic health records over their lifetime at little to \nno cost, with specific, established measures for privacy and security.\n  We saw in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, when medical records \nand lab results were literally washed away, that the current system of \npaper records can prove to be cumbersome at best, and fatal at worst. \nAmericans should have the ability to access their health records as \neasily as they access their bank accounts--through the use of a \nnational IT network administered by cooperative, not-for-profit \ninstitutions. I urge my colleagues to support this effort through \ncosponsorship of this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 3455. A bill to establish a program to transfer surplus computers \nof Federal agencies to schools, nonprofit community-based educational \norganizations, and families of members of the Armed Forces who are \ndeployed, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which \nis intended to ensure that more surplus government computers are put to \ngood use in our schools and by families of deployed service members.\n  Each year, it is becoming more and more evident that, especially for \nour youth, computer knowledge is essential for success. While many \nAmericans have computers at home, there are still many Americans who do \nnot have that easy access to computer technology. In addition, not all \nof our schools have or can afford up-to-date computer technology to aid \ntheir students in their learning. This bill is intended to bridge this \ngap.\n  It has been estimated that each week, the Federal Government disposes \nof 10,000 computers. Thanks in part to Executive Order 12999, which was \nissued in 1996, some of these computers are placed in schools that \nwould otherwise not have access to this technology. The Executive order \ndirects that federal agencies shall safeguard and identify potentially \neducationally useful federal equipment that is no longer needed or \ndeclared surplus. This equipment shall then be transferred directly or \nthrough the Government Services Administration Computers for Learning \nprogram to public and private schools and nonprofit organizations, \nincluding community-based educational organizations. Schools and \nnonprofits in enterprise communities or empowerment zones are \nprioritized in receiving these computers.\n  I have been pleased to be able to work through the related program in \nthe Senate to place excess computers in several Pennsylvania schools \nwhere\n\n[[Page S5505]]\n\nthey are being put to good use. Unfortunately, I have heard from those \nworking in Pennsylvania to obtain such computers that not enough of \nthem are getting through to schools. They are experiencing increased \ndifficulty in maintaining the number and quality of computers they were \npreviously able to get from the government for refurbishment and \ndonation. In some cases, hard drives are being needlessly destroyed \nbefore they are turned over.\n  One of the problems that has prevented schools from getting and using \nthese computers is that many times they are not able to be immediately \nput into use by the school. Schools may not have the technical ability \nor storage space to take computers directly from the government if they \nneed maintenance before they can be placed into service. It has been \nestimated that if schools get the computers directly from the \ngovernment, only 10 percent can be put into use. However, if they are \nfirst refurbished, 40 percent can be used.\n  The hope is that this legislation would result in federal agencies \nmaking more surplus computers available for schools by codifying the \nprevious Executive order. The bill would also allow computers to go \ndirectly to nonprofits for refurbishing before going to the school, \nmaking is easier for more schools to participate in the program. \nCurrently, a school has to take title to the computer and then can \ntransfer it to a nonprofit refurbisher to be fixed up, an additional \nstep for them. This bill would allow nonprofit organizations like \nComputers for Schools that can refurbish computers at low-cost to \nparticipate in the process, getting computers ready to use and sending \nthem out to schools where they last three more years, enabling more \nchildren to learn and profit by them. To prevent the needless \ndestruction of hard drives, the bill also references federal standards \non how to completely and securely erase hard drives without destroying \nthem.\n  Lastly, this bill includes language that would make it possible to \ndistribute these computers to the families of deployed service men and \nwomen who do not have a computer in their homes so that they can stay \nin better touch with their family members while they are fighting for \nour country.\n  I believe this legislation is an important step to help ensure that \nsurplus federal computers are put to good use by allowing more of our \nyouth to have access to computers in school. I am hopeful that this \nlegislation will be enacted into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MENENDEZ:\n  S. 3456. A bill to ensure the implementation of the recommendations \nof the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States; \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, first, I congratulate my colleagues in \nthe House, Representatives Shays and Maloney, for their hard work on \nthis legislation and for introducing H.R. 5017, the companion \nlegislation to the bill I am introducing today.\n  Almost 5 years ago, our country was attacked by terrorists on \nSeptember 11, 2001. This attack on our cities, on our symbols, on our \ndemocracy, and on our way of life killed nearly 3,000 Americans and \nover 700 people from my home State of New Jersey. But this attack could \nnot kill our determination to preserve our freedom, our values, and our \ndemocratic system.\n  Almost 2 years ago, the 9/11 Commission published their riveting \naccount of what happened on that terrible day and made 41 unanimous and \nbipartisan recommendations to make our country safer from future \nterrorist attacks.\n  Six months ago, the 9/11 Public Discourse Project published a \ndisturbing report card giving more F's than A's on the implementation \nof those 41 recommendations.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation to finally and fully implement \nthe 41 bipartisan and unanimous recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. \nThe former Chairman of the 9/11 Commission, Thomas Kean, and the former \nVice Chairman, Lee Hamilton, endorsed this same legislation in the \nHouse, H.R. 5017 Shays-Maloney. In a letter, Mr. Kean and Mr. Hamilton \nsaid that the legislation ``represents a comprehensive approach to \ncarry out each of the recommendations of the Commission . . . [and] \nfocuses on urgent unfinished business before the Nation\n. . .''\n  It is the responsibility of the Congress to carry out this urgent \nunfinished business. We certainly need this comprehensive legislation \nat a time when the disastrous Dubai Ports World deal made it clear that \nour ports are not safe and those who live and work near them are not \nsecure; the Department of Homeland Security is increasing homeland \nsecurity funding for small cities while cutting it to New York and \nWashington, DC; first responders still don't have the ability to \ncommunicate with each other during a disaster; nuclear weapons in the \nhands of a terrorist remain one of the greatest threats to our Nation, \nyet the 9/11 Public Discourse Project gave the administration a D on \nprogress towards fixing this problem; and hundreds of Afghans have been \nkilled in the recent violent resurgence of the Taliban.\n  Since immediately after September 11, many of us in Congress have \nbeen working to learn the hard lessons from those attacks so we can \nprepare for and prevent future terrorist acts. Shortly after the \nattacks, I introduced comprehensive homeland security legislation and \nserved on the first ad-hoc Homeland Security Committee in the House.\n  I was a strong supporter of the creation of the 9/11 Commission and \nintroduced a proposal on the House floor to fully implement the 9/11 \nCommission recommendation in 2004 during the initial debate on the \nrecommendations. I then served as a House negotiator on and helped \nsecure passage of the final landmark intelligence reform bill that was \nthe first step in implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations. \nIntroducing this legislation today is the next important step in \nprotecting our country against terrorism. I certainly agree with the \nformer heads of the 9/11 Commission that passing this bill should be a \ntop priority for this Congress.\n  I think all of us were shocked last week when the Department of \nHomeland Security actually slashed overall homeland security grant \nfunding for New York, Washington, DC, and New Jersey, while increasing \nfunding for much smaller areas with fewer terrorist targets.\n  DHS slashed these funds in spite of the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendation which said that ``Homeland Security assistance should be \nbased strictly--strictly--on an assessment of risks and \nvulnerabilities.''\n  And that is exactly what I fought for when I introduced the Menendez \nsubstitute to the intelligence reform bill in 2004. That is exactly \nwhat I fought for in the conference report on that legislation and what \nI sought to accomplish in the House when I introduced the Risk-Based \nHomeland Security Funding Act with Senators Corzine and Lautenberg. And \nthat is exactly what the legislation I am introducing today would do.\n  As many of you know, New Jersey faces unique terrorism threats that \nrequire a greater portion of homeland security aid due to its proximity \nto New York City and to its vast number of potential targets of terror, \nsuch as the largest container seaport on the east coast, one of the \nbusiest airports in the country, an area known as the ``chemical \ncoastway,'' our four nuclear power plants, and the six tunnels and \nbridges that connect New Jersey to New York City.\n  And if that were not enough, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has \nplaced more than a dozen New Jersey sites on the National Critical \nInfrastructure List and has called the area in my former congressional \ndistrict between Port Elizabeth and Newark International Airport the \n``most dangerous two miles in the United States when it comes to \nterrorism.'' An article in The New York Times pointed out that this 2-\nmile area provides ``a convenient way to cripple the economy by \ndisrupting major portions of the country's rail lines, oil storage \ntanks and refineries, pipelines, air traffic, communications networks \nand highway system.''\n  The bottom line is that States and municipalities, like New Jersey, \nwhich are under the greatest risk should receive homeland security \ndollars based solely on that risk. The funding awarded to Newark and \nJersey City clearly proves that New Jersey is well served when Federal \nhomeland security dollars are awarded based on risk. Yet I\n\n[[Page S5506]]\n\ncannot understand why the Department of Homeland Security would not use \na risk-based formula when awarding all of their grants. So long as \nHomeland Security grants are awarded based on factors other than risk, \nthose States most at risk will continue to lack the necessary resources \nto protect the people they serve.\n  I know that many Americans would also be shocked to learn that almost \n5 years after 9/11 and almost 1 year after Hurricane Katrina, many \nfirst responders still cannot communicate with each other during a \ndisaster.\n  In fact, when I speak to firefighters in my home State of New Jersey, \nthey consistently tell me that this remains a serious impediment to \ntheir work. In our port in New Jersey, the largest container port in \nthe east coast, firefighters, Coast Guard, police, and other law \nenforcement officials often still cannot communicate with each other. \nWhen Hurricane Katrina hit, emergency personnel were on at least five \ndifferent channels and were hampered in communicating with one another. \nAs the Washington Post reported on September 2, 2005, ``Police officers \nand National Guard members, along with law officers imported from \naround the State, rarely knew more than what they could see with their \nown eyes.''\n  It is astonishing that our firefighters, police, and paramedics still \ndo not have the ability to communicate in an emergency. How is it \npossible that almost 5 years after September 11, our local first \nresponders still do not have interoperable communications systems that \ncan talk with each other as they carry out their lifesaving work?\n  That is why my legislation would provide adequate radio spectrum for \nfirst responders and a status report on creating a unified incident \ncommand system during disasters.\n  In its final report card, the 9/11 Public Discourse Project gave the \nadministration a D for its efforts to secure WMDs. The former \nCommissioners then recommended that the U.S. Government make this issue \nthe top national security priority to counter what it called ``the \ngreatest threat to America's security.''\n  I certainly believe that a nuclear weapon in the hands of a terrorist \nis one of the greatest threats to our national security. Osama Bin \nLaden himself has said that it is al-Qaida's ``religious duty'' to \nacquire weapons of mass destruction.\n  According to CNN, in January 2002, documents found in a house in \nKabul, Afghanistan, reportedly used by al-Qaida operatives included a \n25-page document filled with information about nuclear weapons. That \ndocument included a design for a nuclear weapon that would require \nhard-to-obtain materials like plutonium to create a nuclear explosion.\n\n  One document appeared to be plans to create a nuclear device. \nAlthough experts contended that the design in this document labeled \n``superbombs'' is unworkable, the author, noted CNN, was clearly \nknowledgeable of various ways to set off a nuclear bomb.\n  In combination with the discovery of AQ Khan's clandestine nuclear \nsupermarket, the potential of al-Qaida building a nuclear weapon is not \na fairytale. In fact, according to CNN, al-Qaida may have had some help \nin its efforts to develop a nuclear device from two Pakistani nuclear \nscientists.\n  This bill works to ensure that the fairytale does not become a \ncataclysmic reality.\n  The bill specifically implements the 9/11 Commission's recommendation \nto expand programs to stop shipments of weapons of mass destruction. \nWith this legislation, the United States would also be able to extend \nour assistance to help countries control, protect, and dismantle their \nnuclear programs to countries outside of the former Soviet Union. It \nwould also create an Office of Nonproliferation Programs in the \nExecutive Office of the President to prevent terrorist access to WMDs. \nFinally, the bill includes a provision to enhance the Global Threat \nReduction Initiative and would require the President to establish a \nDepartment of Energy task force on nuclear materials removal.\n  I believe we all want to make sure that a nuclearized al-Qaida never \nbecomes a reality. And we should spare absolutely no effort in pursuing \nthis goal.\n  Many of us have been horrified as we have watched the resurgence of \nthe Taliban and strong anti-American sentiment in Afghanistan. Over \njust the past few weeks, over 250 people have been killed in the \nupsurge in violence, and we see techniques borrowed from Iraq, like the \nuse of improvised explosive devices, in Afghanistan. According to the \nNew York Times, Pentagon officials say that 32 suicide bombs were \nexploded in 2006, which is already 6 more than exploded in all of 2005. \nRoadside bombs are up 30 percent over last year, and the Taliban are \nfighting in groups triple the size of last year. And after a deadly \ntraffic accident involving the U.S. military, an anti-American riot \nexploded in Kabul last week.\n  The 9/11 Commission made it clear in their recommendations that \nAfghanistan must be a priority stating that the ``United States and the \ninternational community should make a long-term commitment to a secure \nand stable Afghanistan to improve life and make sure it is not a \nterrorist sanctuary.'' Unfortunately, we are clearly a long way from \nachieving that goal.\n  The administration never finished the job in Afghanistan, the \nbirthplace of the Taliban, the home to al-Qaida, the land of Osama bin \nLaden, and the place where the attacks of 9/11 were planned.\n  That is why this legislation is an important step to help us move in \nthe right direction in Afghanistan. My bill urges a new commitment to a \nlong-term economic plan to ensure Afghanistan's stability as well as a \nreport on progress towards achieving the goals in the Afghanistan \nFreedom Support Act.\n  This bipartisan, bicameral legislation is the next step to finally \nimplementing all of the 41 recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. \nTheir report was a call to action. Their report card was a reminder of \nwhat still needed to be done. Their work cannot be left unfinished.\n  We must all heed advice of the 9/11 Commission and learn from the \nhard lessons of 9/11. We cannot wait any longer to take action, and I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S.J.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution to \nspur a political solution in Iraq and encourage the people of Iraq to \nprovide for their own security through the redeployment of U.S. \nmilitary forces.\n  I introduce this resolution with the hope and prayer that we will \nredeploy U.S. troops from Iraq and end this ill-fated war that has \nresulted in more than 20,000 U.S. troops killed or wounded.\n  This resolution speaks for itself. I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 39\n\n       Whereas the United States military forces have served \n     bravely in Iraq and deserve the heartfelt support of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas more than 2,450 members of the United States \n     military forces have been killed and more than 18,000 wounded \n     in support of military operations in Iraq;\n       Whereas more than 200 coalition personnel have been killed \n     in support of military operations in Iraq;\n       Whereas it is estimated that at least 40,000 people of Iraq \n     have been killed during the military intervention in Iraq;\n       Whereas much of the intelligence used by the Bush \n     Administration to justify the use of force in Iraq was either \n     exaggerated or simply wrong;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush stated that the mission in \n     Iraq was to rid that country of weapons of mass destruction;\n       Whereas weapons of mass destruction have not been found in \n     Iraq;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush then stated that the \n     mission in Iraq was to end the regime of Saddam Hussein and \n     free the people of Iraq;\n       Whereas Saddam Hussein is in custody and standing trial for \n     crimes against humanity;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush then stated that the \n     mission in Iraq was to establish a free, self governing, and \n     democratic Iraq;\n       Whereas the people of Iraq elected their first permanent \n     democratically elected government on December 15, 2005, and \n     the cabinet of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has been \n     approved by the Parliament of Iraq, concluding the transition \n     of Iraq to full political sovereignty;\n\n[[Page S5507]]\n\n       Whereas President George W. Bush then stated that the \n     mission in Iraq was to train the security forces of Iraq so \n     that they can do the fighting in Iraq;\n       Whereas the Pentagon reports that more than 240,000 \n     military and police personnel of Iraq are now trained and \n     equipped;\n       Whereas on May 1, 2003, President George W. Bush stood \n     under a banner proclaiming ``Mission Accomplished'' and \n     declared that Iraq was an ally of al Qaeda;\n       Whereas the report of the 9/11 Commission found no \n     collaborative operational relationship between Iraq and al \n     Qaeda;\n       Whereas the commander of the Multinational Forces Iraq, \n     General George Casey, testified before the Senate Committee \n     on Armed Services on September 29, 2005, that ``[i]ncreased \n     coalition presence feeds the notion of occupation . . . \n     contributes to the dependency of Iraqi security forces on the \n     coalition . . . [and] extends the amount of time that it will \n     take for Iraqi security forces to become self reliant''; and\n       Whereas, according to a January 2006 poll, 64 percent of \n     Iraqis believe that crime and violent attacks will decrease \n     when the United States redeploys from Iraq, 67 percent of \n     Iraqis believe that their day-to-day security will increase \n     if the United States redeploys from Iraq, and 73 percent of \n     Iraqis believe that there will be greater cooperation among \n     the political factions of Iraq when the United States \n     redeploys from Iraq: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That--\n       (1) United States military forces in Iraq are to be \n     redeployed from Iraq by December 31, 2006, or earlier if \n     practicable;\n       (2) nothing in this resolution prohibits the use of United \n     States military forces from training Iraqi security forces in \n     the region outside of Iraq; and\n       (3) nothing in this resolution prohibits the use of United \n     States military forces based outside of Iraq to--\n       (A) conduct targeted and specialized counter-terrorism \n     missions in Iraq; and\n       (B) protect military and civilian personnel of the United \n     States in Iraq.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/06/senate-section/article/S5507-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5507-S5508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 500--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT THE \n RUSSIAN FEDERATION SHOULD FULLY PROTECT THE FREEDOMS OF ALL RELIGIOUS \nCOMMUNITIES WITHOUT DISTINCTION, WHETHER REGISTERED OR UNREGISTERED, AS \n   STIPULATED BY THE RUSSIAN CONSTITUTION AND INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Nelson of \nFlorida) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations:\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nwhereby the Senate calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation \nto fully protect the right of individuals to worship and to practice \ntheir faith as they see fit. This resolution reiterates provisions on \nreligious freedom that are contained within the Russian Constitution of \n1993 and international agreements to which the Russian Federation is a \nparty.\n  I am especially appreciative for the co-sponsorship of this important \nresolution by my colleagues and friends, the senior Senator from \nDelaware, Mr. Biden, the junior Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith, and the \nsenior Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson.\n  It is true that religious practice in Russia today is much freer than \nduring the Soviet era. However, many minority religious communities \nthroughout the Russian Federation continue to suffer harassment and \ndiscrimination on the part of some local officials who, either through \npersonal prejudice or misplaced paranoia, see a threat to their society \nby religious faiths with whom they are unfamiliar.\n  Until fairly recently, the U.S. Helsinki Commission, which I chair, \nwas receiving troubling reports of several instances of violence \nagainst religious minorities in Russia. Arson attacks against churches \nin Russia have occurred in several towns and cities with little or no \npolice response. I would note that reports of such attacks have \ndecreased in number of late.\n  I would like to quote from the International Religious Freedom Report \nfor 2005, which is published by the State Department Office on \nInternational Religions Freedom annually:\n\n       Some Federal agencies and many local authorities continue \n     to restrict the rights of various religious minorities. \n     Moreover, contradictions between Federal and local laws and \n     varying interpretations of the law provide regional officials \n     with opportunities to restrict the activities of religious \n     minorities. Many observers attribute discriminatory practices \n     at the local level to the greater susceptibility of local \n     governments than the Federal Government to discriminatory \n     attitudes in lobbying by local majority religious groups. The \n     government only occasionally intervenes to prevent or reverse \n     discrimination at the local level.\n\n  Mr. President, on April 14, 2005, the Helsinki Commission held \nhearings on the treatment of religious minorities in Russia. Mr. Larry \nUzzell, a journalist and researcher specializing in religious liberty \nissues, noted that Russian bureaucrats had increased the pressure on \nminority religious confessions, especially by denying them places to \nworship.\n  In March 2004, a city court banned the religious activity of \nJehovah's Witnesses in Moscow. Since that time, officials in St. \nPetersburg have been threatening to ``liquidate'' the Jehovah's \nWitnesses Administration Center in that city. If the administrative \ncenter were to cease to exist, the effect on local congregations could \nbe devastating. Just this month, police in Ivanovo, Russia, reportedly \nbroke up an evangelical event where Bibles were being distributed and \ndetained three members. Catholic parishes in the cities of Sochi and \nRostov-on-Don have also had difficulty with local officials in \nobtaining official permission to use their new church buildings.\n  Concerning anti-Semitism, on January 11 of this year a ``skinhead'' \nattacked worshipers with a knife and wounded eight persons in the \nMoscow Headquarters and Synagogue of Agudas Chasidei Chabad of the \nFormer Soviet Union. Thankfully, the Moscow City Court sentenced the \nattacker to 13 years in prison for attempted murder. However, a copycat \nattack that followed in Rostov-on-Don was not handled as well, with the \nperpetrator only being charged with ``hooliganism'' and given 5 days \nadministrative detention. I urge Russian authorities to be more \nconsistent with their response to these heinous crimes.\n  Another difficult situation is that of Muslim believers in Russia \ntoday, with officials often harassing communities practicing outside of \ngovernment approved mosques. For instance, there are repeated and \ncredible reports that police are arresting Russian Muslim citizens on \ncharges of terrorism on the basis of fabricated evidence. Certainly \nRussia has a right to defend itself from terrorism, but I would urge \nauthorities not to sow the seeds of further bitterness and violence \nthrough wholesale arrests and unjust trials.\n  Mr. President, I certainly don't want to suggest that all Russian \nofficials are hostile to religious faith and practice. There are \ncountries with worse far records, and there are many areas of the \nRussian Federation where the principles of religious freedom are \ngenuinely observed and still others where progress is being made. \nMoreover, many officials at the federal level have made sincere efforts \nto see that their government observes its own laws as well as \ninternational standards.\n  This resolution reminds the leadership of the Russian Federation of \nthe critical importance of enforcing Russian constitution and Russia's \ninternational commitments on religious freedom. Considering Russia's \npresidency of the G-8, a grouping of the world's major industrialized \ndemocracies, it is time to live up to the standards of religious \nliberty that characterize the nations of the G-8 and the community of \ndemocracies as a whole.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                              S. Res. 500\n\n       Whereas the Russian Federation is a participating State of \n     the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \n     (OSCE) and has freely committed to fully respect the rights \n     of individuals, whether alone or in community with others, to \n     profess and practice religion or belief;\n       Whereas the 1989 Vienna Concluding Document calls on OSCE \n     participating States to ``take effective measures to prevent \n     and eliminate discrimination against individuals or \n     communities on the grounds of religion or belief'' and to \n     ``grant upon their request to communities of believers, \n     practicing or prepared to practice their faith within the \n     constitutional framework of their States, recognition of the \n     status provided for them in the respective countries'';\n       Whereas Article 28 of the Constitution of the Russian \n     Federation declares that ``everyone shall be guaranteed the \n     right to freedom of conscience, to freedom of religious \n     worship, including the right to profess, individually or \n     jointly with others, any religion''\n\n[[Page S5508]]\n\n     and Article 8 of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and \n     Religious Associations provides for registration for \n     religious communities as ``religious organizations,'' if they \n     have at least 10 members and have operated within the Russian \n     Federation with legal status for at least 15 years;\n       Whereas religious freedom has advanced significantly for \n     the vast majority of people in Russia since the collapse of \n     the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas many rights and privileges afforded to religious \n     communities in the Russian Federation remain contingent on \n     the ability of the communities to obtain government \n     registration;\n       Whereas some religious groups have not attempted to \n     register with government authorities due to theological \n     considerations, and other communities have been unjustly \n     denied registration or had their registration improperly \n     terminated by local authorities;\n       Whereas many of the unregistered communities in the Russian \n     Federation today were never registered under the Soviet \n     system because they refused to collaborate with that \n     government's anti-religious policies and they are now \n     experiencing renewed discrimination and repression by \n     authorities of the Russian Federation;\n       Whereas over the past 2 years there have been an estimated \n     10 arson attacks on unregistered Protestant churches, with \n     little or no effective response by law enforcement officials \n     to bring the perpetrators to justice;\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation reacted \n     swiftly in response to the January 2006 attack on a Moscow \n     synagogue, but there have been numerous other anti-Semitic \n     attacks against Jews and Jewish institutions in the Russian \n     Federation, and there is increasing tolerance of anti-\n     Semitism in certain segments of society in that country;\n       Whereas there has been evidence of an increase in the \n     frequency and severity of oppressive actions by security \n     forces and federal and local officials against some Muslim \n     communities and their members;\n       Whereas there are many cases involving restitution for \n     religious property seized by the Soviet regime that remain \n     unresolved;\n       Whereas in some areas of the Russian Federation law \n     enforcement personnel have carried out acts of harassment and \n     oppression against members of religious communities \n     peacefully practicing their faith and local officials have \n     put overly burdensome restrictions on the ability of some \n     religious communities to engage in religious activity; and\n       Whereas the United States has sought to protect the \n     fundamental and inalienable right of individuals to profess \n     and practice their faith, alone or in community with others, \n     according to the dictates of their conscience, and in \n     accordance with international agreements committing nations \n     to respect individual freedom of thought, conscience, and \n     belief: Now, therefore, be it\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of Congress that the United \n     States Government should--\n       (1) urge the Government of the Russian Federation to ensure \n     full protection of freedoms for all religious communities \n     without distinction, whether registered or unregistered, and \n     end the harassment of unregistered religious groups by the \n     security apparatus and other government agencies, thereby \n     building upon the progress made over the past 15 years in \n     promoting religious freedom in the Russian Federation;\n       (2) urge the Government of the Russian Federation to ensure \n     that law enforcement officials vigorously investigate and \n     prosecute acts of violence, arson, and desecration \n     perpetrated against registered and unregistered religious \n     communities, as well as make certain that government \n     authorities are not complicit in such incidents;\n       (3) continue to raise concerns with the Government of the \n     Russian Federation over violations of religious freedom, \n     including those against unregistered religious communities, \n     especially indigenous denominations not well known in the \n     United States;\n       (4) ensure that United States Embassy officials engage \n     local officials throughout the Russian Federation, especially \n     when violations of freedom of religion occur, and undertake \n     outreach activities to educate local officials about the \n     rights of unregistered religious communities;\n       (5) urge the Government of the Russian Federation to invite \n     the three Personal Representatives of the OSCE Chair-in-\n     Office and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom \n     of Religion or Belief to visit the Russian Federation and \n     discuss with federal and local officials concerns about the \n     religious freedom of both registered and unregistered \n     religious communities; and\n       (6) urge the Council of Europe, its member countries, and \n     the other members of the \n     G-8 to raise issues relating to religious freedom with \n     Russian officials in the context of the Russian Federation's \n     responsibilities both as President of the Council in 2006 and \n     as a member of the G-8.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/06/senate-section/article/S5508-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 501--COMMENDING THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CAVALIERS \n MEN'S LACROSSE TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2006 NATIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC \n         ASSOCIATION DIVISION I NATIONAL LACROSSE CHAMPIONSHIP.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN (for himself and Mr. Warner) submitted the following \nresolution;

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the young \nmen and women who competed in the 79th annual Scripps National Spelling \nBee last week.

Mountz School in Spring Lake, NJ, \nand was sponsored by the Asbury Park Press and the Home News Tribune. \nOther New Jersey participants included Serenity Fung of Faith Hope Love \nAcademy in Somerset, Joseph Reed of Deerfield Township Elementary \nSchool in Rosenhayn, Austin Tamutus of MacFarland Junior School in \nBordentown, Tianqi Wang of Ramapo Ridge Middle School in Mahwah, and \nNisha Sadanand Naik of St. Anne's Parish School in Jersey City. I am \nproud of all of them.\n  Miss Close--showing true grace under pressure--won in the 20th round \nby correctly spelling ``ursprache,'' which is defined as ``a parent \nlanguage, especially one reconstructed from the evidence of later \nlanguages.'' Miss Close is a five-time veteran of the National Spelling \nBee, first competing when she was 9. She tied for seventh place last \nyear. Over the past 5 years, Miss Close has spent between 1 and 2 hours \neach day looking up words and their origins in order to prepare for the \ncontests. Her dedication should serve as an inspiration to all of us.\n  The 2006 Scripps National Spelling Bee, which is administered by the \nE.W. Scripps Company and 268 local sponsors, is the largest and longest \nrunning educational promotion in the United States. This competition \nbegan with 275 competitors from across the United States, American \nSamoa, the Bahamas, Canada, Europe, Guam, Jamaica, New Zealand, Puerto \nRico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands who qualified for the contest by \nwinning locally sponsored spelling bees.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in congratulating Miss Close \nand the other 274 competitors in this year's Scripps National Spelling \nBee.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
