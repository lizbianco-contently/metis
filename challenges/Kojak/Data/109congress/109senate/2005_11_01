Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 1932, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1932) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to \n     section 202(a) of the concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 2006 (H. Con. Res. 95).\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time until 8 \np.m. shall be divided between the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. \nGregg, for 4\\1/2\\ hours and the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, \nfor 5\\1/2\\ hours.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Majority Leader\n\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this morning we will immediately resume \ndebate on the deficit reduction package after a brief statement I have \nto make.\n  Chairman Gregg opened debate on the bill yesterday and will be here \nmanaging the bill this morning. Last week we entered an agreement which \ndivided the statutory time limit between 3 days, with all time expiring \non Wednesday at 6 p.m.\n  During today's session, Senators will be able to offer amendments. \nHowever, votes on those amendments will be stacked to occur at a later \ntime. I will be working with the Democratic leader to determine the \nbest time for those votes to occur. I had hoped that we could dispose \nof some of the proposed amendments with votes during today's session. \nHowever, at this point, we have several scheduling conflicts, and we \nmay have to delay those votes until tomorrow. On Wednesday, we have \nseveral Members attending the funeral of Rosa Parks, and we will need \nto schedule votes to accommodate that service as well.\n  Having said that, this will be a very busy week. Senators will be \nable to offer amendments after the expiration of time and that leads to \nthe so called vote-arama. I encourage Senators to offer their \namendments during the debate period so that we can limit the amendments \nconsidered after time expires.\n  I do not believe the vote-arama is the most constructive use of the \nSenate's time, and I believe most Members are frustrated with that \nprocess--at least halfway through the vote-arama, as they express that \nfrustration directly to me and leadership. During those consecutive \nvotes, the Senate votes on amendment after amendment with very little \ntime and little explanation of the amendments.\n  So I hope we can do it in an orderly process over the next several \ndays. I do want Members to come to the floor early so we can show some \nrestraint when the 20 hours of debate time is complete.\n  Finally, I want to remind everyone that we will be considering the \nappropriations conference reports as they arrive from the House. Once \nthe House has completed action and those conference reports become \navailable, we will address them. We have the Agriculture appropriations \nconference report already, and we will be scheduling that for a vote \nsometime this week.\n\n\n                               Avian Flu\n\n  Mr. President, on another issue, I want to make a few comments. \nShortly, the President will begin to unveil his plan to prepare the \nNation against the threat of bird flu or avian flu, a potential for \ninitially an epidemic and then pandemic nobody was thinking very much \nabout a year ago.\n\n  I do thank the President for his bold and decisive leadership. He \nrecognizes the urgency for our Nation to take immediate action to \nprepare for and to prevent the spread of such a pandemic and the impact \nit would have on this Nation and, indeed, nations throughout the world.\n  Last night, the Secretary of Health and Human Services began briefing \npeople on the plan that will be laid out by the President today. He has \nbeen discussing in meetings over the last several weeks the importance \nof comprehensive organization at all levels of Government. It is not \njust a Federal issue or a State issue or a local issue, it is all \nthree. The vertical integration of communication and response and \npreparedness is complex, but it is something that we absolutely must \naddress. We would have to mobilize from\n\n[[Page S12080]]\n\nthe very top vertically at the Federal, State, and local level in ways \nthat we never had to in the past.\n  The Secretary explained at the National Press Club last week all of \nthis using the analogy of a dry forest, that it takes only one little \nspark to set a fire in a forest, and if we are close to where the spark \nignites, usually you can just stamp it out. But if it is allowed to \nspread and it really goes beyond any size that can be contained, that \nwhole forest is left in smoldering ruins. I would simply add to that \nanalogy that in a forest you could have many different little sparks \nwhich aggravate and increase the challenges to the system itself. If \nyou can isolate those sparks or that spark very quickly, you can stamp \nout that potential for a pandemic, and ultimately you can save millions \nof lives. That is why it is absolutely critical we think of the \nresponse, of preparedness in this country. Indeed, this is a global \nchallenge, and we have to work with our partners throughout the world.\n  In fact, if you had to look at the likelihood of a pandemic and how \nit starts, it would probably be in Asia or Southeast Asia, and \ntherefore we have a real obligation to address concerns in this country \nas well as around the world.\n  In the Senate, we are working hard to develop a comprehensive \nprevention and preparedness plan. We have now passed two separate \nmeasures to increase the national stockpile of vaccines and the \nantiviral drugs, drugs like Tamiflu. This month the HELP Committee, the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, passed a measure to \nprotect vaccine makers from the frivolous lawsuits that we absolutely \nknow discourage vaccine production and which, in part, has explained \nwhy we have gone from several dozen vaccine manufacturers in this \ncountry down to fewer than a handful. The bill that the HELP Committee \nhas addressed and passed out of committee also establishes a Biomedical \nAdvanced Research Development Agency, called BARDA, which would support \nthis bug or identifying what the etiology is, the bug that starts it, \nall the way to creating a drug.\n  This agency, BARDA, would focus on the gaps that exist in the system \ntoday. The agency would help researchers move from egg-based vaccine \nmanufacture--and right now for the avian flu you depend on millions and \nmillions and millions and millions and millions of eggs to grow this \nvaccine, and today it does not make sense because you can with the \nappropriate research target and focus, develop a cell manufacture that \ndoesn't require any eggs, that you could ramp up very quickly, in a \nshort period of time, and you don't have to worry about, yes, we are \ngoing to have to have an egg-based vaccine, so where are all 20, 30, 40 \nmillion eggs, chicken eggs, that you need to cultivate this vaccine for \nweeks and weeks and weeks?\n  It is the sort of effort that BARDA would focus on to incentivize, to \nfill this gap in our system today.\n  In the 20th century, we have seen three outbreaks of avian flu, avian \nbird flu. The worst of those occurred in 1918. A lot of people have \ngone back to read about that Spanish flu. It is called Spanish flu, \nthough it probably started in this country in Kansas. Half a million \nAmericans died, somewhere between 40 and 50 million people worldwide. \nAnd the people say why this bug, why this drug, why does it have to be, \nwhy do you have to narrow that window and speed things up? If you look \nback on the Spanish flu, in 24 weeks' time, more people were killed in \nthe world than have been killed by HIV/AIDS in 24 years. In 24 weeks, \nmore people died of the avian flu than in 24 years of HIV/AIDS. Speed, \nefficiency, appropriate research and development, appropriate vaccine \nproduction needs to be done rapidly, quickly.\n  Secretary Levitt warns that if the past is a prologue, we are long \noverdue for a pandemic. If you look throughout history at pandemics, \nyou cannot only look at it on a regular basis but a periodic basis. \nWorse yet, the current virus looks and acts more like the virus of 1918 \nthan any of its other cousins that we have seen to date--if you come \nback and analyze H5N1 and you compare it to the virus of 1918.\n  So what do you do? Americans look for leadership, look for bold \nleadership, and we are seeing it from the President of the United \nStates. I pulled off my desk, as I was coming over, last month's \nNational Geographic, which asks the question: ``The next killer flu:'' \nAnd over in little letters here it says, ``Can we stop it?'' ``The Next \nKiller Flu: Can we stop it?'' And the answer to that is, yes, we can, \nusing technology for research, bold leadership, Government resources, \nprivate sector resources.\n\n  We know that H5N1 is spreading. Romania reported two bird cases \nyesterday. Last week, Indonesia and Thai authorities reported new cases \nof bird-human transmission. To date, avian flu has infected more people \nand more poultry than any previous strain. In fact, over 160 million \nbirds have either died or been killed because of this avian flu in the \nlast year.\n  Since 2003, there have been 121 people confirmed to have avian flu \nand half of them have died, 61 have died. That is a 50-percent \nmortality. The Spanish flu in 1918 had a mortality of about 2.5 \npercent--2.5 percent--and in this country, less than that. We are \ntalking about a virus right now that has a mortality rate of 50 \npercent.\n  Last week, I met with Dr. Robert Webster, again, from St. Jude's \nChildren's Research Hospital, which is in Memphis, TN. He is one of the \nleading authorities on H5N1. As he explains, there are 16 families of \navian influenza. That virus mutates billions of times a day. It is \nconstantly changing, which is why it is such a challenging opponent for \nus. And with each of these changes in this mixing bowl of the virus \nitself, the human-to-human transmission becomes more likely. If and \nwhen it becomes a pandemic, we have no natural immunity. That is the \nbad thing. It is not similar to the regular flu. If you have the flu \none year and you get it next year, you already have some antibodies \nbuilt up, but nobody in this room, nobody listening to me right now, \nnobody has any natural immunity to this. So when you get hit, you get \nsick very quickly, and of the people hit so far, one out of every two \ndied. Again, panic and paralysis, even talking about it, people get so \nanxious.\n  The good news is there are things we can do in terms of prevention, \npreparedness, stockpiling, educating our first responders and that, \nindeed, is what the President will spell out. I look forward to hearing \nmore specifically about the President's plan. I urge my colleagues to \nspend time studying the issue.\n  There is absolutely no reason to panic, but we do need to be \nprepared, and today we are underprepared. Indeed, we have no higher \nduty than to protect the health, the well-being, and the security of \nthe American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the subject under discussion is the matter \nbefore us entitled the ``Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act \nof 2005.'' Big words that are meant to communicate, but it reminds me a \nlittle of the old saying: You can't tell a book by its cover. If there \nwas ever a case of that, this is it. You need to know that this is a \nbook of many chapters. We need to read all of the chapters to know the \nconclusion. I can assure you the conclusion is not deficit reduction. \nNo, this budget has nothing to do with deficit reduction. This budget \nis all about increasing the debt and increasing the deficits.\n  Describing this package as deficit reduction is a little like the \nblindfolded man describing an elephant by only touching its tail. The \nblindfolded man might describe the elephant by just holding its tail as \nsmall, long, and slick. Well, that is not the whole story. That is an \naccurate description as far as it goes, but it misses the larger truth. \nThat is the case with describing this budget action as deficit \nreduction. It is only the first chapter. You have to read all of the \nchapters to get the full meaning. The truth is, this budget increases \nthe deficit and explodes the debt. That is the larger truth.\n  The budget that was enacted earlier this year actually increases the \ndeficit by $168 billion over the 5 years of its life. It does not \nreduce the deficit. It increases the deficit. We would have less of a \ndeficit if we put the whole budget on cruise control, but that was not \nthe choice the majority made. They made a choice, consciously, to\n\n[[Page S12081]]\n\nwrite a budget that, even in the face of record deficits and massive \nincreases in debt, increases the deficits even further. I know it is \nhard to believe, but that is the fact of the matter. The budgets that \nhave been written by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nincrease the deficits.\n  Budget reconciliation is a part of the overall budget process. Budget \nreconciliation is special provisions, fast-track provisions that enjoy \nspecial protection under the rules of the Senate. But remember, what we \nare dealing with this week is the first chapter. The first chapter \ncontains spending cuts of $39 billion. But that is only part of the \npackage. The next chapter will have tax cuts of $70 billion. If you put \nthose two chapters together, you don't have a reduction of the deficit, \nyou have an increase in the deficit of over $30 billion.\n  Chapter 3 is the chapter our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle hope you will not read. Chapter 3 increases the debt of the \ncountry by $781 billion. That is what this book is all about: \nincreasing the debt of the country when we have already taken on record \namounts of debt.\n  Back to chapter 1 and chapter 2. Chapter 1 cuts spending by $39 \nbillion, but it is quickly followed by chapter 2 that cuts taxes $70 \nbillion. The combined effect of chapters 1 and 2 is very clear. It is \nnot deficit reduction, not what is on the cover of the book; it is a \ndeficit increase, an increase in debt.\n  If we go back to what the President told us when he started us down \nthis course, he told us in 2001:\n\n       [W]e can proceed with tax relief without fear of budget \n     deficits, even if the economy softens.\n\n  That is what he told us. Look at what has happened. Now we can look \nback and we can check the record and we can see whether the President \nwas right or was he wrong.\n  Back at the time in 2001 that the President proposed these massive \ntax cuts, this was the outlook according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice and the administration. This was their outlook going forward, a \nrange of possible outcomes from a worst-case scenario to the best-case \nscenario. They adopted the midline that told us we were going to \nexperience some $6 trillion of surpluses over the next 10 years.\n  But look what happened in the real world. Look what happened in \nactuality. We didn't get the worst possible outcome under the \nprojections that were provided. We got way below the worst possible \noutcome. This red line is what actually happened compared to the \nprojections, and instead of trillions of dollars of surpluses, what we \nhave are trillions of dollars of debt.\n  I can remember when we were having that debate. My Republican \ncolleagues told me when I warned them that you can't bet on this 10-\nyear forecast, that it is highly unlikely to come true, many of my \nRepublican colleagues told me: Kent, you are far too conservative. \nDon't you understand, when we have these big tax cuts, we are going to \nget even more revenue. We are not going to be at this midrange of \nforecasts of possible outcomes; we are going to be well above it \nbecause these tax cuts are going to generate much more revenue.\n  Again, now we can go back and check the record as to what actually \nhappened. We did not get some great boost. Instead what we got was an \nocean of red ink. Instead what we got were these massive deficits.\n  Previous Presidents have said that facts are stubborn things. Facts \nare stubborn things. And the facts are that this fiscal policy has \ntaken us deep into the deficit ditch. Despite all of the President's \npromises that would not occur, he was simply wrong.\n  The next year the President told us:\n\n     . . . [O]ur budget will run a deficit that will be small and \n     short-term. . . .\n\n  We can go back and check the record on that as well. He said that in \n2002. Look what has happened since. The deficits have exploded. In \n2003, we had what was then the largest deficit ever. In 2004, the \ndeficit got even bigger. In 2005, the deficit was the third largest we \nhave ever had. So, again, the President was simply wrong in his \nprediction.\n\n  If we look at this from a historic vantage point and look back to \n1980 and look at the outlays or spending of the United States and the \nrevenues, we see some very interesting things. This is all expressed as \na percentage of our gross domestic product, which is what economists \nsay is the best way to make these comparisons because it takes out the \neffect of inflation and real growth. So we are comparing apples to \napples here.\n  Look what has happened. This is the spending line of the United \nStates. It was up over 23 percent of gross domestic product in the \nprevious Bush administration. Then we got to the nineties, and the \nDemocrats put in place a plan that led us to reduce spending, and each \nand every year spending came down as a share of GDP.\n  In 2000, we had a change of administration, and here is what has \nhappened to spending. Spending has gone up. Spending has gone up, but \nit is still well below where we were in the eighties and nineties. \nThese are facts.\n  Why did the spending go up? The spending went up largely for three \nreasons. One, national defense; two, homeland security; three, \nrebuilding New York and bailing out the airlines.\n  All of us supported on a bipartisan basis this increase in spending. \nThis was in response, obviously, to 9/11 and a national emergency. So, \nyes, spending went up. Virtually all of it is accounted for by defense, \nhomeland security, and rebuilding New York and aid to the airlines.\n  Now we are at a place where spending is at about 20 percent of gross \ndomestic product. But look what happened on the revenue side of the \nequation. Again going back to the eighties, we were at about 19 percent \nof gross domestic product on revenue. We had a series of tax cuts then \nthat opened up deficits as spending was not reduced to make up the \ndifference. Then we got to the nineties and again we had a plan that \nwas put in place. Revenue increased every year until we actually got to \nthe circumstance in which we were running surpluses. For 2 years, we \nnot only ran surpluses, but we stopped using Social Security money for \nother purposes.\n  Then in 2000, with the change of administration, a series of tax cuts \nwas put in place, and we experienced an economic slowdown and the \nrevenue side of the equation collapsed. Until last year, we had the \nlowest revenue as a share of gross domestic product since 1959. We have \nhad an increase in this last year, but the forecasters are saying that \nwill level out going forward as a share of gross domestic product, \nleaving us with this very large gap between spending and revenue and, \nhence, ongoing massive deficits. That is the reality we find ourselves \nin today.\n  The next year, in 2003, the President told us:\n\n     [O]ur budget gap is small by historical standards.\n\n  I think if you measure it fairly, what you find out is that is not \nthe case either. What the President has been focusing on is only the \ndeficit. The deficit this last year was $319 billion, but that isn't \nwhat got added to the debt. What got added to the debt of the country \nwas not $319 billion, it was $551 billion. The largest part of the \ndifference is Social Security because last year, under the President's \nplan, $173 billion of Social Security money was taken to pay for other \nprograms. That all gets added to the debt, but it is not counted in the \ndeficit calculation.\n  When you add in those items that were not counted in the deficit, \nwhat you find is that the increase in the debt was, instead of the 2.6 \npercent that many have asserted, the actual difference between spending \nand revenue, the actual difference in addition to the debt was 4.5 \npercent of gross domestic product, and that number is a danger sign.\n  Most economists say your deficits should not be above 2.5 percent of \nGDP. The truth is, what got added to the debt last year was 4.5 percent \nof GDP. In the European Union, you cannot be a member in good standing \nif you run deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of GDP.\n  The big difference is what is happening with Social Security because \nback in the eighties, the deficits had almost nothing to do with Social \nSecurity. Social Security was running very small surpluses at the time. \nIn fact, if you go back to 1983, there was no Social Security money to \ntake to spend for other programs. There was no surplus in Social \nSecurity. But look what has happened since. Social Security surpluses \nhave grown dramatically. This was intended, this was designed to \nprepare for the retirement of the baby boom generation. The whole idea \nwas\n\n[[Page S12082]]\n\nto use these surpluses to pay down debt or to prepay the liability. \nThat is not what has been done.\n  Under the President's policy, all of this Social Security money is \nbeing taken to pay for other programs. That is what is happening. All \nof it is getting added to the debt, all of it has to be paid back, and \nthere is no plan to do it.\n  This is the difference between the eighties and now. In the eighties, \nalmost no Social Security funds were available to be taken to pay for \nother items, now we have--just last year--$173 billion in that year \nalone.\n  Over the next 10 years, under the President's plan, they are going to \ntake $2.4 trillion of Social Security money to pay for other things. \nThat is a dangerous course.\n  Now, the President told us just last year:\n\n     So I can say to you that the deficit will be cut in half over \n     the next 5 years . . .\n\n  All of his assertions so far have been proved wrong. Now he tells us: \nDo not worry, we are going to cut the deficit in half over the next 5 \nyears.\n  First, I do not think that is the appropriate test because we are in \nthe sweet spot of the budget cycle. This is the time when we should not \nbe running deficits at all because this is right before the baby \nboomers retire, and we are running these massive surpluses in Social \nSecurity. Those funds should have been used to either pay down debt or \nprepay the liability. Instead, the money has been hijacked. The money \nhas been taken to pay for other things--digging a much deeper hole for \nthe future. So when the President says the deficit will be cut in half \nover the next 5 years, that is not even the right test. This is not a \ntime when we should be running deficits at all.\n  Beyond that, if one pierces the veil on the President's claim that \nthe deficits are going to be cut in half, here is what they find out: \nHe got there by just leaving out things. He just left out war costs, \ndid not have any war costs in his budget past September 30 of this \nyear. Does anybody believe the war costs ended on September 30 of this \nyear? That is what the President's budget said.\n  He did not just leave out war costs, he left out the cost of dealing \nwith the alternative minimum tax. The alternative minimum tax, which is \nthe old millionaire's tax and is rapidly becoming a middle-class tax \ntrap. It costs $700 billion to fix. The President just left that out of \nhis budget.\n  The President wrote a 5-year budget instead of the 10-year budgeting \nthat used to be done because at the end of the fifth year, the cost of \nhis tax cut proposals explodes, driving us deeper into deficit and \ndeeper into debt. Apparently, he did not want to share that information \nwith the American people.\n  When one looks at the long-term outlook with those things added back \nin that the President left out, what one sees is a slight improvement \nin the deficit in the short term, but then it just explodes beyond the \n5-year budget window. Why is that the case? Well, I have mentioned some \nof the reasons.\n  The first reason is war costs. In the mid-session review, the \nPresident had included $50 billion for ongoing military operations, but \nthe Congressional Budget Office tells us that $50 billion does not \nbegin to cover the real costs. They say the real cost is going to be \n$333 billion. So the President has left out a big chunk of spending \nthat others say we will experience.\n  Second, by adopting a 5-year budget--it used to be 10-year budgets--\nthe President is hiding this fact: The cost of his tax cut proposals \nexplodes right beyond the 5-year budget window. Is this not \ninteresting? This dotted line is the end of the 5 years of the budget \nproposal presented by the President. Look what happens to the cost of \nhis tax cut right beyond the fifth year. The cost of the President's \ntax cut proposal explodes right beyond the end of the fifth year.\n  Maybe it should not be a surprise that the President switched from \n10-year budgeting to 5-year because he would have had a very hard time \nexplaining how his plan will reduce the deficit when factoring in the \nexploding cost of his tax cuts, the additional cost of war, and the \ncost to fix the alternative minimum tax.\n  By the way, the pattern is much the same with the alternative minimum \ntax. The alternative minimum tax, which virtually everyone says needs \nto be reformed, the President did not put one thin dime in his budget \nproposal to deal with that. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, it will cost $774 billion to fix. The President does not have \nany of it in his budget.\n\n  Look at the pattern. Here again, the dotted line is the end of the 5-\nyear budget proposal of the President. Here is the pattern of costs of \nfixing the alternative minimum tax. What happens if we do not fix the \nalternative minimum tax? Well, here is what happens: In 2005, 3.6 \nmillion taxpayers were affected. If we fail to act, by 2010, 29 million \ntaxpayers will be affected. So people are in for a big surprise. They \nthought they were going to get a tax cut? Instead, they are going to \nget into the swamp of the alternative minimum tax: 3.6 million people \naffected this year, 29 million affected 5 years from now if we fail to \nact. It costs $770 billion to fix, and there is not one dime in the \nPresident's budget to do it.\n  Here is what the President said in 2001 about the importance of \npaying down debt. The President told us at the time:\n\n     . . . (M)y budget pays down a record amount of national debt. \n     We will pay off $2 trillion of debt over the next decade. \n     That will be the largest debt reduction of any country, ever. \n     Future generations shouldn't be forced to pay back money that \n     we have borrowed. We owe this kind of responsibility to our \n     children and grandchildren.\n\n  The President was right about one thing. We do owe that \nresponsibility to future generations, but he did not pay down any debt. \nInstead, the debt has exploded. The budget that my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle passed and the budget that we are moving to \ntake final action on does not pay down any debt. It explodes the debt. \nIt takes the debt from $7.9 trillion now, and it increases it by more \nthan $600 billion a year each and every year of the life of this \nbudget--this after the President told us he is going to have maximum \npay-down of the debt. There has been no pay-down of the debt. He is \nexploding the debt.\n  Every minute in 2005, the budget policies of our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle increased the national debt by over $1 million. \nEvery minute of every day, they have increased the debt by over $1 \nmillion.\n  What are the consequences of this fiscal failure? The consequences \nare very clear. Foreign holdings of our debt have exploded. It took 200 \nyears to run up $1 trillion of debt held by foreign countries and \nforeigners. This President has doubled it in 4 years. We have gone from \n$1 trillion of foreign holdings of our debt to $2 trillion. That is an \nutterly unsustainable course. That is the outcome of the fiscal policy \nof this administration. It is not conservative; it is reckless. This is \na policy of exploding our debt.\n  Who holds this debt? Well, I might add it is interesting that \nPresident Bush did in 4 years what 42 Presidents took 224 years to do. \nForty-two Presidents ran up $1 trillion of external debt. This \nPresident exceeded them in 4 years. This President ran up more debt \nheld by foreigners in 4 years than the other 42 Presidents combined in \nthe history United States. Let me repeat that. This President ran up \nmore debt held by foreigners in 4 years than 42 other Presidents ran up \nin 224 years. That is a record of fiscal failure unmatched in the \nhistory of this country.\n  They call themselves conservatives? Why, they should call themselves \nborrowers because that is what they are doing. They are engaged in the \ngreatest borrow-and-spend spree in American history.\n  Who are we borrowing the money from? Increasingly, we are borrowing \nit from foreigners, from foreign governments, from foreign investors. \nNow we owe Japan over $684 billion. We owe China over $240 billion. We \nowe the United Kingdom over $170 billion. My favorite, the Caribbean \nBanking Centers, we owe the Caribbean Banking Centers over $100 \nbillion. Where did they get their money? Anybody here do their banking \nin the Caribbean? We owe them over $100 billion. This is conservative? \nWhat is conservative about this? Some say this is strengthening the \ncountry. How is that? How does it strengthen the country to borrow more \nand more money from abroad?\n\n  This is all happening at the worst possible time--before the baby \nboomers retire. We are facing a demographic tsunami, and here it is: \nThis is a depiction of the numbers of people in the\n\n[[Page S12083]]\n\nbaby-boom generation. We have less than 40 million people who are \neligible for Social Security and Medicare now, and we are headed for 81 \nmillion. That changes everything. Instead of preparing for it, this \nPresident has dug the hole deeper and deeper. There is nothing \nconservative about what is being done.\n  Let us go back to the so-called budget reconciliation that is before \nus today. The cover on the book says: Deficit Reduction. One has to \nread the book. They have to read every chapter of the book to find out \nthe conclusion, and the conclusion has nothing to do with deficit \nreduction. Oh, no. The first chapter cuts spending $39 billion, but the \nsecond chapter cuts revenue $70 billion. So guess what: No deficit \nreduction here. The deficit is increased, not reduced. Then one has to \nread the third chapter of the book. What is found there? They are going \nto increase the debt $781 billion--one of the biggest increases in our \nnational debt ever. If they get that increase, this President alone, in \nthe 4 years he has been in power so far, will have run up the debt by \n$3 trillion.\n  In the next 5 years, he is going to run up the debt another $3 \ntrillion. There used to be a TV show--what did they call it--the ``Six \nMillion Dollar Man''? We have the $6 trillion President because the \neffect of his policies will be to run up the debt of this country by $6 \ntrillion. That is truly stunning.\n  Here is the record. In 2002, debt was increased by $450 billion. In \n2003, debt was increased by $984 billion. In 2004, it was increased by \n$800 billion. Now our friends on the other side want to increase the \ndebt by $781 billion. That is a grand total of more than $3 trillion of \nadditional debt. We know that, if this budget is passed, they are going \nto add another $3 trillion of debt over the next 5 years--a combined \ntotal of this President's policies of $6 trillion. That is this \nPresident's plan. Unfortunately, that is the plan of this Congress.\n\n  Don't take my word for it. This is a budget they euphemistically call \na deficit reduction plan. If this weren't so serious, this would be \nvery amusing. They place the title of ``Deficit Reduction'' on this \nplan. Come on. Here is what this plan does according to their own \ntables. Go and look in the conference report on the budget that was \ndone earlier this year by the majority party in the House and the \nSenate. This is their conclusion about what is going to happen. This is \ntheir conclusion. You see the debt going up every year by more than \n$600 billion. That is their plan. If you look at the next 5 years, the \ndebt under their plan is going to increase by more than $3 trillion, \nand they are out here with this book entitled ``Deficit Reduction \nAct,'' and their plan increases the debt by $3 trillion over the next 5 \nyears. Have words lost their meaning? They call this deficit reduction. \nThey are increasing the debt over $3 trillion, and they label this \ndeficit reduction. That is breathtaking.\n  Chapter 2 of this book is to extend certain tax benefits, tax cuts. \nMany of those I support, but some of them are just overwhelmingly \ndirected at the most wealthy among us. If you look at chapter 1 being \nwritten here, and chapter 1 being written over on the House side--by \nthe way, the House budget is very clear. It is going to cut food \nstamps. It is going to cut Medicaid. The House bill takes from the \nleast among us so that they can give to those who have the most.\n  When I say ``give to those who have the most,'' let me talk about two \nprovisions that are in their tax plan. Extending dividends and capital \ngains cuts will, on average, give a millionaire a tax break for 1 year \nof over $35,000. Those earning less than $50,000 a year will get $6. \nThose earning from $50,000 to $200,000 a year, on average, will get \n$112. Those earning from $200,000 to $1 million a year will get, on \naverage, $1,480. Those earning more than a million dollars a year will \nget $35,000 a year. It is a very interesting set of values. It is a \nvery interesting set of priorities, to cut Medicaid and cut food \nstamps. This is not the Senate bill I am talking about. I am talking \nabout the House bill. The House bill cuts food stamps, cuts Medicaid, \ncuts aid for those who are the least among us, takes the resources and \ngives them to those who have the most.\n  I don't know in what Bible they read that. I have not read any Bible \nthat says the value ought to be take from those who have the least and \ngive to those who have the most. In fact, I don't know of any holy book \nof any religion that says that is a value, that what we ought to be \ndoing is taking from those who have the least among us to give to those \nwho have the most among us. I don't know of any religion that has that \nas a value.\n  I know our colleagues on the other side will say: Wait a minute here. \nThese tax cuts have fueled economic growth.\n  There are tax cuts that are helpful to economic growth. That is \nundeniable and clear. In 2001, I supported a significant package of tax \ncuts, tax cuts that the Congressional Budget Office told us would get a \nlarge bang for the buck in terms of economic growth. Part of those were \nincluded in the package. In fact, many of them were, and I supported \nthose.\n  But many of these provisions simply went too far in terms of their \ncost and have pushed us over into a sea of red ink, massive deficits, \nand massive debt. They simply went too far.\n  Here is the record on revenues as a share of gross domestic product. \nIn 2000, we were at a historic high. That is absolutely clear. Tax cuts \nwere justified in 2000. I didn't think the magnitude of the tax cuts \nwere justified, but clearly we needed tax cuts, partly to give lift to \nthe economy. My own proposal to our colleagues actually had more tax \ncuts in the short term, much more than the President's plan, to give \nlift to the economy because that made good economic sense. But they put \ntax cuts on top of tax cuts on top of tax cuts and plunged revenue to \n16.3 percent in 2004. That is the lowest it has been since 1959, and \nfar below the level of spending for which they have all voted. So the \nresult is red ink, massive red ink.\n  Here is what the Chairman of the Federal Reserve has said about \ndeficit-financed tax cuts, because that is what is going on here now. \nWe are borrowing the money to give tax cuts. From whom are we borrowing \nthe money? Increasingly, we are borrowing it from the Japanese, the \nChinese, Caribbean banking centers, to give tax cuts to the most \nwealthy among us. Does that really make sense? Is that really \ndefensible? I don't think it makes any sense.\n  I am not alone. Chairman Greenspan, in his testimony before the \nBudget Committee last year, said:\n\n       If you are going to lower taxes you should not be borrowing \n     essentially the tax cut. That over the long run is not a \n     stable fiscal situation.\n\n  Chairman Greenspan has it right. We should not be borrowing to \nprovide tax cuts, and we certainly should not be borrowing from foreign \ngovernments and foreigners to finance tax cuts. We certainly should not \nbe borrowing more and more money from Japan and China and Caribbean \nbanking centers and who-all knows who else in order to finance these \ntax cuts, driving us deeper and deeper into the deficit ditch before \nthe baby boomers retire.\n  About the baby boomers, that is not a projection. They are alive \ntoday. They are going to retire. They are going to be eligible for \nSocial Security and Medicare. About all I hear from the other side is \nthey will cut Social Security, and they will cut Medicare in order to \nfill in the difference. That is where this is all headed. Make no \nmistake about it. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, their \nfull intention is to shred Social Security and to shred Medicare in \norder to avert a fiscal disaster. We are headed for a train wreck. It \nis just as clear as it can possibly be.\n  What have our colleagues done? They have come out with this very, I \nwould say misleading title on a book, saying it is a Deficit Reduction \nAct. When you read all the chapters of the book, it is not a deficit \nreduction proposal. It increases the deficit and explodes the debt.\n\n  Chapter 1, yes, they cut spending $39 billion over 5 years. Chapter \n2, they cut revenue $70 billion over the same time. That increases the \ndeficit by $31 billion. But chapter 3, that is the one they do not want \nyou to read. You will not hear them talking about chapter 3 at all out \nhere because they do not want you to know about chapter 3. In chapter \n3, they are going to increase the debt by $781 billion. This is after \nthey have already run up the debt over $2.5 trillion over the last 4 \nyears. Now they are fixing to increase the debt another\n\n[[Page S12084]]\n\n$3 trillion over the next 5 years, and they are out here with a book \ncalled ``Deficit Reduction.'' Oh, no, I don't think the American people \nare going to buy that. I don't think the American people are going to \nbe fooled by that. I don't think the American people are going to \nconclude that what this is about is reducing the deficit because it is \nnot.\n  The simple truth is, this budget plan increases the deficit and it \nexplodes the debt.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator began with 5.5 hours, and he has \nconsumed 42 minutes. So it is approximately 4 hours 45 minutes, \napproximately, remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me say that on our side we have \nenjoyed working with the chairman of the committee very much. He is \nabsolutely professional and fair and his word is good. We have had a \nvery good working relationship on the Budget Committee. Obviously, we \nhave disagreements about policy, but on the committee we have tried not \nto disagree in a disagreeable fashion. I have respect and admiration \nfor the chairman of the committee, and we are going to try to work \ntogether to handle amendments in an expeditious and professional way so \nthe time is well used.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me echo the comments of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota relative to his staff and himself. They are \nextraordinarily professional. As he mentioned, we do have some \ndisagreements, but we do it in what I think is an appropriate way. We \ndiscuss the policy. We disagree on policy. But it is never personal, \nand there is always a cooperative spirit to try to do the business of \nthe Senate. I greatly admire his professionalism and his staff's \nprofessionalism.\n  I understand the Senator from North Dakota has another 4 hours. I \nregret we are not going to hear him speak for that entire period of \ntime because this last hour was certainly ``chartlizing''; not \nscintillating but ``chartlizing.''\n  The Senator has made a number of points, some of which I actually \nagree with but most of which I must say I find inconsistent with the \nfacts that are on the ground. With what do I agree? I agree with the \nfact we are headed toward a fiscal problem of immense proportions \nprimarily driven by the fact that we have a tremendous baby boom \ngeneration that is about to retire. Yesterday I spoke at some length \nabout that. That is why we need to initiate efforts to get under \ncontrol spending of the Federal Government, especially in the mandatory \naccounts--mandatory accounts being those accounts which people have a \nright to, simply because of their situation, whether it is a fiscal \nsituation or personal situation. They may be a former member of the \nmilitary--veterans benefits; they may be of a certain age; they may be \nof a certain income.\n  The most significant mandatory programs which are facing us are, of \ncourse, the entitlement programs benefiting retired individuals--Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid. The only way you can address retired \nprograms, mandatory programs, is through a reconciliation bill which is \nwhat we have before us today, a deficit reduction bill, because you \nhave to change the law in order to accomplish changes in the ways those \nbills are going to spend money over the years to come.\n  So the Republican Congress, the leadership and the membership, has \nstepped forward with an aggressive proposal to try to do that. It is \nthe first time in 8 years that we have seen an effort to try to put \nsome brakes on the rate of spending on the mandatory side of the \nFederal Government.\n  Thirty-five billion dollars, $35 billion original instruction, and \n$30 billion is what the committees of the Senate have reported back in \ndeficit reduction initiatives in this bill which is before us today. It \ncannot be discounted so casually, as the Senator from North Dakota has. \nHe has essentially said it is not a deficit reduction because there \nwill be a bill afterward that will give tax relief or it is not deficit \nreduction because the debt goes up. The simple fact is that those are \ninaccurate statements.\n  This bill, if you vote for it, will reduce the deficit by $39 billion \nin its present form. That is a fact, a simple, incontrovertible fact. \nThere will be a tax relief bill that will follow this bill.\n  I wish to point out that my colleague from North Dakota--and he has \nopenly said this--is going to probably vote for a lot of the amendments \nto that tax relief bill because they are good initiatives which need to \nbe done. As he mentioned, the AMT, as he mentioned--I am not sure he \nmentioned it, but others have mentioned the State and local sales tax \ndeductibility or deductibility of certain education expenses which \nteachers incur when they are trying to spend money on their classroom \nor the savings credit--all of these--or the R tax credit which makes \nus more competitive as a nation. The other side of the aisle is saying \nall those taxes should be raised on all those people. Are they saying \nthat the 8 million people who fall under AMT should have their taxes \nraised? Are they saying people in the United States who get to deduct \ntheir sales tax should have their taxes raised? Are they saying that \nteachers who buy crayons for the classroom should have their taxes \nraised? Are they saying that small businesses, especially those that go \nout and invest in opportunity and creativity by doing R expansion, \nshould have their taxes changed and raised? Maybe they are. Clearly, if \nthey are claiming that the next bill, the tax relief bill, is a bad \nbill--that is what they are claiming because that bill is going to be \nmade up primarily of those initiatives.\n  We can get into a debate about dividends and capital gains, also.\n  What has generated the revenue in this country in the last few years? \nWe have seen one of the most dramatic expansions in revenue in this \ncountry in the last 20 years and rate of growth of revenue as a result \nof having cut taxes and given people more incentive to be creative, go \nout and invest, create careers for people, and create economics to \ncreate jobs.\n  This chart shows, as we have watched the tax cuts put into place, \nthat revenues have been jumping every year. Why? They are headed back \nto the historical mean where they have been traditionally. They have \nbeen jumping because people have had an incentive to go out and invest, \nto create economic activity, to take risks, to create careers, create \njobs, and that is taxable activity which is coming back to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Sure, revenues have dropped dramatically, as many of the charts the \nSenator from North Dakota pointed out show. But the drop in those \nrevenues was a function of two events which we had very little control \nover: the bursting of the bubble of the 1990s, which was the largest \nbubble in the history of world, bigger than the South Sea Bubble. It \nwas the Internet bubble, and it burst. Quite honestly, we should have \ngone into a dramatic depression as nation as a result of that burst. \nBut because this President had the foresight to put into place a tax \ncredit on the productive side of the ledger, we did not see that \ndramatic economic downturn. We saw a reduction, and that reduction \ndropped revenues.\n  We were hit with 9/11. Never before has this Nation been hit with an \nevent like 9/11 where we lost thousands of people on our soil here in \nthe United States. Pearl Harbor, obviously, is a comparable. But the \ncivilian losses were overwhelming, and the economic loss was dramatic. \nWe were hit with a body blow to our economy. So that line went down \nagain.\n  We had the bursting of the bubble, compounded by the single largest \nattack on our Nation certainly since Pearl Harbor, arguably exceeding \nPearl Harbor in many ways, and the economic impact forced the economy \ndown further. That is why the economy dropped. It wasn't the tax cuts \nthat dropped the revenue. The tax cuts have been shown to increase \nrevenues and will continue to increase revenues.\n  For the other side to take the position that anything else is \nhappening is wrong because the facts are clear. The revenues are going \nup, and they are jumping dramatically back to the norm, 18 percent \ngross domestic product for the revenue. A lot of that is a function of \ntax relief which we will be seeing in the tax package which will be \ncoming here to extend those tax relief initiatives in the next bill. \nBut this bill\n\n[[Page S12085]]\n\nis about reducing the deficit by $39 billion, $35 billion being the \noriginal instruction. It is a huge step in the right direction.\n  Now we should ask, I believe--and I think the Senator from South \nCarolina is going to make this point rather dramatically--what is the \nresponse from the other side of the aisle? The response from the other \nside of the aisle, as I believe the Senator from South Carolina is \ngoing to point out, is that their proposal is to spend more money. That \nis their proposal for reducing the debt around here. They are going to \nspend more money. That doesn't work.\n  Since January, they have proposed spending increases which have \nexceeded or reached almost a half-trillion dollars in new programs, new \ninitiatives, which isn't too surprising because that is the philosophy \nof the other side of the aisle. I don't think anyone takes that as a \nsurprise. On the other hand, where is their proposal to cut the \ndeficit, to reduce the debt, which the Senator from South Carolina \ntalks about?\n  We searched, and we found their proposal. Wow.\n  Here it is. Here is the Democratic proposal on the budget. They have \nno budget. They haven't proposed a budget. Even when they were in the \nmajority, they didn't propose a budget. At least they didn't bring one \nto the floor. They have no proposal at all to reduce the deficit or to \nreduce the debt. They do have a lot of concerns about our proposal. \nThat is understandable because we wrote it. They didn't vote for it. \nThere was not one Democratic vote for our budget. You wouldn't expect \nus to basically draft their language, but we are willing to take \nproposals, if they have them, to reduce the debt, to reduce the \ndeficit, proposals which are constructive. But so far, there has been \nno budget from the other side of the aisle.\n  There will be a lot of targeted amendments, I presume, to spend more \nmoney, which will raise taxes on working Americans and on Americans \ngenerally. But as a practical matter, their efforts to reduce the \ndeficit or reduce the debt are extraordinarily limited, especially \ncompared to what we have done.\n  This is the summary of what this bill does. It is not the tax bill. \nThis is not the tax relief bill. This is the debt reduction bill. It \nreduces by $71 billion entitlement spending, and $32 billion of new \nspending is put in place because we believed it was important to assist \ncertain groups and because it was fair. The vast majority or large \npercentage of the $71 billion came from education accounts by reducing \nthe corporate subsidies for lenders. Rather than take all of that money \nin deficit reduction, we believed a significant amount of that money--\nabout half--should flow back into student accounts to assist low-income \nstudents in getting a college education. It is a good proposal. The key \nto our Nation's capacity to compete is that we have creative and \nproductive people. That means you have to send people to college. We \nhave to help especially low-income kids get to college. This bill does \nthat to the tune of $11 billion. Maybe the other side is opposed to \nthat.\n  In addition, we want to make doctors more available to patients. We \nwant senior citizens, when they walk into a clinic or into their health \ncare area, to be able to see a doctor. We know that under the present \nlaw, doctors are going to be cut by 4.5 percent in their spending, and \nthey are going to drop out of the Medicare system. The Finance \nCommittee decided to fix that and hold doctors harmless by essentially \nfreezing their pay rather than cutting it 4.5 percent. That is where \nthe money is.\n  But the net effect of this bill is a $39 billion reduction in the \ndeficit. You can say it is not much. I happen to think it is a lot. In \nSouth Carolina, $39 billion is a lot of money. In Ohio, $39 billion is \na lot of money. In New Hampshire, $39 billion is a lot of money.\n  This bill is a lot of money put toward debt reduction. In my opinion, \nwe should be passing it and actually should be passing it on a \nbipartisan basis because if the other side genuinely wants to reduce \nthe debt and reduce the deficit, they have to vote for this bill. This \nis their opportunity.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from South Carolina who will have a \nlot of thoughts on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I understand the frustration of my \ncolleague because his party has given him an impossible task--to come \nout and defend a budget plan that explodes the debt.\n  You notice there was not one comment by the Senator about the debt. \nHere is why there was no comment about the debt. Here is what has \nhappened to debt under their watch. When President Bush took office, \nthe gross debt of the United States was $5.6 trillion. Each and every \nyear, the debt has gone up by $500 billion or $600 billion. In 2002, it \nwent up to $6.2 trillion, a $500 billion increase; in 2003, $6.8 \ntrillion, it went up another $600 billion; the next year, $7.4 \ntrillion, another $600 billion; the next year, $7.9 trillion, it went \nup another $500 billion. Here is what it is slated to do under the \nbudget plan they have put in place.\n  The debt keeps going up, up, up, by $600 billion a year by their own \ncalculation, and they are out here touting that they have a deficit \nreduction package. Excuse me. Have words lost their meaning? They are \nout here talking about reducing the deficit, and their fiscal plan has \ndone nothing but explode the debt of our country from $5.7 trillion \nwhen they took over and we are headed for over $11 trillion of debt by \nthe time they are done. And they are out here touting a plan of deficit \nreduction. Come on. Come on. That doesn't pass the laugh test.\n  I understand the Senator from South Carolina was up here with a chart \nthe other day that he called the Democratic Spend-O-Meter chart. Let me \naddress that.\n  The Democratic Spend-O-Meter chart of the Senator from South Carolina \nis a complete concoction. He claims that the Democratic amendments this \nyear would cost $470 billion. Absolute nonsense. Their Spend-O-Meter \nignores the fact that many of the Democratic amendments were offset. He \ndidn't count those offsets. In fact, because they included additional \ndeficit reduction, the net effect of all Democratic amendments on the \nbudget resolution would have reduced deficits by $57 billion.\n  Their Spend-O-Meter also double-counts the cost of some Democratic \namendments because they treat them as if they were a package instead of \noffered individually. Some Democratic amendments covered the same \nsubject area as an earlier amendment and would never have been offered \nif that earlier amendment had passed.\n  Their Spend-O-Meter also overstates the cost of Democratic amendments \nby misleading and falsely assigning 5-year costs to 1-year amendments. \nMost of these Democratic amendments were for only 1 year, but they have \ntaken them and made them into 5-year amendments.\n  Those weren't our amendments. That is your concoction. That is your \nfabrication. That is not right.\n  Democratic amendments to the 2006 budget resolution would have \nreduced the deficit by $57 billion. Republican amendments to the 2006 \nbudget resolution actually worsened the deficit by $79 billion. That is \nthe real story of what happened earlier this year--net cost of GOP \namendments: $79 billion of additional red ink; net effect of Democratic \namendments: $57 billion of reduction in the deficit.\n  I also want to respond to the more general accusation that Democrats \njust want to spend. I would like to remind my colleagues of the \nrecord. Under the last Democratic administration, spending as a share \nof the economy came down steadily year after year, falling from 22.1 \npercent of gross domestic production to 18.4 percent of gross domestic \nproduction. During the term of the Democratic administration, spending \nwent down.\n\n  Now I will compare that to the time since the Republicans gained \ncontrol. Under our Republican friends, spending has gone from 18.4 \npercent of gross domestic production to 22.2 percent of gross domestic \nproduction. Who are the big spenders? When we were in control, spending \nwent down. When they have been in control, spending has gone up.\n  That is not the end of the story. The bottom line is deficits. Here \nis the difference in the deficit records of various\n\n[[Page S12086]]\n\nadministrations going back to the Reagan administration. They were in \nsignificant deficit the entire period of the Reagan administration. The \nBush administration, Bush 1, dramatically increased the deficits. Under \nthe Clinton administration, we pulled out of deficit and actually went \ninto surplus for 3 years. In fact, 2 of the 3 years we were actually \nable to stop raiding Social Security trust funds.\n  Here is the deficit record under the second Bush administration: They \nplunged us right back into deep deficits and massive increase in debt. \nNow they have a budget plan that, by their own terms, by their own \ncalculations, increases the debt of the country by $3 trillion over the \nnext 5 years--and they are out here talking about reducing the deficit.\n  I suppose they can make the claim, but I don't think it will stand up \nvery well. I don't think it will stand up to much scrutiny because we \ncan look at the package--even this little package before the Senate \nright now. The fact is, there are many chapters to this book. The first \nchapter cut spending $39 billion. That is in the face of increasing the \ndebt by $3.4 trillion over the next 5 years. They talk about it being a \ngood start. I would say it is virtually no start. It is no start when \nyou consider the second chapter which will cut the revenue by $70 \nbillion. The combined effect is to increase the deficit.\n  If anyone wonders, go to chapter 3 where they increase the debt in 1 \nyear alone by $781 billion. And they call themselves fiscally \nconservative? My goodness, that is conservative? That is not any \ndefinition of conservative I have read anywhere.\n  Let's see what is happening to the debt under our friends. They came \nin and it was $5.7 trillion and they have already run it up to $8 \ntrillion. Here is what their budget proposal is doing now. If we adopt \nthe 5-year budget plan, they will have run the debt of the country from \n$5.7 trillion to over $11 trillion. That is their record.\n  What are the results of these policies? The results of these policies \nare to build a wall of debt. Every year, debt is going up $600 billion \na year under their budget plan. These are their numbers. Not my \nnumbers, their numbers.\n  What does that translate into? That translates into an increase of \ndebt by over $1 million a minute. That is the fact. That is what we are \ntalking about.\n  What is the result? The result is in 4 years, they have doubled the \ndebt held by foreign countries. U.S. debt held by foreign countries and \nforeign investors has doubled. It took 224 years to run up $1 trillion \nof foreign-held debt. In only 4 years, they have doubled it.\n  Here is the record, looking at the other 42 Presidents in American \nhistory. It took them 224 years to run up $1 trillion of external debt. \nThis President has exceeded them in 4 years. This President has run up \nover $1 trillion of foreign-held debt in his term: $1.05 trillion \nversus 42 other Presidents, $1.01 trillion. It is pretty stunning what \nhas happened.\n  And the result? Here it is: We now owe Japan over $684 billion. We \nowe China $248 billion. We owe the United Kingdom over $174 billion. We \nowe the Caribbean Banking Centers over $100 billion. This strengthens \nthe country? How does that strengthen the country?\n  They do not want anyone to read chapter 3 of the book. No. They want \nto talk about deficit reduction. It is a wonderful title, but it has no \nrelationship to the facts. The budget they have before the Senate does \nnot reduce any deficit. They increase the deficit. They explode the \ndebt. Under their own calculations they will increase the debt over the \n5 years of this budget proposal by over $3 trillion. They have the \nchutzpah to come out here and talk about deficit reduction.\n  Let's read the third chapter of their book. The third chapter \nincreases the debt limit of the United States in 1 year by $781 \nbillion. And they are out here talking about deficit reduction? Come \non.\n  The chairman said accurately we did not present a budget. That is \nexactly right, we did not present a budget. Why didn't we present a \nbudget? Because they are in control. They are in control of the White \nHouse. They are in control of the Senate. They are in control of the \nHouse. We first had to try to defeat their proposal. Only then would we \nhave had an opportunity or a chance to offer an alternative.\n  The first test was, can we defeat their budget? I tried my darnedest. \nThe chairman knows that. I tried very hard to defeat the budget \nproposal they put before our colleagues because it exploded the debt by \ntheir own calculations by more than $3 trillion over the next 5 years. \nBut I didn't succeed. They won. They passed their budget. If we could \nhave stopped them, if we could have defeated them, then an alternative \nwould have been in order and I would have been happy to offer an \nalternative if we had a chance to prevail. There was no chance to \nprevail. They won. The country lost, but they won. The country lost \nbecause their budget did not reduce the deficit. It increased the \ndeficit and it exploded the debt.\n  By their own calculations, this 5-year budget they have put together \nwill increase the debt of our country by $3 trillion. That is a fact.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield such time as the Senator from South Carolina may \nuse.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, could I inquire what the parliamentary \nsituation is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is controlled today between the Senators \nfrom New Hampshire and North Dakota.\n  Mr. SARBANES. How much time is available to each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 4 hours 33 \nminutes. The Senator from New Hampshire has 4 hours 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I understand the Senator from New Hampshire has now \nyielded to the Senator from South Carolina. Could I inquire, so I have \nsome idea of the sequencing, how much time the Senator from South \nCarolina will be using?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Ten or 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. After the Senator from South Carolina speaks, I intend to \nspeak for 15 minutes and offer an amendment. Then it would be back to \nyour side for whatever time you wish to take, so about half an hour \nfrom now.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would it be possible to make an opening statement \nbefore the chairman of the committee offers an amendment?\n  Mr. GREGG. I want to get the amendment in the queue. I will offer the \namendment and then I will let the Senator from North Dakota yield to \nyou for whatever you need for an opening statement--15 minutes?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. And then back to me to explain the amendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  I find the comments of the Senator from North Dakota very curious, if \nnot amusing. I find the opposition to this deficit reduction package \nperplexing.\n  How can we come to the Senate and rail against deficits and, at the \nsame time, rail against spending cuts? Some of my colleagues have \ngotten comfortable with voting against something before they vote for \nit.\n  In 1993, when the Senate was considering mandatory spending \nreductions much like we are considering today--only then it was $77 \nbillion, about twice as much as we are considering cutting today--the \nSenator from North Dakota supported it. Not only did he support it, he \ntook the lead in pushing for more spending cuts. To quote the Senator \nfrom North Dakota:\n\n       I am one of those on the Democratic side who insisted on \n     more spending cuts . . . I did so because I believed very \n     strongly that we had to have more spending cuts to have \n     balance in this program . . . Madam President, we succeeded . \n     . . We got more spending cuts.\n\n  The Senator also said:\n\n       When we talk about there being too much spending, when we \n     talk about the Federal budget being out of control, Medicare \n     and Medicaid are part of the explanations.\n\n  And, again, in 1997, when the Senate was considering mandatory \nspending reductions which totaled $107 billion, which is almost three \ntimes what we are considering today, the Senator from North Dakota \nsupported it, too. Again, he not only voted for it but he called for \neven more spending cuts.\n\n[[Page S12087]]\n\n  Again, the Senator said:\n\n       I, too, am proud to have voted for the provisions that we \n     passed this morning that will finish the job of balancing the \n     unified budget . . . Frankly, I would have done more by way \n     of deficit reduction. I wish we had been more ambitious. I \n     wish we would have done more in the long-term reform of \n     entitlement programs, but that was not to be. That is for \n     another day.\n\n  This is all very confusing to me. How can the Senator be for spending \nreductions in 1993, in 1997, but then oppose them today? I don't want \nto make any assumptions, but this appears to be politically driven \nbecause the only thing that has changed since 1993 and 1997 is the man \nin the White House.\n  The Senator is correct that the Republicans are now in the majority. \nBut history will show that the Republicans in the majority in the 1990s \nworked with President Clinton to cut the budget and balance the budget \nover time.\n  Our country faces many difficult challenges. But my colleagues \ncontinue to talk a good game while they obstruct at every turn. It \nactually reminds me of an experience when I was a teenager taking \nlifeguarding classes at a swimming pool. One of the parts of the final \ntest for that lifeguarding class was to swim to the bottom of the deep \nend, pick up a concrete block, bring it back to the surface and then \nswim to the other side of the pool. Every day when I get up in \nWashington, DC, I feel I have to go down to the bottom of the pool and \npick up my Democratic colleagues and drag them across the pool.\n  On energy, while we hear rhetoric in the Senate blaming the President \nfor high energy prices, the Democrats vote en bloc to keep us from \ndeveloping the oil resources we have in this country. In a committee \nmeeting last week we wanted to build new refineries, modern, \nenvironmentally safe refineries on old military bases, but the \nDemocrats voted en bloc to stop it.\n  I heard this morning from the Senator from North Dakota about \nspending Social Security on other things. Yet when Republicans this \nyear proposed we stop spending Social Security on other things and save \nit in Treasury notes, they en bloc came out against it.\n  The same thing is happening today on deficit reduction.\n  They say they want deficit reduction, but they are on the floor \nspeaking out against it. I find the comments coming from the other side \nof the aisle very interesting. I keep hearing how ``we are opposed to \nbudget deficits,'' but this chart will show how they spend, spend, \nspend.\n  If I could--and my colleague from North Dakota referenced some of the \namendments that we brought up last week, which they said were offset--I \nthink it is important, when we speak on the floor, we get our facts \nstraight. Because these are the amendments offered by the Democrats \nthat would increase the budget by over a half a trillion dollars, none \nof which were offset. There were other amendments offered with some \noffsets, but, as shown on this chart, this would increase the spending \nand the deficit by over a half a trillion dollars.\n  If we look at it in total--since we are using some moving charts this \nmorning--if we want to be accurate--again, this gets back to the \nconcrete block analogy--we are trying to cut spending in this Senate, \nwhich is only a third of what we did last time we went through this \nsame procedure, with Democratic support, yet amendments have been \noffered that have taken this all the way up to the top of $500 billion \nand beyond, with the new amendments that were offered last week.\n  It is important, as a nation, we address difficult issues in a sound, \nfiscally responsible way. This bill before us this week is very modest, \nwith spending cuts that reduce no care to the poor; they are cutting \nwasteful spending and fraud from Medicaid and other programs. This \nshould be an easy vote for every Member of the Senate. There is other \nspending that we need to address. This bill should be easy.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to set the rhetoric aside. Let's \nleave the concrete block at the bottom of the pool and swim across it \ntogether and get this done on behalf of the American people.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chariman for this time and yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2347\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], for Mr. Frist, \n     for himself and Mr. Gregg, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2347.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide amounts to address influenza and newly emerging \n                               pandemics)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. ASSISTANCE TO COMBAT INFLUENZA AND NEWLY EMERGING \n                   PANDEMICS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Out of any money in the Treasury of the \n     United States not otherwise appropriated in title VII, there \n     are appropriated $2,780,000,000 to enable the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services to carry out the activities \n     described in subsection (c).\n       (b) Additional Amounts.--Out of any money in the Treasury \n     of the United States not otherwise appropriated in title III, \n     there are appropriated $1,174,000,000 to enable the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services to carry out the activities \n     described in subsection (c).\n       (c) Activities.--From amounts appropriated under \n     subsections (a) and (b), the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services shall utilize--\n       (1) $577,000,000 to intensify surveillance of influenza and \n     other newly emerging pandemics and outbreaks;\n       (2) $2,800,000,000 for the development and stockpiling of \n     antivirals and vaccines for influenza and other newly \n     emerging pandemics; and\n       (3) $577,000,000 to establish a seamless network of \n     Federal, State, and local authorities for preparedness \n     relating to influenza and other newly emerging pandemics.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it is my understanding that at this point \nthe Senator from North Dakota is yielding time to the Senator from \nMaryland, and it will be taken from the time of the Senator from North \nDakota. After the Senator from Maryland makes his statement, I will \nreclaim the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak on the measure before us. As we well \nknow, budgets are all about priorities. The budget resolution which was \npassed earlier this year paved the way for the reconciliation \nlegislation which is now before us, legislation which I strongly \nbelieve represents the wrong set of priorities for America.\n  I say this for two primary reasons. One is the adverse impact this \nlegislation will have on the Nation's soaring budget deficit; in \neffect, what it does to the fiscal underpinnings of our economy. The \nsecond very strong reason is the impact this legislation will have on \nfamilies all across the country.\n  I commend the able Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, for his \nvery effective leadership on this issue. He has been consistent \nthroughout in trying to bring a sense of fiscal responsibility to our \nbudget deliberations. His presentation earlier today has maintained \nthat strong commitment, as he set out the fiscal consequences of the \npath on which we are proceeding.\n  The reconciliation process, which originated in the mid-1970s, \nprovides fast-track procedural protections for reconciliation bills, \nwhich are supposedly designed to help achieve the goal of reducing \nbudget deficits. Regrettably, that goal has been absent from the \nreconciliation process since 1997, which was the last time the Congress \nconsidered a reconciliation bill that actually sought to bring down the \ndeficit. In fact, in recent years, the reconciliation process has been \nused not to bring down the deficit but to cut taxes. So a process \ndesigned to help reduce budget deficits has actually made our deficits \nworse, significantly worse, by speeding through the Congress package \nafter package of excessive tax cuts.\n  This year's reconciliation process is no different. The budget \nresolution, which passed on a party-line vote earlier this year, \nprovided fast-track procedural protection for both a spending bill and \na tax bill. Both were provided this protection under the reconciliation \nprocess. So if one is to see the impact made on the deficit by the \nreconciliation process, one has to take into account both of these \nmeasures. Only one of the two is before us today. But the other is \nscheduled to follow\n\n[[Page S12088]]\n\nnext week. They constitute part of a package.\n  Now, the budget resolution, passed earlier in the year, required \nvarious committees to make $35 billion in spending cuts. The effort to \nimplement that is reflected in the legislation before us today. That \nsame budget resolution required the Finance Committee to report a tax \nbill that reduces revenues by $70 billion. So we have a requirement, \nunder the budget resolution now being implemented by this fast-track \nprocedure, of $35 billion in spending cuts which I understand is \nactually coming in at $39 billion--and $70 billion in tax cuts.\n  The consequence of using this reconciliation process for both the \nspending cuts and the tax cuts will be to increase the budget deficit \nby more than $30 billion. So the reconciliation legislation, originally \ndesigned for the purpose of budget deficit reduction, is not, in fact, \ngoing to reduce the budget deficit; it is going to increase the budget \ndeficit. This bill is really about trying to make room for more tax \ncuts, primarily benefitting the people at the very top of the income \nand wealth scale.\n  When you look at the reconciliation instructions in the budget \nresolution, on both the tax and spending sides, that conclusion is \ninescapable. The reconciliation legislation is a clear example of a \nfiscal policy that places a higher priority on tax cuts than on funding \nneeded services and reducing the deficit. To me, that is a misplaced \npriority but, regrettably, one that has marked this administration.\n  Now, if the ranking member would yield for a couple of questions?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is my understanding that when President Bush came \ninto office in 2001, the fiscal situation which he inherited was one \nwhere we actually we were running a surplus in the Federal budget, if I \nam not mistaken. We were projecting a surplus, over the next 10-year \nperiod--2002 to 2011--of $5.6 trillion. I say to my colleague; is that \ncorrect? That was the projection at the time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Of course, these were projections. We recognize that. \nBut they were the best estimate that could be made. Over a 10-year \nperiod, we were projecting a surplus of $5.6 billion. In fact, some \nsaid we were paying down the debt too quickly, if the Senator will \nrecall?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, they did. In fact, they were concerned we were going \nto pay off too much debt.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I understand it, today, after this series of \nexcessive tax cuts the President has pushed through, using this \nreconciliation process--actually, I think, abusing it, not using it, \nbecause it was designed to reduce deficits, not to increase deficits--\nbut using this fast-track procedure, the President and his allies in \nthe Congress have pushed through a series of excessive tax cuts.\n  So as I understand it, we are now in deficit, $317 billion for the \nfiscal year that just ended, and we are facing projected deficits, over \nthe next 10 years, of $4.5 trillion; is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is correct. So we have had a swing from \nprojections of a $5.6 trillion surplus to more than a $4 trillion \ndeficit. That is a swing of $10 trillion.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to underscore what the very able \nSenator from North Dakota has pointed out. This is an incredible \ndeterioration in the fiscal position of our Nation. We have gone, in \nless than 5 years' time, from projecting a surplus of $5.6 trillion, \nover a 10-year period, to a point where we are now projecting a deficit \nof $4.5 trillion over a 10-year period. And as the able Senator points \nout, that is a swing in our fiscal position of $10 trillion--$10 \ntrillion in the wrong direction. It is incredible when one stops to \nthink about it.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would say to the Senator, if I could, the situation is \neven much worse. Why is it much worse? Because the deficits understate \nwhat is happening to the debt.\n  Last year, for example, the deficit went up by something over $300 \nbillion, but the debt went up by $551 billion. Most of the difference \nis the money they are taking from Social Security. Last year, they \ntook, under the President's plan, $173 billion of Social Security money \nand used it to pay for other things. It all gets added to the debt, but \nnone of it counts toward the deficit calculation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Could I ask the Senator, who is holding this debt?\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. GREGG. As the Senator knows, I did yield to the Senator to make \nan opening statement. The understanding was it would be for about 10 \nminutes. It has been about 15 now. I am wondering if the Senator is \nplanning on going on for an extended period of time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If I could have 4 or 5 more minutes, I could draw to a \nclose.\n  Mr. GREGG. That would be great. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the chairman.\n  Well, as was pointed out, rather than conserving the budget surplus, \nwhich President Bush inherited, he has chosen to risk our fiscal future \nthrough excessive tax cuts--tax cuts targeted to those who need them \nthe least. This reconciliation process before us will only continue \nthat pattern.\n  The reconciliation process is supposed to provide special protection \nto measures to bring the deficit down, not to provide special \nprotection to a combination of measures, as we have here: some spending \ncuts but greatly exceeded by tax cuts.\n  So the net result of the reconciliation measures to be considered \nthis week and next week will be an increase in the deficit of $30 \nbillion. I don't know anyone who can contest that. It is pretty well \nconceded.\n  The instructions made it clear from the outset there was to be $35 \nbillion in spending cuts--and they have increased it a few billion--and \n$70 billion in tax cuts. You put the two together, you have an increase \nin the deficit of over $30 billion.\n  We are facing serious future challenges. The Senator from North \nDakota has been the leader in pointing out to us the need to consider \nthe baby boomers as they approach retirement age, the impact that will \nhave on the fiscal situation of the country, and how we can deal with \nthat in a balanced and equitable way. That discussion is not taking \nplace. Instead, we have this fast-track process in which the most \nvulnerable amongst us are asked to make the sacrifices in terms of the \nprograms being cut, such as Medicaid and Medicare.\n  The New York Times, in an editorial on October 26, titled ``Stalking \nthe Poor to Soothe the Affluent,'' said:\n\n       Impoverished Americans are being set up as targets this \n     week in Congress's desperate attempt to find budget cuts \n     after four straight years of tax cuts for the affluent.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I draw to a close, I just want to underscore what is \nhappening. I had put a question to the Senator from North Dakota and \nthere wasn't an opportunity to answer. Our debt is escalating at a \nfaster rate than the budget deficit, which compounds the situation. Who \nis holding this debt? Who is buying this paper and, therefore, has \nclaims against U.S. citizens looking out into the future?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Increasingly, this debt is being held by foreign \ncountries and foreign investors. If you think about it, during the \nPresident's watch so far, he has increased the debt from $5.6 trillion \nto $7.9 trillion. That is a $2.3 trillion increase in the debt so far \nunder his watch. I keep urging my colleagues to understand that you \ncan't tell a book by its cover. This cover says it is deficit \nreduction. That is just the first chapter. You have to read all the \nchapters to conclude what is happening.\n  What is happening is, as the Senator has correctly described, the \nfirst chapter is, cut a little bit of spending. The second chapter is, \ncut even more revenue. The third chapter is--and this is the one they \nreally don't want people to read--increase the debt of the country by \n$781 billion for 1 year. That will take the total up to over $3 \ntrillion of added debt in just the 5 years that this President has been \nin power. Who is holding the debt?\n  Increasingly, it is foreigners. This President has increased foreign \nholdings of our debt by a trillion dollars. It\n\n[[Page S12089]]\n\ntook 42 Presidents 224 years to run up a trillion dollars of external \ndebt. This President has more than doubled that amount in 4 years.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I close with this observation: In one of \nhis plays, Tennessee Williams has a character, Blanche Dubois, who \nsays: I have always depended on the kindness of strangers. That is what \nis happening to the fiscal future of the United States of America. We \nare becoming increasingly dependent on foreign nations, in many \ninstances central bankers, not individuals, central bankers buying our \ndebt, holding this paper, financing this deficit, underwriting this \ndebt. The United States, as a consequence, is losing a measure of its \nstrength and independence which only underscores the seriousness of the \nsituation we confront.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, we owe Japan over $680 billion.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, point of order: No question was asked by \nthe Senator from North Dakota. Is it correct to have an interchange of \nthis nature?\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I interpreted a question from the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I asked the Senator who was holding the debt.\n  Mr. CONRAD. He had asked who was holding the debt, and this is who is \nholding the debt.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from North Dakota's response was not in \nrelationship to a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has the floor. He \nmay not ask questions of other Senators, but he may respond to \nquestions from other Senators.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to ask the Senator from Maryland a \nquestion, if he would yield for that purpose.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator can see here the answer to the question he \nposed to me. I would ask: Who is holding the debt?\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I look at the chart which the Senator has presented, \nJapan has $684 billion of it; China, $248 billion--and that is rapidly \nescalating, moving upwards very fast--the United Kingdom, $174 billion. \nCaribbean banking centers are holding over $100 billion of our national \ndebt. This is a recipe for eventual disaster if we don't get this \nsituation under control. The budget reconciliation process ought not to \nbe used in such a way that the ultimate result is going to be an \nincrease in our deficit and a further runup of the debt.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member for this opportunity to \nspeak. I again commend Senator Conrad from North Dakota for the \neffective and consistent leadership he has provided over the years in \naddressing the important question of the fiscal underpinnings of our \nnational economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                Stalking the Poor To Soothe the Affluent\n\n       Impoverished Americans are being set up as targets this \n     week in Congress's desperate attempt to find budget cuts \n     after four straight years of tax cuts for the affluent. House \n     Republicans propose harmful cuts in Medicaid access and \n     benefits, while forcing another 10 hours of work from welfare \n     families and giving states free rein to pile more draconian \n     reductions onto the most vulnerable citizens.\n       This gross political posturing does not even translate into \n     true savings. While imperiously proclaiming cuts of $50 \n     billion over five years, Congressional leaders are determined \n     to fiddle more harmfully with the revenue half of the budget \n     and to pass an additional $70 billion in upper-bracket tax \n     cuts.\n       The proposals would have the federal government--supposedly \n     the protector of the neediest--give the states broad leeway \n     to restrict current benefits; to require co-payments by the \n     poor for medicine and for care by doctors and emergency \n     rooms; and to cut preventive care for children, who represent \n     half of the Medicaid roll. The food stamp program would \n     probably also be hit with a $1 billion cut, and even welfare \n     payments to elderly people who are sick would be crimped by \n     using federal bookkeeping tricks.\n       One particularly boneheaded proposal would severely cut the \n     funds for child support enforcement by $4 billion. This \n     program currently returns $4 in benefits from natural parents \n     for every dollar invested.\n       The proposals are so appalling that moderate Republicans \n     are even said to be considering a show of life on the floor. \n     In contrast, Senate Republicans are shaping cuts that would \n     spare the poor's Medicaid and other safety nets, while \n     finding savings in Medicare overpayments.\n       The Senate approach is obviously preferable, but it is also \n     rooted in the G.O.P.'s pre-election fiction that overspending \n     is the basic problem. The tax cuts should be scuttled and the \n     poor protected.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I had, as a matter of courtesy, yielded the \nfloor so the Senator from Maryland could speak; he said for 10 minutes. \nIt has now been a half hour. Cooperation does help in this institution.\n  Cooperation also helps on bills such as this. The Senator from North \nDakota has taken considerable time to talk about the reduction in the \ndeficit in the 1990s and the fact that we went into surplus, claiming \nit as an action of the Democratic Party. The deficit reduction which \noccurred during that part, there was another player in that, and that \nwas the Republican Congress which essentially asked President Clinton \nto pursue a course of a balanced budget. And with some reticence, the \nfinal agreement was reached, and a balanced budget bill was passed. It \nwas passed in cooperation. There was cooperation from Republican \nmembership with a Democratic President.\n  It would be nice if we had that cooperation today from our Democratic \ncolleagues. I find it uniquely ironic that they have decided to oppose \na bill which reduces the deficit by $35 billion--that initially was the \ndemand; it was a proposal put forward; now it is up to $39 billion--on \nthe representation that, well, they can't support this bill because \nthere may be a later bill that gives tax relief. You can't have it both \nways. You can't claim you are for deficit reduction and for reducing \nthe debt and then vote against the one opportunity you are going to \nhave to do so. The one opportunity is this bill. This isn't a tax \nrelief bill. There are no tax relief proposals in this bill at all. \nThis is not a bill that in any way harms people of lower incomes.\n  In fact, the vast majority of the new spending in this bill is \ndirected specifically at low-income students and patients on Medicare \nand assisting both of them. The Medicaid proposals in this bill were \ncrafted by the Finance Committee to make sure they focused on making \nthat program more efficient. It will actually, if the language in this \nbill passes, have an impact on the pharmaceutical industry but not on \nlow-income individuals who benefit from Medicaid. In fact, because it \nhas significant expansion of the flexibility of Governors to deal with \nMedicaid, most of the Governors you talk to, any that are sort of good \nmanagers, are saying they can do a lot more. They are going to be able \nto deliver a lot more Medicaid services to a lot more people as a \nresult of the language in this bill, even though it saves money in the \nMedicaid accounts, because they are giving Governors more flexibility.\n  This is a bill which actually produces significant improvements in \nthe delivery of services in this country to low-income individuals, \nespecially those who want to go to college, those who are benefiting \nfrom Medicare, and those who are benefiting from Medicaid. At the same \ntime, it reduces the deficit by $39 billion, or $35 billion if the \namendment I just offered happens to be passed.\n  To say that you are not going to vote for this bill because there may \nbe some bill coming down the road that gives tax relief to people is \nnot consistent, and then to argue that you are for deficit reduction on \ntop of that. This is your opportunity to vote for deficit reduction. \nThis is it. This is the only vote you are going to get--at least in \nthis exercise of reconciliation--to reduce the deficit. So vote for \nthis. And if you are not happy with the tax relief package, vote \nagainst the tax relief package. Take the good, which you allegedly \nclaim you want, which is deficit reduction, and reject what you \nconsider to be bad, which is the tax relief package coming later.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. No, I will not yield at this time.\n  The tax relief package to which they are opposed, which is coming \ndown the pike, which they allege is part of this package so they have \nto vote against the debt reduction deficit reduction package, let's \ntalk about what is in that package potentially.\n  The alternative minimum tax: Something like 8 million people will be\n\n[[Page S12090]]\n\nadded to the alternative minimum tax if we don't extend what is known \nas the patch, if we don't exempt those people from being added to it. \nThat is a $30 billion item right there. The folks on the other side \nwant to vote against the tax reconciliation bill. They want to raise \ntaxes on 8 million people. They want to create a tax revenue of $30 \nbillion by making the alternative minimum tax apply to middle-income \nAmericans. That is their choice.\n  The research and experimentation tax credit, the R credit, this is \nthe credit which allows entrepreneurs, especially small businesses, to \ninvest in R, which produces jobs, which makes our country more \ncompetitive, which keeps jobs from going overseas, which gives people \ncareers. This is one of the most important tax initiatives in our Tax \nCode because it increases economic activity and increases opportunity \nand jobs. They want to vote against that one. Fine. Raise the taxes on \nsmall business and entrepreneurs who want to do R That is the second \nlargest item, $7 billion, that is going to expire in the next 2 years.\n  The deductibility of qualified credits, teachers' deductibility. We \ntalked about that before. When teachers go out and buy things for their \nclassrooms, they get a deduction for it. If they want to raise taxes on \nteachers, go ahead, have a tax increase on teachers.\n  The deduction for State and local sales taxes: Which States benefit \nfrom the deductibility of State and local taxes? Massachusetts, \nConnecticut, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, California--those are the \nhigh tax States. They are the ones with the highest sales taxes. How \nmany Republican Senators are there from those States? I don't think \nthere are any. But that is one of the items. They appear to want to \nraise taxes on people in those States by making their sales tax not \ndeductible.\n  I have to tell you, I come from New Hampshire. We don't have a sales \ntax or an income tax. If you want to eliminate the deductibility of \nsales taxes, it is no skin off our nose. But I don't think it happens \nto be that great a policy. But that appears to be the position that is \nbeing taken here, if you listen to the other side as they excoriate the \npackage of proposals that is coming at us as a result of the \nreconciliation process: First, the deficit reduction bill, the debt \nreduction bill; second, the reconciliation bill on taxes, the majority \nof which includes these right here. And these are the ones that are \nexpiring in the next 2 years.\n  Then the third is the debt ceiling, which is put under \nreconciliation. Well, you know, we are at war. We had a downturn of \ndramatic proportions as a result of the bursting of the Internet \nbubble, and this country's expenses have gone up rather significantly \nbecause of those two factors--especially the cost of the war. In fact, \nif you look at discretionary spending, almost the entire increase is an \nattempt to fight terrorism and protect our Nation. Now, it may be that \nthe other side of the aisle does not want to pay those bills, that they \nthink we should not do a debt increase. Well, if you do that, the \nFederal Government defaults on its debt, chaos occurs in the \nmarketplace, and people's savings will be wiped out not only in the \nUnited States but across the globe.\n  Maybe that is the fiscal position of the other side of the aisle. A \ndebt reduction bill is a technical step in the sense it increases our \nability to borrow the money. We are going to borrow the money because \nwe have the debts. It is like saying, when you get your credit card \nbill, you are not going to pay it. Well, the practical implication of \nnot paying is you file bankruptcy. Maybe the other side's position is \nlet's file bankruptcy. It seems to be we should do nothing. However, \nthe rate at which that credit card is being charged--because this is \nthe only bill that does that. This is a deficit reduction bill. The $39 \nbillion bill that is pending before us is a deficit reduction bill. So \nif you are not going to vote for this bill, you have no credibility on \nthe issue of whether you are willing to cut the deficit or debt. It is \none separate bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will not yield. I yielded to the Senator for 30 minutes \nwhen he asked for 10, and to tell you the truth, I don't think that was \nconsistent with the comity of the Senate.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Now, the Senator should yield on that point.\n  Mr. GREGG. No, I will not yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. On questioning the comity of the Senate, the Senator \nshould yield on that point.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will not yield on that point.\n  The next item: The second point is how much money have we generated \nfrom this tax cut. The tax cut has energized a significant increase in \nrevenue to us relative to the budget. We have seen a 14-percent \nincrease in 2005. We will see a 6-percent increase in 2006, and it is \nprojected that this will continue to go up significantly as we move \ninto the outyears. That is because as you reduce the tax rate on \nworking Americans, you significantly expand the revenue of the Federal \nGovernment because people become more productive and they generate more \nactivity, which generates income to the Federal Government.\n  That has been proven over and over and over again. The tax cuts of \nPresident Bush have shown that, the tax cuts of President Reagan showed \nit, and the first person to show it in fairly definitive terms was \nPresident John F. Kennedy, who put forth his tax cut which generated \nsignificant revenues to the Federal Government.\n  We are seeing a dramatic expansion in the revenue activity of this \nGovernment. To say anything else is inaccurate. Yes, the budget deficit \nis $314 billion, but it was supposed to be $440 billion or $420 \nbillion. We have generated $100 billion of reduction in the deficit and \nalmost all of it, almost all of it has been a function of new revenues \ncoming into the Federal Government. There has also been essentially a \nfreeze on discretionary spending, nondefense, which has been good, but \nessentially all that revenue has come out of this, come out of the fact \nthat we cut taxes and we have generated more economic activity.\n  So when the argument is made that the tax cuts are inappropriate and \nthat we are generating cuts for wealthy individuals at the expense of \nlow-income individuals, it is just not consistent with the fact. The \nfact is, this deficit reduction plan significantly reduces the deficit \nbut does it in a way that does not impact low-income individuals. In \nfact, the new spending initiatives in this plan, which are fully paid \nfor by offsetting reductions, dramatically benefit low-income \nindividuals, especially those who are working, who are going to \ncollege, and who are trying to benefit from Medicare.\n  Secondly, the tax provisions which will be coming in the next \nexercise, which is independent of this exercise, are provisions which \nare generally supported by most Americans. They are the deductibility \nof the R tax credit, deductibility of education credits, \ndeductibility of savings credits, State and local taxes, sales taxes, \nand, of course, the AMT fix. The tax revenues of this country are going \nup dramatically on an annual basis, and they are projected to continue \nto go up. So we don't have a problem that we are an undertaxed society. \nWe have a problem that we are not controlling spending.\n  The pending amendment which I sent to the desk is an amendment to \naddress the fact that we are confronting a very significant threat in \nthe world called avian flu. This Congress, this Senate, has tried to \naddress this issue a couple times, but we know the avian flu issue is a \nticking time bomb out there. Whether it is going to happen today or \nwhether it is going to happen--well, not today, obviously, but whether \nit is going to happen within 12 months or 2 years or 5 years, we know \nthe threat should avian flu transfer from birds over to humans is huge \nbecause we have a record to look to, which is the pandemics of the \nearly part of this century.\n  We need to get ready for it, and we all recognize it, and there is an \nurgency to do that. It has been a bipartisan push to try to accomplish \nthat. So this amendment essentially takes some of the dollars which \nhave been saved in excess of the original reconciliation instruction \nand applies those dollars to try to address the pandemic situation.\n  In trying to accomplish that, we have addressed what I think is a \nsignificant need. In addressing the avian flu issue, it is more than \njust a money issue. We\n\n[[Page S12091]]\n\nall know that. There has to be an incentive for the vaccine industry to \naggressively pursue some sort of cure to address not only avian flu but \navian flu as it mutates through various systems. That has not been \naccomplished yet. But we know it will not be accomplished until we are \nsuccessful in standing up to the vaccine industry and making sure that \nthey have the resources to pursue an adequate treatment.\n\n  This amendment tries to accomplish that, and thus I have offered it.\n  At this point I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I think the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee just summed up the position of his party when he said we have \nto borrow the money because we have the debt. That is exactly right. \nTheir party has put us on a fiscal course to explode the debt. And when \nthe Senator talks about deficit reduction, which is on the cover of the \nbook of the matter that we are discussing today--it says deficit \nreduction--it just doesn't have any credibility because it is part of a \npackage. The package is the budget that was passed earlier this year. \nThis reconciliation process we are going through now was authorized by \nthat budget. That budget didn't reduce any deficit; it increased the \ndeficit. Most seriously, it exploded the debt.\n  Well, here it is. The budget we are working to conclude increases the \ndebt by $3.4 trillion over the next 5 years. The spending cut they have \nout here right now is $39 billion. By the way, they are about to reduce \nthat because the first amendment from our colleagues on the other side \nis a spending amendment.\n  But let's look at the whole package, the whole package that our \ncolleagues have offered the country, have offered the Senate. If \ndoesn't reduce the deficit, it doesn't reduce the debt, it dramatically \nexpands the debt--not by my calculation but by their calculation. Here \nis their calculation of the increase in the debt of their 5-year budget \nproposal. They are going to run up the debt $3.4 trillion. This \nspending out here over 5 years of $39 billion basically does not touch \nit.\n  Now, my colleague had a whole list of possible tax cuts and said, \nwell, maybe we are for increasing the taxes on the American people, on \nthose various items. I support extension of many of those tax cuts, but \nI believe they ought to be paid for. That is the way we used to do \nbusiness around here. We used to have a provision we called pay-go, and \nif you wanted to increase spending or you wanted to have more tax cuts, \nyou could do it, but you had to pay for it. There is an old-fashioned \nidea: pay for it. Our colleagues over here don't want to pay for \nanything. They want every tax cut, they want every spending provision--\nthis increase in spending. They are in control. The spending they are \ncomplaining about, they passed it. They control the Senate of the \nUnited States. They control the House of Representatives. They control \nthe White House. Every dime of this spending that they are complaining \nabout, they passed--every dime of it. The President has not vetoed one \nspending bill. Every dime of this spending they supported.\n  But here is what they did on the revenue side. This is what has \nhappened to the revenue. The revenue side of the equation collapsed, \nand, yes, we have had an upkick in the last year, absolutely. The \nSenator is correct. Revenue has increased in the last year. But look at \nwhere it is. It is way below the historical level. The result of this \ncombination of their spending increases and their tax cuts has been to \nexplode the deficits. We have had in the last 3 years the largest \ndeficits in the history of the country. They have exploded the debt--\nnot by my calculation but by their own calculation and by the historic \nrecord.\n  Look, when this President came in, the debt was $5.7 trillion. In 5 \nyears he is going to have added $3 trillion, if this budget plan \npasses. They ran up the debt another $551 billion for the last year \nalone. They are going to increase the debt of this country in the 5 \nyears of this Presidency by $3 trillion, and in the next 5 years they \nare going to run it up another $3 trillion.\n  Now, facts are stubborn things. It is very interesting that my \ncolleague on the other side, when he put up the possible tax cuts they \nare talking about, left this one out. You didn't see this. You didn't \nsee this one mentioned, the capital gains and dividends tax cuts. Here \nis the distribution of those tax cuts, who gets them: Those earning \nover $1 million a year will get, on average, a $35,000 tax cut. Those \nearning less than $50,000 a year, this is what they get: $6--$6. That \nis what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle think is a fair \ndistribution of the tax cuts--$6 for those earning less than $50,000 a \nyear, $35,000 for those earning over $1 million a year. And one of the \nways they reduce the cost of all this is to take from the least among \nus.\n  Go look at what the House of Representatives is proposing by way of \ntheir spending cuts. They are going to cut Medicaid, they are going to \ncut food stamps, the things that go to the least among us so that they \ncan give additional tax cuts to those who have the most among us.\n  That is not a value that I have read in any Bible. My Bible does not \nsay take from the least among us to give to the most among us. I have \nnot seen that in any chapter of the Bible or, for that matter, in any \nholy book. Virtually every religion--perhaps every religion--has as a \nvalue that we help the least among us. We don't take from the least \namong us to give to those who have the most. But that is exactly what \nis before us in this proposal.\n  Again I say to my colleagues, you can't separate out the first \nchapter of the book they have labeled deficit reduction; you have to \nread the whole book. You have to read all the chapters. If you read the \nchapters of this book, what you find is in chapter 1, they cut a little \nbit of spending, in chapter 2 they cut even more revenue, and in \nchapter 3, they explode the debt by $781 billion. And they call it \ndeficit reduction? Please.\n  If you look at the whole book, if you read the entire book, what you \nfind is they are going to increase the debt of our country by $3 \ntrillion over the next 5 years. And they are out here talking about \ndeficit reduction? No, that dog won't hunt.\n  I rise to offer an amendment with Senator Nelson and Senator Feingold \nto restore some budget discipline. We want to go back to the pay-as-\nyou-go rule that served this country so well in previous years. I thank \nSenator Nelson and Senator Feingold for their leadership on this issue. \nI see Senator Feingold is on the floor.\n  Our amendment is simple. It restores the original pay-go rules \npreventing new mandatory spending and new tax cuts unless they are paid \nfor. My colleague talks about all the additional tax cuts he wants. \nThat is fine. I will support a lot of them, but we have to pay for \nthem. Otherwise, we are borrowing money from China, Japan, the \nCaribbean Banking Centers, and all the rest to give tax cuts that, in \nmany cases, go predominantly to the wealthiest among us. What a bizarre \nstrategy that is.\n  The proposal we are making today eliminates a loophole in the current \npay-go rule which exempts tax cuts and spending increases that are \nprovided for in the budget resolution. We don't have to pay for them if \nthey are in the budget resolution. This huge loophole encourages \nfiscally irresponsible behavior, which is exactly how I would \ncharacterize the budget that is before us. It is fiscally \nirresponsible--fiscally irresponsible to increase the debt by $3 \ntrillion when we have already almost $8 trillion of debt. If people are \nserious about fiscal discipline, this is their chance to prove it.\n  I would like to take a moment to remind my colleagues of the history \nof pay-go and why it is important to reinstate the original pay-go \nrule.\n  The rule was adopted in 1990 at a time when the Federal Government \nwas facing unprecedented deficits, just as we are today. Originally, \nthe pay-go rule created a 60-vote point of order against tax cuts and \nmandatory spending that would increase the deficit. Tax cuts and \nincreased spending either had to be paid for or face a 60-vote point of \norder. Back in the nineties, the budget discipline of pay-go helped us \nturn record deficits into record surpluses. But the pay-go rule we have \nnow has lost its teeth. What we are left with is a pale reminder of \nwhat pay-go used to be.\n  The current pay-go rule exempts all policies assumed in every budget \nresolution. As a result of these changes,\n\n[[Page S12092]]\n\nthe budget resolution this year advocated borrow-and-spend policies. \nHere is what our current fiscal picture looks like: record budget \ndeficits as far as the eye can see; an ocean of red ink. That is where \nwe are now, and that is where we are headed.\n  In this year's budget, the majority paved the way for these \nreconciliation bills that are before us now that will actually increase \nthe budget deficit. How? By shaving $39 billion of spending over 5 \nyears, but then by cutting revenue $70 billion. The combined effect is \nto increase the deficit by $31 billion, and we already have record \ndeficits. The whole idea of reconciliation was to provide fast-track \nprotection to deficit reduction. Now it has been hijacked, and they are \nusing these special provisions and special protections to increase the \ndeficit. It is a perversion of the process.\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan opposes tax cuts that are \nfinanced by increasing the deficit. Here is what he told Congress last \nyear.\n  Question from Congressman Spratt:\n\n       Let me ask you this. You said you were for extension of the \n     original pay-go rule, which would apply to tax cuts as well \n     as to entitlement increases. Does that mean you would advise \n     us that as we approach these sunsets and expirations in \n     existing tax cuts, that they be offset before the renewal be \n     passed?\n\n  Mr. Greenspan:\n\n       Yes, sir.\n\n  That is the answer the chairman was perhaps seeking. He wants to \nextend these tax cuts. Many of them I do as well. But I want to pay for \nthem. That is what pay-go provides. Here is what the Fed Chairman had \nto say on the question of restoring the original pay-go: ``Yes, sir,'' \nwhen asked a direct question if we should restore pay-go. Earlier this \nyear in testimony before the House Budget Committee, Chairman Greenspan \nagain reiterated his support for fully offsetting the costs of all tax \ncuts:\n\n       If you're going to lower taxes, you shouldn't be borrowing \n     essentially the tax cut. And that over the long run is not a \n     stable fiscal situation.\n\n  That is what we are doing here: Put it on the charge card, run it up, \nborrow the money. Where are we borrowing it? Increasingly we are \nborrowing it from abroad. Under this President, we have increased our \ndebt held by foreign countries by over 100 percent. It took 42 \nPresidents 224 years to run up a trillion dollars of external debt. \nThis President has doubled it in 4 years. That is an utterly \nunsustainable course.\n\n  Chairman Greenspan said before the House Budget Committee earlier \nthis year:\n\n       All I'm saying is that my general view is that I like to \n     see the tax burden as low as possible. And in that context, I \n     would like to see tax cuts continued. But, as I indicated \n     earlier, that has got to be, in my judgment, in the context \n     of a pay-go resolution.\n\n  That is what we are offering today, a pay-go resolution. You can have \nmore spending; you have to pay for it. You can have more tax cuts; you \nhave to pay for them. That is the budget discipline we had earlier in \nthe nineties, and it worked well in drawing us out of record deficits \nand back into surplus.\n  In the past, the chairman of the Budget Committee has agreed with the \nFed Chairman's wise counsel. During the fiscal year 2002 supplemental \nbill, the Budget chairman had this to say. This is Chairman Gregg:\n\n       The second budget discipline, which is pay-go essentially \n     says if you are going to add a new entitlement program or you \n     are going to cut taxes during a period, especially of \n     deficits, you must offset that event so that it becomes a \n     budget-neutral event that also lapses.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n     . . . If we do not do this, if we do not put back in place \n     caps and pay-go mechanisms, we will have no budget discipline \n     in this Congress and, as a result, will dramatically \n     aggravate the deficit which, of course, impacts a lot of \n     important issues, but especially impacts Social Security.\n\n  The Budget Committee chairman was right then, and if he took the same \nposition now, he would be right now because the measure we are offering \nis pay-go. If you want to have new spending, pay for it. If you want to \nhave more tax cuts, pay for them. That is critically important given \nthe fact that the deficits and debt are going up, up, and away under \nthis underlying budget resolution.\n  What we are offering today eliminates the pay-go loophole. The \ncurrent pay-go rule exempts all tax cuts and mandatory spending \nincreases assumed in any budget resolution, no matter how much they \nincrease deficits. Our proposal is to go back to what has worked in the \npast. It is traditional pay-go. It says all mandatory spending and all \ntax cuts that increase deficits must be paid for or they have to get a \nsupermajority vote of 60 votes.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from Wisconsin such time as he \nmay use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am very pleased to cosponsor the \namendment that will be offered by my good friend, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. There is no Senator more dedicated to a fiscally \nresponsible Federal budget and to restoring sound budget rules than \nSenator Conrad. I have had the pleasure of watching him do his work, \nnow in his 13th year of leadership on this issue. He is an acknowledged \nexpert on the budget and the rules that govern its consideration.\n  You don't actually have to be a Kent Conrad to understand the pay-go \nrule. As he said, it is very straightforward. It is a commonsense \nrequirement. Whenever Congress wants to spend money through \nentitlements or the Tax Code, we have to pay for it. That rule, as he \npointed out in the past few minutes, has been an effective restraint on \nthe appetites of Congress and the White House, and it was absolutely \ncritical to our ability and success in balancing the Federal books \nduring the 1990s.\n  It is no coincidence that when this body stopped following that rule, \nthe bottom dropped out from under the budget. Four and a half years \nago, the Congressional Budget Office projected that in the 10 years \nthereafter, the Government would run a unified budget surplus of more \nthan $5 trillion. Now we are staring at what is almost a mirror image \nof that 10-year projection, except instead of healthy surpluses under \nany reasonable set of assumptions, we are now facing immense deficits \nand backbreaking debt.\n  This has to stop. Running deficits causes the Government to use the \nsurpluses of the Social Security trust fund for other Government \npurposes rather than to pay down the debt and help our Nation prepare \nfor the coming retirement of the baby boom generation.\n\n  As Senator Conrad has noted, it isn't just the annual budget deficits \nthat are the problem, it is our debt. Every dollar we add to the \nFederal debt is another dollar we are forcing our children to pay back \nin higher taxes or fewer Government benefits.\n  As I noted before during the pay-go debates we have had over the \nyears, when the Government in this generation chooses to spend on \ncurrent consumption and to accumulate debt for our children's \ngeneration to pay, it does nothing less than rob our children of their \nchoices, to which I think they should be entitled, just as we have \nbeen. We make our choices to spend on our wants, but what we are doing \nhere is saddling them with the debts they must pay from their tax \ndollars and their hard work, and that is not right.\n  That is why I am proud to join Senator Conrad in offering this \namendment to reinstate the pay-go rule. We need a strong budget \nprocess. We need to exert fiscal discipline. When the pay-go rule was \nin effect, that tough fiscal discipline governed the budget process. \nUnder the current approach, it is exactly the other way around. The \nannual budget resolution determines how much fiscal discipline we are \nwilling to impose on ourselves and that, obviously, simply has not \nworked.\n  When Congress decides it would be nice to create a new entitlement or \nenact new tax cuts, and then adjusts its budget rules to assist those \npolicies, we are inviting a disastrous result. And that is exactly what \nwe have seen happen.\n  As I noted during the budget resolution, if you want to lose weight, \nyou set the total calories you are allowed to consume first, and then \nyou make the meals fit under that cap. It is not the other way around. \nImagine trying to lose weight by deciding what you want to eat first \nand then setting the calorie limit to accommodate your cravings. If you \nwant to eat cake, fine; dial up the limit on your calorie intake. If \nyou want a couple of extra beers--which, of course, in Wisconsin\n\n[[Page S12093]]\n\nwe are fond of--that is fine, too. Raise the calorie limit accordingly.\n  It may taste pretty good at the time but one will probably almost \ncertainly end up gaining weight, just like this Nation is racking up \ndebt.\n  Because this ill-advised diet is exactly how the current mutated \nversion of pay-go works, and we have seen the results, the debt we are \nleaving our children and grandchildren that we will have has been \nputting on massive amounts of weight. This amendment that the Senator \nfrom North Dakota will offer would simply return us to the rule under \nwhich Congress operated for the decade of the 1990s.\n  As the Chair well knows, it was instrumental in balancing the Federal \nbudget. Many of us lived under that rule, and we know how effective it \nwas. This amendment is a truth test. Our colleagues who are genuinely \nserious about reducing the deficit and returning to a balanced budget \nwill vote for it.\n  A real pay-go rule by itself will not eliminate the annual budget \ndeficits and balance the budget, but we also know that we will never \nget there without a real pay-go rule.\n  I, again, thank Senator Conrad for his leadership on this and the \nother critical budget issues and I strongly urge my colleagues to \nsupport his commonsense, time-tested amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Feingold, \none of the most valued members of the Budget Committee, somebody who \nhas been absolutely consistent on these issues and who has tried over \nand over to get the pay-go rules reinserted so we would have some \nassistance in restoring budget discipline.\n  I told a reporter the other day I have never seen this town so \ndisconnected from reality as it is today. We have a measure before us \nthat they call deficit reduction in the first chapter when we all know, \nif we read the whole book, it has nothing to do with deficit reduction. \nIt is explosion of debt. Because by the time we get to the third \nchapter, what we find out is they are going to increase the debt by \n$781 billion all the while they are talking about reducing the deficit. \nIt is like words have lost their meaning. It is as though, what is the \nbook, ``1984,'' George Orwell--war is peace, love is hate, deficit \nreduction is deficit increase. This labeling ceases to have meaning \nwhen people come out and say they are doing one thing, when they are \ndoing precisely the opposite thing.\n  It is going to be hard to fool people about this because people know \nwe have big deficits. The last three deficits are the biggest in our \nhistory and people know the debt is increasing. They may not know the \nexact numbers, but they know the debt is not going down; the debt is \ngoing up. The hard reality is this budget package that is steaming \nthrough is going to increase the debt of the United States by $3 \ntrillion over the next 5 years and that is by their own calculations. \nThat is not my calculation. That is not the calculation of Senator \nFeingold. That is their own budget document's calculation. It says they \nare going to increase the debt $3 trillion. They are talking about over \nthe same period of time a $39 billion spending cut, which is chapter 1. \nChapter 2 is they cut the revenue $70 billion, so now they have \nincreased the deficit. Chapter 3, they are going to increase the debt \nby $781 billion. That is just one year. The 5-year effect of their \nbudget, and this is all part of the package, is to increase the debt $3 \ntrillion, and they are going to spend a week talking about how they are \nreducing the deficit.\n  One of the best things we can do is restore the pay-go rules. Pay-go \nrules say if one wants to spend more money, pay for it; want more tax \ncuts, pay for them. That is a rule we ought to have. That is a rule we \nused to have. That is a rule that helped. It was not the only thing \nthat worked, but it helped.\n  I hope very much that this body will adopt the pay-go provision we \nare putting before them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have been listening to this debate, and my \nleast favorite part of being in the Senate is probably the floor debate \nthat we have because it is rhetoric. It is not the substance that we \nought to be debating on the Senate floor.\n  What we are talking about right now is an omnibus deficit reduction \nreconciliation bill, and it has $39 billion worth of savings in it. One \ncan go ahead and talk about other legislation that will come up later \nand add those in different directions and come up with different \nnumbers, but what we are talking about right now is deficit reduction. \nWe spent a lot of time and a lot of effort to get it that way. Much of \nit is bipartisan, but we will not hear that kind of discussion on the \nfloor probably. One will from me because I want to give some credit to \nthe people who have worked with me on arriving at the biggest part of \nthis reconciliation package in a very bipartisan way.\n  Senator Kennedy is the ranking member on the HELP committee, and my \ncommittee had responsibility for $13.65 billion in spending cuts over 5 \nyears. We not only met that goal, we exceeded that goal. I want to say \na little bit about how we did it. We did it in several areas. One of \nthem is higher education. We provided more for kids going to college \nwhile we also provided savings. In the pensions area, we reduced \npotential outlays, and that saves money. In the area of FDIC reform, we \nreduced outlays so that we had savings so that we could provide for \ninsurance for people at their retirement time that will aid \ncommunities. I will talk about all of that as we go along. I would like \nto begin by commending Leader Frist and Chairman Gregg for keeping the \nbudget reconciliation process on track this year. Our shared commitment \nto meaningful deficit reduction is the reason that this package is on \nthe floor this week. The omnibus deficit reduction reconciliation bill \nof 2005, which is S. 1932, is an ambitious step toward meaningful \ndeficit reduction.\n  The budget agreement that Congress approved in April requires eight \nauthorizing committees to produce $34.7 billion in spending cuts. As \nchairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, \nthat is a big bite of the apple, but it is not when it comes to the \nbudget spending. My committee received the largest reconciliation \ninstruction. It was $13.65 billion in spending cuts over 5 years. That \nis nearly 40 percent of the overall target. I am pleased to report that \nwe exceeded that target and reported legislation with a net savings of \n$16.4 billion over 5 years.\n  That is an additional $2.75 billion beyond HELP's reconciliation \ntarget. So there is a significant amount of extra savings in the \nhealth, education, labor, and pensions component of this package, title \nVII, which I will discuss momentarily.\n  Now, 2 weeks ago, the HELP Committee reported a bipartisan bill that \ngarnered support from four Democrats, in addition to all of the \ncommittee Republicans. We achieved this savings in several ways. One \nwas the Higher Education Act reauthorization. It has been held up for \nsome period of time because we are trying to identify proper funding \nlevels, and reform programs so that more people can get more training. \nThis will ultimately lead to students obtaining better skills, \nresulting in fewer jobs being outsourced. It is not just a college age \nsituation. It is a college age-to-retirement situation and it includes \ncareers. We addressed that separately in the Workforce Investment Act \nreauthorization. That separate bill passed 20 to 0 in the committee. So \nit was unanimous and unanimously bipartisan.\n  I also mentioned that the HELP Committee passed a bipartisan pension \nbill that garnered support from both sides of the aisle, but it was not \nunanimous. I have to explain why. We also have to solve the pension \nproblem in this country so that people who have earned pensions get the \npensions. We have worked on a comprehensive pension package. In fact, \nwe passed a comprehensive pension package in the HELP committee and \nthen we merged it with a comprehensive pension reform bill from the \nFinance Committee. We have to go through the process of getting that \nbill through on the floor and then conferencing it with the House who \nhave yet a third version of the bill. I am hoping that we can do that \nfull package that way. But in that part of the process, when we were \ndoing that bill as a stand-alone bill, there was one\n\n[[Page S12094]]\n\nsection in there that dealt with some hybrid forms of pension plans. I \nhad one person on one side of the aisle who did not think we had gone \nfar enough and one person on the other side of the aisle who thought we \nhad gone too far. So we had two dissenting votes on that whole package.\n  When we take the pension reconciliation to the floor, as we are doing \nright now, we are not able to do the comprehensive pension package that \nwe had reported previously. We are limited to reducing the outlays, \nwhich means increasing the fees. That would not be my preference for \nthe way to go. There is a little provision in there that says that if \nwe pass a complete reform, it will supersede what we are doing in \nreconciliation. I am assuming, and am pretty sure, the dissenting votes \nthat we had when we worked the reconciliation package out of committee, \nwhich was both a combination of the education package and the pensions \npackage, that the dissension was over having to raise fees in the \npension part of the package. Otherwise, if it had been, again, just a \nstand-alone on the education part, I am pretty sure we would have had a \nunanimous, bipartisan vote. But we did have people from both sides of \nthe aisle, in what I consider to be fairly significant numbers, \nsupporting this. Writing this package has been a challenging process \nbecause it has required months of bipartisan negotiations. Spending \nreconciliation bills involve tough choices, about which programs to \nresponsibly reform and how to reinvest subsequent savings, while still \nmeeting deficit reduction goals. I am pleased about the role that the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee has played in this \nprocess.\n\n  I would like to briefly walk through the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions title of the reconciliation bill. The HELP Committee's \ntitle has two components, as I mentioned, one dealing with higher \neducation, the other with pensions. The higher education provisions in \nthe reconciliation legislation are similar to the comprehensive higher \neducation reauthorization bill that the HELP Committee agreed to \nunanimously in September, as I mentioned.\n  In addition to exceeding our reconciliation target, the title VII of \nthe legislation provides additional benefits to students and \nstrengthens access to higher education. Now, I have to say that one of \nthe ways that we worked enthusiastically on doing this was when we were \ndoing the budget process and outlining how much had to be saved by the \nvarious parts. First, in the pension area, we worked hard to come up \nwith a reasonable number that could happen without businesses being put \nout of business. We wanted to do it so that people would be encouraged \nto continue pensions. I think that we have done that.\n  In the education portion, I asked the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee if we could not work a little deal where if we saved more \nthan the $7 billion that we were required under the budget act to save, \nif we could not have half of what we saved, with it really not starting \nuntil we got to the $7 billion. We had to get to $7 billion but if we \ngot to $14 billion we would get half.\n  That gave us some incentive to look at what is actually happening in \nthe higher education area and see ways that we could save.\n  I appreciate the enthusiastic participation of everybody on the \ncommittee and their staff because that is what allows these things to \nhappen.\n  I have to tell you that the largest part of this, of course, comes \nfrom ending some corporate subsidies.\n  Title VII of the reconciliation bill reduces the deficit by $9.8 \nbillion over 5 years. That is an additional $2.8 billion beyond the \ncommittee's $7 billion higher education savings target.\n  This also provides over $8 billion in increased grant assistance for \nlow- and middle-income students, including $2.25 billion targeted to \njuniors and seniors in college majoring in math and science subjects or \nforeign language critical to national security. That is a junior-senior \npackage for low- and middle-income students that will, I hope, bridge \nthe gap that we are beginning to have with China and India on having \npeople who are technically capable of keeping our economy growing.\n  Again, I want to emphasize that is $8 billion of increased grant \nassistance for low- and middle-income students. I don't think I used \nthe word ``rich'' students in there. Did I? No, low- and middle-income \nstudents with a special target of math, science, and foreign languages \ncritical to national security. We have to do something in this country \nto launch a greater interest in math and science if we are going to \nmaintain the economic edge that we have at the present time. Our kids \nhave to realize there is competition out there, that there are people \nwho want their jobs, that there are people out there who want to be the \nemployer of Americans, not the employee of Americans.\n  We have the $8 billion in increased grant assistance for low- and \nmiddle-income students.\n  It also reduces borrower origination fees which will benefit the \nstudents who finance some or part of their education through loans. \nThat is a cost of $1 billion.\n  It incorporates language to provide financial relief to students \nimpacted by Hurricane Katrina, including cancelling loans disbursed in \nthe 2005-2006 academic year to students in impacted areas. That is a \ncost of $105 million.\n  Those are loans that could be difficult to use in light of the \nhurricane. But it takes care of that part.\n  We have an interest in doing some other things and need to do some \nother things with it yet.\n  But that is an outline of how cumulatively the higher education \nreforms save approximately a net of $9.8 billion, bringing the total \ndeficit reduction in the package to $16.4 billion over 5 years.\n  I want to emphasize that those things are paid for that we talk about \nthere.\n  The second component of the HELP Committee title addresses premiums \nto the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, PBGC. The understanding \nwhen the resolution was adopted in April was that an additional $6.65 \nbillion in deficit reduction would be achieved through pension reforms. \nIt continues to be my hope that these savings can be accomplished in a \nbipartisan fashion outside of reconciliation. In reconciliation, \nhowever, we are in a position to only raise the PBGC premium instead of \nalso addressing the funding rule that will ultimately determine plan \nsolvency. In other words, this could drive more people into bankruptcy. \nBut it is the best that we can do under the rules we have under budget \nreconciliation.\n  This legislation makes three changes to the current law that will \ngenerate approximately $6.7 billion in savings over 5 years. Here is \nhow it does it.\n  It first increases the flat-rate premium paid by all single-employer \nplans, and it increases it from $19 to $46.75 per participant and \nindexes the increase to wage inflation.\n  Next, it raises the participant premium for multi-employer plans from \n$2.60 to $8 immediately, and likewise indexes the increase to wage \ninflation.\n  Third, it includes a new premium requiring companies to terminate \ntheir defined benefit plans through bankruptcy to pay a premium of \n$1,250 per participant for 3 years but only after the company \nsuccessfully emerges from bankruptcy.\n  Why did we do that third part? That should be a part of coming out of \nbankruptcy--to repay some of the money that had to be potentially paid \nout, and paid out during the time the company was going through \nbankruptcy. But if we don't do that third part, what we were faced with \ndoing was going with the singly-employer plan, flat-rate premium going \nfrom $19 to $59. We were able to keep it back at $46.75. Under the \ncomprehensive bill, again, which I prefer to do, but it is not an \noption at this point in time, that would raise the premium to only $30 \nper participant. That is still a pretty significant rate, $19 to $30 \nper participant. And the reconciliation measure before us raises the \npremium to $46.75 per participant.\n  There are savings under the comprehensive reform, but this meets the \nrequirements of getting to that $6.7 billion with the assurance that \nPBGC will be able to meet its payments as people's retirements come up \nwho have been relegated to that system.\n  The short answer to why the premium was raised so high is we do not \nhave as many legislative options in reconciliation as we have outside \nreconciliation. But it has to be done. This is one of the two to get it \ndone. None of us want this premium ultimately to\n\n[[Page S12095]]\n\nbe enacted into law. Adopting a comprehensive reform will solve that \nproblem. But for now, the premium of $46.75 is the ``least bad'' option \nthat we face.\n  To be clear that this premium label will be reduced, the bill \nlanguage includes a special rule that the premiums contained in the \nreconciliation bill shall not go into effect if comprehensive pension \nreforms that accomplish the same savings are enacted before the end of \nthis year. It is a pretty tight timeline.\n  I would also like to address some of the additional titles in the \nreconciliation package.\n\n  Two weeks ago, the Senate Banking Committee passed a budget \nresolution package that included S. 1562, the Safe and Fair Deposit \nInsurance Act of 2005. That is a bill that I introduced this year along \nwith Senators Johnson, Hagel, and Allard. S. 1562 gained the support of \na wide majority of Republicans and Democrats on the Banking Committee \nbefore the markup. It is also supported by the Department of the \nTreasury and the FDIC. I believe passing S. 1562 is crucial for the \nhealthy operations of our Nation's banks and credit unions. The current \nFDIC system is in desperate need of improvement. Over the past 20 \nyears, deposit insurance has been eroded by inflation and growing \ndeposits falling to the dangerously low levels we have today. S. 1562 \nwould give the FDIC statutory authority to make the deposit insurance \nfund healthy again, and in a way that accounts for the riskiness of \neach of the institutions it insures.\n  This bill is very important to keep the retirement funds and savings \nof Americans safe. In our rural towns and communities, depositors \ndepend upon their local credit union or their local bank to deposit \ntheir hard-earned money. These financial institutions, in turn, lend \nmoney to local businesses and invest in their communities. This \nrelationship benefits the customer, the institution, and the community. \nMy bill would ensure that this relationship can continue into the \nfuture, adapting to changing economic cycles or unexpected crises.\n  I am also pleased the Senate Energy Committee included provisions to \nmeet its budget reconciliation target that allows for responsible \nexploration in ANWR. With the energy crises our Nation faces, it is \nimperative that we make the most of our domestic supply. Wyoming is \ncontributing dramatically to that supply but nothing like what could be \ndone with ANWR. ANWR is a world-class resource, and with proper \nprotections in place--and there are proper protections--we can recover \nthe resource without damaging the area.\n  While the ANWR provisions will help our Nation's energy crisis, \nanother rumored provision threatens to further burden consumers and \nburden an important industry in my State. Fortunately, the Judiciary \nCommittee did not include a tax on explosives to meet their \nreconciliation goal. Such a tax would have been extremely costly to the \nmining industry and, in my view, did not make sense. The committee's \ndecision to use other methods to meet their reconciliation number \nensures that in this energy crisis consumers are not forced to pay even \nmore to heat their homes and keep on the lights.\n  I want to reiterate just a little bit that in this budget \nreconciliation package the biggest part of the heavy lifting comes from \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions.\n  We worked in a bipartisan way to provide for higher education and \nadditional benefits for low- and middle-income students, and for \njuniors and seniors in that low- and middle-income situation to provide \neven more, if they will do math and science to meet some critical needs \nfor their country. We have taken care of pensions.\n  There are some important things in this bill that should not be \nconfused with other bills or other times. There are some very \nsignificant things that can happen if we can get this done. They can \nhappen immediately for many of our college students.\n  I will work as much as possible to make sure that any savings that \ncome from education go to education.\n  I really think that is the way it has to be. That is the principle \nunder which my committee worked to make sure that we had the incentive \nfor savings.\n  In closing, I look forward to working with my colleagues this week \nand in conference to complete work on this important legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n\n\n                             Amendment 2351\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that the \nDemocratic leader be recognized when the Senate reconvenes at 2 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I now yield 10 minutes to the Senator from\n\n[[Page S12096]]\n\nFlorida, Mr. Nelson, who is a very important member of the Senate \nBudget Committee. Senator Nelson has been one of the most consistent \nMembers on the Budget Committee, insisting on a return to fiscal \ndiscipline. I very much appreciate his leadership on this pay-go \namendment, which is an attempt to restore the basic budget discipline.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from North Dakota yield time \noff general debate or the amendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will yield time off the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  As we judge this question of whether we have any fiscal sanity here, \nI thought, in the old days, when I came here 27 years ago and was a \nfreshman member of the House Budget Committee, that fiscal conservatism \nwas that we tried to balance the budget and that we did so through the \nvery painful process of spending cuts and tax increases.\n  Yet we have been on a course since I came back to Washington 5 years \nago, having entered into a fiscal condition of this country where we \nhad a very healthy surplus, that is exactly the opposite. We have gone \non a course that calls for tax cuts and spending increases, and, ``va-\nboom,'' suddenly the big surplus has vanished. We have a huge deficit \nand a huge deficit that is projected for years into the future to add \nto the national debt by some $5 trillion over the course of the next \ndecade.\n  Is it any wonder that some economic sectors of the economy are \ngetting a little shaky? I can tell you that the demands on spending are \nnot going to subside.\n  I just came back from Florida yesterday, from a very poor section of \nFlorida that got hit with winds clocked as high as 158 miles an hour \ncoming off of Lake Okeechobee at Belle Glade and Pahokee and South Bay. \nAnd those communities are devastated. They need help in jobs. They need \nhelp with infrastructure. They need help with trying to exist.\n\n  Yet we are facing a budget brought to the Senate today to cut social \nprograms in order to finance additional tax cuts. Something is wrong \nwith this picture. It is not bringing America back to the fiscally \nconservative position of moving toward balancing the budget.\n  We had a fiscal year ending with a deficit of over $400 billion. We \nare moving to a deficit in this fiscal year of over $300 billion and \nall of that is adding to the national debt.\n  We have a budget that, in fact, is providing $39 billion in savings, \nbut next week we will consider a budget that is going to take away all \nof those savings with $70 billion in tax cuts, for a net of $31 billion \nmore in debt. Is this the kind of fiscal policy we ought to be \nconducting and an annual deficit that keeps going up and up, that took \nus out of surplus, and is taking us into the red more and more with the \nnational debt? I don't think so.\n  I thank my former chairman and the ranking member, the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota, who says this Senator has been consistent in \nsaying exactly this. It seems it is wrongheaded and reverse \nconservative economics.\n  When we look at where some of these spending cuts are coming from, \nthey are coming from student loans, $7 billion in cuts and increased \nfees. By the way, I visited two of our State universities this past \nweekend, visiting with the administration of two of the distinguished \nuniversities in Florida. Florida tuition rates are going up. The \nminority communities, particularly in Historically Black Colleges, are \nhaving a very difficult time. They have dropping enrollment because \nthose students are not able to get the financial assistance. Is this \nthe equal opportunity society we want for America? I don't think so. \nWhy are we cutting student loans?\n  The ability of America to be competitive in the global marketplace \ndepends on us having an educated public. So we are adopting, if this \nbudget is passed, a policy that says we do not think student loans and \nfinancial assistance are a priority. That is like the farmer who goes \nout and eats his seed corn and then he doesn't have any corn the next \nyear to plant for the crop. This is not the kind of policy we should \nhave.\n  On the other side of the Capitol, the House has cuts in their budget \nthat will come to conference, and of course they will insist in \nconference committee that their cuts prevail--food stamps, cut $844 \nmillion. They had $9.5 billion cut in Medicaid, the health care program \nfor the poor. Food stamps, the food program for the poor. Child support \nenforcement, $5 billion cut in the House.\n  I thought we were in a society that wanted to encourage going after \ndeadbeat dads to support their children. Are we going to cut this \nenforcement of child support? That is what is coming over from the \nHouse. Federal foster care assistance; how many children do we have \ntoday who need foster care? We need to promote adoption, but we do not \nget all of the adoptions completed. There are children who need homes. \nAnd we are going to cut that Federal support for foster care?\n  Somehow if we continue down the line of this kind of thinking, we are \ncontinuing to push this country to a country of haves and have-nots. \nThat is not where we want to go. I am going to offer an amendment next \nweek when we have the tax section of this budget reconciliation to say \nif we are going to have tax cuts, true fiscal conservatism, we are \ngoing to have to pay for them. What the American people want, if we are \ngoing to have spending increases and if we are going to have additional \ntax cuts--which is the drop in revenue the American people want--is for \nspending increases and tax cuts to be paid for. We have one right here. \nIt is Senator Conrad's amendment. We will have another one next week \nand it will be my amendment. Let's start supporting some fiscal \nconservatism around here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida for his \nremarks. I thank him, as well, for his leadership. I have thought many \ntimes I wish there were more Bill Nelson's in the Senate because he has \nbeen a very strong voice on fiscal responsibility and in paying our \nbills and not shoveling the debt off to our kids and not continuing \nthis policy of borrowing more and more money from abroad.\n  Is the Senator seeking recognition to respond?\n  Mr. ENZI. I was going to offer an amendment Senator Kennedy will want \nto speak on. We are working here together.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: At this point we \nare on the pay-go amendment. It would require consent, would it not, to \nlay aside the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I might say to my colleague, if we could go to Senator \nKennedy, he has only requested 5 or 10 minutes, and then at that point \nwe could consider the amendment.\n  Mr. ENZI. I have no problem.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Senator Kennedy is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Seven minutes is fine.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 7 minutes or the time the Senator might consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend the Senators from North Dakota \nand from Florida, my colleagues, who have spoken so eloquently about \nthe fundamental challenge facing this Nation in terms of its \npriorities. They have outlined in significant detail the choices before \nthis country. We will define the priorities this week and next week in \nallocating scarce resources for this Nation. They have spoken very \nclearly, effectively and convincingly. I intend to support their \nleadership on the underlying legislation.\n  A few hours ago I had the opportunity with my friend and colleague, \nthe chairman of the Subcommittee on Appropriations for Labor, Health \nand Human Services and Education, Senator Specter, to attend at NIH the \nPresident's announcement of his program on the avian flu virus. This is \nan issue which the Senate has also, appropriately, focused on.\n  We have had a number of colleagues very much involved in this debate, \nled by my friend, the Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin, including \nSenator Obama from Illinois, Senator Reid\n\n[[Page S12097]]\n\nfrom Nevada, Senator Bayh from Indiana, and Senator Durbin from \nIllinois. Others have been very much involved in this issue, including \nthe majority leader and others.\n  Last week, the Senate appropriated $7.9 billion to develop the \nvaccines, antivirals, global detection system, surge capacity, and \nother priorities necessary to protect the public health. The President \nreiterated strong support for those efforts. Global detection is a high \npriority; the ability to detect locally in the United States, a high \npriority; the development of vaccines, a high priority; the development \nof antivirals, a high priority; and cell research, a high priority, so \nwe can have an alternative in the development of vaccines as opposed to \nresearch on eggs which have been used in the past.\n  We have, at last, a proposal by the administration on how we ought to \ndeal with the avian flu. I commend the leadership provided by the \nchairman of our HELP Committee, Senator Enzi, and also Senator Burr, \nwho has been very involved and active in developing legislation, \nincluding incentives to attract new investment into developing and \nstockpiling antivirals and vaccines.\n  Hopefully, we will be able to work out a system by which those, \nparticularly the first responders, who take the vaccines or antivirals \nand suffer adverse consequences will have some opportunity for \ncompensation. We also want to make sure the companies are going to \nreproduce these products in ways which meet high standards, and we are \nin the process of doing that.\n  Senator Enzi and Senator Burr have been working on this issue for \nsome time. We have all enjoyed working with them. We will all examine \ncarefully the details of the President's preliminary proposal. The \nSenate is on record now, voting for $7.9 billion for these endeavors. \nThis has been an enormously important undertaking.\n  The President has talked about $7.1 billion; the Senate passed the \nHarkin proposal for $7.9 billion; and Senator Gregg has offered $4.4 \nbillion. The appropriations will have to be worked on through. Under \nthe leadership of Senator Harkin, the Senate has responded to this \nchallenge with a very effective downpayment. We certainly look forward \nto working with the administration on the proposal we have just \nreceived.\n  As we talk about priorities for this country, I also want to mention \nthe achievement of our Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions under the leadership of Senator Enzi. The bill we reported \nsignificantly and dramatically increases need-based aid and other \nbenefits for students struggling to afford college. The bill includes \n$11.5 billion in new funding for this purpose, and still meets the \nreconciliation target for savings mandated by the Committee on the \nBudget. The House did not follow that pattern.\n  The House did not follow the pattern of the Senate. But we will see \nan increase from $4,050 to $4,500 in the maximum grant for Pell-\neligible students. That is an extraordinary achievement and \naccomplishment. As one who has been out here, even recently, trying to \nget an increase of $200 in the Pell grants, to know this is going to be \nachieved--a $450 increase--is enormously important. Then there are the \nadditional kinds of programs that will provide some $1,500 on top of \nthat for Pell-eligible students studying math and science and high-need \nforeign languages. It is really a downpayment, in a very important way, \nin improving the nation and making the nation more competitive in math \nand science.\n  So I certainly hope our colleagues will get a chance to examine \nexactly what we did on the higher education proposals. There are some \nitems that I might have altered or changed, but I think the overall \nresults on this will be enormously important to students.\n  Mr. President, how many minutes do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 15 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, may I have 2 more \nminutes?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am happy to yield an additional 2 \nminutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Finally, when we are talking about the substance of the \nmatter on education and what has been achieved, we also want to be very \nconscious of the fact that some 370,000 children in the Gulf area--in \nLouisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama--were displaced by the hurricanes. \nWe know there has been an enormous upheaval in these children's lives. \nWe have not, to this date, provided help and assistance to those \nchildren and to the schools that are trying to educate those children.\n  I certainly hope in this reconciliation bill we have the opportunity \nto provide a downpayment to help those children. We have listened to \nthe eloquence of the Senators from Louisiana, from all the Senators \nfrom the gulf region, but particularly the Senators from Louisiana, \nMary Landrieu and David Vitter--others as well--on this issue. But I \nwould hope from the eloquence and the sense of need that has been \noutlined on the floor, and in meetings that all of us have had with \nSenator Landrieu and others about the needs of these children, that we \nwould somehow find the opportunity to provide help and assistance to \nthese children in this current legislation.\n  I see on the floor the former Secretary of Education, Senator \nAlexander, who has fashioned and shaped and worked with us on a \nproposal that can make an important difference to the children in that \nregion. I am very thankful to him, and to Senator Dodd, and of course \nto our chairman, Senator Enzi, for all their work on this. I am very \nhopeful we will have an opportunity, this week, to meet our \nresponsibilities to these children. These children did not know about \nthis hurricane. The hurricane affected children in public schools and \nprivate schools. I think this is an urgent national challenge in a very \nreal way. When children are presented with that kind of a situation, \ncommon sense, decency, and our values require us to provide help and \nassistance to them. Our children and our schools cannot wait any longer \nfor the relief they so obviously and urgently need and deserve. I look \nforward to working with our colleagues to address those particular \nneeds this week.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Conrad, for yielding this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment so I can offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, I do want to, for the record, indicate we have had a number \nof requests that we move to delay the offering of this amendment. I \nwill not do that.\n  Senator Enzi has been a very responsible member of the committee. He \nhas every right to offer his amendment. The fact is, if he were delayed \nat this point, he could offer his amendment later. So those who are \nseeking to delay might force him into the vote-a-thon, but I believe \nSenator Enzi, who has been a fully responsible member of the committee, \ndeserves his opportunity to offer this amendment, and I will not \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2352\n\n (Purpose: To provide elementary and secondary education assistance to \n    students and schools impacted by Hurricane Katrina and to lower \n                           origination fees)\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will please report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi], for himself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Alexander, and Mr. Dodd, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2352.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I join my colleagues, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Alexander, and Senator Dodd, in offering an amendment to S. \n1932, the Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 2005.\n  As chairman of the committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions, my committee received the largest reconciliation instruction \nof $13.65\n\n[[Page S12098]]\n\nbillion in spending cuts over 5 years. That is nearly 40 percent of the \noverall target. I am pleased to report that we exceeded that target, \nand reported legislation that will net $16.4 billion over 5 years. That \nis an additional $2.75 billion beyond HELP's reconciliation target. So \nthere is a significant amount of extra savings in HELP's component of \nthis package--Title VII--which this amendment addresses.\n  This amendment ensures that extra savings generated from education \nwill be returned to education. Let me be clear, additional savings from \nstudents should be returned to students, just as they are in the other \npart of the reconciliation bill.\n  The amendment provides additional relief for students enrolled in \npostsecondary education who take out Federal student loans to pay for \ntheir education expenses. This amendment also addresses the elementary \nand secondary education challenges faced by the 372,000 schoolchildren \ndisplaced by Hurricane Katrina, their families, and the schools that \nopened their doors to accommodate the thousands of displaced students.\n  I congratulate Senator Alexander for his tremendous work in this \narea. He is in charge of the subcommittee that handles this area and \ndid a tremendous job of pulling together different people, different \nopinions, different situations in coming up with a very comprehensive \namendment that would solve those issues. I have to say, he did that in \nconjunction with Senators Kennedy and Dodd and myself. It was a very \nbipartisan effort.\n  There are some very sticky issues in this area that needed to be \ndealt with, and were dealt with, and it will take care of a significant \nbody of students that need some significant help to make sure they get \ntheir education this year. We do not want kids in K through 12 out of \nschool. We want them in school. And when we are forcing them on to \nother schools, we want to make sure that is taken care of, too.\n  First, I will discuss the additional relief for students enrolled in \npostsecondary education. The Higher Education Act amendments that are \nincluded in S. 1932 represent a significant boost in need-based grant \naid for our neediest postsecondary students. Also included is a \nprovision to relieve the fees that students pay to borrow under the \nFederal student loan programs.\n  The amendment I am offering today provides significant benefits to \nstudent borrowers, and makes Federal student loans more affordable. The \namendment would reduce even further those origination fees for \npostsecondary students. The current fee of 3 percent would be reduced \nto 2 percent. Origination fees were originally applied to help reduce \nFederal spending on the guaranteed student loan program. It is time \nthat students stop paying these fees to ensure the program's solvency.\n  Reducing these fees for students will save dependent students up to \n$500 dollars and will save independent and graduate students even more.\n  The average dependent student borrowing under the Federal Family \nEducation Loan program or the Direct Loan program currently pays \nseveral hundred dollars in origination fees. Since the majority of \nstudents capitalize these fees, they will also pay interest on these \nfees for 10 years or more. Independent students could pay twice as \nmuch.\n  Over the life of the student's loan, these fees and the interest paid \non them can add up to several thousand dollars, and they do not help \nstudents pay for tuition. These fees do not make any difference on the \nability of students to afford college, and in many cases they only \nrepresent additional expenses.\n  This amendment begins to phase out these fees. At the 6.8 percent \ninterest rate in the underlying higher education bill, this change \ncould save dependent students nearly $500 over the life of their loans. \nOver $125 of that would be interest payments. With this amendment, \nindependent students could save more than $1,000 and graduate students \nwould save even more.\n  This amendment also addresses the elementary and secondary education \nchallenges faced by the 372,000 schoolchildren displaced by Hurricane \nKatrina, their families, and the schools that opened their doors to \naccommodate them.\n  This amendment includes provisions from the Hurricane Katrina \nElementary and Secondary Education Recovery Act, which is S. 1904, a \nbipartisan compromise that accomplishes the common goal of providing \nrelief to support the instruction and services that the students \ndisplaced by this terrible storm need in order to continue their \neducation, regardless of whether it is in a public or nonpublic school.\n  Over 300,000 students and their families were displaced by Hurricane \nKatrina. Their lives were disrupted, and they have no sense of when \nthey will be able to return to their home communities. With this \namendment we will be providing one-time, temporary, emergency aid on \nbehalf of these students. All of us can agree that these displaced \nstudents deserve help to continue their education under these \nextraordinary circumstances caused by a disaster of unprecedented \nscope.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Education, schools in 49 States \nand the District of Columbia have opened their doors to help students \ndisplaced by this storm. Nine States have received more than 1,000 \ndisplaced students. Texas has enrolled as many as 60,000 students. The \nHouston independent school district alone enrolled 4,700 displaced \nstudents, hired 180 new teachers, added 37 new bus route, and ordered \nabout 10,000 new textbooks to accommodate them. These statistics \nrepresent just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the number of schools \nthat have accepted displaced students from the Gulf States. \nApproximately 25 to 30 percent of these students were attending \nnonpublic schools, and in their new communities the nonpublic schools \nhave opened their doors to these students.\n  These States and schools need realistic, fiscally responsible \nassistance from the Congress to accommodate the students they have \ntaken into their education system. This amendment will provide the \nrelief necessary to support the instruction and other school services \nthe displaced students need regardless of the school they are \nattending. Students will get the education services they need so that \nthey can return as quickly as possible to their home school district \nwithout losing educational ground at a time when their lives have been \nturned upside down.\n  Our top concern was to make sure that all displaced students \ncontinued their education. School provides a sense of routine that is \nimportant in assuring students that things will return to normal. \nSchool provides them with access to a support system of friends and \nteachers, which is invaluable as they and their families continue to \ncome to grips with the aftereffects of the storm. Some students are \nalready returning home as their schools reopen, but severe problems of \ndisplacement do remain. Many schools will remain closed for the entire \nschool year.\n  This amendment does not make permanent changes to Federal education \nlaws. It is a one-time, temporary solution that sets aside ideological \ndifferences to make sure children are not harmed unnecessarily by the \nimpact of this unprecedented disaster.\n  Developing this language was a difficult task, as we have limited \nresources, but we are faced with an almost unlimited need. It provides \na comprehensive approach to address the needs of the hundreds of \nthousands of students who have been displaced. It focuses on the \nimmediate needs of students with the expectation that they will return \nhome to their local school.\n  Let me describe what this amendment does. First and foremost, it \nprovides support for all displaced students, ensures accountability, \nand is fiscally responsible. Children displaced by this storm do not \nhave the resources of their home communities to rely on for friends, \nactivities, learning opportunities, and stability. These resources will \nassist students in their adjustment to new schools, new materials and \nstandards, new classmates, and new teachers.\n  The amendment provides for a restart fund for special school \nreopening grants for school districts directly affected by the \nhurricane. These grants are meant to supplement FEMA funding to ensure \nthe effective use of Federal funds. They can be used to repurchase \ntextbooks and instructional materials, establish temporary facilities \nwhile repairs are being made, help reestablish the data that was \ndestroyed,\n\n[[Page S12099]]\n\nand pay salaries of teachers and other personnel who are working to \nreopen these schools.\n  The largest portion of the funding under this amendment is focused on \neasing the temporary transition of students into new schools, both \npublic and nonpublic, through one-time emergency aid. These funds will \nbe used to help defray the additional costs incurred as a result of \nenrolling displaced students, and they can be used for purposes such as \nsupporting basic instruction, purchasing educational materials and \nsupplies, and helping schools temporarily expand facilities to relieve \novercrowding.\n  It provides assistance to schools in a nonideological and responsible \nway. It is based on the number of students, public and nonpublic, \nreported by local school districts to the State. The funding flows \nthrough regular channels to local school districts and accounts \nestablished on behalf of students attending nonpublic schools. The \namendment maintains public control of public money to ensure \naccountability.\n  Quarterly payments are made based on the head count of the displaced \nstudents temporarily enrolled in schools, with a maximum amount of \n$6,000--$7,500 for students with disabilities--per displaced students, \nor the cost of tuition, fees and transportation for nonpublic students, \nfor the four payments.\n  States apply for these funds and are required to establish income \neligibility criteria for aid on behalf of students in nonpublic \nschools. Nonpublic schools must waive or reimburse tuition in order for \naccounts to be established for their displaced students. Parents of \ndisplaced students must clearly make the choice for their child to \nattend a nonpublic school, and the nonpublic school must attest to the \nuse of funds and the numbers of displaced students in attendance. \nNonpublic schools shall use funds in secular and neutral ways, not for \nreligious instruction, proselytization, or worship. Displaced children \ncannot be discriminated against on the basis of their race, color, \nnational origin, religion, disability, or sex.\n  The assistance provided through this amendment is temporary. It \nsunsets at the end of this school year. This amendment is necessary \nbecause of the extraordinary circumstances and the emergency nature of \nthis situation.\n  Through the savings in this reconciliation bill, we have the \nopportunity not only to authorize programs that will serve the \nthousands of children affected by Hurricane Katrina, but to defer the \ncosts required to meet their education needs. Investing these funds in \nthis way will meet an immediate need, but education is a longer-term \ninvestment in the future of our country and its ability to compete in a \nglobal economy. We must focus our efforts on ensuring that the \neducational needs of the children affected by this unprecedented \nemergency are addressed, and I believe that this amendment achieves \nthat goal.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and support returning \nadditional education savings to the education needs of our students. I \nurge my colleagues to support student access to postsecondary \neducation, which is critical to our ability to compete in the global \nmarketplace. I can think over no better investment in the future of our \nstudents, businesses and Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Landrieu be added as a cosponsor \nof the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD.

It \nhas been cleared on both sides.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.R. 2967, received from the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2967) to designate the Federal building \n     located at 333 Mt. Elliott Street in Detroit, Michigan as the \n     ``Rosa Parks Federal Building''.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread three times, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statements related thereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2967) was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, last week the Senate addressed an \nidentical piece of legislation offered by our distinguished colleagues \nfrom Michigan, Senators Stabenow and Levin. Senator Reid was very \nactive in the consideration of that bill at that time. With the consent \non that side and the consent of others on this side, I was successful \nin getting on an amendment that I had been working on for some 3 years, \nwith Senator Leahy and others, to name the new annex to the District of \nColumbia Federal courthouse system in honor of William Bryant. I have \nknown this outstanding African American much of my life, having served \nas a young U.S. attorney. He was one of our great teachers at that \ntime, having been a senior U.S. attorney. He was the first African \nAmerican assistant U.S. attorney, the first African American to become \nchief judge of the district court. He is 94 years old now and in senior \nstatus, and I thought it appropriate that the Senate pass that \nrecognition. That bill by the Senator from Michigan, as amended by the \nSenator from Virginia, was passed by this Chamber last week. I have \nbeen assured by the Speaker of the House of Representatives that bill \nwill be on tomorrow's consent calendar. So both bills will be acted \nupon in due course. This particular bill was introduced by \nCongresswoman Kilpatrick, in whose district the courthouse will be \nnamed. Therefore, it is appropriate that there be a companion piece of \nlegislation.\n  I thank all those who participated in this and made it possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/01/senate-section/article/S12099-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the minority leader \nis recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, just a couple of days ago, my son Leif called me and \nindicated that his lovely wife Amber was going to have another baby. \nThat will be our 16th grandchild.\n  Mr. President, I have been in public service a long time. Never have \nI been so concerned about our country. We have gas prices that are \nreally unbelievable. This year, gas prices have been over $3 in the \nState of Nevada. Diesel fuel is still over $3 a gallon in Nevada.\n  The majority leader of the House of Representatives is under \nindictment. The man in charge of contracting for the Federal Government \nis under indictment. We have deficits so far you can't see them. The \ndeficits have been basically run up by President Bush's administration \nthese last 5 years.\n  We are the wealthiest nation in the world, but we are very poor as it \nrelates to health care. We have an intractable war in Iraq. Is it any \nwonder that I am concerned about my family, my grandchildren?\n  This past weekend, we witnessed the indictment of I. Lewis Libby, the \nVice President's Chief of Staff, also on the President's staff, a \nsenior adviser to the President.\n  Mr. Libby is the first sitting White House staffer to be indicted in \n135\n\n[[Page S12100]]\n\nyears. Is it any wonder that I am concerned about my grandchildren?\n  This indictment raises very serious charges. It asserts this \nadministration engaged in actions that both harmed our national \nsecurity and were morally repugnant. A decision made to place U.S. \nsoldiers, our military, into harm's way, I believe, is the most \nsignificant responsibility the Constitution invests in the Congress and \nin the President. The Libby indictment provides a window into what this \nis really all about: how this administration manufactured and \nmanipulated intelligence in order to sell the war in Iraq and attempted \nto destroy those who dared to challenge its actions.\n  These are not just words from Harry Reid. COL Larry Wilkerson, Colin \nPowell's former Chief of Staff--Colin Powell, of course, was Secretary \nof State--this man was Chief of Staff for 4 years. Here is what he said \nabout the war in Iraq.\n  In President Bush's first term some of the most important decisions \nabout U.S. national security, including vital decisions about postwar \nIraq, were made by a secretive, little known cabal, made up of a very \nsmall group of people led by Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense \nSecretary Donald Rumsfeld. But the secret process was ultimately a \nfailure. It produced a series of disastrous decisions.\n  That is what I am here to talk about today. As a result of its \nimproper conduct, a cloud now hangs over this administration. This \ncloud is further darkened by the administration's mistakes in prisoner \nabuse, Hurricane Katrina, and the cronyism and corruption in numerous \nagencies throughout this administration.\n  Unfortunately, it must be said that a cloud also hangs over this \nRepublican-controlled Congress for its unwillingness to hold this \nRepublican administration accountable for its misdeeds on these issues.\n  During the time we had a Democratic President--8 years--and when the \nDemocrats were in charge of the committees, we were in the majority, \noversight hearings were held covering the gambit of what went on in \nthat administration. Today, there is not an oversight hearing held on \nanything.\n  Let's take a look back at how we got here with respect to Iraq. The \nrecord will show that within hours of the terrorist acts of 9/11, \nsenior officials in this administration recognized those attacks could \nbe used as a pretext to invade Iraq. The record will also show that in \nthe months and years after 9/11, the administration engaged in a \npattern of manipulation of the facts and retribution against anyone who \nhad gotten in its way as it made its case for attacking, for invading \nIraq.\n  There are numerous examples of how the administration misstated, and \nmanipulated the facts as it made the case for war. The administration's \nstatements on Saddam's alleged nuclear weapons capability and ties with \nal-Qaida represent the best examples of how it consistently and \nrepeatedly manipulated the facts. The American people were warned time \nand time again by the President, the Vice President, the current \nSecretary of State in her other capacities, about Saddam's nuclear \nweapons capabilities. The Vice President said:\n\n       Iraq has reconstituted its nuclear programs.\n\n  Playing upon the fears of Americans after September 11, these \nofficials and others raised the specter that if left unchecked Saddam \ncould soon attack America with nuclear weapons. Obviously, we know now \nthat their nuclear claims were wholly inaccurate. But more troubling is \nthe fact that a lot of intelligence experts were telling the \nadministration then that its claims about Saddam's nuclear capabilities \nwere false--the situation very similar with respect to Saddam's links \nto al-Qaida. The Vice President told the American people:\n\n       We know he's out trying once again to produce nuclear \n     weapons and we know he has a longstanding relationship with \n     various terrorist groups including the al-Qaida organization.\n\n  These assertions have been totally discredited--not a little bit, \ntotally discredited. But again the administration went ahead with these \nassertions in spite of the fact that the Government's top experts did \nnot agree with these claims. Again, Wilkerson is a person in point.\n  What has been the response of this Republican-controlled Congress to \nthe administration's manipulation of intelligence that led to this \nprotracted war in Iraq? Nothing.\n  Did the Republican-controlled Congress carry out its constitutional \nobligations to conduct oversight? No.\n  Did it support our troops and their families by providing them the \nanswers to many important questions? No.\n  Did it even attempt to force this administration to answer the most \nbasic questions about its behavior? No.\n  Unfortunately, the unwillingness of the Republican-controlled \nCongress to exercise its oversight responsibilities was not limited to \njust Iraq. We see it with respect to the prison abuse scandal. We see \nit with respect to Katrina. We see it with respect to the cronyism and \ncorruption that permeates this administration. Time and time again, \nthis Republican-controlled Congress has consistently chosen to put its \npolitical interests ahead of our national security. They have \nrepeatedly chosen to protect the Republican administration rather than \nto get to the bottom of what happened and why it happened.\n  There is also another disturbing pattern; namely, about how this \nadministration responded to those who challenged its assertions. Often \nthis administration's activity sought to attack and undercut those who \ndared to raise questions about its preferred course. For example, when \nGeneral Shinseki indicated several hundred thousand troops would be \nneeded in Iraq, his military career was ended, he was fired, relieved \nof duty, when he suggested it would take 200,000 troops. Well, it has \ntaken a lot more than that.\n\n  When the OMB Director Larry Lindsey suggested the cost of this war \nwould approach $200 billion, he was dumped, fired.\n  When the U.N. chief weapons inspector Hans Blix challenged the \nconclusion about Saddam's weapons of mass destruction capabilities, the \nadministration simply pulled out its inspectors.\n  When Nobel Prize winner and head of the IAEA Mohamed ElBaradei raised \nquestions about the administration's claims of Saddam's nuclear \ncapabilities, the administration attempted to remove him from his post.\n  When Ambassador Joe Wilson stated there was no attempt by Saddam to \nacquire weapons from Niger, the administration not only went after him \nto discredit him, they launched a vicious and coordinated campaign, \ngoing so far as to expose the fact that his wife worked as a CIA spy. \nThese people now have 24-hour protection, fearing for their own safety.\n  Given this administration's pattern of squashing those who challenge \nits misstatements--and I have only mentioned a few--what has been the \nresponse of the Republican-controlled Congress? Absolutely nothing. And \nwith their inactions, they provide political cover for this \nadministration at the same time they keep the truth from our troops who \ncontinue to make large sacrifices in Iraq.\n  Everyone may think the troops in Iraq are 100-percent Republican. I \nhave met a friend, a marine. He was over there when the elections were \nheld 10 months ago. He said where he was, he never even went to the \nbathroom without a rifle. Wherever he was on duty, all over this area, \nhe said he could not find anyone who was happy with the way the \nelections turned out. The Republicans will do anything they can to keep \nthe truth from people such as my marine friend. I would give you his \nname except he is stationed right here in the Marine Corps.\n  This behavior is unacceptable. The toll in Iraq is as staggering as \nit is solemn. More than 2,000--2,025 now--Americans have lost their \nlives. Over 90 Americans have paid the ultimate sacrifice in the month \nof October alone, the fourth deadliest month in this ongoing 3-year \nwar. More than 15,000 have been wounded. More than 150,000 remain over \nthere in harm's way. Enormous sacrifices have been made and continue to \nbe made.\n  We have had soldiers and marines from Nevada killed, from Ely, from \nLas Vegas, from Henderson, from Boulder City, from Tonopah. Every time \none of these deaths occurs, it is a dagger in the heart of that \ncommunity.\n  This behavior is unacceptable. I am a patient man, Mr. President. I \nam a legislator, and I know things don't happen\n\n[[Page S12101]]\n\novernight. I am a patient man. But the call from my son has put this in \nperspective. I am worried about my family. The toll in Iraq is as \nstaggering, I repeat, as it is solemn. The troops and the American \npeople have a right to expect answers and accountability worthy of that \nsacrifice.\n  For example, more than 40 Democrats wrote a substantive and detailed \nletter to the President asking four basic questions about this \nadministration's Iraq policy, and we received a four-sentence answer in \nresponse:\n\n       Thank you for your letter to the President expressing your \n     concerns with Iraq. I shared your letter with the appropriate \n     administration officials--\n\n  Remember, we wrote it to the President--\n\n     and agencies responsible for formulating policy \n     recommendations in this area. Please be assured your letter \n     is receiving close and careful attention. Thank you for your \n     comments. Candy Wolff.\n\n  That is a letter that duly elected Senators of the United States \nSenate wrote to the President of the United States, and we get a letter \nfrom Candy Wolff saying: Thanks, we're working on it.\n  America deserves better than this. They also deserve a searching, \ncomprehensive investigation into how the Bush administration brought \nthis country to war. Key questions that need to be answered include: \nHow did the Bush administration assemble its case for war against Iraq? \nWe heard what Colonel Wilkerson said.\n  Who did the Bush administration listen to and who did they ignore?\n  How did the senior administration officials manipulate or manufacture \nintelligence presented to the Congress and the American people?\n  What was the role of the White House Iraq Group, or WHIG, a group of \nsenior White House officials tasked with marketing the war and taking \ndown its critics? We know what Colonel Wilkerson says.\n  How did the administration coordinate its effort to attack \nindividuals who dared challenge the administration's assertions? We \nknow what happened to them. I listed a few.\n  Why has this administration failed to provide Congress with the \ndocuments which will shed light on their misconduct and misstatements? \nUnfortunately, the Senate committee that should be taking the lead in \nproviding these answers is not. Despite the fact that the chairman of \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee publicly committed to examine these \nquestions more than a year and a half ago, he has chosen not to keep \nthat commitment. Despite the fact that he restated the commitment \nearlier this year on national television, he has still done nothing \nexcept to assemble a few quotes from Democratic and Republican Senators \ngoing back to the first Iraq war.\n  We need a thorough investigation that that committee is capable and \ntasked to do. At this point, we can only conclude he will continue to \nput politics ahead of our national security.\n  If he does anything at this point, I suspect it will be playing \npolitical games by producing an analysis that fails to answer any of \nthese important questions. Instead, if history is any guide, this \nanalysis will attempt to disperse and deflect blame away from this \nadministration.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Key facts about the Intelligence Committee's phase II, June \n4, 2003: Intelligence Committee commits to bipartisan review of the \ndeeply flawed intelligence on Iraq WMD phase I.\n  February 12, 2004, Intelligence Committee commits to phase II \ninvestigation looking at five areas, including whether the \nadministration exaggerated and manipulated intelligence.\n  July 9, 2004, committee publishes phase I report on the intelligence \nagencies' mistakes on Iraq. Senator Rockefeller says publicly that \nphase II is as yet unbegun. Republican Chairman Roberts says it is one \nof my top priorities.\n  July 11 on ``Meet the Press,'' Republican Chairman Roberts says:\n\n       Even as I'm speaking, our staff is working on phase II and \n     will get it done.\n\n  Fall of 2004, House Intelligence Committee, after no follow- through \non the Iraq WMD investigation, the House announced on May 2003 no final \nreport.\n  Republican Committee Chairman Porter Goss is selected as CIA \nDirector. Regarding the question of the Valerie Plame leak, Goss \npreviously said: ``Show me a blue dress and some DNA and I will give \nyou an investigation.''\n  November 2004, we had the Presidential election.\n  March 2005, the President's hand-picked WMD Intelligence Committee \nsays the intelligence agencies got the intelligence dead wrong, but \nsays that under the President's terms of reference we are not \nauthorized to investigate how policymakers used the intelligence \nassessments they received from the intelligence community.\n  March 31, 2005, Senator Roberts says it would be a monumental waste \nof time to replow this ground any further. Replow?\n  April 10, 2005, on ``Meet the Press,'' Senator Roberts commits to Tim \nRussert that the review will get done.\n  September 2005, committee Democrats file additional views to their \nauthorization bill blasting the committee for failing to conduct phase \nII.\n  There have been letters written to the committee. A press release was \nissued even saying they were going to go forward with this.\n  Mr. President, enough time has gone by. I demand, on behalf of the \nAmerican people, that we understand why these investigations are not \nbeing conducted. And in accordance with rule XXI, I now move that the \nSenate go into closed session.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I second the motion.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I second the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion has been made to go into closed \nsession, and it has been seconded. The motion having been made and \nseconded, the Senate will go into closed session.\n  The Chair, pursuant to rule XXI, now directs the Sergeant at Arms to \nclear all galleries, close all doors of the Senate Chamber, and exclude \nfrom the Chamber and its immediate corridor all employees and officials \nof the Senate who, under the rule, are not eligible to attend the \nclosed session and who are not sworn to secrecy. The question is \nnondebatable.\n  (At 2:25 p.m., the doors of the Chamber were closed.)\n\n\n                          Legislative Session\n\n  (At 4:33 p.m., the doors of the Chamber were opened, and the open \nsession of the Senate was resumed.)\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we now resume \nopen session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks Senator Roberts be recognized to speak for up to 15 minutes, to \nbe followed by Senator Rockefeller for up to 15 minutes, with the time \nyielded from the pending deficit reduction measure; further, that \nfollowing that time Chairman Gregg or his designee be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are back in open session, and I believe \nshortly--in about 40 or 45 minutes--we will be back on course on a very \nimportant bill that our Nation cares about, which we are on track to \ncomplete this week; that is, the deficit reduction bill.\n  Over the next about 30 or 35 minutes, however, we will be clarifying \nsome of the intention, scheduling, and language with regard to the \ncompletion of the report on Iraq prewar intelligence which has been \nunder a great deal of discussion in the past within the Intelligence \nCommittee, and, indeed, a subject of discussion between the chairman \nand the vice chairman, both of whom will have the opportunity to \nexpress their ideas here shortly.\n  Let me say that I think it is absolutely critical as we move forward \non this important issue that we get partisanship out of these \ndiscussions of intelligence--important matters, important to this \ncountry, important to the American people--and anything and everything \nwe can do to keep these discussions above partisanship is absolutely \ncritical.\n  We have been in a closed session, and I want all Members to \nfamiliarize themselves with what that actually\n\n[[Page S12102]]\n\nmeans as we have seen because we were in that session for a little over \n2 hours. It is very important that people do not talk about what \nhappened during that session. Again, we will all have to go back \nbecause it is very unusual to go into these closed sessions, and, in \nfact, I think unprecedented, the way we went into this session, which \nwe will probably talk about a little bit more later. I was very \ndisappointed the way we entered into this session, which was a total \nsurprise to me.\n  Let me also say I have absolute confidence in our Intelligence \nCommittee and in what they are doing in terms of this important work \nand Senator Roberts as chairman.\n  The one thing that is important for us to mention, for the benefit of \nour colleagues, is an agreement between the leader and myself to the \nfollowing three points: that the majority leader and the Democratic \nleader will appoint three members from their respective parties. This \ntask force of six Senators will meet and report back to leadership no \nlater than the close of business on November 14 the following: The \nIntelligence Committee's progress on the phase II review of the prewar \nintelligence and its schedule for completion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, our representatives will be Senators \nRockefeller, Levin, and Feinstein.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues, at this \npoint we have 15 minutes set aside--for up to 15 minutes--for Senator \nRoberts, followed by Senator Rockefeller, and after that we will \nrecognize Chairman Gregg or his designee. And with mutual discussion \nbetween the Democratic and Republican leaders, we very much, after the \ncomments by the chairman and vice chairman, want to get back on the \ndeficit reduction bill.\n  We have a time agreement to complete discussion on that bill by 6 \no'clock tomorrow night. There are a lot of Members who want to talk \nabout this very important issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nKansas is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I think the best face I could put on this--after this unfortunate \nsituation which was totally unexpected by myself, or my staff, or the \nRepublican members on the committee, for that matter, the Republican \nleadership--is that we have agreed to do what we already agreed to do; \nthat is, to complete as best we can phase II of the Intelligence \nCommittee's review of prewar intelligence in reference to Iraq.\n  I think it is very important to point out that the Intelligence \nCommittee has had an absolutely outstanding record working with Senator \nRockefeller and my colleagues across the aisle to produce the original \nreview in regard to the 2002 National Intelligence Estimate prior to \nthe military activities into Iraq, and also as to whether Saddam \nHussein had reconstituted his weapons of mass destruction. That was a \n17-to-0 vote. We had some differences, but that report came out. It was \na good report. It was a seminal report. As a matter of fact, I take \npride in saying that it was a bipartisan effort that was agreed to by \nthe 9/11 Commission, by the WMD Commission that was later formed, and \nmade about 93 or 94 recommendations to the administration of which \nprobably 93 to 94 out of 95 have already been implemented. So we worked \nin a bipartisan fashion to do that.\n  We also at the same time--and I am basically quoting from the \nstatement the vice chairman and I made on February 12 of 2004--agreed \nwe would go to something called phase II. There has been a lot of talk \nabout phase II. What is phase II? Why is it that has been delayed, if \nin fact it has been delayed?\n\n  There was some talk on the floor that got a little personal, and I \nregret that. It seems to me it was rather convenient because it was \nonly yesterday our staff was working with the staff of the minority \nindicating that not this week but next week we would spend as much time \nas possible, 5 or 6 days, to complete our work in regard to phase II. \nIt isn't as though it has been delayed. As a matter of fact, it has \nbeen ongoing. As a matter of fact, we have been doing our work on phase \nII. It is difficult, as I will indicate in a minute, while I go through \nthese provisions on what we agreed to do.\n  So it seems to be a little convenient all of a sudden to go into a \nclosed session of the Senate and call for a full Senate investigation \nof phase II when the committee is already doing its work. I think that \nbasically is an unfortunate stunt. I would call it something else, but \nI think probably I will simply leave it at that.\n  Let me tell you what phase II is all about. Again, let me point out \nthat we took a look at whether Saddam Hussein did reconstitute his \nweapons of mass destruction. That took us a long time. It is a 511-page \nreport. It is a seminal report. It is a good report, and it signifies \nwhat we can do in the committee when we at least let one another know \nwhat is going on and we work in a bipartisan fashion.\n  This is what phase II is all about. That is what we will begin as we \nhave planned to do and what our staff has indicated to the other side's \nstaff in regard to what we were going to do as of next week--that we \nwill start next week, and we will hope to continue that effort. We will \ncancel all other hearings until we can reach some sort of an \naccommodation. Now, if we can do this on the WMD report, certainly we \ncan do it in regard to phase II.\n  My good friends across the aisle are people of good faith. We had \nstrong differences of opinion then. I suppose we will have it in regard \nto phase II as well. We have seen that happen time and time again. As a \nmatter of fact, we brought up phase II on May 17 of this year.\n  The biggest issue is as follows. There are five things in phase II: \nWhether public statements and reports and testimony regarding Iraq by \nU.S. Government officials made between the gulf war period and the \ncommencement of Operation Iraqi Freedom were substantiated by \nintelligence information. In other words, the public statements made in \nthe administration and the public statements made by public officials, \nwhether they be in Congress, whether they be in the administration, or \nwhatever, Congress, because we voted for regime change and we voted to \ngo to war. Obviously, the administration, because they looked at the \nintelligence and thought our national security was in danger, we went \nto war.\n\n  Were the public statements backed up by intelligence or were they \nbacked up by flawed intelligence? We have that material. We were \nsupplied about 300 to 400 names by my colleagues across the aisle from \nall sorts of statements made by people in the administration. We took a \ngood look at what Members of Congress have said about the same \nintelligence. I must say, at this point, some of those statements are \neven more declarative and more aggressive than those made in the \nadministration.\n  That is the big issue: the use of intelligence. Whether somebody in \nthe administration or somebody in the Congress made a statement that \nthey thought was based on intelligence that was later proved wrong and \nsomehow we are suppose to get in their head and ask: Why did you make \nthat statement? Is that credible?\n  On May 17, in the spring, we started down the list of statements. We \ntook names off of the statements because I didn't want it to be a \nsituation, in terms of naming who made the statement, because I thought \nit might perjure or affect how people would vote in the committee. We \nstarted down that road. We didn't get very far. We had requests on the \ntotal progress of phase II, other portions of phase II.\n  So we started again on the first statement. Does that first statement \nmatch up with the intelligence? We didn't get very far. We started \nphase II in May, and we went back to work to see what we could get \ndone, where we would agree and come back to the ``use'' question, when \nthat would be possible.\n  There are five issues to phase II. Let me read them. The postwar \nfindings about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and their weapons \nprograms and the links to terrorism and how they compare with prewar \nassessments. That was done by Charles Duelfer and David Kay. Those two \nparagraphs are already written. You can simply say that Charles Duelfer \nand David Kay did not find WMD. That was their conclusion. They made \nsome statements\n\n[[Page S12103]]\n\nabout it. It was commensurate, exactly, with what our WMD report said. \nThere shouldn't be any problem with that. That should be adopted by the \ncommittee with hardly any dissent or any discussion.\n  The third issue is prewar intelligence about postwar Iraq. That is \nnot necessarily true today. It is post-insurgency Iraq. That was my \nsuggestion, saying if the intelligence community at least could figure \nout what we expected to find in Iraq postwar, post the military action. \nWhere was the intelligence? That is ongoing. That is ongoing because we \nhave what we think is a pretty good report, but we can make it more \nconcise. I can say right off the bat that intelligence was as flawed as \nthe intelligence in regard to the WMD report. We can agree with that. \nSo there are two we can agree on.\n  Let me go to the next one. Any intelligence activities relating to \nIraq conducted by the policy counterterrorism evaluation group and the \nOffice of Special Plans within the Office of the Undersecretary of \nDefense. This involved a question as to whether Under Secretary Douglas \nFeith had a special intelligence group that had undue influence in the \n2002 National Intelligence Estimate and whether or not that group and \nthat intelligence had an undue influence on the administration's \ndecision to go to war.\n  We had Under Secretary Feith before the committee. Then we were going \nto have him up again. And then my good friends across the aisle wanted \nmore information. In the midst of that, there was a statement made by \nthe vice chairman--I will not get into that because it tends to be \npersonal, and I don't want any remarks of mine to be personal, \nespecially after what happened on the Senate floor in regard to this \nissue. Basically, there was a statement made that what was going on in \nthe Office of Special Plans could be illegal. When that happened, \neveryone down there at the Office of Special Plans got lawyered up or \nat least thought about seeking legal representation.\n  The cooperation between that particular department and our committee \nwas not nearly as good as it was. We can clear that up because we have \nasked the Department of Defense inspector general to come back and tell \nus if there was anything wrong in regard to what the Office of Special \nPlans was doing. We will rely on that. We will put that in the report. \nWe can believe the inspector general of the Department of Defense.\n  Finally, the use of the intelligence community of information \nprovided by the Iraqi National Congress. Now, remember back when the \nCongress was talking to members of the Iraqi National Congress. Mr. \nChalabi was the head of that group. I had Senator after Senator come to \nme and ask, Why don't you have Mr. Chalabi appear before the committee? \nThe people supporting him wanted to vote and eventually did vote for \nregime change.\n  Then the pendulum swung the other way and people said, Wait a minute. \nWe are not really sure about his position or, for that matter, what he \nhas said in the past, what are you doing, and the question of the INC. \nThe whole question again was, how much effect did the Iraqi National \nCongress and Mr. Chalabi have on the input to the administration as to \nwhether or not they would go to war.\n\n  We have found, basically, as far as I am concerned, there is very \nlittle evidence, if any, that would take place.\n  I wouldn't think that would take too much time, as well.\n  So those are the five things we had to do in regard to phase II.\n  Let me repeat, again, yesterday our staff talked with my colleagues' \nstaff across the aisle and their staff--not my colleagues across the \naisle but their staff--and said the chairman wants to move on this next \nweek. My conversation in regard to the distinguished vice chairman, I \nthink it was last Wednesday, and let me say it was in the middle of a \nhearing and let me say it was not exactly clear in terms of any kind of \na date, but I did talk to Senator Rockefeller and indicated we had to \nmove, we had to get this done.\n  He will doubtlessly say they have written letters and they have tried \nto get me to move and this, that or the other, but we have been doing \nthis all along. Staff has been working on this very diligently. \nConsequently, I think we are very close. I am very pleased to announce, \non schedule, exactly what we planned to do, we will start next week. We \nwill start on Tuesday, and I will announce the time in the morning. \nMembers of the Intelligence Committee will know Tuesday, Wednesday, \nThursday, Friday, how long it takes, working in good faith. We will \nlook into phase II and see what we can do and finish that product.\n  I said a long time ago on the Intelligence Committee we had to work \nin a bipartisan fashion. I said a long time ago that whatever ended up \non the fan, we were going to have to clean it up. I said a long time \nago we will let the chips fall where they may, and that went for phase \nII as well as the WMD special inquiry.\n  I ought to say one other thing. There was a memo that was highly \npublicized back about a year and a half ago. That memo, which was not \nprovided to Republicans--obviously, it was a Democratic memo--and \nparagraph four caused a big fuss. It caused us about a month to sort of \nwalk gingerly around one another and smother each other with the milk \nof kindness and say, Well, let's see if we can't work things out. And \nwe did. I credit a lot of that to Senator Rockefeller. He is not a \npartisan man.\n  Here is the paragraph:\n\n       Be prepared to launch an independent investigation when it \n     becomes clear we have exhausted the opportunity to usefully \n     collaborate with the majority. We can pull the trigger on an \n     independent investigation any time, but we can only do so \n     once. The best time to do so will probably be next year.\n\n  Well, the trigger has been pulled today with an executive session of \nthe Senate that is not needed, not necessary, and, in my personal \nopinion, was a stunt. I plead with my colleagues across the aisle and \nmy colleagues, all Republicans on the committee, next week when we \nstart this, on Tuesday--we will go through Tuesday, Wednesday, \nThursday, Friday--I have no illusions, we will have differences, but I \nplead with you, as we have done in the past, for the good of our \nnational security, and to finish the inquiry on whether or not Saddam \nHussein had reconstituted his weapons of mass destruction, we were able \nto do that, and it became the seminal study for intelligence reform and \nwhere we are now with the Director of National Intelligence.\n  If we can get back to that mode instead of this surprising stunt on \nthe floor to go into executive session, we will be better off.\n  Phase II, yes, you bet, we have been on phase II, and we will do it \nexactly as we planned to do it as of next week. I see from the \nexpression of the distinguished President's face my time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer. For \nthe past 30 years, the Senate Intelligence Committee has been \nremarkably bipartisan. It has performed a terrific oversight factor for \nthe Senate. The resolution creating the committee mandates an oversight \nrole. We are not there watching clouds drift by. The resolution that \ncreates the committee mandates an oversight role of the U.S. \nintelligence community and a responsibility to carefully review our \nNation's most sensitive national security programs. It is very broad \nand widespread in the handling of highly classified secrets. The \ncommittee is designed to be nonpartisan. That is why I am called a vice \nchairman. That is not true in any other committee. But it is meant to \nwork.\n  We have reached an agreement that shows what has happened today, in a \nsomewhat abrupt manner, but nevertheless we have reached an agreement \non what we will do. That is a large step forward. I congratulate all \ninvolved in that.\n  For the most part, the history has been a good one. Over the past 2 \nyears, I have to say, in all honesty, I am troubled by a concerted \neffort by this administration to use its influence to limit, to delay, \nto frustrate, to deny the Intelligence Committee's oversight work into \nthe intelligence reporting and activities leading up to the invasion of \nIraq.\n\n[[Page S12104]]\n\n  In June, 2003, the Senate Intelligence Committee began a formal \ninvestigation into the prewar intelligence on Iraq. The primary focus \nof the investigation was to evaluate the intelligence reporting \nunderlying the claims that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction \nand that Iraq had ties to terrorist groups. Although the Senate \nresolution establishing the Intelligence Committee intelligence clearly \nstates in Senate resolution 400 we are to look at the ``use'' of \nintelligence, the majority on the committee initially rejected attempts \nby myself and by others to add to the investigation--that is, to add to \nphase I--how administration officials used or potentially misused \nintelligence and public statements leading up to the war which maybe \nhelped lead up to the war. Only after considerable insistence by \ncommittee members and protracted discussions did the majority \nleadership of the committee agree to add to the scope of our \ninvestigation the issue of how intelligence was used prior to the Iraq \nwar. It is a huge uncovered subject.\n\n  On February 12, 2004, the Intelligence Committee unanimously agreed \nand publicly announced that five issues would be added to the \ninvestigation, phase II. One, whether public statements, records and \ntestimony regarding Iraq by Government officials made between the gulf \nwar period, end of gulf war I and the commencement of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom, whether those statements by Government officials were \nsubstantiated by intelligence information.\n  Prewar intelligence is No. 2, prewar intelligence assessment about \npostwar Iraq.\n  Three, any intelligence activities related to Iraq within the Office \nof Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, headed by one Douglas Feith.\n  Four, the use of the intelligence community of information provided \nby the Iraqi National Congress.\n  Five, the postwar findings about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction \nand weapons programs and links to terrorism.\n  Remember, this was constantly being thrown at us, links to terrorism \nand how they compare to the prewar assessments.\n  The committee press release explained all of that. Everyone agreed to \nit, and it added the resolution adopted unanimously today that \nillustrated the commitment to all members to a thorough review to \nlearning the necessary lessons from our experience with Iraq and \nensures that our Armed Forces and policymakers benefit from the best \nand most reliable intelligence that can be collected.\n  These five areas of inquiry commonly referred to as phase II were \nauthorized well over a year and a half ago, in February of 2004. It has \nbeen 20 months since the committee committed to all Members of the \nSenate and to the American public a thorough review.\n  My colleague, the chairman of the committee, has referred to all of \nthe things that have been done. In fact, we have had one hearing. And \nhe referred to work that would take place next week. I didn't know \nabout that. All of a sudden everyone will plow into phase II. I am not \ncritical of that because I think today has helped to create that kind \nof momentum which I think is important.\n  Since the committee identified these five issues as a high priority \nin February of last year, I and other Democrats on the committee have \nrepeatedly urged completion of the review--we agreed to it \nunanimously--and had been assured by the chairman, time and time again, \nthat the committee will fulfill this commitment.\n  Yet, despite these repeated assurances, it is clear that only token \nwork, at best, has been done on phase II since it was authorized. That \nis unacceptable. We have had only one business meeting on phase II, and \nno report has been written for members to review--nothing.\n  The public pronouncement of Chairman Roberts earlier this year that \nphase II was ``on the back burner'' has been, unfortunately, accurate. \nDo I enjoy saying this? Not particularly, true. But let people know.\n  The disturbing question is, why has the chairman relegated the phase \nII investigation to the back burner? Why did he do that?\n  The fact is--and I hope folks will listen closely--that any time the \nIntelligence Committee pursued a line of inquiry that brought us closer \nto the role of the White House in all of this, in the use of \nintelligence prior to the war, our efforts have been thwarted time and \ntime again.\n  When it was reported that the Vice President's Chief of Staff Scooter \nLibby and the National Security Council prepared a draft speech making \nthe intelligence case against Iraq and sent it to the CIA for Secretary \nof State Powell to give before the United Nations in February of 2003, \nmy staff asked that the committee obtain the NSC, National Security \nCouncil, document as part of our ongoing review of how the Powell \nspeech was formulated. Our requests were denied by the majority. Why?\n  Because of this denial, I personally wrote to the Director of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency, Mr. Tenet, requesting the Libby/NSC input \ninto the Powell speech--it was important to have that information--and \nother documents in October of 2003. Director Tenet did not respond to \nmy letter, nor did he respond to my two subsequent letters for the NSC \npaper in January and March of 2003. Why?\n  Perhaps the answer can be found in last week's National Journal \narticle, which reports that Vice President Cheney and his Chief of \nStaff Libby overruled White House lawyers and withheld this \ninformation--withheld these documents--from us, and other documents \nfrom the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n  When, during the committee's Iraq investigation, my staff requested \nthat the committee interview the White House speechwriter who wrote the \nPresident's 2003 State of the Union Address to better understand how \nthe debunked claim that Iraq was seeking uranium from Niger made it \ninto the President's speech--how it got in there, when the same claim \nwas removed, at the CIA's insistence, a few months earlier in \nCincinnati--our request was denied by the majority. Why?\n  When we requested that the committee obtain a copy of the one-page \nsummary of the Intelligence Community's National Intelligence Estimate \non Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs that was prepared for \nthe President in October 2002, our request was denied by the majority. \nWhy?\n  And why has the committee's phase II investigation been moribund \nsince February of 2004? When the committee told the American people it \nwould conduct a thorough review, was the promise a hollow one? What \nother conclusion?\n  Could it be that the administration has made it clear it does not \nwant the Congress to examine whether intelligence was accurately \npresented to the American people in the rush to war?\n  Could it be that the administration has made it clear it does not \nwant Congress to examine the role that Pentagon policy officials under \nDouglas Feith played in circumventing the intelligence community and \npreparing an alternative analysis to the White House that drew a link \nbetween Iraq and the attacks of 9/11 that the intelligence did not \nsupport?\n  Could it be the administration has made it clear it does not want \nCongress to examine the claim that the Iraqi National Congress made to \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee in June of 2002 that it was \nproviding intelligence information directly to the Vice President's \noffice--to Mr. Hadley, I believe--and the Office of the Secretary of \nDefense? Chalabi passed all intelligence agencies in our Government \ndirectly into the White House.\n  The administration's ability to head off any line of inquiry into \nmatters of appropriate congressional oversight is not limited to the \nIntelligence Committee's Iraq investigation. Despite repeated attempts \nby me and other Intelligence Committee members to initiate a detailed \nreview of fundamental legal and operational questions surrounding the \ndetention, interrogation, and rendition of suspected terrorists held in \nU.S. custody--important national security measures that fall squarely \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Intelligence Committee--the committee's \nmajority has refused to conduct such an investigation. What are we to \ndo?\n\n  The Intelligence Committee's obligation under Senate Resolution 400--\n``to provide vigilant oversight of the intelligence activities of the \nUnited\n\n[[Page S12105]]\n\nStates''--requires us to not only answer questions related to cases of \ndetainee abuse, but to examine the effectiveness of the methods used in \ninterrogations.\n  But, again, it is apparent to me that the White House has sent down \nthe edict to the majority--and I could say more--that the Congress is \nnot to carry out its oversight responsibilities in detention, \ninterrogation, and rendition matters, or some of the previous matters I \ndiscussed, as it would bring uncomfortable attention to the legal \ndecisions and opinions coming from the White House and the Justice \nDepartment in the operation of various programs.\n  Finally, the delay in completing the remaining portion of the \nIntelligence Committee's Iraq review is inexcusable. Sadly, the \ncommittee's delinquency in completing an investigation that it \nunanimously voted to undertake over 20 months ago has diminished the \ncommittee's credibility as an effective overseer of the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  But what disturbs me the most is that the majority has been willing, \nin this Senator's judgment, to take orders from this administration \nwhen it comes to limiting the scope of appropriate, authorized, and \nnecessary oversight investigations. This is a very strong statement. \nThe very independence of the Congress as a separate and coequal branch \nof Government has been called into question.\n  We need to not only complete the second phase of the Intelligence \nCommittee's investigation, we need to reopen the first part of the Iraq \nreport we released in July of last year, to find out what role the \nWhite House played in denying the committee documents it needed to \ncarry out its investigation. That is not a part of the agreement, I \nfully and freely admit.\n  It is time the Senate, as a body, own up to our oversight \nresponsibilities and provide the American people the answers we \npromised we would give them over 20 months ago.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senators yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator from West \nVirginia a question.\n  Has the joint agreement of February 12, 2004, been made a part of the \nRecord?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan, I have the same document and ask unanimous consent that \nbe printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, also, there was a reference in the chairman's remarks \nas to events that went on in the Douglas Feith matter, and he referred \nto ``lawyering up.'' There is a very clear, easy, simple answer to \nthat, and I ask unanimous consent that be printed in the Record, also.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n [From the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Feb. \n                               12, 2004]\n\n   Chairman Roberts and Vice Chairman Rockefeller Issue Statement on \n    Intelligence Committee's Review of Pre War Intelligence in Iraq\n\n       Washington, DC.--Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS), Chairman, and \n     Senator Jay Rockefeller IV (D-WV), Vice Chairman, of the \n     Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, today announced that \n     the Committee unanimously agreed to refine the terms of \n     reference of the Committee's ongoing inquiry into pre war \n     intelligence with regard to Iraq. The new terms are as \n     follows:\n       A. The matters set forth in the joint release of the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman on June 20, 2003:\n       1. The quantity and quality of U.S. intelligence on Iraqi \n     weapons of mass destruction programs, ties to terrorist \n     groups, Saddam Hussein's threat to stability and security in \n     the region, and his repression of his own people;\n       2. the objectivity, reasonableness, independence, and \n     accuracy of the judgments reached by the Intelligence \n     Community;\n       3. whether those judgments were properly disseminated to \n     policy makers in the Executive Branch and Congress;\n       4. whether any influence was brought to bear on anyone to \n     shape their analysis to support policy objectives; and\n       5. other issues we mutually identify in the course of the \n     Committee's review;\n       B. the collection of intelligence on Iraq from the end of \n     the Gulf War to the commencement of Operation Iraqi Freedom;\n       C. whether public statements and reports and testimony \n     regarding Iraq by U.S. Government officials made between the \n     Gulf War period and the commencement of Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom were substantiated by intelligence information;\n       D. the postwar findings about Iraq's weapons of mass \n     destruction and weapons programs and links to terrorism and \n     how they compare with prewar assessments;\n       E. prewar intelligence assessments about postwar Iraq;\n       F. any intelligence activities relating to Iraq conducted \n     by the Policy Counterterrorism Evaluation Group (PCTEG) and \n     the Office of Special Plans within the Office of the Under \n     Secretary of Defense for Policy; and\n       G. the use by the Intelligence Community of information \n     provided by the Iraqi National Congress (INC).\n       Sen. Roberts said, ``Today's agreement reflects a \n     refinement and to a great extent a restatement of the \n     Committee's ongoing review of pre-war intelligence. The \n     resolution adopted unanimously today illustrates the \n     commitment of all members to a thorough review, to learning \n     the necessary lessons from our experience with Iraq, and to \n     ensuring that our armed forces and policymakers benefit from \n     the best and most reliable intelligence that can be \n     collected. I believe that the report which we are currently \n     reviewing will have a profound impact on the future of our \n     Intelligence Community. My hope is that we be able to release \n     our initial report soon and then continue our review as we \n     work toward recommendations. I congratulate all members for \n     their willingness to work together toward these goals.''\n       Sen. Rockefeller said, ``This agreement reflects a \n     difficult and lengthy process, but in the end, we were able \n     to reach consensus on the need to expand the investigation \n     into several key areas.''\n       ``We will address the question of whether intelligence was \n     exaggerated or misused by reviewing statements by senior \n     policy makers to determine if those statements were \n     substantiated by the intelligence,'' Rockefeller said. ``We \n     will take a closer look at the shortfalls in our intelligence \n     collection. We will compare pre-war estimates to the \n     situation in postwar Iraq, and we will pursue a better \n     understanding of what role the Policy Counterterrorism \n     Evaluation Group and the Office of Special Plans played in \n     pre-war intelligence. There are definitely a few outstanding \n     issues, but we've made a lot of progress, and it's clear that \n     we're moving in the right direction.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n      Response to Department of Defense Letter Regarding Senator \n            Rockefeller's Statement on Under Secretary Feith\n\n       In July 2004, officials at the Department of Defense took \n     exception to my characterization of the activities of the \n     office of Under Secretary of Defense Doug Feith. The Senate \n     Intelligence Committee has been investigating these \n     activities as part of its ongoing review of prewar \n     intelligence related to Iraq. After much delay, we received \n     thousands of pages of documents from the Defense Department \n     and conducted several interviews as we have sought to \n     determine the nature and extent of the intelligence \n     activities of this office. At the time of my public \n     statements, our review of these activities was still ongoing \n     and as part of the second phase of the Committee's work on \n     prewar intelligence.\n       In describing that part of our review I stated that we were \n     seeking to determine if Under Secretary Feith was running a \n     private intelligence operation not authorized in law. For \n     example, Section 502 of the National Security Act of 1947 \n     requires the heads of all departments and agencies of the \n     U.S. government involved in intelligence activities ``to keep \n     the congressional oversight committees informed.'' This \n     requirement relates to the activities of any part of the \n     government not just intelligence agencies. The Committee \n     review is intended to determine if the activities within \n     Under Secretary Feith's office were unauthorized intelligence \n     activities in contravention of this and perhaps other legal \n     requirements. The Committee unanimously agreed to review \n     ``any intelligence activities relating to Iraq conducted by \n     the Policy Counterterrorism Evaluation Group (PCTEG) and the \n     Office of Special Plans within the Office of the Under \n     Secretary of Defense for Policy.'' Implicit in that statement \n     is the possibility that unauthorized intelligence activities \n     may have taken place.\n       A letter from Assistant Secretary of Defense Powell Moore \n     in July 2004 expressed surprise at my description and asked \n     for an apology. I did not suggest that Mr. Feith has broken a \n     criminal statute. My concern, and that expressed in the \n     Committee's resolution authorizing its investigation, is that \n     some activities of his office may have been unauthorized. The \n     Committee has not reached a conclusion. And cannot reach a \n     conclusion without further investigation.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, one additional unanimous consent request. I \nask unanimous consent that it be noted in the Record that items C \nthrough G in the February 12, 2004, press release setting forth the \nagreement be noted as being phase II of the agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S12106]]\n\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we actually now return to the deficit \nreduction bill, which some of my colleagues may have forgotten. But \njust to remind them, this bill saves $39 billion off the deficit, and \nis the first major attempt in 8 years to try to accomplish savings \nthrough the process of reducing the rate of growth of our entitlement \naccounts.\n  In that context, we have a number of amendments, and we are glad \nMembers have been coming forward with them. We cannot formally agree \nright now on what the sequence will be, but to outline what we think \nthe sequence will be, it will be Senator Lincoln going now--we can be \nsure of that--followed by Senator Inhofe, followed by Senator Nelson, \nfollowed by Senator Lott this evening. And tomorrow morning, the first \ntwo amendments will be Senator Cantwell, dealing with ANWR, and then an \namendment by Senator Grassley, dealing with agriculture programs. That \nis the game plan.\n  Now, the understanding is that at 8 o'clock tonight we will complete \nour business today relative to the Deficit Reduction Act, and we will \nreconvene tomorrow, I believe, at 9 o'clock. Or is it 8:30? I am not \nsure. In any event, we will formalize that understanding in a few \nminutes, hopefully, after both sides have had a chance to review those \namendments which I outlined.\n  I now yield to the Senator from North Dakota to yield such time as he \nmay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this matter before us, just to remind \npeople after this interruption we have had, is about the so-called \nreconciliation project. It is part of the budget agreement that was \nreached earlier this year. On our side, we do not believe this has \nanything to do with deficit reduction. As we see it, this budget \nincreases the deficit dramatically, and expands the debt. In fact, \nunder the 5 years of the terms of this budget agreement, the debt will \nincrease by more than $3 trillion--$3 trillion. That is not my \ncalculation; that is the calculation of those who have prepared this \nbudget. So to be talking about deficit reduction here, I think, is \nutterly misleading.\n  Now, it is true the matter before us at the moment--and I call it \n``chapter 1'' of reconciliation. ``Chapter 1'' is called deficit \nreduction. That is because it slices spending by some $35 billion over \nthe next 5 years. During the same time, the debt is going to go up by \n$3 trillion. But what is to come next week is the second chapter. The \n``chapter 2'' is to reduce revenues by $70 billion. If you put the two \ntogether, the deficit is going to go up.\n  But ``chapter 3'' is to increase the debt of the United States by \n$781 billion--$781 billion. If you couple that with the debt increases \nthat have already occurred under this administration's watch, they will \nhave increased the debt of the country, in just 5 years, by $3 \ntrillion. In the next 5 years, under this budget agreement, they are \ngoing to increase the debt another $3 trillion. In this very short \nperiod of time, they will have accounted for half of all of the debt \naccumulated by this country over 228 years. That is truly stunning.\n  Now, the next amendment on this side is offered by Senator Lincoln, \nand I yield such time as she may use for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at this time I think we can reach unanimous \nconsent on what at least the next three amendments will be. I ask \nunanimous consent that the next three people to be recognized for \namendments will be Senator Lincoln, Senator Inhofe, and Senator Nelson. \nThe next amendment after Senator Nelson we expect to be offered by \nSenator Lott. The other side has not had a chance to review that \namendment yet, so we reserve on Senator Lott. I further ask unanimous \nconsent that tomorrow morning we will begin with an amendment from \nSenator Cantwell, followed by an amendment by Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No objection on this side. That is exactly what we worked \nout, and the chairman states it very well. And we may be able to slip \nin another amendment later today.\n  That is the order we have contemplated at this point and the \nunanimous consent request is entirely in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2356\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, over 2 months ago, devastating natural \ndisasters occurred in our Gulf Coast States, things that were \nabsolutely out of our control, Mother Nature. Since that time, I and \nmany of my colleagues have tried our hardest to get health care relief \nto those who were impacted by the tragedy. I say that because I am so \nsaddened, as we have strived so diligently to look at a commonsense way \nthat we could bring health care needs, meeting the health care needs of \nthe victims of that region with absolutely very little success.\n  In the week following the tragedy, I came to the floor and offered an \namendment to the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill. I withdrew \nmy amendment because so many people said: We need to do this. Let us \nwork out a bipartisan effort. Let us work together to meet the needs \nthat exist in this devastated region of the Nation. I withdrew my \namendment after working with Senators Grassley and Baucus to come up \nwith a bipartisan compromise, with the assurance that we would allow a \nbipartisan compromise to come forward and provide the kind of relief \nour good neighbors in the Gulf State region needed.\n  The compromise, the Emergency Health Care Relief Act, which was S. \n1716, received overwhelming support on both sides of the aisle. But \neach time we came to the floor and tried to pass it, there was a \nhandful of Members who objected. We have tried to bring it to a vote at \nleast five times that I am aware of. We listened to the concerns of the \nSenators who objected. We have scaled back the legislation time and \ntime again, first taking out one piece, then the other, trying to see, \naccordingly, what we could do to accommodate their concerns, without \ncompletely gutting the purpose of providing the kind of relief our \nfellow Americans need in the gulf region. That scaled-back version was \none that Senator Baucus offered in the Senate Finance Committee markup \nlast week, and it failed along party lines, with the understanding, \nmany Members said, that there was a need to get something out of \ncommittee.\n  I know how important it is to keep the trains running, but how well \ndo we understand here in this body the needs of our fellow Americans \nwho have been devastated, whose families have been torn apart, whose \nhomes have been demolished, their children's lives and schools \ndestroyed, who have been displaced and put into strange places to go to \nschool? We think about people who have lost their jobs, who have lost \ntheir memories in many instances, family albums, wedding albums, things \nthat can devastate you, depress you, and put you in a frame of mind \nthat says: I need someone to embrace me and make me feel like a part of \nthe family again.\n  Here we are attempting a budget reconciliation. A lot of people \nacross this country think: Oh, budget reconciliation, what is that, yet \none more big, long term the Senate uses for something they try to \naccomplish.\n  You know what, Mr. President, working American families reconcile all \nthe time, now probably more so than ever before. Their wages are \nstagnant. The price of gasoline is out of control. The price to heat \ntheir homes this winter, the price of health care in general is out of \ncontrol. They look at all of the things they are surrounded by and what \ndo they do? They reconcile their budgets. They reconcile their \nhousehold budgets, and they sit down and say to themselves: What is \nessential to keep our family whole? What is it this family needs to be \nable to maintain itself as a family, to not become dysfunctional or \nseparated or torn apart, to not be hungry or cold? What is it this \nfamily needs? How do we reconcile the fact that our wages have been \nstagnant, our costs are going out the roof?\n  What do they do? They sit down and look at the essentials that are \nnecessary. They make a list of what their essentials are, and they \naddress those essentials first. Then they move on to\n\n[[Page S12107]]\n\nthe things that may not be as essential, things that they want to do, \nbut they deal with the essentials of life first. They deal with food, \nshelter, health care needs, education for their children. These are the \ndecisions working families all across this great Nation are dealing \nwith.\n  Here we find ourselves in the Senate doing the very same thing for \nour American family. When I reconcile my budget at home, I try very \nhard to think of those individuals who my children and I pray for every \nnight when we say our prayers and we say: God bless those people who \nare homeless, who are hungry, who have lost their homes, who have \nsuffered from natural disasters. I think as we reconcile this budget \nhere, we need to look at our American family and what it is we find \nessential, that we find as a priority.\n  I come to this floor to say my sisters and brothers in the gulf coast \nregion are a priority in this American family. Their needs have to be \nmet. We don't need to wait another 8 weeks or 4 months or another year \nbefore we make it a priority. We need to reconcile it in this budget in \nour minds and in our hearts right here today. And if people have a \nproblem with it, then let them pick it apart. Let them come down here \nand say: We will cover pregnant women, but we are not going to cover \nthe childless adults who have lost their homes and been displaced from \ntheir families. We are not going to provide for those individuals.\n\n  Let them come down and pick it apart and nickel-and-dime what it is \nwe can do for our American family. Because I have to say, I think a \nhuge part of this Nation's values is represented in the priorities we \nchoose. The priorities we choose have an important impact on the \nchoices we make. We are here to reconcile the choices to be made at \nthis time in our Nation. We are consumed with enormous debt. We are \nconsumed with obligations internationally, with troops whose lives are \non the line today in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have unbelievable \nchoices.\n  But we can't forget about the other choices, the precious children we \nsaw last night trick-or-treating. What is their future? Are they going \nto have the education they need to be competitive? Are they going to \nhave an economy that is strong? Are they going to have a nation that is \nwell-respected? The heart of it goes back to how we as Americans treat \none another. Those are the values we have to begin to look at, \nparticularly in a document such as this.\n  The underlying bill does contain some assistance for Katrina \nsurvivors. I thank the Finance Committee chairman, Senator Grassley, \nand my colleague, Senator Lott from Mississippi, who is on the \ncommittee. But the truth be told, it is not enough. The hospitals and \nproviders of Louisiana have told us it is not enough. They have told us \nthey can barely keep their hospital doors open past Thanksgiving. How \nin the world could we imagine that people are going to move back in to \nthe communities of the gulf region to rebuild their homes, rebuild \ntheir businesses, bring their children back into school systems, if \nthere is no medical care? I ask my colleagues, would you do that? Would \nyou move your family back into communities where the hospitals are \nclosing their doors? Would you ask your employees to come back to a \nbusiness where no medical services could be provided? Is that how we \ntreat our American family and the members of our American family?\n  It is beyond me why it is that we would nickel-and-dime our sisters \nand brothers in the gulf region. Chairman Grassley himself admitted in \nthe committee that the limited relief in the underlying bill is only a \ndownpayment. I urge my colleagues to take this opportunity to do more \nthan just a downpayment for people whose lives have been destroyed, \ntheir families displaced, their homes obliterated, their jobs, Heaven \nknows what kind of jobs they might have to go back to.\n  We can provide real relief because we are Americans. We can do better \nthan that by our American sisters and brothers. We are a family. As a \nfamily, we can do better than that. We can do better than a downpayment \nthat might keep them open until Thanksgiving. I know we can do better \nthan that. I urge my colleagues to do so.\n  I am sure the administration and my colleagues who oppose this \namendment will say there is money out there for relief. And they are \ncorrect that there is money out there. But where is the relief? \nCongress has passed over $60 billion in FEMA funding, and where has it \ngone? Who knows? Through October 19, FEMA had placed only $18.2 billion \ninto the Hurricane Katrina disaster relief fund, roughly one-quarter of \nthe available funding, and had reported spending only around $4.1 \nbillion. Nearly 2 months after the hurricane devastated the Gulf \nStates, FEMA has provided only about $2.9 billion out of the $60 \nbillion to individuals and families affected by such a monumental \ntragedy to a region in our Nation. That is one-tenth of the funding \navailable that has gone to help hurricane survivors.\n  Even President Bush has realized that the money is not being used \nappropriately and has proposed reallocating $17 billion of it to do a \nvariety of things, including reconstructing military bases, offering \njob training, building affordable housing, repairing the wetlands, \namong many other items. All of these things are great. But will \nfamilies move back, will companies come back, will schoolchildren come \nback if there is no health care? Every day we drag our feet, it will \ncost us more, more to rebuild hospitals, more to bring providers into \nthe region, more to make sure the health care infrastructure is there, \nwhether it is medical schools, hospitals, clinics, ambulance service, \nall of the necessary needs that come through medical care.\n  What about health care for the thousands of Katrina survivors who \naren't getting their basic health care needs met or for the hospitals \nand health care providers that came to their aid and States that have \nalready been strapped and now have even more pressure on their budgets?\n  I do not understand why we continue again to nickel-and-dime these \nfamilies who have been through so much. Can we not put ourselves in \ntheir shoes to understand the devastation they have experienced?\n  Maude Jordan is an example I used from an article out of the \nEconomist. She is one of the Louisianans who isn't getting her basic \nhealth care. She survived on the top of her refrigerator for 3 days to \navoid the flood. Then when she was finally taken to Baton Rouge, she \nmade it to a relief center there and was told she didn't qualify for \nMedicaid because she is a childless adult, and the program doesn't \ncover childless adults.\n  All we are asking is to temporarily cover the Maude Jordans who have \nbeen devastated by this natural disaster--temporarily cover them. And \nif people on the other side think that is just too bold of an expansion \nof the program, then let's take it out. If they want to take it out, \nlet's take it out. Let's not cover the Maude Jordans. I want to, and I \nthink there are others who do, too. But if people think that is just \ntoo much sharing and they can't handle it, too much community, let's \ntake it out. Let's just cover the normal people under Medicaid with 100 \npercent so that Louisiana, when they finally begin to get their feet on \nthe ground, will not have to buckle from the burden of what we will lay \nupon them in covering their share of this devastation.\n  Katrina health care in this budget reconciliation bill will not help \nthe Maude Jordans of the world or the thousands of survivors who simply \ndon't have children. And maybe that is what people want to do. If it \nis, I hope they will come to the floor and make those recommendations.\n  But what about our health care providers. Last week, an Associated \nPress article illustrated the dire situation with Louisiana hospitals, \nsaying that the entire hospital system is only a step away from \nfinancial disaster. One of those executives is the one I quoted \nearlier:\n\n       We're out of money, roughly after Thanksgiving.\n\n  What a great holiday gift we would provide the people of Louisiana \nwho have lost their hospital system, do not have anywhere to take their \nchildren or elderly if they should choose to move back to their home \nand try to be there during the holiday season. There is no safety net \nin a hospital, no ability to be reassured that should they need it \nduring the holidays it would be there.\n  Across the border, Mr. President, in my home State of Arkansas--I \nhave been so proud of Arkansans. I believe\n\n[[Page S12108]]\n\nthey have exhibited the values that we all believe are strong in \nAmerica, the values of being a good neighbor. They answered the call. \nThey answered the call to be a good neighbor and provided a tremendous \namount of care without asking how or when or if they would be repaid.\n  My hometown, in one of the poorest counties in the country, that had \nto set up its own health foundation to keep the infrastructure of its \nhealth care in place and moving and operating and doors open, took out \nof that foundation to provide for the evacuees who were coming in, up \nthe Mississippi River Delta and into our communities. And God bless \nthem for doing it, for showing us that this spirit is still alive in \nthis great country; that neighbors do mean something to neighbors and \ncommunity is important. God bless them for doing it without being \nasked.\n  Yet what about us sitting here, not answering their call when they \nask, does our American family have those same values? Are they going to \ncome through for us when we have come through for our neighbors? \nLouisiana's Medicaid Program is considering making big cuts because \nthey don't have the funding to keep it going. Those cuts could result \nin 100,000 people losing their prescription drug coverage. Over 100,000 \nlow-income children and 2,500 pregnant women could be left without any \nMedicaid coverage. And Arkansas is operating under a waiver that the \nadministration contends will make them whole. But even the \nadministration admits that they need congressional action to get it \ndone.\n  How many stories do we have to share, and how many lives have to be \nimpacted before Congress will act? We have to do something now--today. \nI think it is so critically important as we see American families \nreconciling themselves in their family budgets, as we looked last night \nat the importance of community. I don't know about you all, but seeing \nprecious children in our own neighborhood walking alongside my own, \nlearning great things about being part of the community, how to say \nthank you, how to meet your neighbors, how to be part of a group in a \ncommunity, it is time for us now to recognize the role we play in this \ngreat American community and this great American family and exhibit the \nvalues that are so important to Americans: that we would share with one \nanother, that we would look after one another, that we would take care \nof our sisters and brothers in the Gulf State region.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Not just yet. Thank you.\n  The whole idea of community has been lost. Unfortunately, I think it \nis because there has been this attitude created, a sense or a feeling \nthat makes Americans afraid to share. What does that mean? It just \nmeans we are all concerned about ``me.'' But what makes us strong as a \ncountry? It is the ``we.'' It is the ``we'' in Americans. It is when we \nwork together, we not only do better, we do our best. And I think this \namendment is a way that Americans can show their best. They can show \nhow important it is to reach out and to take care of our neighbors and \na big part of our American family.\n  My grandmother used to tell me when I would feel down and out: When \nyou feel bad, and you feel like you could do better, she said, stop. \nShe said: Think of somebody who needs something, and go do it for them.\n  Mr. President, I think America feels down right now. I think they \nwonder who we are and what we are all about. I think this is the time, \nas we reconcile whatever it is we are here to do, that we stop and \nthink about who needs us right now and we go do something for them. I \nhappen to think that my brothers and sisters in the gulf region need \nsomething. I think it will show all of us the biggest and the best \nAmerica that we can possibly be.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I actually need to yield to my colleague here.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate that the Senator will not yield. I was going \nto ask the Senator for a copy of the amendment. Out of courtesy from \nthis side of the aisle, I decided to let her go forward. I appreciate \nshe won't yield to us to find out what her amendment is about.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at this point I yield time from our side to \nthe chairman of the Committee of Finance.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am going to speak against the \namendment by the Senator from Arkansas, but I want to make clear that I \ndo not object to the substance of the amendment. I am in a position \nwhere I have to have a reconciliation. I want to show sympathy for what \nshe is talking about but defending what I have in my mark and also \nexpress--and I am summarizing now--that I hope somewhere between now \nand the final consideration of the reconciliation we are able to take \nout Katrina relief that I have in mine, do it more broadly, as Senator \nBaucus and I have tried to do, but right now I am not in a position to \ndo that. I hope to move that along, and so today I am a little bit \nopposite of the Senator and a little bit opposite of Senator Baucus.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Will the chairman yield for a brief comment?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, I will.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would like to yield 1 minute.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. That is fine.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. For a question or comment.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Earlier, I complimented the chairman on the incredible \ndevotion to this issue and hard work in trying to bring about a \ncompromise, and I am grateful to him.\n  I would like to apologize to the Senator from New Hampshire who \nseemed upset that I hadn't put forth my amendment here in writing, but \nI have it here for him. I thank the chairman for all his hard work.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas for \nher kind remarks. As I explained, because things have to be compromised \nin order to get anything done here, it tends to be the majority party's \nresponsibility to move along reconciliation. In that vein, I am \nsomewhat different from the Senator from Arkansas, even though I have \nsympathy and even though I have spoken in support of it and even though \nI have worked with Senator Baucus on what she wants to accomplish.\n  So momentarily and throughout this reconciliation bill I have to \noppose the amendment by my friend and colleague from Arkansas.\n  We, of course, Mr. President, were all deeply moved by many of the \nstories that we have heard on the floor, particularly the stories that \nthe senior Senator from Louisiana tells us about. And it is not only \nher State but Mississippi and Alabama, stories about people who have \nlost everything--their homes, their jobs, and, worst of all, more than \n1,000 people have died. I am keenly aware that those who have suffered \nthe most are our most vulnerable citizens: the infirm, the displaced, \nthe disabled, and families on welfare. Our hearts go out, as well, to \nall the others who have suffered so much as a result of this terrible \ndisaster.\n  I understand the need to act, and my colleague, Senator Baucus, and I \ncame together very quickly--now I think 2 months ago almost--well, at \nleast 6 weeks ago--very quickly, in a bipartisan way, in response to my \nown leader's desire that we move very quickly to respond to this, as he \nhad a news conference the Wednesday after Labor Day, on behalf of those \nmost vulnerable individuals and families who have suffered so greatly.\n  You know that it is a priority for me to assist those affected by \nHurricane Katrina, and I think Senator Baucus and I came up with a very \ngood package, and I remain committed to it.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Go ahead.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield just to make an apology to the \nSenator from Arkansas? It appears my staff did have this amendment. I \nwas misinformed. I apologize to the Senator from Arkansas at this point \nfor having stated we didn't have it. I didn't know what was in it; I \nstill don't know what is in it. I presume somebody has it because the \nSenator from Iowa would not be opposing it if he didn't know what was \nin it.\n\n[[Page S12109]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Let me say here that for those people who don't see \neverything that is going on in the Chamber, we just had a Democrat \napologize to a Republican, and a Republican apologize to a Democrat. \nEverything here is not everybody at each other's throat. And I say that \nto the public at large because we do get along even though we disagree \nsometimes.\n  Anyway, I had this reconciliation package come out of my committee, \nand we are going to it now. And in the provision that we passed we were \nable to include what I consider a downpayment of what the Senator from \nArkansas and the Senator from Louisiana want to accomplish. In their \njudgment, it is not enough, but it is moving the ball down the road in \na way I hope that will get some help to people who need it.\n  This provision in the reconciliation legislation then makes that \ndownpayment to respond to the health care needs of low-income families \naffected by Hurricane Katrina. This is a placeholder for spending on \nthe hurricane victims because I believe it is extremely important that \nwe address the needs of those so affected. The legislation provides \n$1.8 billion to protect Medicaid benefits in Alabama, Louisiana, and \nMississippi. The legislation provides targeted temporary relief to \nparishes and counties affected by the hurricane.\n  The legislation reimburses States fully at 100 percent of their share \nof Medicaid costs for any claim paid for medically necessary health \ncare for evacuees. This Federal Medicaid funding increase is temporary. \nIt begins on August 28, 2005, the day the hurricane hit, and ends on \nMay 15, 2006. This is targeted relief for 1.9 million people. It \nfocuses its assistance to the people who need it the most.\n  I want to be clear, I would prefer to do our full bill on the Senate \nfloor outside the reconciliation process in what we call emergency \nmeasures. I remain deeply disappointed in the people who have stood in \nour way, and they are on my side of the aisle. In my judgment, this \nadministration's stand as well on this has just been plain wrong, and I \nhave said that in committee, and I have said that in news conferences.\n  Would I like to do more? Certainly. But to do more means that you \nmust pay for it. Frankly, I am concerned about how the Senator from \nArkansas is paying for this amendment. While I support taking funds out \nof FEMA to pay for Katrina relief, doing so on a reconciliation bill is \nnot germane.\n  So, Mr. President, the provisions in the reconciliation bill provide \nassistance for the next 8 months for 1.9 million people, and that is a \nvery good start. It is crucial that we do it this way, and we will get \nit done this way. At least this much will get done.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this provision in my bill and, \nconsequently, I ask them to vote against the amendment by the Senator \nfrom Arkansas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I continue to yield to the Senator from \nArkansas for the purpose of making a unanimous consent request and also \nfor the purpose of making a unanimous consent request that we go to her \namendment, that her amendment be before the body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2356\n\n    (Purpose: To provide emergency health care and other relief for \n                    survivors of Hurricane Katrina.)\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment to offer the amendment about which I have just \nspoken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln], for herself, Ms. \n     Landrieu, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Pryor, and Mr. Kennedy, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2356.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I apologize. I guess we brought this \namendment to the floor and to the committee so many times I just \nassumed my colleagues knew what it was. I apologize for any confusion \nin that regard.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time that has been \nused in the debate on this amendment be charged against the amendment \nso that it does not get charged against any of my colleague's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, I presume the time used by \nthe Senator from Arkansas will be charged to the Democratic side and \nthe time used by the Senator from Iowa and myself will be charged to \nthe Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I yield to my good friend and my \ncolleague from the gulf region, Senator Landrieu from Louisiana.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold for just one \nmoment so I might inquire? I think it will be useful for us to know \nwhere we are in terms of the time at this point on the amendment and on \nthe bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the amendment, the minority has consumed 22 \nminutes. On the amendment, the majority has consumed 9 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And can we also have the time left on the bill for today?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 1 hour 28 minutes remaining. \nThe minority has 1 hour 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. To further understand, the yielding of time to the \nSenator from Louisiana is off the amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GREGG. Parliamentary inquiry: I am presuming, just to make sure \neverybody is on the same wavelength, even though the time is off the \namendment, the time is also off the underlying 20 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, now that we have the amendment offered \nand the time straight, I wish to thank the Senator from Arkansas for \nher extraordinary leadership on this issue because this is not the \nfirst time she has come to the Senate floor. She has spent hours on the \nFinance Committee and hours on this floor trying to describe to our \ncolleagues the critical nature of this situation.\n  She comes from a State that was not directly hit by the hurricane but \nwas, nonetheless, impacted, as so many other States were that had the \ngoodness, the graciousness, the wherewithal, and the inclination to \ntake on thousands and thousands of people from Louisiana and \nMississippi, truly tens of thousands of people who fled for safety, for \nsecurity, for food, and for shelter.\n  It has been 64 days since Katrina hit and about 50-some-odd days \nsince Rita hit, two of the deadliest storms in U.S. history. But it was \nnot just the storms that did us in, not just the category 4 or category \n5 storms of 175-mile-an-hour winds that did us in. It was the 17 levee \nbreaks in one of the largest cities and metropolitan areas in the \nUnited States. And not just any city--an international city, an \ninternational region, the heart of the energy coast, the city that \nsecures the mouth of the Mississippi River and, may I say, the parishes \nthat surround the great city of New Orleans--Jefferson, St. \nTammany, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, and to the south we have parishes \nsuch as Vermillion, and along the southwestern part of the State, \nCalcasieu, and Cameron that were hard hit by Rita. There were over 2 \nmillion people displaced because of the storms and the subsequent levee \nbreaks. It was the largest catastrophe, natural disaster in the history \nof the Nation.\n\n  Our frustration--the Senator from Arkansas, the Senator from Montana, \nand other Senators from the Democratic side, and even Senator \nGrassley--is that it has been very difficult for people in Washington, \nparticularly\n\n[[Page S12110]]\n\nmembers of the administration and the majority party, to understand the \ndesperate and unprecedented nature of this disaster and what it has \ndone to people--poor, middle income, and wealthy.\n  Let me share a statistic in terms of doctors that is quite startling. \nDoctors are not usually in a poor category, nor are they really in any \ngovernment program in a sense. Most doctors make a considerable amount \nof money, and most doctors live in very nice homes. They have studied \nhard, and they have worked hard. Most doctors would not be in a \nGovernment program. But just to give a sense of the displacement, there \nwere 6,000 active patient care physicians in this region before the \nstorm. Sixty-five days ago, there were 6,000 active patient care \nphysicians. Over two-thirds, 4,486 have basically been displaced out of \n3 central New Orleans parishes that were evacuated.\n  Not only do we not have hospitals or clinics, our doctors are gone \nand our nurses are gone. The system is literally collapsing as we \nspeak. That is why Senator Lincoln has been here not just today but \nalmost every one of these 64 days trying to get this body and Congress \nto understand the magnitude of the disaster, the unprecedented nature \nof the disaster, and why it is important for us to provide a few \nbillion dollars to help us keep the lights on, get our doctors back, \nour nurses back, keep what hospitals we can standing up, because an \nunprecedented number of people have not just lost their homes but have \nlost their jobs and, as a result, have lost whatever health care, \nwhatever access to good care they needed.\n  Let me make one other point. The point I want to make in my short \ntime--the ranking member of the Finance Committee is here--as Senator \nLincoln said, this is about choices. I believe we as a Congress can \nmake better choices. We can do better. We can do better by the people \nwe serve.\n  The reason I say that is because the majority party is in a position \nto write the rules. We are writing a rule today that basically says we \nare going to provide $70 billion for tax-cut extensions. Some of them \nmay be good, but we are deciding as a Congress that we are going to \ngive $70 billion in tax cuts for 5 years. That is $14 billion a year. \nYet when Senator Lincoln and Senator Baucus come to the floor to say we \nneed $6.2 billion to just help people who have lost their homes, lost \ntheir churches, lost their schools, lost their neighborhoods, and lost \ntheir jobs, to just give the poorest of the poor access to health care \nso they can take care of their cancer or diabetes or even desperate \nmental health situations just for a few months or a year, we are told \nthat we cannot afford that.\n  It is about choices. It is about the choices we are going to make on \nspending and tax cuts. We are basically told: I am sorry, Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama. The only thing you rate is $1.8 billion for \nhealth care. That is all you rate, and that is all this will do, is \ntake care of just the Medicaid Program that was only in the 13 \nparishes.\n  But what I have to explain to people is, because New Orleans is the \nlargest city in Louisiana, because this region is the largest economic \ncontributor--it is a profit center to the State--our State budget is \nnow struggling with a $1.5 billion to $3 billion shortfall in the State \ngeneral fund. As a result of the loss of revenue due to this \ncatastrophic event, our entire program is struggling, not just in the \nparishes in which the hurricane hit, where the wind blew, the waters \nrose, the trees fell, and the homes collapsed, but our whole State is \nstruggling. That is why Senator Lincoln and Senator Baucus come to the \nfloor and say: We thank you for the $1.8 billion, but it is not enough \nto keep our program up and running this year.\n  This is not just any program. This is not a program that Louisiana \nthought about. This is a Federal program. It is in the essence of a \nFederal-State partnership, as you know, Mr. President, from your work \nin Tennessee. The Federal Government puts up 70 percent, and the State \ngovernment puts up 30 percent. What I am here to tell you is the State \npartner has experienced a great setback. The State partner is going to \nhave a very hard time, if not impossible time, putting up the 30-\npercent match to keep our children and our poorest citizens, as well as \nthose who are vulnerable, in health care for the year.\n  So we come here 65 days after the storm, when we are spending money \non everything we can imagine--from new programs, expansion of programs, \ntax cuts--to say, please consider a basic service of health care, not \njust for the parishes that were affected and the counties in \nMississippi but for the whole States of Louisiana and Mississippi that \nare struggling.\n  Particularly in Louisiana's case, we were harder hit, we had more \nlevees break, our major city was flooded. Jackson was not flooded. New \nOrleans was flooded. Our major economic base, from our ports to our \nenergy industry, have been directly impacted and revenues have fallen \noff precipitously.\n  Let me share one other statistic and then I am going to wrap up. I \nasked my staff to give me something so I can explain to people what the \nlosses are. They went back to 2003. Now, this is only 2 years. This is \nan average of people who are unemployed in Louisiana. We work hard just \nlike everyone else. We averaged about 135,000 people unemployed in June \nof 2003. Let us pick June of 2004: We had 119,000 people receiving \nunemployment. Let us go to January 2005: We had 119,000 people. Right \nbefore the storm in August of 2005, we had 122,000 people unemployed.\n  So I think one can say over the last 2 years we have had roughly an \naverage of 120,000 people unemployed. In one month, our number jumped \nfrom 122,000 to 227,000 people--100,000 people in one month are seeking \nunemployment. That is how desperate people are. It has never happened \nin these 2 years. I bet if we went back and looked at it for the last \n20 years, the only spike that one would find like this is maybe in the \n1980s when the oil industry collapsed and almost everybody in Louisiana \nlost their livelihood. We have not seen this in so long, we do not \nremember a time such as this.\n  I do not know why we are having a hard time explaining this to an \nadministration and to the majority about how desperate the situation \nis. We are not ungrateful for the steps that have been taken. We are \nnot ungrateful for the FEMA money that is slowly getting to us. What we \nare saying is we need to do better.\n  Today, how do my colleagues think I felt watching the President of \nthe United States stand up and tell everybody that he was going to \nallocate $8 billion for the avian flu? I do not know where he is \ngetting the $8 billion for the avian flu. All we are asking for is $6.2 \nbillion to keep a health care system of the whole State standing up \nuntil we can figure out what we might need to do because we do not have \nall the answers. It has only been a few weeks. Our system has basically \ncollapsed. It is going to take us a little bit more time to figure out \nwhat the long-term solution is.\n  For the people that Senator Lincoln talked about that stayed on their \nrefrigerator for 3 days, for Mr. Albert Bass, who was a painter in the \nninth ward, who went to the hospital with a 104-degree fever, his \nMedicaid application has been denied; he needs help now. For Ms. \nStewart, who lives in Jefferson Parish, she was a teacher; she has been \ndenied Medicaid. She is 51. She is married. Her husband receives Social \nSecurity. She was diagnosed with cancer. Her cancer is back. Her health \nsituation is worsening. She has no more income. I need to tell Mrs. \nStewart what her outlook is.\n  What I am going to tell her is, we are going to find money for the \navian flu, we are finding money for Iraq, we are finding money for a \ntax cut, we are going to raise $4 billion more by selling off spectrum, \nbut I am sorry, we cannot get you into a hospital.\n  The final thing I am going to say, maybe the majority does not like \nthat it is a Government program. So Senator Lincoln, Senator Baucus, \nSenator Grassley come up and say, well, let us have some way for the \nbusinesses that had people on unemployment--I mean insurance, the \nbusinesses have collapsed, but these businesses are valiantly trying to \nkeep people on their insurance program because they know the desperate \nsituation of their employees.\n  I cannot say what most businesses are going through. Business owners \nare taking money out of their own pocket, going into their own savings \naccount, trying to pay their employees with no money coming in the \nfront door. These businesses have been in business 30\n\n[[Page S12111]]\n\nyears. These employees have been loyal to them. They have showed up for \nwork every day. Talk about public-private partnerships. This amendment \nis an $800 million fund that is not a new program. It goes to our \ninsurance commissioner to try to help work with small businesses and \nbusinesses so that people can keep their health insurance, so that they \ndo not fall onto the Government payroll, so they do not become wards of \nthe State.\n  This is self-help. This is partnership. This is self-reliance. With \nall of that, we have been told, no, come back later.\n  We are going to continue to come back because while we are grateful \nfor the $1.8 billion, it is so far short of what we need to stabilize \nour health care system. For a State that is 4.5 million people, that \nhas literally been punched in the gut and is rolling back, this \nadministration has got to do better by the people of Louisiana, \nMississippi, and the gulf coast. Charity starts right at home. Strength \nbegins right at home. Our war is right at home in the Gulf Coast \nStates. When one is fighting cancer, it is about as tough as it gets. \nWhen one has their son or daughter dying of a fatal disease, it is \nabout as tough as it gets. That is a private war that people are going \nthrough. We keep walking away from it, pretending that it is going to \ngo away. Well, it is not going to go away. I am not going to go away. \nThe Louisiana delegation is not going to go away.\n\n  Finally, we will realize that this is not a regular hurricane. This \nwas an unprecedented catastrophe that has taken a major economic center \nto its knees, and it is going to take more than whitewashing and press \nconferences and a little bit of money drabbed here and there to stand \nus up so that we can continue to be the great region we are, pay taxes \nto this country and contribute to the economic benefit.\n  As I said, we are not a charity case. We have contributed billions of \ndollars to this Government and will continue to. In our hour of need, \nwe have to come and ask for pennies on the dollar. So I hope that we \ncan do better. We must. We can. There is most certainly room in this \nbudget on the spending side or the tax side to do better.\n  We are grateful for the $1.8 billion, but we need Senator Lincoln's \namendment, we need the leadership of Senator Baucus. I thank Mr. \nGrassley, the Senator from Iowa, the Republican leader of the Finance \nCommittee, who has been a champion on this issue. If he had a little \nmore support from his caucus and from the administration, we might get \nmore than a Band-Aid, because we are hemorrhaging.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I do not know who is yielding the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Arkansas \ncontrols the time.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. What is the time remaining on our side, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LOTT. Parliamentary inquiry: How much time remains on this side \nof the aisle on this issue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 51 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LOTT. Has the Senator from Montana spoken on this subject?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Not yet. I plan to speak now.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to speak on the subject also, but I \nwould defer to the ranking member of the committee, and then hopefully \nI could speak right after that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I yield time to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, 9 weeks ago yesterday, Hurricane Katrina \nhit the gulf, killing over 1,000 people, displacing over 1 million \npeople, leaving the region with a cleanup bill that might reach $200 \nbillion. Katrina left a gaping need in health care in the affected \nStates and those that are hosting States. I do not know how to say it \nany other way but that the devastation is biblical.\n  I visited the area 5 or 6 weeks ago. Other Senators did, too. I do \nnot think there is any Senator who actually visited who would come up \nwith any other feeling or belief that it is biblical. Unfortunately, \nvery few Members of this body have actually been there. Unfortunately, \nvery few Members of this body have actually seen the area, seen what is \nleft, and it is not much, whether it is in Louisiana, New Orleans or \nthe Gulf States. It is incredible how much the area has been destroyed. \nPeople who are alive do not have jobs, do not have homes, do not have \nschools, do not have their lives. It is absolutely incredible, and it \nis devastating. It is biblical. I do believe firmly, if every Senator \nin this institution were to see the areas affected, see the people, see \nwhat is happening, there would be a different result.\n  We have become too academic around here. We read too many memos. We \ntalk too much among ourselves. There is too much sort of theory, not \nenough actual on the ground, what really is going on. If Senators were \nto see it, feel it, taste it, smell it, there is no doubt in my mind \nthat this amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas would pass, it \nwould pass unanimously, and we would not be debating it. We would be \nprobably asking how could we help some more.\n  So in the meantime, how has this Congress responded? To be fair, it \nhas not. Incredibly, it has not. In the hurricane's wake, the chairman \nof the Finance Committee and I drafted a bill to cover evacuees under \nMedicaid for a short period of time, 5 months, to help provide health \ncare to low-income people who do not have their jobs anymore, who do \nnot have health insurance anymore, who do not have a place to put their \nkids in school, do not have homes--just temporary health care, 5 \nmonths. That was the bill we offered, a bill that Senator Grassley and \nI put together.\n  Who supported it? Everybody in the affected States, Republicans, \nDemocrats, Senators, Governors, supported it. Did we get it passed? No. \nWe cover evacuees below the poverty level of $9,500. Think of that. \nPeople who earn that low income need help, particularly in the \ncircumstances faced by the people in the aftermath of this destruction \nof the hurricane.\n  Our amendment also would cover pregnant women and kids at twice that \nincome level. That is not a lot of money. That is about $19,000 a year. \nThat is all. Pregnant women and kids with incomes above that much would \nnot get covered by our amendment but up to that level, $19,000 a year, \nthat is all, pregnant women who only earn $19,000 a year. We say let's \nhelp them out for 5 months but at least help them out. That bill did \nnot pass.\n  What else did Senator Grassley and I provide for? Well, an $800 \nmillion fund for health care providers' uncompensated care cost. What \nis that all about, uncompensated care? What does that mean? That means \nhelp to those hospitals, those doctors, who gave free medical care out \nof the goodness of their hearts. Free medical care to people, \nregardless of what it cost, they just gave it; it is uncompensated \ncare. Because those folks did not have insurance coverage, they did not \nhave ways to pay the bills. It was free care. So we are saying, those \nhospitals are Good Samaritans, those doctors are Good Samaritans. They \nwere not compensated at all for their care, so let us give them a \nlittle bit, $800 million--that is all. I know that the true \nuncompensated care cost is many times that. We are saying, let's help \nthose Good Samaritans and show them that we care.\n  And who is ``we''? We are the American people who pay taxes. We are \nMembers of the Senate saying, OK, we represent our people back home. \nThose of us offering this amendment say we believe that our people in \nour States want to help out. They want to help these people who do not \nhave health care, who have lost their jobs, lost their health \ninsurance, help people who are in desperate need of help.\n  Indefinitely? No, for 5 months. For a long time? No. For a huge \namount? No, a little bit. We think the American people want to help \ngive some care to those people who need it and who are good Samaritans. \nBut this body so far has said we are not going to help those good \nSamaritans. We are going to leave them out in the cold.\n  Senator Grassley and I also suggested giving 16 months of full \nFederal funding to the beleaguered Federal programs of the affected \nStates. What does that mean? That means for 16 months\n\n[[Page S12112]]\n\nwe, as Americans, are going to help those States meet their Medicaid \nbills--for 16 months. But our bill has been blocked. It has been \nblocked by a small group of Senators on the other side of the aisle.\n  What do these Senators on the other side of the aisle say? What is \ntheir reason for blocking this bill, this little, small bill that helps \nsome people for a short period of time? What do they say? That our bill \nprovides an open-ended expansion of Medicaid. It is the camel's nose \nunder the tent. It is a theoretical, ideological argument.\n  They argue also that the Government, that is HHS, Department of \nHealth and Human Services, can take care of this crisis without \ncongressional action. They say you don't need that, Congress. We, the \nadministration, can take care of this. That is what they say. They also \nargue that our legislation is unnecessary spending. They keep those \nsame arguments in effect today.\n  Let me take those points on one by one. On the first, the amendment \nbefore us provides, as did the bill Senator Grassley and I offered, \ntemporary 5-month Medicaid coverage. It is not indefinite; it is \ntemporary, 5 months. We also suggest the President can renew that \ncoverage for an additional 5 months, but that is it. It is not an open-\nended Medicaid expansion. It is getting help to those who need it; not \ndown the road, not forever, but now, because people need health care \nnow. That is not something they can postpone. When you need health \ncare, you need it right now. What about the argument that the \nadministration, HHS, can take care of this problem without \ncongressional action, that the administration can take care of Katrina \nhealth needs through something called Medicaid waivers?\n  Simply put, that is not true. It is simply not true. They cannot do \nthat under the law. They need a change in the law to do that. They \ncannot do that on their own. Last week in the Finance Committee, HHS \ntestified they do need legislation to provide additional funds for the \nStates to meet Katrina health needs. They admitted it before the \nFinance Committee. They also said the plan to provide only $100 million \nfor new funds for uncompensated care costs--that $100 million is a \npaltry pittance compared to what is needed in the State of Louisiana \nalone.\n  I might say, too, legislation is needed to address these needs, but \nthe President still has not asked Congress to pass the legislation to \nmake that happen. We provide it in this amendment, but they do not.\n  Finally, Senators on the other side of the aisle argue that this bill \nconstitutes wasteful spending; since we have already appropriated $60 \nbillion through FEMA, two-thirds unspent, we should use those funds \nfirst. These same Senators argue we should scale back the bill's \npricetag.\n  I have listened to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. \nSenator Lincoln has listened to them. Senator Landrieu has listened to \nthem. We want to get legislation passed. We want to help people in some \nway.\n  Guess what. In the spirit of compromise we scaled back our bill, \noffsetting it with unspent FEMA funds. That is, we are doing what the \nSenators wanted us to do. The amendment before us reduces the cost of \nthe Katrina health package by giving 12 months of State Medicaid relief \ninstead of 16 months; it removes the reductions in 29 State Medicaid \nprograms--that bothered them, we removed that part--and by using \nunspent FEMA funds to offset its costs, the amendment does what the \nWhite House advocated last week.\n  As you know, last week the White House proposed redirecting $17 \nbillion in unspent FEMA funds to help rebuild the gulf coast. Let's \nlook at that $17 billion. Of that $17 billion, $3.3 billion would go to \nreconstruct military bases--not health care needs but military bases--\nand $2.3 will be spent on highways and bridge construction.\n  I am speaking perhaps out of place here, but I visited the military \nbases that have been the subject of this amendment here. Yes, there is \ndamage there, but it does not begin to compare with the other damage, \nthe damage to the homes and the roads and the bridges, the lost jobs \nand health care needs. There is no comparison. I don't know why we are \nspending $3.3 billion to reconstruct a military base but not spending \nthe money to help people with their health care needs.\n  Mr. President, $410 million would help farmers remove debris and \nrehabilitate the land. Those are good causes. But the President's \nrequest doesn't ask for increased health care funding. It does not help \nthose hospitals or doctors who were Good Samaritans by providing \nuncompensated care relief. It does not help States care for evacuees \nthrough their overburdened health care programs, and it doesn't help \npatients now.\n  As I say, this amendment, to remind my colleagues what one of the \nopponents on the other side argued for a moment ago--it does it. What \nis that? When trying to move this bill through the Senate, a Senator on \nthe other side, on September 30, said, and I quote him:\n\n       The question is not whether we should or want to provide \n     assistance. But we want to make sure we do it in a way that \n     ensures that resources get where they are most needed and in \n     a way that takes advantage of the $45 billion or so that has \n     already been appropriated but has not been committed yet.\n\n  Guess what. That is what this amendment does. It uses unspent funds \nto meet the urgent health care needs of Katrina victims. More than 9 \nweeks after this major national disaster hit our shores, we are still \nwaiting for this Congress and the President to act on Katrina health \ncare needs. The reconciliation bill we are considering provides some \nhelp for victims, but the $1.8 billion in the bill is not enough. It \nhas been called a downpayment. It is not a downpayment; it is an end \npayment in the minds of the administration and those on the other side \nof the aisle. It is a last payment; it is not a downpayment. Why is it \nnot a downpayment? Because they are saying no to extra funds being \nsuggested here. So it is not a downpayment. That is flat inaccurate. It \nsounds nice, but it is inaccurate.\n  We need to provide more Federal funds to help the affected States. \nLouisiana is in very dire financial straits. It will have to cut its \nMedicaid program by an estimated 40 percent if that State doesn't get \nfunds by the end of this year. Think of that. It has to cut Medicaid by \nhuge amounts if it does not get the needed funds.\n  We also need to provide the funds for uncompensated health care costs \nto ensure providers--doctors, hospitals, health centers, the Good \nSamaritans--are recognized. And we need to ensure that low-income \nsurvivors get the health care they need, whether or not they meet \nMedicaid's rigid eligibility rules.\n  In Louisiana alone, half of those who have applied for Medicaid have \nbeen turned away because they don't meet those standards. Think of \nthat. Half the people in Louisiana have been turned away. They have \nhealth care needs. It is diabetics, cancer patients, people with dire \nneeds who are turned away. We are not talking about high-income levels. \nCurrently, a single mom who makes more than $2,500 a year would not get \ncovered. Think of that. We are raising that to $9,500 a year. Right \nnow, in the view taken by the other side of the aisle, a single mom who \nmakes more than $2,500 a year would not get coverage. She would not get \nany help.\n  What are we saying? Let's raise it up to $9,500 at least. That is not \na lot of money; $9,500 a year. That is not a lot of money. If she makes \nmore than that, she doesn't get help, but if she makes up to that \nlevel, she does get some help.\n  This is not right, that this amendment is not being passed. It will \nnot be agreed to. It is clear by the tone of this debate here. The \nSenator from Louisiana said we are going to keep working until we get \nsomething passed. Why? Because it is the right thing to do.\n  I see the chairman of the Budget Committee is sitting there, deeply \npondering, his chin on his hand there. I am saying to the chairman: \nThere is a way to do this. The way to do it is to pay for it out of \nunspent Katrina appropriated dollars. There is a way to do this.\n  I know the chairman is very concerned about total costs. He should be \nconcerned about total costs. That is his job. But there is a way to do \nthis and that is through this amendment. It is through the already \nappropriated dollars that are unspent. It does not add\n\n[[Page S12113]]\n\nto the deficit, does not add to the budget woes the chairman is \nworrying about. There is a way of doing this.\n\n  I am calling upon all of us as Senators to find a way to do this. We \nall know it is the right thing to do. We all know it is the right thing \nto give temporary health care assistance to people in the affected \nareas. We all know that. We all know it is the right thing to do to \nhelp some of those hospitals and doctors who have been Good Samaritans \nget a little bit of help because all America wants to help. We all know \nthat. All America wants to help those doctors and those hospitals a \nlittle bit.\n  I say to my good friend from New Hampshire, find it in his head and \nin his heart to help make this thing work because it is so important to \nso many people who are counting on us to recognize them, give them a \nlittle bit of hope--that is the very least we can do--and support the \namendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. I will yield to the Senator from Mississippi such time as \nhe may use off the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire, the \nmanager of this important legislation, for yielding at this time. He \nhas been very patient as this amendment has been discussed. And the \ndistinguished Senator from Oklahoma certainly has been patient, \nthinking he was going to have to wait 5 or 10 minutes after this \namendment, so I will try to be brief.\n  Let me say there is no question in my mind about what our needs are \nin Mississippi and Louisiana. The people I love the most, my neighbors, \nmy family, and constituents I have represented for 33 years, are \nhurting. They need lots of help.\n  Right across the hall now are 12 superintendents from south \nMississippi saying: Help us, please, and do it quickly because FEMA is \nnot delivering trailers for our employees. We are open because we want \nto get our children back in school, but we need operating expenses, we \nneed help right away. Not just rebuilding, we need help to keep \noperating because the tax base has been destroyed--no ad valorem tax, \nno sales tax, nothing in some of the counties that are affected.\n  Look, I know firsthand how bad this situation is. Every time I go \nhome it breaks my heart again. Fortunately, the people there are \nresilient and determined to come back. They appreciate any help we give \nthem. They don't whine a lot, from my neck of the woods, they just keep \nworking.\n  I agree with what has been said here in a lot of areas. First, this \nSenate has not done enough to help the people, and what we have done is \nbeing slow-rolled by the Office of Management and Budget and FEMA. The \nlist of horror stories, if I put them in the Record, would stagger my \ncolleagues here.\n  A good job is not being done--yet. The money we passed, $63 billion \nalmost, probably--maybe $40 billion has been spent. Meanwhile, some \ncontractors have not been reimbursed; schools have not gotten a nickel; \nthe Mississippi Department of Transportation is not being reimbursed \nfor the money they have already spent. There are horror stories of what \nCongress has not yet done in terms of changing the law. There is a bill \npending right now at the desk from the Government Affairs and Homeland \nSecurity Committee, S. 1777, that would do an awful lot to help our \npeople in a lot of areas by changing the laws, by removing caps. It \nwould not necessarily cost a lot more money. It would extend the time \nfor unemployment benefits from 26 weeks to 39 weeks, and so on and so \non. There is a lot we could be doing. We ought to do it.\n  But what is this bill we are working on? This is the deficit \nreduction legislation, I thought. I thought this is where we found \nplaces where we could make savings where money is not being properly \nspent, or spent to the best effect. Several committees have worked to \ncome up with the savings we have. And, by the way, gee whiz, we came up \nwith more money than the budget required. So, ``Gee, where can we spend \nit?''\n  Yes, I am one of the ones who is trying to do that. I supported the \neffort of Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus to get a bill \nthrough--I don't know, 6 weeks ago--that would have provided $8.5 \nbillion, I think it was, for Medicaid. I didn't cosponsor it because \nthere were things in there I was uncomfortable with, but I thought we \nneeded to take action quickly.\n  So we came down to this. Now it is $1.8 billion. How did we get $1.8 \nbillion for Katrina in the deficit reduction bill? I don't want to brag \ntoo much; I am not even particularly proud of it. But I said if you \ndon't put that in there, I won't vote for the bill, and if I didn't \nvote for it, it wouldn't have passed because, unfortunately, we have to \ndo it with all Republican votes.\n  Democrats won't help us at all. That is why it is in here. But it is \nnot enough. It is not all we need. The plate has been passed. We got a \nlittle help. Now I am going to come back and say give me another $2 \nbillion, $3 billion, or $4 billion. That is going to depend on how we \nadd to the deficit. This is not all it is going to be. But this is a \ngood start, $1.8 billion.\n  I have gotten to the point where I am saying I don't want it all, \njust help me a little. This is responsible, what we have done here--\n$1.8 billion to increase the Federal match for Medicaid in the FEMA \ndisaster counties. That is an important differentiation.\n  One of my problems I keep arguing about is I have people in northwest \nMississippi who are not in the disaster area. We shouldn't increase the \neligibility for them. They weren't hit by the hurricane.\n  I would be perfectly willing to just say: Governors of Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Arkansas, we are going to give you X dollars for \nMedicaid, and you make sure it gets to the people who really need it. I \nhave not been able to sell that. A lot of what we need can be done by \nOMB without us doing a thing. They could take it out of the $60 \nbillion-plus that we passed.\n  But I don't think we should use deficit reduction or the need for \nMedicaid help to immediately increase eligibility. I don't think we \nought to provide 100 percent FMAP to all of Mississippi and Louisiana, \nincluding in those areas that were not affected. We may need to \nincrease eligibility, but this is supposed to be to help people who \nwere hit by the disaster, who were displaced by the disaster, or live \nin the area and lost everything.\n  I tried to make a point to my colleagues when they said we have to be \nfiscally responsible. I say help me explain to the people in Hancock \nCounty, MS, who lost their job, their house, their car, their truck, \ntheir boat, their dog, that we have to make sure we are fiscally \nresponsible. I am not going to do that. We are going to help that \nperson. That person has a slab, a mortgage, and no job. We are going to \nhelp them or I am not going to be part of an institution or government \nthat will not help people in America who are hurting like that.\n  I can get just as passionate. I lost my house. I am emotional about \nthat. Everybody around me lost their houses. And people who worked all \ntheir lives and saved everything, they have lost it all. This hurricane \nis a great equalizer. If you are poor and you lost everything, you have \nnothing. If you are middle income and you lost everything, you have \nnothing. If you are a retired doctor and you lost your home and your \ncar, you ain't got much left.\n  We need to do more. There is no question about that. But we do the \nright thing here by raising the FMAP 100 percent for those areas that \nare affected. We need to do more in this uncompensated care area, and \nwe are going to do more.\n  But I ask my colleagues--I know how heartfelt this is for my \ncolleague from Louisiana and the Senator from Arkansas. They are trying \nto do the right thing. But I am just saying, let us not pursue the \nperfect at the expense of the good. I was a part of the deal. I got all \nI could. I will come back at the next round in conference and try to \nget more.\n  When we get through this, we will be back trying to get what we need. \nBut to my colleagues from the affected States and those who want to \nhelp us, I want to remind them that when you ask for more than you are \nreally entitled to, or when you ask for things not in the hurricane-\naffected area, or for people not in the affected area, you are hurting \nyour credibility. When you ask for a huge number and include things \nthat maybe are not in the area, and I\n\n[[Page S12114]]\n\ncould do that, then our colleagues say: Wait a minute. We have to make \nsure we help those people who really need it, but we don't do things \nunder the cover of the hurricane that can't be justified on behalf of \nthe American taxpayer.\n  Having been critical about the recovery, let me just say to \neverybody--to volunteers, to the military, to the private sector, to \nthe faith-based groups, to this institution, to so many people who have \nhelped us when we have been on our knees--we appreciate it. We have to \ndo a lot more. But I don't think we are in a position to be looking a \ngift horse in the mouth.\n  Let us do this now, and let us keep working because we have a long \nway to go.\n  This hurricane was so overwhelming, the damage is so monumental that \nit overwhelmed Federal agencies. Nobody can really appreciate what we \nare dealing with here. It is just more than we ever dreamed, including \npeople like me. I have been through six hurricanes, two tornadoes, an \nice storm, and a flood. I have never seen anything like this.\n  We are not going to fix this tonight, in a week, in a month, or in \nmany months. It is going to take years.\n  I want to make sure, my colleagues, that I come back to you again and \nagain and say: We need this help. I have done my homework. It is \njustified, and we need you to do it on behalf of these people.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, what is the time agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has no time \nremaining. There is 50 minutes remaining in opposition.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent agreement, the \nunderstanding was that we move on to the Inhofe amendment and to the \nNelson amendment. And although it wasn't agreed to, I believe it can \nnow be agreed to that the amendment in order after the Nelson amendment \nwill be the Lott amendment, except if we end up going into tomorrow, \nthe first two amendments will be Senator Cantwell's amendment followed \nby Senator Grassley's amendment.\n  If Senator Lott's amendment or Senator Nelson's amendment do not come \nup tonight, we follow those two amendments. Is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The chairman, as always, has it exactly right.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that be the order of business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, \nbecause we have a half dozen Senators or more on this side who have \nasked to have time to speak on the bill, let me send a message in this \nway, if I can, to our colleagues and the staff who are listening. \nObviously, the events of this afternoon have blown a hole in the time \non the budget bill. What was the game plan before this afternoon has \nclearly been altered. Now, we have tried to lay out a schedule of \namendments, as the chairman has just indicated. Next, we will go to \nSenator Inhofe.\n  Could Senator Inhofe give us a picture of how long he might require?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes. I respectfully say I can do mine in probably 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Then there may be some discussion on the Inhofe amendment \non this side. Then we would go to Senator Nelson. That would be in \napproximately 20 minutes, perhaps, for the information of Senators.\n  How long would Senator Nelson require?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. We will have a response, I presume. That is another 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Then we go to Senator Lott.\n  Maybe that helps, for the information of our colleagues, as we try to \ngo through this bill with some efficiency as we get toward the end of \nthis day. We will close, by prior agreement, at 8 o'clock.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, may I inquire? There are two \namendments that I will be offering in tandem. What is the procedure \nthat the Senators would like me to use in offering those amendments? \nThey deal with the same subject.\n  Mr. GREGG. I don't think the agreement reflected two amendments; it \nreflected one amendment. Let us take a look at it while the amendment \nof Senator Inhofe is going forward and see if we can work it out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent agreement is for one \namendment.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2355\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside for the purpose of considering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. INHOFE], for himself, and \n     Mr. Chambliss, proposes an amendment numbered 2355.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To cap non-defense, non-trust-fund, discretionary spending at \n       the previous fiscal year's level, beginning with FY 2007)\n\n       ``Beginning with fiscal year 2007 and thereafter, all non-\n     defense, non-trust-fund, discretionary spending shall not \n     exceed the previous fiscal year's levels, for purposes of the \n     congressional budget process (Section 302 et al. of the \n     congressional Budget Act of 1974), without a \\2/3\\ vote of \n     Members duly chosen and sworn.''\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I want to make a couple of observations. I \nhappen to be one of the very first Members of the Senate to go down \nafter Katrina to Louisiana and Mississippi. In fact, actually, we went \nall the way from New Orleans to Alabama in a helicopter. The \ndevastation that took place is incredible. It reminded me a little bit \nof the tornadoes we have seen in Oklahoma. The difference is a tornado \nnormally will affect about 5 square miles as opposed to a couple \nthousand square miles.\n  I certainly wouldn't want anything that I say to imply that we are \nnot deeply sympathetic to the problems of the people of Louisiana and \nMississippi, and to a lesser degree in Alabama. But I have to observe, \nas I have been listening to this debate, that you can always pour more \nmoney on a problem. This is something we have seen in government \nforever.\n  The Senator from Montana outlined a lot of things on which we need to \nspend more money, as did many others over here. You can always do that. \nI would question whether it is the Federal Government's responsibility \nto take care of everything that happens when a disaster occurs. We \ndidn't expect that in Oklahoma, and I don't think it should be \nexpected. For one thing, we couldn't do it.\n  The other day, there was an op-ed piece by the senior Senator from \nAlaska, Mr. Ted Stevens. He talked about the 1964 earthquake and the \ndevastation. He actually had to go out and repair his own house and do \na lot of this work, and not even 10 percent of that was taken care of \nby the Federal Government. We have a mindset now that somehow the \nFederal Government has deep enough pockets to take care of all of these \nproblems. Frankly, it is just not right.\n  It is not true. You can't have it. We are going to have to get a \nhandle on this thing, and I want to help.\n  I can say them in a relatively short period of time. I have been \nworking on a solution to this problem with an amendment for quite some \ntime. I have actually wanted to offer it previously on appropriations \nbills. But to do that, I would have to initiate a program of negating \nparagraph 4 of rule XVI of the rules. I don't think that is \nappropriate. It has been done three times in the last couple of weeks \nby three of the Democrat Senators. I don't criticize them for it, but I \nthink if I do this on the Republican side it would be the first time \nthat procedure would have been exercised, and it would not be \nappropriate.\n  Last Thursday or Friday, toward the end of the week, I had a colloquy \non the floor with Senator Frist, and we specifically discussed bringing \nup the amendment that I have in mind on the budget reconciliation bill. \nI am not\n\n[[Page S12115]]\n\nnaive. It could be that there will be a budget point of order against \nit. It doesn't really make any difference. We are going to get a vote \non this bill.\n  This is a very simple solution to a very complex problem. I \nunderstand a bill is going to be introduced which is going to eliminate \nall earmarks. That sounds real good. There is a big population out \nthere that thinks this is going to solve the problem. But it doesn't \nsolve the problem.\n  I mentioned this the other day when my junior Senator brought up a \nbill to do away with a bridge up in Alaska. I said: Look, you are \nlooking at something where one of the few things that really works well \nin Washington is the way we handle the Transportation bill. What we do \nis determine by a formula that no one thinks is fair. Because you \nalways want more in your own State, you take into consideration highway \nmortalities, the number of road miles, the donee status, and then you \ncome up with a formula. That formula will allocate to the States an \namount of money. This money, I might add, is money that has been paid \nin taxes at the pumps so that it goes to improving our transportation \nsystem. When you do this, if you send that to the States and they say, \nall right, you in the States determine the priorities that you have in \nthe State of Florida, or in the State of New Hampshire, what do you \nthink is the proper thing? That is either done by the elected \nrepresentatives or by the local people.\n  In my State of Oklahoma, we have the transportation commission with \neight commissioners in eight geographic areas of the State. They \nprioritize projects, and it is done very well.\n  With have earmarks to lock in these projects. That can be done, and \nthese decisions are made locally.\n  There is a mentality in Washington that if a decision is not made in \nWashington, it is not a good decision. It is a little bit arrogant to \nsay, Yes, the money has gone out to these States, but we in our wisdom \ndo not think it should be spent on those projects that they think it \nshould be spent on in this State--in this case, the State of Alaska, \nthe well-known bridge, so-called Bridge to Nowhere, when, in fact, that \nbridge was a bridge that was for economic development, according to the \nAlaska Department of Transportation. They said out of 100 projects, \nthat was No. 4 from the top because they want to develop that area and \nthey cannot develop the area because people cannot get to the area. I \nam not sure whether I agree with that, but I don't care; that was their \ndecision, not our decision in Washington to make.\n  If we were to pass a bill to eliminate all earmarks--it is not going \nto save money in the Transportation bill; almost all of that was below \nthe line in formulas--all it would say is if you eliminate that \nearmark, then you are going to have to go back and decide what you want \nto spend that money on. The money is not going to be saved. The money \nis going to still go to some projects, but we will have dictated that \nfrom Washington, DC. I am not saying this critically, because some of \nmy closest friends and good conservatives believe if you eliminate \nearmarks, you will resolve a problem. You are not going to resolve it.\n  But there is a way to do it. I have a very simple amendment that will \ndo that. The White House has been looking at ways to cut unnecessary \nspending. The White House, to their credit, proposed a package of $2.3 \nbillion in cuts. On October 24, 2005, Scott McClelland briefed the \npress regarding the White House's efforts, stating that certainly an \narea we have been looking at is rescinding spending increases, and \ncongressional leadership has been looking at this for a long time.\n  There is a simple solution to this. I have a one-sentence amendment \nthat I will offer to the reconciliation bill. A lot of people think you \nhave to get long and involved verbiage before you can do something \ngood. When I was in the House in 1994 on the issue that ended up being \nconsidered the greatest single reform in the history of the House of \nRepresentatives, that was my amendment. It was one sentence. You do not \nhave to have long, complicated sentences.\n  I will read the one sentence that is in this amendment. I know one of \nthe cosponsors of this is the Presiding Officer. It says:\n\n       Beginning with fiscal year 2007 and thereafter, all \n     nondefense nontrust fund discretionary spending shall not \n     exceed the previous fiscal year's levels without a two-thirds \n     vote.\n\n  Why a two-thirds vote? Something like Katrina comes along, something \nthat is unanticipated, sure, two-thirds of the people may decide we \nshould do something. That is not going to happen very often.\n  Let me be a little bit partisan because I have heard a statement--not \na misquote but certainly taken out of context--one of the Republican \nSenators saying that all Senators are big spenders; they are all big \nspenders equally.\n  Frankly, that just is not right. Yet we do have a solution to this \nproblem. I will show that spending is a partisan issue. This chart \nshows the Democrat amendments we have seen so far. I can update this. \nThe bottom line is that it is $530 billion--half a trillion--for these \nDemocrat amendments. They are from Senators Bingaman, Stabenow, Byrd, \nAkaka, Harkin, Kennedy, Dayton, Dorgan, Biden, Clinton. It goes on and \non. These are amendments that were offered. These are amendments that \nwere defeated--most of them. All the amendments were considered. If you \nadd up all those amendments by the Democrats in this Senate, that is \nwhat you get--half a trillion. If you carry that out to the end of a \n10-year period, it is over $1 trillion. Those are specific amendments \noffered.\n  We stood in the Senate a few minutes ago and listened to several \nSenators talk about how much more money we should be spending on these \nprograms. We are going to hear it. I am sure tonight and tomorrow we \nwill hear it. Nonetheless, that is a fact. My solution will not get \ninto entitlements. That will be addressed with reconciliation. There \nare other ways of doing that.\n  Of course, right now the defense spending will have to stay up \nbecause we went down in our defense spending during the 1990s. We have \nto rebuild the military. We all understand. I believed the primary top \nfunctions that should be performed by Government would be national \ndefense and infrastructure.\n  In the case of infrastructure, that is money people have paid. That \nis a moral issue. Most people believe that when they pay the high taxes \nat the pumps, somehow that will get into building roads and repairing \nroads. It should. Unfortunately, the highway trust fund has been \nrobbed. The aviation trust fund and other trust funds have been robbed. \nThey need to be kept intact.\n\n  However, this very simple solution is one that should pass this \nSenate. Because of a procedural vote, it might be a budget point of \norder and need 60 votes to pass. However, if you look at what many of \nmy colleagues on the Democrat side have said--Senator Biden said \nspecifically on more spending cuts:\n\n       If I had designed a deficit reduction plan, I would have \n     done it differently.\n\n  Senator Dorgan says that we need to provide spending cuts in a \nsignificant manner.\n  Senator Feingold says:\n\n       We also need to continue to cut spending in Federal \n     programs . . .\n\n  Senator Levin stated how we need to cut spending. The last thing he \nsays in the 1993 reconciliation, the same thing we are talking about \ntoday:\n\n       Discretionary spending is frozen for 5 years.\n\n  He advocated freezing discretionary spending. That is exactly what my \namendment does.\n  It says:\n\n       Beginning with fiscal year 2007 and thereafter, all \n     nondefense nontrust fund discretionary spending shall not \n     exceed the previous fiscal year's level without a two-thirds \n     of majority vote.\n\n  It is very simple, cut and dry, something that can pass. And there \nwill be a vote on this, whether it is a procedural vote or a vote on \nthe content. I hope those individuals who have a more complicated \napproach to this will recognize this is something that is doable.\n  I have had the unfortunate experience this year of trying to find \nevery bill that comes up that is over either the budget or last year's \nspending, and I have opposed that because this is the only way we will \nget this back in order.\n  I recognize this is a time when we are going to have deficits. The \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S12116]]\n\npeople understand that. We do know we had a rebuilding job to do in the \nmilitary. Then along came September 11, and we are in the middle of a \nwar. We have to prosecute this war. Then Katrina and some of the other \ndisasters have taken place. We recognize these are difficult times. \nThis is one area in discretionary spending that we can do something.\n  I look forward to getting a vote on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the chart the Senator has put up here \nlabeled ``Democrat spendometer'' is a complete fabrication, a total \nconcoction. That chart suggests Democrats have offered amendments \ncosting $460 billion this year. False. Absolutely false. I know the \nSenator has borrowed that chart from somebody else. He did not prepare \nthe chart, but he has used the chart, and the chart is wrong.\n  First, the ``spendometer'' ignores the fact that many of those \nDemocratic amendments were offset. In fact, because they included \nadditional deficit reduction, the net effect of all Democrat amendments \nto the 2006 budget resolution would have reduced deficits by $57 \nbillion. The ``spendometer'' double-counts Democratic amendments \nbecause it treats them as if they were a package instead of offered \nindividually.\n  Many of the Democratic amendments covered the same subject areas as \nan earlier amendment that was defeated and would never have been \noffered if the earlier amendment had been agreed to.\n  The ``spendometer'' also overstates the cost of Democratic amendments \nin the most egregious way--by transferring 1-year amendments into 5-\nyear amendments. That really strains credibility. To convert amendments \nthat were offered for 1 year on an appropriations bill and make them \ninto 5-year amendments in cost is a complete concoction.\n  The fact is, on the budget resolution, Democratic amendments would \nhave reduced the deficit by $57 billion; the net cost of Republican \namendments was $79 billion. They would have increased the deficit by \n$79 billion.\n  Our colleague says it is a partisan issue, spending. He is right. \nDuring the last Democratic administration, spending went down as a \nshare of gross domestic product. That is, the economists say, the best \nway to measure it. Spending went down each and every year during the \nlast Democratic administration, from 22 percent of gross domestic \nproduction down to 18.4 of gross domestic production. Democrats, when \nthey were in charge, cut spending.\n  Let's look at the Republican record. Here is what has happened under \nthe Bush administration. Each and every year, spending has gone up, \nwith one exception, of the time they have been in control. We went from \n18.4 percent the last year the Democrats were in control, and we are up \nto 20.2 percent of gross domestic production now that Republicans have \nbeen in control.\n  The story does not end there. The bottom line is what has happened to \nthe debt. When our Republican colleagues took over, the debt of the \ncountry was $5.7 trillion. They have increased the debt each and every \nyear by $500 or $600 billion. They have gone from $5.7 trillion this \nyear. The end of 2005, the debt was up to $7.9 trillion. Under the \nbudget that is before the Senate now, they will take the debt up to \nover $11 trillion. That is the record of our colleagues on the other \nside. They are in control. They control the House, they control the \nSenate, they control the White House, and they are leaving this country \na legacy of debt, debt, debt.\n  Here is the reality. When they came in and they took control of \neverything, the debt of this country was $5.7 trillion. Today, they \nhave increased it to $8 trillion. And this is, by the way, when the \nPresident said he was going to have maximum paydown of the debt. But \nlook where it is headed. Under the budget in the Senate now, they will \nraise the debt over the next 5 years to $11 trillion. This is \nunbelievable. They are approaching $6 trillion of added debt while they \nhave been in control, and they are out here claiming that we are the \nspenders. Hello? We are not in control. They are in control. They are \nthe ones running up the debt. They are the ones running up the debt.\n  It does not end there. The package they have that they claim is \ndeficit reduction is not deficit reduction. Read all the chapters of \nthe book before you reach a conclusion of what the message is. The \nmessage of our friends on the other side is debt on top of debt. The \nfirst chapter is the one we have before the Senate now that slices \nspending a little bit over 5 years. Then we come back, cut taxes more, \nand add to the deficit. But the third chapter is they will increase the \ndebt limit by $781 billion for 1 year alone. That brings their 4-year \ntotal to over $3 trillion of added debt. And the budget they have \nbefore the Senate, a 5-year budget--these are not my numbers, these are \ntheir numbers--they will run up the debt another $3 trillion.\n  Here is the bottom line: It took 42 Presidents 224 years to run up $1 \ntrillion of foreign-held debt. And this President in 4 years has \nexceeded what 42 Presidents over 224 years had done to the debt of this \ncountry.\n  If they want to start talking about deficits and debt, bring it on. \nTheir record is a record of deficits and debt unparalleled in the \nhistory of this Nation. Let me repeat, it took 42 Presidents 224 years \nto run up a trillion dollars in foreign holdings of U.S. debt. This \nPresident has more than doubled it in 4 years.\n\n  So I hope every time that ``spendometer'' chart comes out, they are \nprepared to listen to this speech all over again because that chart is \na complete concoction.\n  On the Inhofe amendment itself, the Budget Committee has never held a \nhearing on this amendment. This amendment from the Senator from \nOklahoma tries to decide the appropriate level of discretionary funding \nfor years to come; in fact, permanently. This amendment says that an \nincrease in funding over the previous year's level for nondefense, \nnontrust fund funding would be subject to a two-thirds vote point of \norder.\n  Just so our colleagues understand the upshot of this amendment--and I \nam certain it is well intended--this amendment would seek to freeze \nfunding for homeland security, for veterans health care, for education, \nfor the National Institutes of Health, and many more priorities, and \nnot just for 1 year, but permanently.\n  Is anybody listening? The Senator's amendment seeks to freeze funding \nfor the Department of Homeland Security, for veterans health care, for \neducation, for the National Institutes of Health, not for 1 year, but \npermanently. Permanently is a long time.\n  Sixty-six Senators could support increased funding for our veterans \nor for homeland security. But it would not be enough under this \namendment of the Senator from Oklahoma because he would freeze funding \nfor those functions permanently, unless you could get a two-thirds \nvote.\n  We have a point of order in the Congressional Budget Act under \nsection 306 for exactly this reason. This far-reaching change to our \nsystem of enforcing spending restraint should not be made without \nBudget Committee oversight. And it certainly should not be done as part \nof a fast-track vehicle with limited debate. This amendment clearly and \ncompletely violates section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act, and it \nis not germane. At the appropriate point, I will bring that budget \npoint of order.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. At this point, we have to go to Senator Nelson, unless \nSenator Inhofe has--\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes. I want to respond. I thought I had the floor.\n  Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: Do I have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from Oklahoma now has \nthe floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. All right. Well, let me do this. I think the Senator from \nGeorgia wants to make a comment. I would like to yield to him. Then I \nwould like to respond to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. President, I say, very quickly, I have been sitting here \nlistening to this debate with real interest. My friend from North \nDakota, who always makes good, strong, passionate arguments, first, \nfails to respond to the Democratic spendometer.\n\n[[Page S12117]]\n\n  All of those are Democratic amendments. Every one of them spends \nexactly the amount of money the Senator from Oklahoma said it spends. \nIt is half a billion dollars that would have been added to the deficit \nhad Republicans not defeated those amendments.\n  Secondly, I would say, I guess I get lost in this verbiage sometimes, \nbut here we are, this week, for the first time in 8 years, addressing \nthe issue of spending and trying to reduce spending that has already \nbeen committed. It has been a very difficult exercise. As the Senator \nfrom North Dakota knows, who serves on the committee I chair, we had a \ndifficult time in the Agriculture Committee coming up with some \nreasonable reductions in spending. Of course, while he did not vote for \nany of those reductions in spending, which is going to help the \ndeficit, some Democrats did. At the end of the day, we are going to \nsave $70 billion. We are going to reduce mandatory spending by $70 \nbillion.\n  So I think the Senator from North Dakota has made the argument for \nthe amendment the Senator from Oklahoma has authored by saying if we \nare serious about cutting spending, let's cut spending. This amendment \nis going to hold our feet to the fire. This amendment in and of itself \ndoes not reduce spending. But the Senator from North Dakota is right; \nno, it freezes spending. It says we are not going to spend any more \nmoney. But if two-thirds of the Members of the Senate say it is OK to \nspend it, then we will increase spending over the previous year.\n  That is a pretty dadgum good thought and a novel thought, and I \napplaud the Senator from Oklahoma for coming up with that. Because if \ntwo-thirds of us agree we ought to spend more money, it is probably the \nright thing to do. But if two-thirds of us do not agree to do it, then \nit is probably not the right thing to do.\n  So I think the Senator from North Dakota makes the argument for the \namendment of the Senator from Oklahoma. I urge an affirmative vote on \nit at the appropriate time.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I believe I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, would you like me to \nyield time to you? I am trying to finish this.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I get a little tired of people on the \nother side of the aisle making the point that tax cuts are responsible \nfor the deficit we have, when you consider we inherited a recession \nfrom the previous administration, and we had September 11, and because \nof the catastrophe of September 11, income to our Federal Treasury went \ndown from $2.1 trillion to $1.75 trillion. That went on over a period \nof 3 years before the economy turned around.\n  Then, to find fault with the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, a person no \nless than Chairman Greenspan said those tax cuts were what turned this \neconomy around. And turning the economy around, we have $274 billion \nmore coming into the Federal Treasury in the year 2005 than we did in \n2004.\n  And then, especially when you measure deficits by gross national \nproduct, our deficit now is less than it was in 1993 under Clinton. Our \ndeficit now is less than it was under Reagan in 1982, and a lot less in \nthe case of 1982.\n  Now, what I rise for is this: the justification that was made this \nmorning that we are having this reconciliation bill, cutting \nexpenditures, so we can cut taxes. We are not going to cut taxes any \nmore. We have done that in 2001 and 2003. That tax policy is what \nturned this economy around and brought in $274 billion more this year \nthan last year, even $70 billion more in the last 10 months than we \nestimated back in February would come in this year.\n  But the case the other side is making that we want to have further \ntax cuts--if we take no action, what they want to do is have an \nautomatic tax increase. We have a lot of tax provisions that are going \nto sunset this year. If we do not keep tax policy the way it is, we are \ngoing to have a tax increase.\n  Now, they like to have more money coming in so they have more money \nto spend. I would like to have somebody on the other side of the aisle \ntell me how high taxes have to be to be high enough to satisfy their \nappetite to spend money. I have never heard that. But the fact is, they \ncan have a tax increase and not even have to vote for it. So we have to \ntake action between now and the end of the year to make sure the \nexisting tax policy, that was good for the economy, keeps this economy \ngoing, as Chairman Greenspan has given those tax cuts credit for where \nwe are.\n  I want to tell my colleagues what is going to happen if we do not \ntake action before the end of the year to continue the tax policies \nthat would otherwise sunset, that somehow they do not want us to \ncontinue.\n  Our objective is to preserve current levels of tax relief. These tax \nincreases would occur if my friends on the other side of the aisle--and \nmaybe even an occasional Republican or two--have their way and thwart \nthe reconciliation bill in the process.\n  First, the tax relief plan continues the hold harmless provision of \nthe alternative minimum income tax. This piece of the plan, the \nlargest, I might add, is worth about $30 billion to 14 million American \nfamilies. You can see by this chart, if we do not take action, we are \ngoing to have about 5 million middle-income taxpayers paying more taxes \nnext year because they will get hit by the alternative minimum income \ntax.\n  I want to remind everybody that the alternative minimum income tax \nwas meant to hit the very wealthy, who were taking advantage of every \ntax loophole they could and not paying any tax, that they ought to pay \nsomething. But it was never meant to hit middle-income America.\n  We are going to have in my State of Iowa 65,000 more Iowans pay tax \nthey were never supposed to pay if we do not take action between now \nand December 31.\n  Look at all the places where I wish I could think of all the people \nwho have been complaining the most about what we are talking about. But \nthe point is--North Dakota, for instance, I think it ought to be pretty \nobvious. Do you want 13,364 North Dakotans to pay additional tax if we \ndo not take action before the end of the year?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Well, I am glad to hear that. But I have heard \ndifferent rhetoric from the other side. And Michigan is here, if I can \nfind Michigan. We ought to put things in alphabetical order, but it \ndoes not matter. It does not matter. You are going to have tens of \nthousands of people or hundreds of thousands of people paying \nadditional tax if we do not take action.\n  Now, that is just one provision.\n  We reduce the capital gains from 20 percent down to 15 percent, and \nwe have been told that is already figured into the stock market. Do we \nwant to let the middle-income taxpayers pay a higher capital gains tax? \nI do not think so, because there are so many middle-income people now \nwho are investing through their IRAs, through their 401(k)s, that we do \nnot want them to be hit by this.\n  We have the tax deductibility of college tuition. We have the small \nsavers credit. We have the small business expensing provisions that are \ngoing to sunset at the end of the year.\n  All of these provisions have been bipartisan. Millions of American \ntaxpayers rely on these provisions. Do my friends want to take away the \ndeductibility of college tuition for middle-income Americans that is \ncapped at $60,000? These people who are sending their kids to college \nought to have, beyond December 31 of this year, the ability of taking \nadvantage of that deduction.\n  We have the small savers credit. Do my friends want to take away the \nexpensing of equipment for small business? I don't think so. But they \nwould lead you to believe that we want to cut taxes for the rich. The \nplan addresses expiring business and individual provisions that we call \nextenders. These provisions include the research and development tax \ncredit, State sales tax deductibility, and the deductibility of \nteachers' out-of-pocket expenses. Do the people who say we are going to \ngive tax cuts to the wealthy consider our teachers, who pay out-of-\npocket expenses for the classroom, that they\n\n[[Page S12118]]\n\nought to not have the tax deductibility for that? That is going to end \nDecember 31.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I believe the pending amendment is the Inhofe amendment. \nIf I may beg the indulgence of the Senator from Iowa, if I could go \nahead and conclude my remarks on my amendment and respond to the \nSenator from North Dakota, he could go back on the reconciliation bill \nand finish his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma may reclaim the time \nthat he yielded the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I don't want to do it unless the Senator from Iowa \nagrees, because his remarks are excellent. If I could finish, it would \nbe a matter of a couple minutes, and then you could get back on the \nreconciliation bill, if that would be acceptable to the Senator from \nIowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Go ahead. You interfered with me. Go ahead.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me go ahead and conclude.\n  First, I have a great deal of respect for the Senator from North \nDakota, but I disagree with him. Let me point out a couple of things \nthat I believe are not correct.\n  The Senator from North Dakota said a lot of these amendments were \ndealing with the same thing. They are not. If you look at them, each \none has a subject matter. They are not dealing with the same thing. \nSecondly, he said they are offset. I would ask the Senator from North \nDakota if he can name one that is offset. You can't because these are \nnot offset. The budget analysts said all of these were not offset \namendments. They were amendments that were offered, and they were \noffered by Democrats. And when you add up all the money that is in \nthese amendments that they have offered--I believe most of these were \nrejected--it would have been an additional half-trillion dollars. It is \nvery clear they are offered by the Democratic Senators.\n  I started off my remarks by saying we are in a unique situation now. \nFortunately, the recession is behind us now. That is not a factor. But \nthis President had to rebuild a military. Then 9/11 came. He had to get \ninvolved in a war. Then we had a couple of disasters that were almost \nunprecedented. I said at the beginning of my remarks, this is not \nsomething we can handle in 1 year or even maybe 2 years. But \nnonetheless, we have to do something specific to get into this thing \nand to get this thing done, and there is a way of doing it without \noverly complicating it. That is my amendment.\n  I would like to also respond to the Senator from North Dakota in his \nstatement about tax cuts. I agree with the Senator from Iowa; they say \nover and over again that we want to have tax cuts, as if you are \ncutting revenues when this happens. There was a very great President of \nthe United States that was elected in 1960. His name was John Kennedy. \nJohn Kennedy, in 1962, said--and these are his exact words; I don't \nhave to read it because I memorized it: We have serious problems in \nthis country. We are going to have to increase revenue. If you want to \nincrease revenue, then you have to reduce marginal rates, and that will \nhappen. He reduced marginal rates and, sure enough, the revenues did \nincrease.\n  Then along came President Reagan in 1980. President Reagan started \nthe 8-year period that had the greatest marginal rate tax cuts of any \n8-year period in the history of America. If you take the total amount \nof money and add up the marginal tax rates in 1980, it was $244 \nbillion. In 1990, it was $466 billion and almost doubled in that decade \nthat was the greatest number of tax cuts in the history of this \ncountry. I know Democrats don't like to cut taxes. But you can increase \nrevenue by cutting taxes, we have proven over and over again. It \nhappened after World War I. It happened during the Kennedy \nadministration. It happened during the Reagan administration, and it \nhas already happened during the Bush 2 administration.\n  We can sit around and talk about these things. The bottom line is, if \nwe want to do something about it, there is going to be a vote. You will \nhave a chance to register your belief as to whether or not you want to \ndo something about the deficit. It has already been suggested there \nwill be a budget point of order. That is fine with me. That means there \nhas to be 60, instead of a majority, to get it passed. At least at that \ntime, when that vote takes place, the American people will know who in \nthis Chamber is serious about reducing the deficit, about cutting \nspending.\n  With that, Mr. President, that is the argument I make on my \namendment. I look forward to getting a vote at the appropriate time, \nwhether it is a vote on my amendment or a vote on a budget point of \norder.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the very able Senator from Oklahoma has \nasked me for a list of the amendments that were offered on the \nDemocratic side that were offset. He asked me to name one.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Up here.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, from that list. I won't name one. I will name 10. \nThe Bingaman amendment on education, completely and totally offset; the \nStabenow amendment on first responders, completely and totally offset; \nthe Byrd amendment on Amtrak, completely offset; the Akaka amendment on \nveterans, completely offset; the Harkin amendment on education, \ncompletely offset; the Kennedy amendment on education, completely \noffset; the Dayton amendment on IDEA, completely offset; the Dorgan \namendment on tribal programs, completely paid for; the Biden amendment \non COPS, completely paid for; the Byrd amendment on transit highway, \ncompletely paid for, offset.\n  That chart is a total and complete concoction and fabrication. These \nare budget resolution matters I have talked about where the combined \neffect of Democratic amendments was to reduce the deficit $57 billion \nbecause they were offset.\n  In addition, what that chart does is, it takes on appropriations \nbills amendments that were offered for 1 year, and our friends on this \nchart have multiplied them into 5-year amendments. They weren't 5-year \namendments. They were 1-year amendments. Appropriations bills are for 1 \nyear, not for 5 years. They have taken them and multiplied them by 5. \nThat is false.\n  Beyond that, those amendments were not offered as a package. They \nwere offered individually. So they would offer an amendment. The \namendment was defeated. The money was still available for a different \namendment. To then add them up and multiply it by 5 and forget about \nthe offsets and put out a chart here on the Senate floor that suggests \nthat is a fair representation is way beyond the pale.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield? First of all, I did yield the \nfloor. I don't have the floor anymore. But I am not going to be able to \nstay. I would like to respond to some of the things you have said as \nyou progressed further. Would you yield to allow me to do so?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate that very much. First of all, I have been \ntold by the budget analysts that, in fact, they were not offset. Some \nof them proposed tax increases. You could call that an offset. I don't. \nThat is increasing taxes to do it.\n  We are getting off center from the purpose of my amendment. My \namendment does something specifically that you can't argue against. You \nare either for or against it. As I look at these, these are specific \namendments. It shows the amount, what the amendment does, and the years \nthat would be affected. So it is true that that would be over a 5-year \nperiod because that is what the amendment was for. But if you take that \non to the end of it----\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. You are yielding to me. Let me finish here. It would \nactually be over $1 trillion, if you carried it out to the end of a 10-\nyear period. I understand what you are saying about 1 year, and that is \nfine.\n  Mr. CONRAD. There is no merit to that chart. There just isn't.\n  Mr. INHOFE. These are all specific amendments.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have the floor now, Senator. Let's be factual here. \nThat chart is a complete concoction. That is all there is to it. That \ntakes amendments that were offered for 1 year, multiplies them by 5, \ndoesn't count the\n\n[[Page S12119]]\n\noffsets. In the budget resolution, we offset our amendments. We paid \nfor them. That is an offset. When you pay for things around here, that \nis an offset. I know that is a new idea around here, but that is what \nwe are offering in our amendment, pay-go. We say, you can have new tax \ncuts. The Senator from Iowa says, we are going to kill all the tax \ncuts. No, we are saying if you want more tax cuts, you have to pay for \nit. If you want more spending, you have to pay for it. That is what \npay-go is about. That is what Democrats have offered in this fight. We \nhave offered the pay-go amendment. It used to be in place. We used to \nhave it. We used to have that authority. We used to have that budget \ndiscipline. If you want to have new tax cuts, pay for them. If you want \nnew spending, pay for it.\n  In addition to the fact that I listed 10 amendments that were offset \nthat don't show up on their chart as offset, that chart is false on \nevery single one of those amendments. In addition to that, they have \ntaken 1-year appropriations amendments and multiplied them into 5-year \namendments. Please, those weren't our amendments. Those are a \nconcoction of what our amendments were.\n  I hate to say this, but our friends have lost sight of the fact that \nthey are in control. These deficits and debt didn't skyrocket under our \nwatch. Our friends control the White House. They control the Senate. \nThey control the House of Representatives. They have since 2000. And \nthe debt of the country has gone up from $5.7 trillion to $7.9 \ntrillion. And under the budget that is being considered--and this \nlegislation is part of that package--it is going to go up to $11 \ntrillion.\n  They have raised the debt of this country in 6 years by almost $6 \ntrillion. It wasn't Democratic spending because your side has been in \ncontrol. Every dime of this spending occurred on your watch. Every dime \nof this increase in debt is your responsibility. These have been your \nbudgets. These have been your plans. These are your deficits and your \ndebt. You have stacked it up on the American people. I repeat: It took \n42 Presidents, 224 years to run up a trillion dollars of external debt, \ndebt held by foreign countries, foreign investors. This President has \nexceeded it, exceeded a trillion dollars of additional external debt, \ndebt held by foreigners. This President exceeded it in 4 years.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will not. What has been added to the debt of this \ncountry will weigh us down for years to come, and this is debt added by \nour friends on this side of the aisle. Every dollar of spending that \nhas occurred has been spending that they voted for, that they \nsupported.\n  I now yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Michigan off the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague and esteemed \nleader, our ranking member on the Budget Committee.\n  I rise this evening to oppose the amendment of my friend from \nOklahoma, as well as the entire budget resolution that is in front of \nus.\n  Together, America can do better than this budget and this amendment. \nBasically, what the amendment is saying is, if we want to invest in \neducation so every child has the opportunity to succeed in America, we \nwish to create greater opportunity, it would take 67 votes. If we want \nto provide another tax cut for those most blessed in this country, \nthose doing most well, the best of anyone in terms of their financial \nsituation, that would take 51 votes. If we want to invest in science \nand new cures for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and diabetes, it would \ntake 67 votes. If we wish to give to those most blessed with resources \nin our country a tax cut, it would take 51 votes.\n  That is the wrong set of priorities for our country. I support tax \ncuts certainly. I sponsored and worked with colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to add a new tax cut for manufacturers so if they create jobs \nin the United States they have a lower tax rate than if the jobs and \nbusiness go overseas. Certainly, we agree together that the alternative \nminimum tax needs to be fixed so middle-class families are not impacted \nby something that was put into play to affect only those who are the \nmost wealthy from avoiding all taxes.\n  We could go down the list of things that we support on a bipartisan \nbasis. But where we differ is where we have gone in this country under \na failed set of values and priorities.\n  And this amendment only makes that worse. We can do better than that. \nOur Nation's budget is designed to reflect the values and priorities of \nour great country. It is essentially our country's values document. I \nbelieve this budget does not honor our Nation's values, and it has the \nwrong priorities for our country.\n  I believe this amendment does the same, again, saying if we wish to \ninvest in the health of the country, if we wish to help manufacturers \nwho, in my great State, desperately need our help by changing the way \nwe finance health care in this country, that would take 67 votes. But \nif we wish, instead, to provide another round of tax cuts to those who \nare most blessed in this country, that takes 51 votes. That is the \nwrong set of values and the wrong set of priorities, and we can do \nbetter than that in America.\n  As Americans, we believe we should leave a better future for our \nchildren and our grandchildren. The American people expect us to make \ntough choices, just like they do around their kitchen tables every day, \ntrying to balance the budget. In my home State people are not sure if \nthey are going to have a job, what the pay is going to be, are they \ngoing to have their pension, are they going to have to pay more for \nhealth care. They are having to make the toughest decisions every day. \nThey expect us to be responsible and make the tough decisions we need \nto make.\n  We do this because we don't want our children to have to pay for our \ndebts. That is why we make tough decisions. Parents across the country \nwork hard enough to build a nest egg for their children so they can \nhave a better life than we have had as their parents. We want that. My \ngreat concern is that we are losing that for our children. I believe we \nare in a fight for our way of life in this country and nothing less. \nAnd the budget documents in front of us only make that worse, only add \nto the race to the bottom too many of our families are feeling.\n  This budget we are considering in two separate reconciliation bills \nwill actually increase the deficit, not reduce it--increase it by $31 \nbillion. America expects us to do better than that. Most Americans \nmight wonder why are we increasing the deficit when we already have the \nlargest deficit in the history of the country. We are fighting wars in \nAfghanistan and Iraq, and we must help to pay for the rebuilding of the \ngulf coast for all of those who have lost so much. Since 2001 when we \nhad the largest surplus in history, we have taken a fiscal U-turn, and \nnow we have the largest deficit in history, putting us back in the days \nof gloomy fiscal policies in the 1980s and early 1990s.\n  It is important to know there was a choice at that point, as our \nleader and our side of the aisle has indicated. When I started in the \nBudget Committee in 2001, we had the largest budget surplus in the \nhistory of the country. We had two choices. We could do what we were \nproposing at the time: take a third of that for stimulating investment \nin jobs, take a third of that in tax cuts to spur the economy, a third \nof that for strategic investments to spur the economy through \neducation, innovation, to also spur the economy, and a third of that we \nwanted to put aside to pay down the debt and to keep Social Security \nsecure. Instead, what happened. Our Republican colleagues rejected our \napproach, and now we have the largest deficits in the Nation's history \ndue to the fact that all of it was put into a supply-side economics tax \ncut geared to the wealthiest among us at the expense of all of the rest \nof America.\n  Mr. President, these deficits are not free lunches. We have to pay \nthem year by year. And how are we paying for them? Well, we are \nborrowing billions of dollars from Japan and China. Right now, Japan \nand China hold almost $1 trillion, $1 trillion of our national debt. \nAnd it is growing each and every year. Not only do taxpayers have to \npay interest to China and Japan, our Government has refused to crack \ndown on unfair trade practices with these two countries because we are \nso far in debt to them. I can tell you, coming from the great State of \nMichigan, our administration's unwillingness to crack\n\n[[Page S12120]]\n\ndown on trade violations, currency manipulation, counterfeit auto \nparts, and stealing our patents has had a profound impact on our losing \njobs in Michigan. They are all related because of our policies in terms \nof the national debt affecting our inability to, in fact, enforce trade \nviolations.\n  We can do better than that. Together, America can do better than \nthis. We can get our fiscal house in order and get tough with our \ntrading partners who are not playing by the rules. The reconciliation \nbill, unfortunately, though, will hurt working families in Michigan. \nFor seniors who have worked hard their entire lives, they will see \ntheir most basic services cut. For some working single-parent families, \nthey will see their health insurance cut. For hard-working family \nfarmers, their livelihoods will be put in jeopardy.\n  With so many working families losing health insurance or paying more \nfor less, is this a good time to be cutting Medicare and Medicaid, our \nNation's health insurance programs for seniors and children? We can do \nbetter than that.\n\n  Also, given all the economic problems hurting our rural communities, \nincluding a terrible drought in Michigan, is this a good time to cut \nprograms that help our farmers? Is now the time to force farmers who \nare struggling into bankruptcy? We can do better that.\n  This budget's priorities are so different than those of Michigan \nfamilies. Michigan families want us to fight for good-paying jobs, for \naffordable health care, and for a secure pension. In essence, they want \nus to fight to preserve their way of life, the middle class of our \ncountry, where they can raise their kids, send them to college, get \nquality health care, retire with dignity after 30 or 40 years of hard \nwork, and know that pension is going to be there along with Social \nSecurity.\n  Mr. President, America can do better than this document and this \namendment. If we make the right budget choices, we can expand health \ninsurance for working families and lower costs. We can create jobs, \nprotect pensions, bring down the deficit if we make better budget \nchoices.\n  As my colleagues know, our Nation's largest auto parts manufacturer, \nDelphi, declared bankruptcy 3 weeks ago, threatening 13,000 jobs in \nMichigan and 35,000 jobs nationwide. Its workers may not only lose \ntheir jobs, they will lose their health care and their pension; in \nother words, everything they have worked for for their entire lives, \neverything they have earned, everything they are counting on for \nthemselves and their families. Tragically, this budget package does \nnothing for them. It increases the deficit, which hurts our economy, \ngives Japan and China the upper hand in trade negotiations, cuts health \ncare, and does nothing to protect people. That is why I intend to vote \nno on this budget and on the amendment. I will continue to fight for \nMichigan's families who are struggling every single day, and I believe \nit is not just Michigan families struggling now but American families \nall across our great country.\n  I worry about whether their way of life is going to continue to \nexist. They want a change. They know we can do better than this.\n  They know this budget debate really is a proxy for a larger \nphilosophical debate, a larger choice on values and priorities.\n  The Republican approach to governing is that you are on your own--no \nmatter what the issue.\n  We believe that all families need jobs, health care, quality schools \nand a secure pension.\n  The Republican approach is that you are on your own.\n  If you lose your job, you are on your own. If your Medicare premiums \nrise 13 percent, you are on your own. If your schools are not \nperforming well, you get a school voucher. And if your pension is \nthreatened, you can try to get some of it back from the PBGC.\n  Mr. President, America can do better. Together, we can create good \njobs, maintain our middle class way of life and get our country back on \ntrack.\n  But this budget will take us in the wrong direction.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think the time has expired on our side. \nI am prepared to yield back. Things are getting a little redundant. I \nstand by this chart. I have a friendly disagreement with my good friend \nfrom North Dakota. I do agree that there are some offsets with tax \nincreases. I do not consider that something that we should be \nembracing. There are still spending increases, budget increases, and we \nneed to do something about it now.\n  I would say this: If the reverse were true, and if all of the \namendments to increase the deficit came from the Republican side, I \nwould still introduce this amendment.\n  I am going to yield back so that my friend from Florida can take up \nhis amendment because he is next in line. But I would say this: Even if \nit were done on this side of the aisle as opposed to that side of the \naisle, I would still say we have to do something for my 12 grandkids, \nand that is really get a handle on this.\n  My amendment is good. There are all kinds of people endorsing it. The \nNational Taxpayer's Union is supporting my amendment. I am going to \nread it one more time and then I am going to yield back the remainder \nof my time and there will be a vote on it.\n\n       Beginning with fiscal year 2007 and thereafter, all \n     nondefense, non-trust-fund, discretionary spending shall not \n     exceed the previous fiscal year's levels . . . without a two-\n     thirds vote of Members duly chosen and sworn.\n\n  With that I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand now we go to Senator Nelson's amendment. I \nunderstand he needs about 10 minutes. I would suggest that Senator \nNelson have until 5 of 8. We are going to wrap up at 8. And then I have \nthe 5 minutes from 7:55 to 8 o'clock to respond to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, I don't want to get frozen \nout of this time situation. If the Senator is saying that----\n  Mr. GREGG. We are giving your side 12 minutes, and I am getting 5 \nminutes. It does not sound to me that you are getting frozen out.\n  Mr. CONRAD. This Senator may be frozen out, and this Senator is going \nto object unless he is not frozen out. I am happy to go to Senator \nNelson. Why don't we let him go and then see where we stand at the end. \nBut I am not going to enter into an agreement that would not permit me \nto answer if I felt something required an answer.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2357\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson], for himself and Mr. \n     Kerry, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Kennedy, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2357.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To hold Medicare beneficiaries harmless for the increase in \n  the 2007 Medicare monthly part B premium that would otherwise occur \n   because of the 2006 increase in payments under the physician fee \n                               schedule)\n\n       On page 268, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       (d) Premium Transition Rule.--\n       (1) 2006.--\n       (A) Premium.--Nothing in this section shall be construed as \n     modifying the premium previously computed under section 1839 \n     of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395r) for months in \n     2006.\n       (B) Government contribution.--In computing the amount of \n     the Government contribution under section 1844(a) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w(a)) for months in 2006, \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall compute and \n     apply a new actuarially adequate rate per enrollee age 65 and \n     over under section 1839(a)(1) of such Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395r(a)(1)) taking into account the provisions of this \n     section.\n       (2) 2007.--\n       (A) Premium.--The monthly premium under section 1839 of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395r) for months in 2007 \n     shall be computed as if this section had not been enacted.\n       (B) Government contribution.--The Government contribution \n     under section 1844(a) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395w(a)) for months in 2007 shall be computed taking into \n     account the provisions of this section, including \n     subparagraph (A).\n\n[[Page S12121]]\n\n       (e) Extension of Prescription Drug Discounts to Enrollees \n     of Medicaid Managed Care Organizations.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 1903(m)(2)(A) (42 U.S.C. \n     1396b(m)(2)(A)) is amended--\n       (A) in clause (xi), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (B) in clause (xii), by striking the period at the end and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(xiii) such contract provides that payment for covered \n     outpatient drugs dispensed to individuals eligible for \n     medical assistance who are enrolled with the entity shall be \n     subject to the same rebate agreement entered into under \n     section 1927 as the State is subject to and that the State \n     shall have the option of collecting rebates for the \n     dispensing of such drugs by the entity directly from \n     manufacturers or allowing the entity to collect such rebates \n     from manufacturers in exchange for a reduction in the prepaid \n     payments made to the entity for the enrollment of such \n     individuals.''.\n       (2) Conforming amendment.--Section 1927(j)(1) (42 U.S.C. \n     1396r-8(j)91)) is amended by inserting ``other than for \n     purposes of collection of rebates for the dispensing of such \n     drugs in accordance with the provisions of a contract under \n     section 1903(m) that meets the requirements of paragraph \n     (2)(A)(xiii) of that section'' before the period.\n       (3) Effective date.--The amendments made by this subsection \n     take effect on the date of enactment of this Act and apply to \n     rebate agreements entered into or renewed under section 1927 \n     of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396r-8) on or after \n     such date.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we reach a major watershed \npoint now as we consider the budget, for contained in this budget is an \nincrease of $1 billion required of senior citizens in the payment of \ntheir Medicare Part B premiums. This amendment that I am proposing cuts \nout that increase and offsets it. I am pleased to be joined by a number \nof colleagues who have cosponsored this amendment. Senator Kerry had \nwanted to speak on it, and it is my understanding that he is not here \nat this late hour, but he may speak later.\n  This is an amendment to protect seniors from these drastic increases \nin their Medicare Part B monthly premiums.\n  I thank all the Senators who have worked with me on this amendment. \nWhat our senior citizens are facing is when they pay a monthly premium, \nwhen they enroll in the Part B premium, that premium covers physician \ncare, home health care, skilled nursing services, physical therapy, and \nother services. There are 42 million people in this country who are \nMedicare beneficiaries. Three million of them are in Florida. They are \nlegitimately concerned about the growing out-of-pocket health care \nexpenses. Why should they be? Let's look at history.\n  Over the past 3 years, the part B beneficiary premium has increased \n50 percent. In 2006, the premium will increase by another 13 percent, \nto $88.50 per month. That represents a $10.30 increase over last year's \nmonthly premium.\n  Our seniors simply cannot afford another premium increase on their \nfixed incomes. If anybody doubts what I am saying, remember gasoline \nused to be $1.50. Gasoline has approached $3. We have senior citizens \nin my State and all of the States who cannot afford to drive to the \ndoctor anymore because they are on a fixed income. And now this bill \nwould tack on an additional billion dollars more in Part B premiums.\n  This Senator does not believe that at this particular time seniors \nshould bear this burden of another billion dollars in spending out of \ntheir pockets. I believe we should and I believe we can fix the \nphysician payment rate without increasing the Part B premiums.\n  Another part of this reconciliation bill gives physicians a 1-percent \npayment update in 2006. This would avert what would be very unfortunate \nfor physicians--a 4.3-percent cut under the sustainable growth rate \nformula used to update physician payments. I have supported and I \ncontinue to support improving the reimbursement rates for Medicare \nproviders, including physicians. Without action in this area, we are \ngoing to continue to see individuals and communities underserved \nbecause no quality providers, including physicians, are going to be \navailable to offer these services if they keep getting cut.\n  However, when the cost of physician care goes up, the Medicare Part B \npremium under the law must rise to cover it. Any change Congress makes \nto increase physician payment rates under reconciliation will be \nreflected in a beneficiary premium for senior citizens for Medicare \nPart B in 2007.\n  Under the current law, if the physicians are going to get the \nincrease instead of a cut, that means that in order to pay that under \nthe current law, the senior citizens are going to have to increase \ntheir Part B Medicare premium payments by approximately $1 billion. In \nresponse, what we are offering to do in this amendment is protect our \nseniors, for this amendment would exclude from the Part B premium the \ncost of the reconciliation package payment increase for physicians. \nSenior citizens would be held harmless from the effect of the \nreconciliation package and would, therefore, not see an increase in \ntheir premiums due to this physician fix, and it is going to keep the \nphysician fix in place by increasing their reimbursements.\n  This amendment is revenue neutral. How is it paid for? Where is the \noffset? It is paid for by negotiating lower prescription drug prices \nfor Medicaid's HMOs. This amendment would help to ease the financial \nburden on our parents and grandparents without harming the physicians \nwho serve them.\n  We have to look out for these grandparents and parents who are on \nfixed incomes. I hope we are going to get some bipartisan support. I \nurge all of our colleagues to join me in this effort to protect our \nNation's senior citizens.\n  Mr. President, I have been waiting for quite a while to offer this \namendment. I said that I was going to be less than 10 minutes. I am \nhappy to conclude in less than 10 minutes, but the import of this \namendment is far beyond the time I have used to offer the amendment \ntonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first, I appreciate the Senator from \nFlorida being concise in presenting this amendment. I thank him for \nthat and for sticking with the time as was represented. It was \nappropriate and generous of him.\n  The amendment, obviously, has an impact on the deficit. It would \nexpand it. As a practical matter, it really has to be put in the \ncontext of the overall Medicare adjustments in this bill and in other \nbills because under the new drug program, seniors will actually see a \nsignificant discount. They will save about $5 on their prescription \ndrugs over what was expected.\n  The Part B premium increase which will occur as a result of this bill \nwill be $1.60. It seems more than reasonable to have structured an \nagreement where we will essentially allow patients to see doctors \nbecause we will be giving them the opportunity to see doctors because \nthe doctors will actually participate in the system, whereas they might \nwell opt out if we cut their pay by 4.3 percent.\n  Under this bill, of course, we avoid that because the Finance \nCommittee has put together a package which allows us to basically hold \ndoctors harmless. It is reasonable that seniors--we are not talking \nabout low-income seniors here because their entire Part B premium is \npicked up by the Government. We are talking about middle and high \nincome. Not to pick anybody specific, but Bill Gates's father, who is \nprobably doing very well, or my mother, for example, has a right to the \nPart B premium and, therefore, is subsidized by working Americans, \npeople who are in day-to-day jobs, to the tune of 75 percent. It is \nreasonable that we ask seniors to participate in the Part B premium, as \nthey get the benefit of it, to the extent of 25 percent. This bill \nsimply continues that process while making sure seniors will have \naccess to doctors by basically supporting the initiatives of holding \ndoctors harmless from a pay cut.\n  The underlying bill has some very positive spending initiatives, and \none of them happens to be giving more access to more patients who are \nunder Medicare. So I believe we should be supporting this amendment \nrather than offering amendments which will essentially undermine this \neffort.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on this \npoint?\n  Mr. GREGG. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I will put it in the form of a question. Will \nthe Senator be surprised to know that instead of it being $1.80, it is \nmore like a $3-\n\n[[Page S12122]]\n\nper-month increase in the Part B premium for seniors, on top of the 18-\npercent increase that is, in fact, going to be added just in this \npresent year?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would be surprised to know that because, as I understand \nit from staff, the estimate, as by CMS, is $1.68. But I guess we can \nturn to the record and find that out. You may be right, CMS may be \nright.\n  In any event, the number seems to be reasonable in the context of the \nbenefit being received, which is seniors are being asked to pay for 25 \npercent of the Part B, which is not a great deal compared to what \nAmericans who are working are being asked to pay, which is 75 percent \nof that.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. GREGG. Certainly.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Given the fact that there are 42 million \nseniors who would be affected, would the Senator be surprised to know \nthat this is a total of $1 billion that will come out of the pockets of \nseniors by the increased Medicare Part B premiums?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would presume the seniors are going to have to pay some \nof the cost of the Part B premium. As I said before, they are paying 25 \npercent of it. As I note, working Americans are being asked to pay tens \nof billions of dollars to support that benefit. In many instances, \nseniors who are receiving the benefits are moderate- and high-income \nseniors who have higher incomes than those working Americans who are \nworking at a restaurant as servers or who are working on a factory line \nor working at a garage or who are working in maybe even a minimum wage \njob and are being asked to bear the burden of the HI insurance costs.\n  So it does seem reasonable and I think most seniors view it as \nreasonable that they pay 25 percent of the cost of their Part B \npremium. Yes, that adds up, if you take all the seniors in America--\nthere are a lot of them--to a fairly significant number. So I would \nagree with that.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield for a final question?\n  Mr. GREGG. I will yield for a final question.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Since this Senator was disciplined in his \ncomments as promised, would the Senator be surprised that this \namendment causes no increase in the Part B premium to senior citizens \nby offsetting what would be the enhanced payment to drug companies \nunder the Medicaid increase that is going to the drug companies when \nthey go over to HMOs from the current law that holds the drug companies \nto a discounted rate?\n  Mr. GREGG. In response to the Senator, the practical effect of what \nthe Senator is proposing is to change a contractual agreement which the \ndrug companies have already entered into. The basic effect of that \nwould mean probably you would have fewer people willing to participate \nin the system and, as a result, seniors would have fewer choices. And I \nsuspect that the practical effect, if the Senator's amendment were to \ngo forward, is that the seniors would have fewer choices.\n  One of the few advantages of the Part D program, which I still am not \nall that enamored of, is that it is giving seniors a variety of choices \nin their drug benefit. As seniors become more educated as to what those \noptions are, they are going to be impressed that there are so many \noptions on the table, and they can tailor their pharmaceutical needs to \nthe options available to them. If you change the contractual agreements \nwhich encourage people to offer that type of opportunity, you obviously \nare going to undermine the number of options that would be available, \nin my opinion.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this bill includes a 1.0 percent payment \nupdate to physicians for 2006. This was done to maintain beneficiary \naccess to physician services. After all what good are Medicare benefits \nif you can't get in to see a doctor.\n  Within the bill, the impact on the part B premium is calculated based \non all the provisions that affect Part B. This amendment would only \nhold the beneficiary harmless from the impact caused by the physician \nupdate.\n  Other provisions included in the bill would increase Part B spending \nand there are other provisions that decrease Part B spending--so why \nshould we single out physicians?\n  In June, Senator Baucus and I sent a letter to the Office of \nManagement and Budget calling for removal of Part B drugs from the \nphysician payment formula. This letter was signed by 87 additional \nSenators from both sides of the aisle. If the administration were to \nremove Part B drugs from the formula--it would also increase the Part B \npremium over a number of years.\n  This letter did not suggest the need for a hold harmless. I wanted to \npoint this out to my colleagues who supported this letter.\n  Some may feel that the Medicare drug premiums along with the Medicare \npart B premium may be a significant cost burden to beneficiaries. \nHowever, CMS recently announced that Medicare drug premiums will be \nlower than expected. The average monthly premium will be $32.20. That \nis $5 less per month than previously estimated.\n  Even if the part B premium is increased in 2007, the increase is \nnothing close to the $5 saved in the prescription drug premiums. And \nkeep in mind that the part B premium increase does not affect low-\nincome beneficiaries. Their premiums are paid for by the government. In \nfact, I worked hard to extend the QI program so Part B premiums would \nbe covered. Currently, 16 percent of beneficiaries enrolled in Part B \nreceive this assistance and more are eligible.\n  In addition, a MedPAC survey issued earlier this year found that 22 \npercent of beneficiaries already had trouble getting an appointment \nwith a new primary care physician and 27 percent reported delays in \ngetting an appointment. Payment cuts to physicians will only make these \nexisting access problems worse.\n  I am also opposed to the provision used to pay for this amendment.\n  Regarding Medicaid MCO rebate, this amendment would in effect \nincrease the rebate paid by drug manufacturers by making the rebate \navailable to Medicaid managed care plans.\n  The bill we are considering today increases the rebate paid by drug \nmanufacturers to States through the Medicaid program to 17 percent. The \nbill also closes a pair of loopholes that have the impact of increasing \nthe rebate.\n  First, we require the best price of an authorized generic to be \nconsidered in the brand name drug's best price calculation. That will \nhave the effect of increasing the rebate.\n  Second, we require physicians to notify the State Medicaid program of \nwhat drugs the physician administers in the office. Under current law, \nStates are permitted to collect rebates on the drugs but nothing in \nstatute requires physicians to disclose that information. As a result, \nStates miss out on the appropriate rebate.\n  When all these policies are taken into consideration, we have \nincreased the rebate paid by drug manufacturers by $1.7 billion.\n  Now I understand my colleague might not think that's enough, but I \nwould encourage you to look at a CBO report put out this past June \nexamining the price of name brand drugs. That report shows that the \neffective rebate being paid by drug manufacturers is actually 31.4 \npercent not 15 percent.\n  I am also concerned about the substantive implications of your \noffset. These Medicaid health plans are private businesses that can \nnegotiate low drug prices. I think it runs contrary to the policy this \ncommittee passed in the MMA to allow the plans to negotiate the best \ndeal they can get and then give them a rebate on top of that.\n  Yes, I do realize the Medicaid Commission accepted your offset in its \nrecommendation, but I am quite certain the Medicaid Commission stamp of \napproval would not win your support for other proposals we could be \nconsidering today. We have looked at this area and come up with \nresponsible policy that addresses loopholes. I don't think we need to \nfurther increase the rebate beyond what is already included in the \nbill.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment and the \noffset that funds it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/01/senate-section/article/S12122-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12122-S12123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                               NEVADA DAY\n\n  Mr. REID.

One hundred and forty-\n\n[[Page S12123]]\n\none years ago, on October 31, 1864, Nevada was admitted into the Union \nas the 36th State.\n  I am proud of Nevada's heritage. Native Americans have called Nevada \nhome for thousands of years, evidenced by the spectacular petroglyphs \nfound in our mountain ranges. Pioneers blazed trails across the Nevada \nfrontier and miners discovered lines and lodes of precious minerals \nthat would to lead to Nevada's designation as the Silver State. While \nwe honor and maintain our heritage, we also look with excitement at \nwhat Nevada has become today.\n  Every year, we welcome tens of thousands of people from across the \nNation who want to make Nevada their home. We are one of the fastest \ngrowing States in the country, and all Nevadans, past and present, have \nmade the Battle Born State what it is today. From the glittering lights \nof The Strip to the quiet strength of the bristlecone pines in the \nGreat Basin, Nevada is a place we are proud to call home. Nevada is the \nmajestic Ruby Mountains, the world-famous Black Rock Desert, \nmagnificent Lake Tahoe, hard-working mining towns, and of course, Las \nVegas, the world-class destination where millions of people from all \nover the world come to visit every year.\n  From the population centers of Las Vegas and Reno to rural \ncommunities that remain the heart of the American west, I have traveled \nall over the State in my decades-long career as an elected \nrepresentative, and I am privileged to represent Nevadans here in \nWashington. Every day, I stand on the Senate floor and do the best I \ncan for the Silver State and all those who call Nevada home.\n  I stand with my fellow Nevadans to honor our rich history and \nheritage and look forward to our bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/01/senate-section/article/S12123-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO SAM MOORE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nvoice of Kentucky agriculture, Mr. Sam Moore. Mr. Moore is retiring as \npresident of the Kentucky Farm Bureau after 7 successful years and will \nbe forever remembered as the Kentucky farmer's greatest advocate.\n  Mr. Moore, a native of Butler County, first became involved with the \nKentucky Farm Bureau in the late 1960s when he joined the Bureau's \nYoung Farmer Program. By 1973 he was selected as Outstanding Young \nFarmer by the Kentucky Jaycees, and he knew he had found his calling in \nworking with and for his fellow Kentucky farmers.\n  Mr. Moore has served on the Kentucky Farm Bureau's board of directors \nsince 1975, and will continue to serve in an at-large capacity after \nhis term as president ends. He is also a member of the American Farm \nBureau's board of directors, and holds positions on the boards of the \nSouthern Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company and Farm Bureau BanCorp. He \nhas also served as president of the Kentucky Farm Bureau Mutual \nInsurance Company.\n  Mr. Moore has been a leader of the Butler County Farm Bureau and is a \nmember of the American Soybean Association, the Kentucky Beef Cattle \nAssociation, and the Kentucky Corn Growers Association. He also serves \non the boards of the Kentucky Grain Insurance Fund and the Kentucky \nCouncil on Agriculture.\n  Mr. Moore was elected as the bureau's president in December 1998 \nafter 7 years of service as its first vice president. Immediately upon \nassuming office, he was faced with a major change in the tobacco \nfarming industry: the leading tobacco companies and the State \ngovernments had reached an agreement called the Master Settlement \nAgreement, which would place significant funds into the various States' \ntreasuries.\n  Mr. Moore was the driving force behind a bill in Kentucky to allocate \nhalf of Kentucky's proceeds from the Master Settlement Agreement--$3.6 \nbillion over 25 years--into a new State fund that would dedicate the \nmoney to projects that develop the State's agriculture market, \nencourage environmental stewardship, support family farms, and fund \nagricultural research and development.\n  The whole process is overseen by the Kentucky Agricultural \nDevelopment Board, which Mr. Moore has served on since its inception. \nThanks to Mr. Moore and the board's efforts, Kentucky's agriculture \nindustry is transforming to meet the needs of more Kentuckians.\n  But perhaps Mr. Moore's crowning achievement is his pivotal role in \nengineering the tobacco buyout of 2004. I worked side by side with Mr. \nMoore in that effort, and can testify that his hard work and dedication \nto moving that project through was critical to our success.\n  Thanks to Mr. Moore's efforts, Congress passed and the President \nsigned a tobacco buyout bill that will guarantee $2.5 billion to \nKentucky farmers and their families over the next 10 years. Farmers now \nhave the opportunity to explore other areas of agriculture, free from \nthe restraints the government placed on tobacco farming for so long. \nNothing was more important to Sam's Kentucky Farm Bureau members--and \nso Sam worked long and hard, until he delivered.\n  Sam is the co-owner of the Green River Feed Mill and also serves as a \ndirector of Morgantown Bank & Trust. He farms over 4,300 acres, \nproducing corn, soybeans, wheat, and cattle. He and his gracious wife \nHelen have six wonderful children.\n  Sam has dedicated decades of his life to farming and his fellow \nfarmers because he loves farming so much. He has made a lot of friends \nacross the State over the years, and I am proud to be one of them. Any \nfriend of Sam Moore will tell you he spent his entire career with the \nKentucky Farm Bureau thinking only of what was best for his members.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in commending Mr. Sam \nMoore for his years of service to Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/01/senate-section/article/S12123-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, we must not lose sight of the devastating \nhumanitarian crisis in Darfur, where some 3000,000 people were killed \nin the genocide and almost 2 million more forced into displacement \ncamps. While some progress has been made in ending large scale attacks \nby government forces, daily attacks against civilians and aid workers \ncontinue in a climate of lawlessness, and the Khartoum government still \nhas not reined in the Janjaweed militia. Given these circumstances, I \nremain concerned that the administration has not done enough to bring \nabout a peace agreement in the region.\n  The African Union soldiers sent to Darfur to date have made some \nprogress in providing much needed protection. However, their mandate \nand current personnel levels are not sufficient to keep the civilians \nand aid workers safe. America and the international community should \nwork to ensure that the African Union is able to get more peacekeepers \ninto place, with an expanded mandate that allows them to complete their \nimportant work.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a Christian \nScience Monitor article from October 25, 2005 describing the current \nproblems Darfur and providing some sensible proposals to solve them.\n\n[[Page S12124]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Christian Science Monitor, Oct. 25, 2005]\n\n                 Help Africans Help Themselves in Sudan\n\n                          (By Jeremy Barnicle)\n\n       West Darfur, Sudan.--As a white foreigner visiting a \n     displacement camp here, I was greeted with the chant, \n     ``khawaja no kwa.'' ``The foreigners say no,'' they sang, \n     meaning international intervention helped curb the violence \n     and ease the suffering in Darfur. The song was a gesture of \n     thanks and respect.\n       The wealthy world fulfilled the first part of its \n     obligation to the people here when it finally started sending \n     emergency aid over a year ago. The second part of that \n     obligation--helping African Union (AU) soldiers provide \n     security for the 2 million people driven from home by the \n     conflict--would consolidate humanitarian gains in Darfur and, \n     as important, serve as a long-term investment in the \n     stability of the entire continent.\n       In Darfur, the international community--specifically NATO \n     and the United States--has a unique opportunity to help \n     Africans provide security for their own conflict zones. The \n     village raids have largely subsided, and access for aid \n     workers has improved dramatically in Darfur over the past \n     year, but the countryside is now racked with lawlessness and \n     warlordism. Neither the government of Sudan nor the rebel \n     parties seem able to control the violence.\n       Within this challenging context, it is critical that \n     Darfurians living in refugee camps start to go home and \n     recover their lives. Peace talks between the government of \n     Sudan and various rebel groups continue in Nigeria, but there \n     is little hope of a durable political agreement in the near \n     future. Meanwhile, the people of Darfur are stuck suffering \n     between no war and no peace.\n       Their most basic needs are met in displacement camps, but \n     the situation is unsustainable: The longer they are displaced \n     the more expensive it becomes for the international community \n     and the less likely it is that they'll ever get home to \n     rebuild their own communities. Ask a Darfur refugee what she \n     wants and inevitably the answer is ``to go home, but only if \n     there is security.''\n       People will return to Darfur only when they have security \n     assurances they see as credible, and that's where the AU \n     force comes in.\n       So far, the AU mission in Sudan has surpassed expectations. \n     Displaced women used to be terrified of leaving camps to \n     collect firewood, as armed men would stalk the outskirts of \n     town and prey on them. Now, women can time their trips \n     outside to coincide with AU patrols, which deter assaults. \n     This is a development of which the AU and its backers should \n     be proud.\n       The problem is that there are currently only about 6,000 AU \n     troops in Darfur, an area the size of Texas. The AU says it \n     plans to ramp that number up to about 12,000 by 2006. That \n     would be too little, too late.\n       In order to help get Darfurians back home and back on track \n     in safety, the AU would need to hit that 12,000 as soon as \n     possible and be prepared to send at least a few thousand more \n     if necessary. The U.S. and NATO are already providing \n     important logistical and technical support for the AU \n     mission, but standing up this larger force would require a \n     speedy and substantial increase in their financial \n     commitments. The U.S. specifically needs to apply diplomatic \n     pressure to ensure that our allies meet the pledges they have \n     made to the AU.\n       That commitment is the least the world can do. Consider \n     this comparison. Following the war in Bosnia, the \n     international community secured the country--especially high \n     refugee return areas--by providing more than 18 peacekeepers \n     per thousand Bosnians. In Kosovo, the world came up with 20 \n     peacekeepers per thousand people. In Darfur right now, there \n     is one AU soldier per thousand people, spread over a much \n     larger geographic area. That is disgraceful.\n       An increased investment in the AU's peacekeeping capability \n     now would also advance a huge shared goal for Africa and the \n     West: to help Africans protect Africans. Several of the \n     continent's conflicts need sustained, legitimate, outside \n     military intervention and history proves that the West is \n     unwilling to commit its own troops in any meaningful way.\n       Some respected analysts have called for NATO to deploy its \n     own peacekeepers to Darfur. That is an appealing idea, but \n     the fact of the matter is that the government of Sudan will \n     never accept NATO troops on its soil, and their presence \n     could actually further destabilize the region.\n       An indigenous peacekeeping force legitimized by \n     international support and conforming to international \n     standards is critical to mitigating conflict, enabling \n     humanitarian access, and easing human suffering in Africa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/01/senate-section/article/S12124-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12124-S12125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             LIHEAP FUNDING\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, when I was governor of Delaware I was \nguided by a principle I learned years ago--if something is worth doing, \nit's worth paying for.\n  I served from 1993 to 2001, and we balanced the budget every year I \nwas in office.\n  The principle of paying for the things that are worth doing is not \nalways easy to follow. In fact, sometimes it's quite difficult.\n  It's especially difficult when we face the choice of how to fund \nimportant programs that we know provide vital services.\n  The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, is one of \nthese important programs.\n  I believe that LIHEAP is worth funding and I think it's worth paying \nfor.\n  And we need to pay for it because we are now in the unfortunate \nsituation of having been saddled with record budget deficits for as far \nas the eye can see.\n  Unfortunately, more often than not, the current administration has \nshown us the opposite of good fiscal leadership. Instead of sticking to \nthe motto, ``if it's worth doing, it's worth paying for,'' this \nadministration has chosen to cut taxes and increase spending more than \nany other administration in the past 30 years. The result: record \nbudget deficits and a bleak fiscal outlook.\n  This administration has turned the largest budget surplus in history \ninto the largest deficits in history.\n  It is for these reasons that we must consider how to pay for \nincreased funding for this vital program and for others as well.\n  The Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations \nSubcommittee took an important step toward providing adequate LIHEAP \nfunds by including $2.183 billion in their fiscal year 2006 committee-\nreported bill. This represents a small increase over last year's \nfunding levels. This is a good starting point.\n  However, we know that energy prices are rising and household heating \nbills will rise accordingly this winter. According to the U.S. Energy \nInformation Administration, consumers who heat their homes with natural \ngas prices--about 55 percent of U.S. households--are expected to see \ntheir heating bills rise by 48 percent this winter. Those who heat with \noil will pay 32 percent more, those who heat with propane will pay 30 \npercent more, and those who heat with electricity will pay 5 percent \nmore.\n  For that reason, I contacted the Appropriations Committee in \nSeptember to express the need for increased funding. I urged that they \nprovide $1.276 billion in emergency LIHEAP funding as part of a \ncomprehensive supplemental appropriations bill to address Hurricane \nKatrina and the effects it has had on energy production and the cost of \nenergy for U.S. consumers. This additional funding would provide an \napproximately 60 percent increase over fiscal year 2005 levels.\n  Unfortunately, we have not yet had the opportunity to consider a \nKatrina supplemental and during the week of October 24, 2005 we were \nfaced with the choice of how to increase funds for LIHEAP as part of \nthe Labor, Health and Human Services and Education appropriations bill.\n  I am not comfortable supporting a $3.1 billion increase in LIHEAP \nfunding if it is not offset by either a reduction in spending or an \nincrease in revenues. I believe that we can increase funds for LIHEAP \nbut I also believe that we need to pay for it.\n  As a result, I worked with my colleague, Senator Ben Nelson to search \nfor ways to achieve enough savings to pay for additional funding for \nthe LIHEAP program in fiscal year 2006.\n  Senator Nelson and I filed an amendment on October 26, 2005 to \nincrease LIHEAP funding by $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2006. This would \nprovide a 73 percent increase in funding over fiscal year 2005 levels. \nThe increase would be offset with $1.6 billion from three tax \nprovisions that either close tax loopholes or clarify and bring greater \nconsistency to current law. We believe that these offsets are \nbalanced--all three have gained support in the Senate in the past--and \nwe believe that our colleagues could support their use as an offset for \nthe LIHEAP program.\n  I would like to add even more funding to LIHEAP, but with the offsets \nSenator Nelson and I were able to identify, we were able to file an \namendment that would increase funds by $1.6 billion.\n  Unfortunately, we did not have the opportunity to vote on the Carper/\nNelson amendment during consideration of the fiscal year 2006 Labor, \nHealth and\n\n[[Page S12125]]\n\nHuman Services and Education appropriations bill. I will continue to \nsearch for ways to increase LIHEAP funding and likewise will continue \nto search for additional offsets to help pay for such an increase.\n  I believe in the LIHEAP program; I believe it serves a vital function \nin helping as many as 5 million low-income households who need a bit of \nhelp paying their energy bills or weatherizing their homes.\n  However, I also believe that as Americans, we can and must find ways \nto pay for our priorities. LIHEAP is worth funding, and it's worth \npaying for.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/01/senate-section/article/S12125-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n             Honoring Army Specialist Christopher T. Monroe\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from \nKendallville. Christopher Monroe, 19 years old, died on October 25 in \nBasra, Iraq. With his entire life before him, Chris risked everything \nto fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land \nhalfway around the world.\n  Remembered for his strong family ties and devotion to the Army, Chris \nwas killed while filling in for a friend on a convoy, a change from his \ntypical desk job. After September 11, Chris had yearned to serve his \ncountry and follow in the family tradition of military service. He \nbegged his mother to allow him to enlist early at age 17. The 2004 East \nNoble High School student had been in Iraq for only a couple months \nwhen he was killed. Friends and family recounted that Chris was an \noutgoing, generous young man who had given up his Christmas leave to \nallow others in his unit to be with their families for the holidays. \nHis mother, Annette, told local media outlets that she was proud of her \nson and that he died doing what he was born to do. Chris was engaged \nand was planning an October 2006 wedding.\n  Chris was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. He was a member of the Army Reserve's 785th Military Police \nBattalion, based out of Fraser, MI. This brave young soldier leaves \nbehind his father Perry Bolton II; his mother Annette Monroe; and his \nbrothers Greg and Nick.\n  Today, I join Chris's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Chris, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Chris was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Chris will be remembered by family members, \nfriends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Chris's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg:\n\n       We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow \n     this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled \n     here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or \n     detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \n     say here, but it can never forget what they did here.\n\n  This statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, \nas I am certain that the impact of Chris's actions will live on far \nlonger that any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Christopher Monroe in the \nCongressional Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country \nand for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I \nthink about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the \nunfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that \nfamilies like Chris's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Chris.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/01/senate-section/article/S12125-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12125-S12126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      IN HONOR OF WILLIAM O'NEILL\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a dedicated \npublic servant and a dear friend, former Connecticut Governor, William \nO'Neill.\n  I had the honor of serving the people of Connecticut alongside Bill \nO'Neill for over 15 years, during which time we shared many of the same \nviews and principles about the future of our great State. When I first \ntook office in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1975, Bill O'Neill \nwas the majority leader of the Connecticut House of Representatives. \nAnd, in December 1980, as I was preparing to take the oath of office as \na newly elected U.S. Senator, Bill O'Neill became the new Governor of \nConnecticut, replacing the beloved Ella Grasso, who had resigned for \nhealth reasons.\n  Bill O'Neill had a remarkable ability to connect with the citizens of \nConnecticut. He was a pragmatic leader, but he also took pains to be \nforward-thinking. As a result, not only did Bill serve one of the \nlongest gubernatorial tenures in Connecticut history, he also had one \nof the most influential.\n  Bill O'Neill understood the immense value of education to both the \nfuture of our State and the entire Nation. He fought to pass the \nEducation Enhancement Act, which, among other things, improved the \nquality of Connecticut teachers and improved student performance. He \noversaw the consolidation of the four ``State'' colleges--Eastern, \nWestern, Southern, and Central Connecticut State University--into a \nstronger unified system. And he funded critical capital improvements on \ncampuses throughout Connecticut.\n  He invested in a strong transportation infrastructure. In the \naftermath of the tragic collapse of the Mianus River Bridge, soon after \nhe became Governor, he responded not with a quick fix but by making \nlong-term investments that have served Connecticut and the rest of the \nnortheastern United States for decades and that will continue to do so \nfor years to come. He made these commitments despite the devastating \neffects of the Reagan administration's budget cuts. He looked to impact \nConnecticut's long-term needs, and, as a consequence, he repaired \nConnecticut's roadways, overhauled the bus and train lines, and \nmodernized Bradley International Airport.\n  Bill O'Neill worked hard to protect the environment. He strictly \nenforced the Clean Water Act, instituted reporting requirements for \ntoxic substances used in manufacturing, and set aside large tracts of \nland to be used for the benefit of the general public.\n  Governor O'Neill was also dedicated to bringing the best public \nservants, regardless of background, into our State government. He \nnominated the individuals who would become the first woman chief \njustice and the first African-American justice on the Connecticut \nSupreme Court. And he appointed the first woman attorney general and \ntreasurer in Connecticut history.\n  Bill O'Neill will be honored this week on the 15th anniversary of his \nretirement from public service at Central Connecticut State University, \nwhere there is a professorship in ``Public Policy and Practical \nPolitics'' endowed in his name. The athletic center at Western \nConnecticut State University, where I recently had the honor of \ndelivering remarks with former President Clinton, also bears the name \nof the former Governor.\n  It is fitting and appropriate that Bill O'Neill's name graces these \nfine institutions of higher learning and others throughout the State of \nConnecticut, and that he is being honored with this ceremony.\n  Bill O'Neill has served this country for over 50 years--as a fighter \npilot during the Korean war, as a six-term member of the Connecticut \nHouse of Representatives, as Lieutenant Governor, and as the Governor \nof Connecticut for more than a decade.\n  At a critical time in our State's and our country's history, \nConnecticut was fortunate to have the leadership of this remarkable \npatriot. His wisdom, his vision, and his ability to accomplish concrete \nchanges for the good of the people of our State set a standard for \npublic service that inspired me and I know continues to inspire those \nof us who believe in the value public service.\n\n[[Page S12126]]\n\n  Bill O'Neill is a true public servant and has been a long-time \nfriend. I wish him, his wife Nikki, and his family my best wishes on \nthis wonderful occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/01/senate-section/article/S12126-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ANNOUNCING THE BIRTH OF GRIFFIN MACK LUGAR\n\n Mr. LUGAR.

Griffin was a healthy 8 pounds at birth. His parents are our son, \nJohn Hoereth Lugar, and his wife, Kelly Smith Lugar, daughter of Robert \nLee Smith and Renee Routon Smith.

On the next day, Griffin met his brother, Preston Charles \nLugar, who was born at Sibley Memorial Hospital on February 20, 2004. \nThe two boys and their parents are now safe and healthy in their \nArlington, VA residence.\n  Kelly and John were married on November 5, 2001, in the Washington \nCathedral with Dr. Lloyd Ogilvie, former Chaplain of the Senate, \npresiding. They and their families and guests had enjoyed a rehearsal \ndinner in the Mansfield Room of the Capitol on the night before the \nwedding. Kelly worked with many of our colleagues during her service to \nthe administration of President George Bush and our former colleague, \nSecretary of Energy, Spencer Abraham, as Deputy Assistant Secretary \nwith responsibilities for congressional relations. She now has a \nprivate consulting business. A graduate of the University of Texas, she \nwas once a member of the staff of Congressman Ralph Hall of Texas. John \nLugar came with us to Washington, along with his three brothers, 28 \nyears ago. He graduated from Langley High School in McLean, VA; Indiana \nUniversity, and received his masters of business administration degree \nfrom Arizona State University. He is currently a vice president with \nJones Lang LaSalle, a commercial real estate services and investment \nmanagement firm.\n  We know that you will understand our excitement and our gratitude \nthat they and we have been given divine blessing and responsibility for \na glorious new chapter in our lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/01/senate-section/article/S12126-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MERCER COUNTY DRUG FREE COMMUNITY SUPPORT PROGRAM\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nMercer County Drug Free Community Support Program. The course provides \ninitiatives towards fighting substance abuse, developing links between \nthe community and its leaders in helping to educate the public, and \nallow young citizens the opportunity to help their peers. They have \nreceived numerous awards for their work in helping the citizens of \nMercer County deal with problems they may encounter daily, be it \nalcohol, prescription drugs, or illegal substances. The county has \nreceived a prestigious national award for its efforts, and deserves \nacknowledgment and praise for this accomplishment.\n  Recognizing the importance that this program brings to the community \nis important; America's Promise, the Alliance for Youth announced that \nMercer County is the winner of a national award to identify the 100 \nBest Communities for Young People; the award shows the true extent of \nthe value of such programs as the Mercer County drug-free program, \nhelping communities create better lives for the people who live in \nareas afflicted by substance abuse, and the problems arising from drug \nabuse. The 100 Best Communities for Young People celebrates \noutstanding, innovative efforts across the country that improve the \nwell-being of our young citizens. Mercer County truly deserved this \naward for its efficient and pioneering ways of dealing with social \nproblems and substance abuse.\n  Mercer County has put in place community programs that help teens \nlearn about problems arising from drug abuse, social misconduct, and \nother related issues. One particular project which deserves praise is \nthe ``teen court'' in which offenders are judged by their peers. The \nMercer County Teen Court was designed to provide youth with the \nnecessary tools to demonstrate the power they have, individually and \ncollectively, to influence others and make positive changes in their \nown lives and in their community. The teen court is especially \neffective in allowing teens the chance to see what problems have arisen \nfrom their offense, and to be given a punishment fitting to the crime \nhanded out by their own peers.\n  As a Vista volunteer in 1964, I realized the importance of community \nwork in combating poverty, helping individuals and low-income \nneighborhoods make positive changes for themselves and their \ncommunities. The Mercer County Drug Free Community Support Program is \nalso part of the Creating Opportunities for Youth coalition, a group of \ncommunity leaders who work hard creating a strategy to address the \nproblematic behaviors plaguing our children and youth in the community.\n  The organization plays a vital role in helping young citizens avoid \nthe dangers of substance abuse; government grants and awards have \nallowed the program to set up successful workshops that deal with \neducating youngsters and parents alike. It is, in effect, a leading \ncommunity source for prevention and awareness of substance abuse. The \nprogram has worked closely with leaders and the citizens to bring \ntogether Mercer County and, as a result, it is a good, safe place to \nlive, work, and raise children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/01/senate-section/article/S12126-3", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/01/senate-section/article/S12126-4", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and two withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/01/senate-section/article/S12126-5", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH \n                        RESPECT TO SUDAN--PM 29\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to amend chapter 21 of title 38, United States Code, \nto enhance adaptive housing assistance for disabled veterans; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, today I introduced the ``Specially Adapted \nHousing Grants Act of 2005'' to help all disabled veterans move home \nfrom medical facilities. The bill upgrades eligibility criteria for \nhousing assistance grants to better reflect the needs of today's \nveteran community.\n  Before discussing the legislation's merits, I want to acknowledge my \nHouse colleague, Representative John Boozman of Arkansas, who serves as \nChairman of the Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity. \nCongressman Boozman has demonstrated real leadership on this issue \nthrough his bill, the ``Veterans Housing/Improvement Act of 2005, H.R. \n3665. Section 101 of Congressman Boozman's bill is almost identical to \nthe measure that I have sponsored. The House Veterans Affairs' \nCommittee recently approved his legislation, and the full House is \nexpected to consider the bill in the near future. I am grateful to \nCongressman Boozman for his considerable efforts to advance a measure \nthat will help improve the lives of many disabled veterans, and I am \nhappy to advance his efforts here in the Senate with this bill.\n  I appreciate the support of my Senate colleagues, Senators Durbin, \nVitter, Kerry and Pryor, who have added their names as original \ncosponsors of the ``Specially Adapted Housing Grants Act of 2005.'' \nTheir endorsement of this bill represents bipartisan agreement on \nCapitol Hill that Congress must constantly evaluate veterans programs \nto make certain that our Nation provides responsive support to \nveterans.\n  While representing New Hampshire in the House and Senate, I have \nworked to ensure that those who served in our armed services receive \ntheir hard-earned benefits quickly and in full. Too often, out-of-date \nand burdensome regulations deny qualified veterans from receiving the \nbenefits to which they are entitled. Whenever possible, it is \nimperative that we remove red tape that does not take into account the \nrealities faced by today's veterans.\n  Guided by these facts, I have introduced legislation to reform rules \nthat determine requirements for a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \ngrant program that helps many disabled veterans make their homes \nsuitable for occupancy. Currently, a disabled veteran must at least \npartly own his or her residence to receive VA housing assistance grants \nto perform necessary residence modifications, such as installing \nwheelchair ramps or railings. However, many younger veterans returning \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan have not yet had the opportunity to become \nhomeowners. Being ineligible for VA help to modify their homes, these \nveterans and their families often are compelled to either shoulder the \ncosts of retrofitting their residences or face extended stays in VA \nmedical facilities.\n  My bill would establish a 5-year pilot program to allow severely \ndisabled veterans who live temporarily with family to receive up to \n$10,000 in adaptive housing assistance; less severely disabled veterans \ncould receive a maximum of $2,000. This grant money will help ensure \nthat all disabled veterans--regardless of whether they own property--\nare able to leave hospitals and return home as quickly as possible.\n\n  Also, mindful that these individuals will likely purchase their own \nresidence, the bill would allow disabled veterans to receive two \nadditional Specially Adaptive Housing Grants to be used for homes that \nthey own in the future. Severely disabled veterans could receive a \ntotal of $50,000 to modify residences; less severely disabled veterans \nwould be eligible for a total of $10,000. Only one of the three total \ngrants could be used for a temporary residence, such as a family-owned \nhome.\n  America's veterans have made enormous sacrifices to protect our \nNation and the ideals for which it stands. Our country owes a special \nobligation to those men and women who have become disabled as a result \nof their service. Under no circumstances should these American heroes \nbe divided into groups of ``haves'' and ``have nots.''\n  This Nation can do no less than to ensure that all disabled veterans \nare returned to the normalcy of home life as quickly and comfortably as \npossible. The common sense changes put forth in the legislation I have \nintroduced aim to do just that, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in the House and Senate to ensure that its provisions become \nlaw as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself and Mr. Sununu):\n  S. 1948. A bill to direct the Secretary of Transportation to issue \nregulations to reduce the incidence of child injury and death occurring \ninside or outside of passenger motor vehicles, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I am introducing The Cameron \nGulbransen Kids and Cars Safety Act of 2005 with my colleague Senator \nSununu, a bill to improve the child safety features in new vehicles. \nThis bill is named after a 2 year old Long Island boy who was killed \nwhen his father accidentally backed over him. Although this effort is \ntoo late to save little Cameron, it is named in his honor and aimed at \npreventing other families from suffering the same fate.\n  I also want to thank my friend and colleague, Congressman Peter King \nfor championing this issue in the House of Representatives.\n  While we hear a great deal about automobile accidents, we don't hear \nnearly as much about non-traffic automobile accidents, which can be \njust as tragic.\n  Since 1999, close to 975 children have died in non-traffic, non-crash \nincidents. This translates into a death almost every other day. The \naverage age of victims in these cases is just 1 year old. And in 70 \npercent of backover cases, a parent, relative or close friend is behind \nthe wheel.\n  As of October 15th of this year, there have been 317 non-traffic \nincidents resulting in ER treatment--tragically, 188 resulted in \nfatalities. New York State alone has suffered over 60 non-traffic \nincidents, 15 of them fatalities. These tragedies are heart-wrenching, \nnot only due to the unimaginable suffering these families endure, but \nalso because they are preventable.\n  The Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars Safety Act makes all passenger \nmotor vehicles safer in three important ways. First, it requires a \ndetection system to alert drivers to the presence of a child behind the \nvehicle. This system will prevent backing up incidents involving death \nand injury, especially to small children and the disabled. Second, it \nwill ensure that power windows automatically reverse direction when \nthey detect an obstruction--preventing children from being trapped, \ninjured or killed when playing with power car windows. And finally, the \nbill will require the vehicle service break to be\n\n[[Page S12130]]\n\nengaged in order to prevent vehicles from unintentionally rolling away.\n  Just as important, this bill will help parents by making them more \naware of the dangers their vehicles pose to kids. Our legislation \nestablishes a child safety information program to collect non-traffic, \nnon-crash incident data and to disseminate vital information to parents \nabout ways to mitigate the dangers cars pose.\n  This bill proves that with modest, cost-effective steps, we can \nprevent many tragic car-related accidents from occurring. The \ntechnology exists that can save children's lives at relatively low cost \nand new innovations are being developed all the time. Power window \nsensors, for example, cost only $8-12 a window. Brakeshift interlocks \nare already standard in most passenger vehicles, but where they aren't, \nthey cost only $5 a car. Backover warning systems cost approximately \n$300 a car, but they are still far cheaper than the DVD systems that \ncan run up to $2000 and stereo systems that go for up to $800--costs \nthat are commonly absorbed into the cost of new cars. There is no \nreason that we are not using these new technologies to save lives.\n  This kind of modest regulatory response to a safety problem has many \nprecedents. Back in 1956, in response to a slew of tragic child \nsuffocations, Congress passed the Refrigerator Safety Act to ensure \nthat refrigerators could be opened from the inside and no child could \nagain be trapped inside. When 156 kids died from airbags, the Federal \nGovernment regulated a design change. The government even changed the \ndesign of garage doors after 56 children were killed by them.\n  This is a comparable situation--this inexpensive technology could \nsave thousands of children's lives.\n  So, I am proud to be introducing the Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars \nSafety Act of 2005 today and I urge all my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this bill. Together, we can make cars and kids safer in this \ngreat country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 1949. A bill to provide for coordination of proliferation \ninterdiction activities and conventional arms disarmament, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I rise on behalf of myself and \nSenator Obama to introduce the Cooperative Proliferation Detection, \nInterdiction Assistance, and Conventional Threat Reduction Act of 2005.\n  This legislation aims to support the priority the Administration has \nplaced on the detection and interdiction of weapons of mass \ndestruction, their means of delivery and related materials, as well as \ndual-use items of proliferation concern. The legislation also contains \nimportant conventional weapons threat reduction measures that have \npreviously been approved by the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the remarks Senator Obama \nand I made this morning at the Council on Foreign Relations regarding \nthis legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Statement of Senator Obama on the Introduction of the Cooperative \n  Proliferation Detection, Interdiction, Assistance, and Conventional \n                          Threat Reduction Act\n\n       Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Lugar in \n     introducing the Cooperative Proliferation Detection, \n     Interdiction Assistance, and Conventional Threat Reduction \n     Act.\n       Earlier today, Senator Lugar and I appeared at the Council \n     on Foreign Relations to discuss our recent trip to Russia, \n     Ukraine, and Azerbaijan and talk about this new piece of \n     legislation.\n       Now, few people understand these challenges better than the \n     co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, \n     Senator Lugar, and this is something that became particularly \n     clear to me during one incident on the trip.\n       We were in Ukraine, visiting a pathogen laboratory in Kiev. \n     This is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-\n     descript building right in the middle of town stood this \n     facility that once operated on the fringes of the Soviet \n     biological weapons program.\n       We entered through no fences or discernible security, and \n     once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open \n     first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not \n     use to secure our own luggage.\n       Our guide then brought us right up to what looked like a \n     mini-refrigerator. Inside, staring right at us, were rows \n     upon rows of test tubes. She picked them up, clanked them \n     around, and we listened to the translator explain what she \n     was saying. Some of the tubes, he said, were filled with \n     anthrax. Others, the plague.\n       At this point I turned around and said ``Hey, where's \n     Lugar? Doesn't he want to see this?'' I found him standing \n     about fifteen feet away, all the way in the back of the room. \n     He looked at me and said, ``Been there, done that.''\n       Of course, Senator Lugar has been there and he has done \n     that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs \n     he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing \n     progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the \n     deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the \n     former Soviet Union after the Cold War.\n       As we discussed with the Council on Foreign Relations, this \n     is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a \n     time when demand for these weapons has never been greater.\n       Right now, rogue states and despotic regimes are looking to \n     begin or accelerate their own nuclear programs. And as we \n     speak, members of Al Qaeda and other terrorists organizations \n     are aggressively pursuing weapons of mass destruction, which \n     they would use without hesitation.\n       We've heard the horror stories--attempts by rogue states to \n     recruit former Soviet weapons scientists; terrorists shopping \n     for weapons grade materials on the black market. Some weapons \n     experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough \n     fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years--and \n     we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if \n     they succeed.\n       Today, experts tell us that we're in a race against time to \n     prevent this scenario from unfolding. And that is why the \n     nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders \n     of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to \n     the security of the United States--a threat we need to think \n     seriously and intelligently about in the months to come.\n       Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction--\n     especially in securing nuclear weapons--serves as a model of \n     how we can do this. And so the question we need to be asking \n     ourselves today is, what is the future of this program? With \n     the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet \n     Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even \n     in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this \n     threat in the days and years to come?\n       The answers to these questions will require sustained \n     involvement by the Executive Branch, Congress, non-\n     governmental organizations, and the international community. \n     Everyone has a role to play, and everyone must accelerate \n     this involvement.\n       For my part, I would suggest three important elements that \n     should be included in such a discussion.\n       First, the Nunn-Lugar program should be more engaged in \n     containing proliferation threats from Soviet-supplied, \n     civilian research reactors throughout Russia and the \n     Independent States.\n       The Department of Energy and others have certainly made \n     progress in converting civilian reactors to low-enriched \n     uranium, taking back spent fuel, and closing unnecessary \n     facilities.\n       Yet, a serious threat still remains. Many of these aging \n     research facilities have the largest, least secure quantities \n     of highly enriched uranium in the world--the quickest way to \n     a nuclear weapon. For a scientist or other employee to simply \n     walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a \n     weapon of mass destruction is far too easy, and the \n     consequences would be far too devastating. Not to mention the \n     environmental and public health and safety catastrophe that \n     could come from a failure to store and transport these \n     materials safely and securely.\n       In a way that balances the needs of science and security, \n     more needs to be done to bring these materials--as well as \n     other sources that can be used to construct \n     improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices--under \n     control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat \n     they pose.\n       In the years ahead, this should become an increasing \n     priority for the Nunn-Lugar program, the Congress, and the \n     Russians, who are already taking important steps to help \n     implement these programs.\n       I want to turn to a second critical area: biological \n     weapons threat reduction programs.\n       Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union was engaged in a \n     massive undertaking in the field of germ warfare.\n       At its height in the late 1980' s, this program stockpiled \n     of some of the most dangerous agents known to man--plague, \n     smallpox, and anthrax--to name just a few. As one book says, \n     ``disease by the ton was its industry.''\n       Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian \n     population, biological agents can also be effective in \n     asymmetrical warfare against U.S. troops. While they are \n     often difficult to use, they are easy to transport, hard to \n     detect, and, as we saw in Kiev, not always well secured.\n       Here in Washington, we saw what happened when just two \n     letters filled with just a few grams of Anthrax were sent to \n     the U.S. Senate. Five postal employees were killed and the \n     Senate office buildings were closed for months.\n       This was two letters.\n       Fortunately, however, we've made some good progress on this \n     front. For years, Nunn-Lugar programs have been effectively \n     upgrading security at sites in six countries\n\n[[Page S12131]]\n\n     across the former Soviet Union. And the Kiev story is heading \n     in the right direction--while we were in Ukraine, Senator \n     Lugar, through his tireless and personal intervention, was \n     able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing \n     that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat \n     Reduction program.\n       But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet \n     biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind \n     in dealing with this proliferation threat. We need to be sure \n     that Nunn-Lugar is increasingly focused on these very real \n     nonproliferation and bioterrorism threats.\n       One of the most important steps is for Russia to permit the \n     access and transparency necessary to deal with the threat.\n       Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and \n     secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-\n     reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-\n     attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts \n     work together to develop improved medical countermeasures. As \n     the Avian Influenza outbreak demonstrates, even the zealous \n     Russian border guard is helpless against the global sweep of \n     biological threats.\n       My third recommendation--which I'll just touch briefly on \n     and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail--is that we \n     need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-\n     generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical \n     weapons.\n       On our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: \n     elimination of heavy conventional weapons, and interdiction \n     efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across \n     borders.\n       In Donetsk, I stood among piles of conventional weapons \n     that were slowly being dismantled. While the government of \n     Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they \n     have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years \n     to dismantle these weapons. But we've all seen how it could \n     take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel \n     around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts \n     from Africa to Afghanistan. By destroying these inventories, \n     this is one place we could be making more of a difference.\n       One final point. For any of these efforts that I've \n     mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think \n     critically and strategically about Washington's relationship \n     with Moscow.\n       Right now, there are forces within the former Soviet Union \n     and elsewhere that want these non-proliferation programs to \n     stop. Our detention for three hours in Perm is a testament to \n     these forces. Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen \n     some disturbing trends from Russia itself--the deterioration \n     of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken \n     place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet \n     Union--that raise serious questions about our relationship.\n       But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose \n     to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian \n     relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does \n     not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the \n     job we started. We must safeguard these dangerous weapons, \n     material, and expertise.\n       One way we could strengthen this relationship is by \n     thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of \n     a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort.\n       This does not mean that we should ease up one bit on issues \n     affecting our national security. Outstanding career officials \n     who run the Nunn-Lugar program--people like Col. Jim Reid and \n     Andy Weber who were with us at the Council this morning--will \n     be there every step of the way to ensure that U.S. interests \n     are protected.\n       Time and time again on the trip, I saw their skill and \n     experience when negotiating with the Russians. I also saw \n     their ability to ensure that shortcomings were addressed and \n     programs were implemented correctly.\n       But thinking of the Russians more as partners does mean \n     being more thoughtful, respectful, and consistent about what \n     we say and what we do. It means that the Russians can and \n     should do more to support these programs. And it means more \n     sustained engagement, including more senior-level visits to \n     Nunn-Lugar program sites.\n       It's important for senior officials to go and visit these \n     sites, to check their progress and shortcomings; to see \n     what's working and what's not. But lately we haven't seen \n     many of these visits. We need to see more.\n       We also need to ensure that the Cooperative Threat \n     Reduction umbrella agreement, due to expire in 2006, is \n     renewed in a timely manner.\n       And we need to work together to obtain a bilateral \n     agreement on biological threat reduction.\n       The Russians, however, must also realize that with greater \n     partnership comes greater responsibility.\n       There is no doubt that there is a tough road ahead. It will \n     be difficult. And it will be dangerous.\n       But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a \n     quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at \n     American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet \n     Union.\n       ``Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also \n     direct attention to our common interests and to the means by \n     which those differences can be resolved . . . For in the \n     final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all \n     inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We \n     all cherish our children's future. And we are all mortal.''\n       Much of what President Kennedy described in 1963 remains \n     true to this day--and we owe it to ourselves and our children \n     to get it right.\n       I look forward to working with Senator Lugar on this \n     legislation and, more broadly, on this issue for years to \n     come.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Council on Foreign Relations, ``New Directions for Cooperative Threat \n        Reduction,'' Senator Richard G. Lugar, November 1, 2005\n\n       It is a pleasure to appear before the Council on Foreign \n     Relations with my good friend Senator Barack Obama. As you \n     have heard, we had an extremely successful trip in August. I \n     appreciate his strong support for the Nunn-Lugar Program. In \n     his first year in the Senate, he has committed himself to \n     improving the U.S. response to the threat posed by weapons of \n     mass destruction. We discussed existing programs and new \n     opportunities extensively during our trip, and we are eager \n     to share with you the first public mention of the joint \n     legislative initiative that developed from our findings.\n       I was particularly pleased that Barack chose Nunn-Lugar as \n     the subject of his first foreign travel as a Senator. This \n     choice was not an accident or the result of a last-minute \n     whim. During his Senate campaign, well over a year ago, he \n     identified the threat posed by unsecured weapons of mass \n     destruction as the greatest national security threat facing \n     the United States. On the Foreign Relations Committee, he has \n     followed these issues intensely, and he has been a steadfast \n     voice of support for non-proliferation efforts.\n       Our trip in August was spent hiking through nuclear weapons \n     storage sites, picking through piles of mortar rounds and \n     landmines, touring missile elimination facilities, examining \n     laboratories containing deadly pathogens, and--for three \n     hours--being detained in the visitors lounge at a remote \n     Russian airfield, near Perm.\n       Barack, I want to make sure you understand that your future \n     congressional travels are unlikely to include so many \n     glamorous tourist hotspots.\n       It's safe to assume that none of the reporters who have \n     joined us today are from Frommer's or Lonely Planet.\n       I have had the opportunity to visit the former Soviet Union \n     to tour Nunn- Lugar sites and facilities once or twice a year \n     for the last 14 years. As Barack witnessed, these trips serve \n     a greater purpose than our personal edification. They are \n     designed to invigorate and endorse the work of a program that \n     both of us see as vital to our national security. On many \n     previous trips, weapons facilities were opened to Americans \n     for the first time, including such notable facilities as the \n     SevMash submarine base, birthplace of the Typhoon nuclear \n     missile submarine. Political support for Nunn-Lugar \n     activities can never be taken for granted. Not everyone in \n     the former Soviet Union, and indeed, not everyone in our own \n     country believes that these programs should be a priority. \n     The Nunn-Lugar program and associated non-proliferation \n     efforts have required constant stewardship and support from \n     the Congress. In this context, I am enthused and encouraged \n     by Senator Obama's commitment to adding his strong voice and \n     creativity to the proliferation challenge.\n       Since its founding, Sam Nunn and I always have regarded \n     Nunn-Lugar as more than a government program. We have seen it \n     as a disarmament concept and non-proliferation tool worthy of \n     adaptation and expansion. The Nunn-Lugar program and people \n     like Jim Reid and Andy Weber, who manage its day to day \n     operations, represent a tremendous national security asset \n     that can be applied to situations well beyond the scope of \n     the original Nunn-Lugar legislation. Indeed, the program's \n     aims have been expanded from the focus on safeguarding and \n     destroying strategic nuclear weapons to a much broader array \n     of goals involving safely disposing of all types of nuclear, \n     chemical, and biological weapons and materials, as well as \n     employing former weapons scientists. In 2003, I offered the \n     Nunn-Lugar Expansion Act, which was signed into law by \n     President Bush. It allowed, for the first time, Nunn-Lugar \n     funds to be used anywhere in the world, not just within the \n     boundaries of the former Soviet Union. As I have advocated \n     frequently, U.S. officials should be prepared to extend the \n     Nunn-Lugar concept whenever opportunities present themselves. \n     Some potential applications for the program North Korea, for \n     example--seem remote today. But the same could have been said \n     for the Soviet Union in the 1980s.\n       In this spirit, Senator Obama and I are introducing \n     legislation, today, that will again extend the Nunn-Lugar \n     concept to new areas of endeavor. Our bill is entitled the \n     ``Cooperative Proliferation Detection, and Interdiction \n     Assistance and Conventional Threat Reduction Act.''\n       As Barack described, our trip included an examination of \n     conventional weapons stockpiles near Donetsk, Ukraine. We \n     also visited Baku, Azerbaijan, where we observed the mock \n     interdiction of a naval vessel playing the role of nuclear \n     smuggler.\n       These visits and our subsequent joint research have \n     convinced us that the United States can and should do more to \n     eliminate conventional weapons stockpiles and assist other \n     nations in detecting and interdicting weapons of mass \n     destruction. We believe that\n\n[[Page S12132]]\n\n     these functions are underfunded, fragmented, and in need of \n     high-level support.\n       The U.S. government's current response to threats from \n     vulnerable conventional weapons stockpiles is dispersed \n     between several programs at the Department of State. We \n     believe that the planning, coordination, and implementation \n     of this function should be consolidated into one office at \n     the State Department with a budget that is commensurate with \n     the threat posed by these weapons.\n       We are particularly concerned that our government has the \n     capacity to deal quickly with vulnerable stockpiles of \n     shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles, known as MANPADS. In \n     recent years, concerns have grown that such weapons could be \n     used by terrorists to attack commercial airliners, military \n     installations, and government facilities here at home and \n     abroad. Al Qaeda reportedly has attempted to acquire MANPADS \n     on a number of occasions.\n       The Lugar-Obama bill recognizes that the proliferation of \n     conventional weapons is a major obstacle to peace, \n     reconstruction, and economic development in regions suffering \n     from conflict and instability. It calls upon the State \n     Department to implement a global effort to seek out and \n     destroy surplus and unguarded stocks of conventional \n     armaments and to cooperate with allies and international \n     organizations when possible.\n       In Ukraine, we saw stacks of thousands of mortars, anti-\n     personnel landmines, and other weapons, left over from the \n     Soviet era. The scene there is similar to situations in other \n     states of the former Soviet Union, Africa, Latin America, and \n     Asia. I have also witnessed these threats firsthand in \n     Albania and Georgia, where those governments have requested \n     assistance in eliminating MANPADS, tactical missile systems, \n     and millions of tons of ammunition and weapons.\n       In many cases, the security around these weapons is \n     minimal--particularly when the weapons are no longer being \n     used by a nation's military. But as we have seen in Iraq, \n     even obsolete weaponry and explosives can be reconfigured \n     with deadly results. If foreign governments know that the \n     United States is poised to help them eliminate such \n     weapons, they will be more likely to come forward with \n     requests for help, as Albania and Georgia did.\n       Inevitably, some countries will decline our assistance, and \n     their stockpiles will remain unsecured. But this is not a \n     reason to fail to secure the stockpiles that are opened to \n     us. Every stockpile represents a theft opportunity for \n     terrorists and a temptation for security personnel who might \n     seek to profit by selling weapons on the black market. The \n     more stockpiles that can be safeguarded or eliminated, the \n     safer we will be. We do not want the question posed the day \n     after an attack on an American military base, embassy \n     compound, or commercial plane why we didn't take these \n     threats seriously.\n       Two years ago the Department of Energy combined several \n     nonproliferation programs into the Global Threat Reduction \n     Initiative (GTRI) charged with identifying, securing, and \n     disposing of vulnerable nuclear materials and equipment \n     around the world. We used GTRI as a blueprint for the \n     organizational and programmatic structure needed in the \n     conventional arms elimination arena. By merging activities in \n     a single office at the State Department and making it the \n     lead Federal agency in efforts to eliminate non-strategic \n     missile systems, MANPADS, and all small arms, we will raise \n     the profile and value of this important work.\n       The second part of the Lugar-Obama legislation is focused \n     on U.S. efforts to assist allies in detecting and \n     interdicting weapons of mass destruction. The Nunn-Lugar \n     Program is our country's first line of defense against the \n     threat posed by weapons and materials of mass destruction. It \n     attempts to secure weapons of mass destruction at their \n     source. The Department of Homeland Security is our last line \n     of defense, focused on detecting these threats inside U.S. \n     borders and responding to attacks, if they occur. Our bill \n     would bolster the second line of defense, namely, our ability \n     to stop weapons of mass destruction that have been taken from \n     the source, but have not yet reached the United States.\n       To strengthen the second line of defense, we believe that \n     we must improve the capabilities of other nations. The United \n     States military and intelligence services cannot be \n     everywhere. We need the cooperation and vigilance of like-\n     minded nations to detect and interdict WMD threats. The \n     United States has constructed the Proliferation Security \n     Initiative, which enlisted the participation of other nations \n     in the interdiction of WMD. PSI is an excellent step forward \n     in our communications with foreign governments on WMD \n     interdiction. But what is lacking is a coordinated effort to \n     improve the capabilities of our foreign partners so that they \n     can playa larger detection and interdiction role.\n       The Lugar-Obama bill creates a single office dedicated to \n     supporting the detection and interdiction of WMD. The State \n     Department engages in several related anti-terrorism and \n     export control assistance programs to foreign countries. But \n     these programs are focused on other stages of the threat, \n     not on the detection and interdiction of WMD cargo. Thus, \n     we believe there is a gap in our defenses that needs to be \n     filled.\n       The Lugar-Obama bill earmarks 25 percent of the \n     Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining, and Related \n     Programs account to address the shortcomings in the State \n     Department's response. This would have amounted to $110 \n     million this year. Our bill goes one step further by calling \n     on the State Department to also commit 25 percent of annual \n     foreign military financing amounts to nations for the \n     purchase of equipment to improve their ability to detect and \n     interdict WMD. This would represent a potent but flexible \n     tool that could help build a network of WMD detection and \n     interdiction capabilities world wide.\n       Senator Obama and I give the State Department the \n     flexibility to determine how these funds should be used. This \n     is because a ``one-size-fits-all'' approach does not work \n     with FMF funds. Some recipients of U.S. security assistance, \n     such as Israel, already are capable of detecting and \n     interdicting WMD. Other potential recipients are unable to \n     utilize effectively such detection and interdiction \n     assistance because they lack the basic military structures to \n     employ it. We require the Administration to outline for \n     Congress the rationale behind the decision not to invoke the \n     25 percent requirement clause. Through this reporting \n     requirement, we are seeking to ensure that Congress remains \n     an active participant in important decisions on foreign \n     military financing.\n       I am confident that the ongoing reorganization of the arms \n     control and non-proliferation bureaus, under the direction of \n     Under Secretary Bob Joseph, provides us with an excellent \n     opportunity to reshape, refocus and reinvigorate the State \n     Department's non-proliferation mission. The Lugar-Obama \n     legislation is intended to assist in the transformation of \n     the Department's efforts.\n       The U.S. response to conventional weapons threats and the \n     lack of focus on WMD detection and interdiction assistance \n     must be rectified if we are to provide a full and complete \n     defense for the American people. We look forward to working \n     closely with the Administration on these proposals and will \n     benefit from their recommendations on ways to perfect our \n     legislation. The Lugar-Obama bill is a critical step forward \n     in improving our ability to protect the United States and its \n     citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/01/senate-section/article/S12132-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2347.

Mr. President, I have recently received a very powerful \nand thoughtful letter from the Presiding Bishop of the Evangelical \nLutheran Church in America, ELCA, of which I am a member. While my \nreligious faith is central to the values which inform my political \ndecisions, these decisions are never based exclusively on direction I \nmight receive from my religious denomination's leaders.\n  Nonetheless, in this instance I believe that this letter, signed by \nall 66 ELCA bishops, sends the Senate a profoundly important and timely \nmessage concerning the budget reconciliation bill currently before this \nbody.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record, \nand I urge all my colleagues to take this message of Christian \ncompassion and values to heart.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S12145]]\n\n                 Evangelical Lutheran Church in America\n\n       Dear Members of Congress, We write to you as religious \n     leaders seeking justice for millions of vulnerable and \n     dispossessed people in our Nation. As Bishops of the \n     Evangelical Lutheran Church in America we represent diverse \n     regions but speak with one voice about the fundamental \n     responsibility of the government, as an expression of the \n     will of the people, to protect the least of its citizens and \n     provide for the poorest in our society. In this spirit we ask \n     specifically that you oppose any attempt to move forward on \n     the budget reconciliation measures now before Congress.\n       Cuts to mandatory spending called for in the reconciliation \n     package would decrease valuable assistance to millions of \n     low-income families, children, elderly and people with \n     disabilities. Even as the number of people living in poverty \n     and without insurance has increased dramatically in the past \n     five years, the last few tragic weeks in the Gulf Coast area \n     have put a face, indeed, thousands of new faces, on poverty \n     in the heart of our society. Programs such as Food Stamps, \n     Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program \n     (SCHIP), and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) \n     help to keep struggling families together and assist low-\n     income working families in moving to higher economic ground. \n     This is not the time to cut such important programs while \n     using the cuts to pay for tax breaks for those who don't need \n     them.\n       The Biblical record is clear. The Scriptural witness on \n     which our faith tradition stands speaks dramatically of God's \n     concern for and solidarity with poor and oppressed \n     communities while speaking firmly in opposition to \n     governments whose policies place narrow economic interests \n     driven by greed above the common good. Jesus speaks and acts \n     unequivocally on behalf of those on the margins of society. \n     St. Paul writes forcefully about the importance of community \n     and expands the definition of those we call brothers and \n     sisters in Christ. As Americans open their homes to embrace \n     neighbors from Gulf Coast states, as non-profit and religious \n     organizations provide relief services, we strongly urge you \n     to reflect on your role as a government official in providing \n     for the least in our society and ask that you oppose any \n     attempt to move forward with the budget reconciliation \n     process.\n           Peace Be With You,\n\n                                        Bishop Mark S.

No, \nthe offset is in the new proposed changes to Medicaid that would make \nMedicaid be distributed through the States through managed care.\n  Under the current law, the prescription drugs that are available \nthrough Medicaid have to be discounted and provided to Medicaid \nrecipients. The new waivers to the States allowing Medicaid to be \ndispensed through HMOs is going to allow those discounts to go away, \nand it will be a negotiated item. There is a savings of up to $2 \nbillion if one does not allow that law to be changed so that the \ndiscount goes away by law.\n  Therefore, Medicaid recipients very possibly pay more. It is that \nsavings, by keeping that discount of up to $2 billion, which is the \noffset that we pay for, keeping senior citizens whole by not raising \ntheir Medicare Part B premiums.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, America can do better than making a \npoliceman walking the beat pay a higher Federal tax rate than someone \nwho makes their money on capital gains and dividends. Unfortunately, \nthe Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform today\n\n[[Page S12147]]\n\nsent to the President a recommendation that will widen the gap between \nour middle class workers and the fortunate few.\n  I am a Democrat who believes in markets, I believe in wealth \ncreation, I believe in entrepreneurship, but I also believe in what \nHenry Ford said. He, of course, was the great industrialist. He made it \nclear that he wanted to make money and he wanted to do well but he \nsaid: For me to make money, my workers have to have enough money to be \nable to buy my cars.\n  What concerns me tonight is that the middle class, the folks who are \nhurting, have gotten short shrift once again from the special advisory \npanel on tax reform.\n  These are the folks, the middle class folks, who are walking an \neconomic tightrope, balancing their medical bills against their energy \nbills, trying to set aside money to save for retirement and health. \nThey are the ones who deserve a break.\n  I heard mention tonight that Democrats, Senators on my side of the \naisle, were not interested in cutting taxes. Well, I proposed last week \nto cut taxes for millions of middle class people and folks with incomes \nup to $150,000 by eliminating scores of exemptions, deductions and \nspecial interest breaks that exist on both the individual side of the \ncode and the corporate side of the code.\n  What we saw today is the special advisory panel on tax reform wanted \nnone of that. They did not want to make those kinds of tough choices \nthat step on the toes of special interests, powerful interests with big \nlobbies. Instead, what they did is take it once again out of the hide \nof middle income people who would be asked to give up tax breaks and \nsupport for concerns such as child care.\n  When we already have a big gap between those who work for wages and \nthose who make their income on capital gains and dividends, how can it \nbe that it is now proposed to widen that gap?\n  I think we would be well advised to look back to 1986, when the late \nPresident Reagan worked in a bipartisan way with Democrats, both with \nthe Senate and the other body, to come up with a proposal that I \nthink--certainly its foundation would be very appealing now. It makes \nsure that all income is treated equally. That is what this country has \nalways been about. I do not want to soak anybody. I do not want to \ndiscriminate against anybody. But I do not think it is right for \nworkers to have to pay a higher effective tax rate than those who make \ntheir money on capital gains and dividends.\n  Income ought to be treated the same. That is what the country is all \nabout. It seems to me that the advisory panel on tax reform missed a \nbig opportunity today when they widened the gap between those who work \nfor wages and those who make their income from wealth.\n  If one looks at the tax panel's recommendations, in effect, they \nthrow three strikes at the middle class and they lob softballs to the \nspecial interests. The first pitch is a slider that shifts a sizable \ntax burden away from those at the top to the middle income taxpayers. \nThat is followed by a fast ball that takes away many of the deductions \nand credits such as those for child care and medical needs that middle \nincome Americans have come to rely on. The third pitch is a change-up. \nThe plan may look revenue neutral, but when it flies across the plate, \nit adds billions of dollars to the budget deficit and will force middle \nclass Americans and their children to pay for tax cuts for the \nfortunate few.\n  Under this special advisory panel plan that was proposed today, the \nmiddle class simply strikes out. Certainly, those who are at the top \nare going to enjoy the grand slam that is offered by the panel's plan. \nThe panel would cut their tax rates, those at the very top, once again \nand there is not the kind of massive housecleaning of the tax system \neither.\n  I proposed in my legislation, S. 1927, the Fair Flat Tax Act of 2005, \nthat everybody pays their fair share, not just cutting the tax rates \nfor the fortunate, making up for it by having the middle class \nsubsidize those tax breaks, but mine would treat all income equally. To \ncarry out our proposal, we include a new, simplified 1040 form, one \npage, 30 lines, for every individual taxpayer. There are three brackets \nrather than the current system.\n  Under my proposal the brackets are 15, 25, and 35, and we create a \nflat corporate rate of 35 percent. This plan is more fair because it \nwould no longer disproportionately favor the most affluent at the \nexpense of the middle class.\n  Certainly, the tax breaks that my legislation calls for step on toes. \nI pay for those middle class tax cuts. The proposal has been scored by \nthe experts at the Congressional Research Service. I pay for the middle \nclass tax cut by eliminating scores of tax breaks that are now in the \nCode for individuals and businesses. Certainly, some of them are going \nto object, already have. It seems to me that it is worth it to make a \nradical statement about tax laws, and that is that America can do \nbetter than a two-tiered tax system which forces a policeman to pay a \nhigher effective tax rate than an investor who makes his income on \ncapital gains dividends. What is fair about taxing a firefighter's \nhard-earned wages at a higher percentage than a corporate executive?\n  Under the current Federal Tax Code, all income is not created equal, \nand under what the panel proposed today to the President of the United \nStates, the equality gap between the middle class and the fortunate few \nis going to grow.\n  Under the proposal that was sent to the President today, Americans \nwho work for wages would further subsidize the cuts, credits, and \ndeferrals of those who make their money from investments such as \ncapital gains and dividends.\n  Personally, I think there were other opportunities for innovations \nthat the panel missed. For example, I proposed in my legislation to end \nfavoritism for itemizers. We do that by tripling the standard deduction \nfor single filers from $5,000 to $15,000 and raise the deduction from \n$10,000 to $30,000 for married couples.\n  I eliminate the alternative minimum tax, which could snare as many as \n21 million Americans in 2006. But instead of forcing middle-class \npeople to pay for that, I go after some of those breaks and exemptions \nand special interest favors that have made their way into the Tax Code.\n  I will also say that the panel should have moved to correct a glaring \ninequity in the current tax system, which is regressive State and local \ntaxes. They were advised about how regressive the State and local taxes \nhave become, but unfortunately they took a pass on dealing with this \nissue as well.\n  Under current law, low- and middle-income taxpayers get hit with a \ndouble whammy. Compared to the fortunate few, they pay more of their \nincome in State and local taxes. Poor families pay more than 11 \npercent, and middle-income families pay about 10 percent of their \nincome in State and local taxes, while the most affluent pay much less, \nonly about half that. Because many low- and middle-income taxpayers do \nnot itemize, they get no credit on their Federal form for paying State \nand local taxes. In fact, two-thirds of the Federal deduction for State \nand local taxes goes to those with incomes above $100,000.\n  Under my legislation, the Fair Flat Tax Act, for the first time the \nFederal Tax Code would look at an individual's entire tax situation. My \nlegislation would look at an individual's combined Federal, State, and \nlocal tax burden and give credit to low- and middle-income individuals \nto correct for regressive State and local taxes. By contrast, the \nadvisory panel that reported to the President today proposes to \neliminate the current State and local tax deduction with no credit or \nother mechanism to address the total tax burden that is paid by \nindividuals in this country. So once again, the panel's approach \nfurther skews the overall tax burden toward low- and middle-income \ntaxpayers, with the fortunate few benefiting and the middle class \ngetting hammered again.\n  The proposal I have made keeps in place the deductions most important \nfor our middle-class citizens and particularly the investments they \nmake--the investments they make in their home, in their retirement, in \neducation--those concerns that are so important to maintaining a middle \nclass in our country.\n  In contrast to the proposal made by the advisory panel today, my \nlegislation means that the vast majority of\n\n[[Page S12148]]\n\nAmerican taxpayers will see a cut, particularly the middle class in our \ncountry. The Congressional Research Service has indicated that all \nAmericans, particularly the middle class and those with incomes up to \n$150,000, will see tax relief. The President's panel, the advisory \npanel that reported today, itself said that most taxpayers under its \nplan will not see much difference in their taxes.\n  We are going to have a battle of ideas. We hear often that there \nought to be a debate about specific proposals. Now we have one. The \nadvisory panel that reported to the President of the United States \nsaid, by their own analysis, that most taxpayers under their proposal \nwill not see much difference in their taxes.\n  Under the proposal I have made for a fair, flat tax rate, what is \ngoing to happen in this country, according to the independent analysts \nat the Congressional Research Service, is that millions of middle-class \npeople will get a tax cut, and all Americans with incomes up to \n$150,000 will see tax relief. Where the panel throws strikes at the \nmiddle class, I say it is time to give the middle class a break. I \ncertainly question the fairness of the President further cutting tax \nrates for those who are the most affluent in this country while the gap \nwidens between those who depend on their wages to support their \nfamilies.\n  Finally, to illustrate the contrast, the proposal made by the panel \ntoday does nothing to deal with the hemorrhage that we have in the \nFederal budget. My proposal, on the other hand, according to the \nCongressional Research Service, makes a real start at reducing the \nbudget deficit and would actually whittle down these budget deficits \napproximately $100 billion over the next 5 years.\n  In summary, I am very troubled by the recommendations coming from the \nadvisory panel today because they continue to twist the Tax Code away \nfrom equal treatment of all income, widening the chasm between people \nwho get wages and people who collect dividends. I am troubled that it \nhits middle-class Americans especially hard, but it treats the special \ninterests and the affluent with kid gloves. And I simply cannot find a \nsound rationale for adding massively to the country's deficit the way \nthe advisory panel would do. Making the Tax Code simpler and flatter is \ngoing to help make it fairer. What is really needed is to provide \nactual, concrete tax relief to the middle class and to treat work and \nwealth equally. That was what was done in 1986.\n  I have been asked several times since introducing this legislation, \nHow is anything going to happen now? The advisory panel's proposal \nprobably goes off to the Federal agency on collecting dust, where they \nsend these commission reports that do not get a lot of attention. But I \nwill tell you that I think there is a chance to strike a chord \nout across the country with the middle class. That was what was done in \n1986 when, on a bipartisan basis, President Reagan and several leading \nDemocrats said, as I am suggesting tonight: America can do better than \nto tax the middle-class person's wages at a higher rate than it does \nthe people who make their money on capital gains and dividends. If it \nwas good enough for Ronald Reagan in 1986, I think it ought to be \npretty appealing to this Congress tonight and in the days ahead.\n\n  Now that the debate has been joined, we have the advisory panel's \nproposal which shows again what their priorities are, which I have \noutlined tonight. I think they are unfortunate. The legislation I have \nauthored would give significant tax cuts to middle-class folks by \neliminating scores of exemptions and deductions and would reduce the \nFederal deficit at a time when these budget books are hemorrhaging.\n  The debate is joined. There are two clear alternatives, two clear \napproaches to this issue of how to approach tax reform now on the \ntable. I look forward to the debate. It is my hope that the Congress, \nas was done in 1986, can decide this is time to cleanse the Tax Code. \nEver since 1986, one break, one exemption, one deduction after another \nhas been added to the Code. Unfortunately, not many of those breaks \nwent to the middle class. They did go to the fortunate few. Now we have \na budget deficit that is hemorrhaging and a middle class that is \nhurting.\n  Folks want to know what the difference is between the various parties \nwith respect to tax reform. The difference could not be clearer tonight \nbetween what I have proposed, a Fair Flat Tax Act, and what the \nadvisory panel proposed this afternoon. I hope the Senate can come \ntogether, as was done in 1986, and cleanse the tax system again, since \nthat exercise has not been pursued in 20 years. It can be done on a \nbipartisan basis as was done in 1986.\n  I look forward to working with colleagues. I serve on the Finance \nCommittee where such a debate will start. I look forward to working \nwith colleagues on a bipartisan basis.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/01/senate-section/article/S12148-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 8:30 A.M.
