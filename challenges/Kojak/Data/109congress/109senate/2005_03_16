Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. Con. Res. 18, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 18) setting forth the \n     congressional budget for the United States Government for the \n     fiscal year 2006 and including the appropriate budgetary \n     levels for fiscal years 2005 and 2007 through 2010.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Byrd Amendment No. 158, to provide adequate funding of $1.4 \n     billion in fiscal year 2006 to preserve a national intercity \n     passenger rail system.\n       Cantwell Amendment No. 168, to strike section 201(a)(4) \n     relative to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n       Akaka Amendment No. 149, to increase veterans medical care \n     by $2.8 billion in 2006.\n       Ensign Amendment No. 171, to increase veterans medical care \n     by $410,000,000 in fiscal year 2006.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, is recognized for up to 20 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as we all know, this budget cuts a score of critical \ndomestic programs: food for women and infants; community development \nblock grants for cities, which cities use for vital purposes; and \nhealth and education programs for children. That is just a few. It cuts \nMedicaid by $15 billion over 5 years. It zeros out reimbursements to \nStates and counties of the cost of incarcerating criminal aliens. It is \nan unfunded mandate in that regard. Yet this budget contains $41.3 \nmillion for nuclear weapons initiatives including $8.5 million for a \nnuclear program that scientists say is impossible to achieve.\n\n[[Page S2760]]\n\n  The seriousness of the issue and the clear intent of this \nadministration to renew funding this year for this nuclear initiative \nthat was zeroed out by the Congress last year compel me to come to the \nfloor today.\n  President Bush's fiscal year 2006 budget calls for $8.5 million, \nincluding $4 million for the Department of Energy and $4.5 million for \nthe Department of Defense, for the research and development of a \nnuclear bunker buster, a 100-kiloton weapon called the robust earth \nnuclear penetrator. The purpose of the research is to determine whether \na missile casing on a 100-kiloton warhead can survive a thrust into the \nearth and take out a hardened and deeply buried military target without \nspewing millions of cubic feet of radioactive debris into the \natmosphere. Scientists know that the laws of physics will not allow \nthat to happen.\n  It includes $25 million to lower the Nevada test site time-to-test \nreadiness from the current 24 to 36 months to 18 months. This sends a \nclear signal of an urgent move to begin underground nuclear testing as \nsoon as possible. This is despite the fact that our country has had a \nmoratorium on nuclear testing since 1992. We have had it for more than \n13 years.\n  It also contains $7.8 million for a so-called modern pit facility. \nThis is a facility to build 450 new pits. These are the nuclear \ntriggers for nuclear weapons, the shells in which the fissile material \nis contained and detonated. This is 450 new pits a year, some of which \nwould be designed for new nuclear weapons.\n  Currently the United States has approximately 15,000 warheads. Under \nthe Moscow Treaty, the United States is to decrease its strategic \nnuclear force to 1,700 to 2,200 by 2012. To maintain a 2,200-warhead \nforce at replacement level--and this is important--we would only need \nto build 50 pits a year, not 450 which is called for in this budget. So \nwhy build a new facility unless there are plans underway to develop a \nnew generation of nuclear weapons?\n  Perhaps because the explosion and use of nuclear weapons took place \nat the end of World War II, we forget what it is like. I hope people \nwill look at this and see what it is like. This is Hiroshima. This is \nat the end of World War II. This is a 15-kiloton nuclear weapon, not a \n100-kiloton nuclear weapon. This is incomprehensible to me. This is \nwhat the Enola Gay dropped on Hiroshima. It cleared bare 4 square \nmiles. It killed immediately 90,000 people. It caused hundreds of \nthousands of people to die of radiation sickness. Again, why fund this \nprogram?\n  Congress made a strong statement last year. We took out the \nappropriations for these new nuclear weapons. This defunding was made \npossible by the leadership of Representative David Hobson, the chairman \nof the House Appropriations Energy Committee, who was successful, with \nour support, in eliminating $27.5 million in funding for this 100-\nkiloton nuclear bunker buster and $9 million for the advanced weapons \nconcepts initiative. This is a fallacious concept of creating low yield \ntactical nuclear weapons, under 5 kilotons, to use on a battlefield no \nless. Who would ever want to send their sons and daughters to any war \nwhere the battlefield had nuclear weapons? It also eliminated funding \nto lower the time-to-test readiness at the Nevada test site to 18 \nmonths and limited funding for the Modern Pit Facility to $7 million.\n  Congress spoke last year. We said: We will not approve appropriations \nfor this program. And yet once again those appropriations have crept \ninto this budget.\n  I will take a few minutes to make that evident to Members of the \nSenate. Last year was a consequential victory for those of us who \nbelieve very deeply--and I might say passionately--that the United \nStates will not be safer because of this program and that the United \nStates sends the wrong signal to the rest of the world by reopening the \nnuclear door and beginning the testing and development of a new \ngeneration of nuclear weapons.\n  This year, our message is clear: Don't reopen this nuclear door. \nThose of us who are appropriators will once again try to remove this \nfunding from the budget.\n  I am so disappointed to learn that the administration has requested \nfunding again this year for a 100-kiloton nuclear bunker buster, to \nlower the time-to-test readiness at the Nevada test site to 18 months, \nand to fund a modern plutonium pit facility that could produce 450 new \nplutonium pits a year when only 50 are needed.\n  There should be no doubt that this is the Secretary of Defense's \nprogram. He is determined to get it funded. It is that Secretary who \nrequested the Secretary of Energy to place $4 million in the energy \nbudget and $4.5 million in the defense budget. This is very clever. In \nthis way Secretary Rumsfeld hopes to get it done in the defense budget, \nif he can't through energy appropriations.\n  I ask that the Senate know that the development of a 100-kiloton \nrobust nuclear earth penetrator is simply not possible without spewing \nmillions of tons of radioactive material and killing large numbers of \npeople.\n  Secondly, the development of new nuclear weapons will only undermine \nour antiproliferation efforts and will make our Nation less safe, not \nmore safe.\n  And thirdly, as a nation, we are sending the wrong message, a message \nthat will only encourage nuclear proliferation by others. In fact, it \nalready has.\n  The bottom line: There is simply no such thing as a clean or usable \n100-kiloton nuclear bunker buster that could destroy a hardened and \ndeeply buried military target without spewing radiation.\n  Consider this: A 1-kiloton nuclear weapon, detonated 25 to 50 feet \nunderground, would dig a crater the size of Ground Zero in New York and \neject 1 million cubic feet of radioactive debris into the air. Given \nthe insurmountable physics problems associated with burrowing a warhead \ndeep into the earth, you would need a weapon with more than 100 \nkilotons of yield to destroy an underground target at a depth of 1,000 \nfeet. Yet the maximum feasible depth a bunker buster can penetrate is \nabout 35 feet. At that depth, a 100-kiloton bunker buster would scatter \n100 million cubic feet of radioactive debris into the atmosphere.\n  There is no known missile casing that can survive a 1,000-foot thrust \ninto the earth to avoid overwhelming and catastrophic consequences. \nThat is not me saying this, that is science saying this.\n  Let me give you the words of the head of the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration, if you don't trust me. At the March 2, 2005, \nHouse Armed Services Strategic Forces Subcommittee, Congresswoman Ellen \nTauscher asked Ambassador Linton Brooks the following question:\n\n       I just want to know, is there any way a [robust nuclear \n     earth penetrator] of any size that we would drop will not \n     produce a huge amount of radioactive debris?\n\n  The answer, according to the Ambassador:\n\n       No, there is not.\n\n  When Congresswoman Tauscher asked him how deep he thought a bunker \nbuster could go, using modern scientific concepts--in other words, here \nwe get to the missile casing--he said:\n\n     . . . a couple of tens of meters maybe. I mean certainly--I \n     really must apologize for my lack of precision, if we in the \n     administration have suggested that it was possible to have a \n     bomb that penetrated far enough to trap all fallout. I don't \n     believe that--I don't believe the laws of physics will ever \n     let that be true.\n\n  So here we have the administration saying what we who have opposed \nthis program from the start have said. The laws of physics will never \nallow the development of a ``clean'' 100-kiloton robust nuclear earth \npenetrator.\n  Again, simply stated, there is no casing that will withstand a 1,000-\nfoot thrust into the earth--the depth at which a spewing of \nradioactivity might be contained. Such an admission begs the question: \nWhy are we even spending a dime on this research? Or as Secretary \nRumsfeld said to me in a Defense Appropriations Subcommittee hearing \nwith a shrug, ``Oh, this is just a study.''\n  Do I believe that answer? Absolutely not. This has never been about a \nstudy. It has been about the intent of the administration to develop \nnew nuclear weapons, and I have followed this for a long time now.\n  This year, this budget funds $8.5 million. In fiscal year 2007, it \nincreases to $17.5 million, including $14 million for the Department of \nEnergy and $3.5 million for the Pentagon.\n  While the administration is silent this year on how much it plans to\n\n[[Page S2761]]\n\nspend on the program in future years, last year they let it all out. \nLast year's budget request called for spending $485 million on a 100-\nkiloton nuclear bunker buster over 5 years, which scientists say is \nimpossible to devise. The laws of physics won't allow it, unless you \nare going to prepare one that is going to spew tons of radioactivity.\n  Let me, for a moment, mention the policies underlying this \ninitiative. These policies began in 2002 with the document called the \nNuclear Posture Review. That document places nuclear weapons as part of \nthe strategic triad for the first time in our history, therefore, \nblurring the distinction between conventional and nuclear weapons--a \nvery bad policy decision.\n  Then take National Security Directive 17, which came out later that \nyear, which indicated for the first time in America's history that we \nwould engage in a first use of nuclear weapons--a historic statement. \nWe have never had a no-first-use policy, but we have never said that we \nwould countenance a first use of nuclear weapons. And in National \nSecurity Directive 17 we do just that. We say we would engage in a \nfirst use of nuclear weapons--again, that is a historic statement--to \nrespond to a chemical or biological attack against certain nations. The \nNuclear Posture Review named seven nations against whom we would \ncountenance a nuclear attack. One of those nations legally is a nuclear \nnation. This is ridiculous and foolish policy, and it jeopardizes the \nfuture of all Americans. But what it does also is it encourages other \nnations to develop their own nuclear weapons, thereby putting American \nlives and our national security at risk. That is why the North Koreans \nare moving ahead. They see what we are going to do. They see that we \nhave said we would enter into a first use of nuclear weapons. North \nKorea is one of the seven nations named. That is what is happening in \nIran now. Iran is one of the seven nations named. Other countries are \nnow looking at advanced weapons concepts, based on the fact that we \nhave moved in this direction.\n\n  The next nuclear nonproliferation review conference is in May, and it \nwill allow parties to the treaty to measure progress in implementing \ntheir obligation and to discuss additional steps to meet the treaty's \nobjectives.\n  In public statements--this is the hypocrisy--the administration \nrecognizes the importance of the NPT. Last week, President Bush stated \nthat the NPT ``represents a key legal barrier to nuclear weapons \nproliferation and makes a critical contribution to international \nsecurity,'' and that ``the United States is firmly committed to its \nobligations under the treaty.''\n  If we are indeed serious about strengthening our nonproliferation \nefforts and increasing international nuclear security, we should lead \nin reducing nuclear arsenals; we should lead in preventing nuclear \nproliferation; and we should know that a production of a 100-kiloton \nnuclear bunker buster is sheer hypocrisy on our part.\n  Make no mistake, the rest of the world is watching us and paying \nclose attention to what we do. I believe the United States can take \nseveral actions to make better use of our resources and demonstrate our \ncommitment to keeping the world's most dangerous weapons out of the \nhands of the most dangerous people. We have to strengthen the Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty at this May 2005 review conference.\n  This includes supporting tougher inspections to monitor compliance, \nmore effective controls on sensitive technologies, accelerated programs \nto safeguard and eliminate nuclear weapon usable materials, and \nagreement that no state may withdraw from the treaty and escape \nresponsibility for prior violations of the treaty.\n  We should expand and accelerate Nunn-Lugar threat reduction programs. \nI hear Senator after Senator saying they support the Nunn-Lugar \nprogram. We should provide the necessary resources to improve security \nand take the rest of the Soviet era nuclear chemical and biological \nweapons arsenal and infrastructure out of circulation.\n  Third, we should strengthen the ability of the DOE's global threat \nreduction initiative to secure and remove nuclear weapons usable \nmaterial from vulnerable sites around the world.\n  Last year, Senator Domenici and I sponsored an amendment to the 2005 \nNational Defense Authorization Act, which authorized the Secretary of \nEnergy to lead an accelerated, comprehensive worldwide effort to \nsecure, remove, and eliminate the threat by these materials.\n  Finally, we should improve--this has to do with the bunker buster--\nour intelligence capabilities in relation to underground targets and \nexpand conventional options to put them at risk. Every underground \ntarget has entry and exit, has air vents, presents a way to take them \nout with conventional weapons. That is what we should be doing instead \nof exploring, doing research and development of a 100-kiloton nuclear \nbunker buster, which science says cannot be done without the spewing of \nmillions of tons radiation. History repeats itself.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for--may I have up to 10 \nminutes? I don't think I will go that long.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is out of the amendment time, and \nthere is 45 minutes on our side. We have many speakers. Can the Senator \ngo for 7 minutes?\n  Mr. WYDEN. That would be gracious. I will try to do that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If Senator Specter has not appeared by then, we can \nprovide more time.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, those who advocate drilling in the Arctic \nclaim that the drilling is needed to reduce our Nation's dependence on \nforeign oil. But what is included in the Senate budget resolution \ndoesn't increase U.S. energy security. To the contrary, it is a license \nto export Alaskan oil outside the United States. With the inflated \nrevenue projections of $2.5 billion from drilling in the Arctic \nincluded in the budget, the Federal Government will be forced to sell \nthe oil to the highest bidder to even come close to reaching that \namount.\n  Under the Senate budget, if the highest price is in South America, \noil from that wildlife refuge would have to go to South America. If the \nhighest price is in the Far East, Arctic oil would have to go to the \nFar East. If the highest price is in the Middle East, Arctic oil would \nhave to go to the Middle East.\n  With the weak dollar, it would be a virtual certainty that the \nhighest price for Arctic oil would be outside our country. It would not \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil one drop to export Arctic oil \noverseas, but that is exactly what could happen under the Senate budget \nresolution.\n  Now, last Congress, the House, in passing its Energy bill, recognized \nthat drilling in the Arctic wildlife refuge won't help our Nation's \nenergy security if the oil from that drilling is exported overseas. The \nHouse-passed Energy bill explicitly prohibited the export of oil from \nthe Arctic wildlife refuge. But the Senate budget resolution fails to \ninclude an export prohibition. In fact, it invites exports by assuming \nrevenues that can only be met by requiring the oil to be sold to the \nhighest bidder, at a time when the dollar is weak.\n  If the goal is energy security, then including the Arctic drilling in \nthe budget resolution in this fashion is the wrong way to go about it. \nWe can get more energy security, and we can get it sooner than from \nArctic oil drilling under the Senate budget resolution.\n  Last week, the President renewed his push for drilling in the Arctic \nby arguing it would produce nearly 10 million barrels per day. But the \nPresident acknowledged that that amount of oil would not be produced \nuntil 2025. We can get that much energy security and more, and we can \nget it now instead of waiting until 2025. We can get that added energy \nsecurity by changing the current policies on exports of oil and\n\n[[Page S2762]]\n\npetroleum and providing the right incentives for producers to develop \nthe billions of barrels of recoverable oil that are in U.S. reserves \nbut are not being developed today.\n  Right now our country is exporting about 1 million barrels a day of \npetroleum products. That happens every single day. We could in effect \nget 1 million barrels a day more oil for our country, 10 percent more \nenergy security, and we could get it right now by ending those exports.\n  By comparison, the administration's Energy Information Administration \nsays the amount of oil that the President says would be produced in the \nArctic would only reduce our Nation's dependence by 3 percent, from 68 \npercent to 65 percent dependence on foreign oil. I seriously doubt the \nOPEC cartel will stop its anticompetitive practices because of a tiny \nincrease in Arctic production 20 years from now that even the Energy \nAdministration says would reduce our dependence on foreign oil by 3 \npercent. Our country can get more than three times that amount of \nincreased energy security and we can get it now rather than 2025 by \nstopping exports of U.S.-produced petroleum products, and under the \nunrestricted export language of the Senate budget resolution we could \nend up with no additional energy security--no additional energy \nsecurity, absolutely not. We can do much better than a 3-percent \nincrease in energy security. We can do better than the 10-percent \nincrease in security our country would get from eliminating exports. In \nfact, our country could produce an additional 40 billion barrels of \noil, enough to replace all of our country's imports of oil for the next \n10 years, and we could get that additional oil from existing reserves \nthat could be produced in our country if the right incentives were \nprovided.\n  If we want to get serious about energy security, we can start today. \nWe should eliminate the budget resolution's license to export Arctic \noil out of our country. We should replace the budget's Arctic oil \nexport license with policies that provide real energy security for our \nNation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID.

I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 173\n\n  I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for himself \n     and Mr. Harkin, proposes an amendment numbered 173.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: Increase discretionary health and education funding by \n                            $2,000,000,000)\n\n       On page 17, line 16, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 17, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 16, increase the amount by $1,500,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 17, increase the amount by $1,500,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 14, decrease the amount by $2,000,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 15, decrease the amount by $2,000,000,000.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, at the outset I submit a statement for \nthe record and ask that it be included in its entirety at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. In order to summarize, since we have a relatively \nlimited period of time, this amendment provides for increasing funding \nfor the Department of Education by $500 million, which would bring it \nup to level funding, and an addition of $1.5 billion for the National \nInstitutes of Health, and the offset would be across the board from \nFunction 920. This reduction would not cut any programs but simply \nreduce administrative expenses, travel, and consulting services by .237 \npercent, which is minuscule in the overall scheme of things, I admit, \nvery minor compared to the importance of having additional funding in \neducation and additional funding in the National Institutes of Health.\n  NIH has made remarkable advances on an enormous list of very major \ndiseases and they are worth itemizing because each one of these strikes \nthousands of Americans. They include:\n  Autism, stroke, obesity, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, spinal muscular \natrophy, scleroderma, ALS, muscular dystrophy, diabetes, osteoporosis, \ncancers, including breast, cervical and ovarian, lymphoma, multiple \nmyeloma, prostate, pancreatic, colon, head and neck, brain, lung, \npediatric renal disorders, multiple sclerosis, deafness and other \ncommunication disorders, glaucoma, macular degeneration, sickle cell \nanemia, heart disease, spinal cord injury, sudden infant death \nsyndrome, arthritis, schizophrenia and other mental disorders, \npolycystic kidney disease, hepatitis, Cooley's anemia, primary immune \ndeficiency disorders, and the list goes on and on.\n  As I read them off to itemize them, they are abstractions to people \nwho suffer from these ailments. To families of people who suffer these \nailments, they are catastrophic. Take someone who has autism, take \nsomeone who has Alzheimer's, this disrupts the family, these ailments \nare overwhelming. The National Institutes of Health has had increases \nin this budget on a commitment by this body to double NIH, and we have \nincreased the funding very substantially. But last year and the year \nbefore and this year, the funding well has not proceeded as it should. \nWhen you talk about a budget of $28 billion for the National Institutes \nof Health, when you have an overall budget of approximately $2.67 \ntrillion, $28 billion is totally insufficient.\n  If there is not an increase in funding for the National Institutes of \nHealth, there will be 402 less grants awarded next year than last year. \nThe increase of less than $200 million does not begin to approximate \nthe replacement rate for chemical, biomedical research which is 3.5 \npercent. We have $1.7 billion which is being applied by NIH to \nbioterrorism. With all due respect, that ought to come out of homeland \nsecurity, bioterrorism. It is coming out of the NIH budget because it \nis a medical issue. If there is not additional funding, these are some \nof the points of impact on the National Institutes of Health:\n  They will be unable to test safety of new behavioral treatments for \nautism; unable to initiate phase 3 to determine the relationship \nbetween infection and cardiovascular disease; unable to expand research \non early identification preventing procurement impairment of newborns; \ndelay by 1 year more research with industry to develop vaccines for \nhepatitis C infections; delay the evaluation of promising vaccines in a \nvariety of contexts. It will delay programs for developing computer \nmodels for responding to infectious disease outbreaks such as avian \nflu, as well as bioterrorism attacks--here again these are \nabstractions, but to the people they hit, they are catastrophic--unable \nto expand the development of methamphetamine addiction; unable \nto initiate multicellular studies of aquaimmune hepatitis, and the list \ngoes on and on.\n\n  The subject of adequacy of NIH research is one which I thought was of \nenormous importance before I was\n\n[[Page S2763]]\n\nelected to the Senate in 1980, and my initial assignment on \nAppropriations took me to the Subcommittee on Health and Human \nServices. I have always been an advocate for increasing NIH funding. \nThen when I took over the chairmanship of the subcommittee in 1995, in \na position to establish priorities, the Senate voted to double NIH \nfunding, but then in the first year following defeated an effort to add \n$1 billion. Senator Harkin and I have formed a partnership on a \nbipartisan basis, and he has had the gavel when the Democrats took over \nfor 17 months in 2001 and when we have had a transfer of the gavel, it \nhas been seamless, he and I and this partnership of established \npriorities within our subcommittee even when this body did not grant \nincreases to NIH. We have found the money by establishing priorities. \nBut the fact is that opportunity is gone. It is gone because there have \nbeen decreases in the other facets of the budget.\n  The Department of Labor budget has been cut by 3\\1/2\\ percent this \nyear. I don't know how we are going to fund the necessary programs for \nworker safety. The education budget, believe it or not, has been cut by \nalmost 1 percent, by some $500 million. I will come to that in a moment \non the aspect of this amendment which seeks to raise education funding \nby $500 million. But it is not possible anymore to juggle the books. We \ncannot juggle the books and find money and priorities to add an \nadditional $1.5 billion to the National Institutes of Health.\n  My interest in medical research occurred long before I developed a \ncurrent problem, which has been publicized, with Hodgkin's, and I am \nglad to say that there is a cure for the particular problem I had. But \nin many forms of cancer there is no cure. President Nixon declared war \non cancer in 1972. Here we are 33 years later, the wealthiest country \nin the world, the greatest talent in the world on research, and we \nspend $2.6 trillion. We spend it in many directions which are \nchallenged by many people in our society, but we allocate $28 billion \nto NIH. And it is totally, totally, totally insufficient, and for \nfamilies where they suffer from Alzheimer's or heart disease or the \nlong list of maladies I recited, it is simply unacceptable. I know the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee has enormous problems. I \ncompliment him on taking on what is probably the toughest job in the \nSenate, to try to find a way to make allocations on the budget.\n  But among the priorities, I will say that the expression is \nfrequently used, ``none is higher.'' Well, that means it could be tied \nwith a lot of others. But I would say health is highest. If you don't \nhave your health, you can't do anything else. I could give an extended \ndissertation on that particular proposition because it has struck home \nto me. Not to overly personalize the matter, but when you go through \nthe regimen for Hodgkin's, they fill your body full of poisons to fight \nthe poisons which are in your body. It is quite a war of the worlds as \nit battles through you. It underscores the importance of health. For \nthe people who were suffering from the long list I recited, it is the \nbeginning and end of every day.\n  We ought to win the war on cancer. In the particular institute of a \nvery distinguished doctor, John Glick, who is my oncologist, they had \nplans for a 57 percent increase in their funding. That was reduced to \n42 percent. And that was eliminated. That is symbolic of what is going \non across America. That reduction in funding means a lot of pain, a lot \nof suffering, and a lot of deaths. We have the capacity to do something \nabout it. This $1.5 billion is a modest step.\n  Now on to education. The President's budget came over with a .9-\npercent decrease in education funding. It is a little hard for me to \nunderstand, given the importance of education. The Governors meet, the \nindustrialists meet, and they decry the inadequacy of education in \nAmerica. While the Federal Government provides a relatively small \npercentage of funding, we do have the leadership position.\n  Just last week, the Senate passed, 99 to 0, the reauthorization of \nthe Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Program, which is a $2 \nbillion program. But on the Education Department budget, this program \nis zeroed out. It was $2 billion, and we voted for it 99 to nothing. We \nlooked good when we had the authorization vote, but when it comes to \nputting our money where our mouth is, we are AWOL, we are gone, we are \nnot there.\n  There is an enormous number of educational programs which have been \ncut out totally. The GEAR UP program, which has been funded by my \nsubcommittee over the last 6 years, which takes seventh graders and \ngives them mentoring and puts them on the right course through high \nschool, an enormously important program not only for education but for \ncrime control, where there is really the stark alternative of becoming \na juvenile delinquent or becoming an educated America--it is gone.\n  The list is too long to read.\n  I ask unanimous consent the full text of these programs which are \nbeing cut be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         EDUCATION DEPARTMENT FY 2006 DISCRETIONARY BUDGET, TERMINATIONS\n                                             [Dollars in

The amendment would add to the funding already \n     included in the resolution for the National Institutes of \n     Health and the Department of Education. The amendment is \n     offset by an across-the-board reduction in Function 920. This \n     reduction would not cut programs, but simply reduce \n     administrative expenses, travel, and consulting services by \n     0.237 percent.\n       This amendment would provide NIH with a $1.5 billion \n     increase over the President's budget. While this sounds like \n     a tremendous increase, in reality it provides only 5.6 \n     percent more than the previous year and provides a slight \n     increase over biomedical research inflation.\n       As chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee for Labor, \n     Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies, I \n     have said many times that the National Institutes of Health \n     is the crown jewel of the Federal Government--perhaps the \n     only jewel of the Federal Government. When I came to the \n     Senate in 1981, NIH spending totaled $3.6 billion. The FY \n     2003 omnibus appropriations bill contained $27.2 billion for \n     the NIH which completed the doubling begun in FY 1998. The \n     successes realized by this investment in NIH have spawned \n     revolutionary advances in our knowledge and treatment for \n     diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's \n     disease, mental illnesses, diabetes, osteoporosis, heart \n     disease, ALS and many others. It is clear that Congress' \n     commitment to the NIH is paying off. Now it is crucial that \n     increased funding be continued in order to translate these \n     advances into additional treatments and cures. Our investment \n     has resulted in new generations of AIDS drugs which are \n     reducing the presence of the AIDS virus in HIV infected \n     persons to nearly undetectable levels. Death rates from \n     cancer have begun a steady decline. With the sequencing of \n     the human genome, we will begin, over the next few years, to \n     reap the benefits in many fields of research. And if \n     scientists are correct, stem cell research could result in a \n     veritable fountain of youth by replacing diseased or damaged \n     cells. I anxiously await the results of all of these avenues \n     of remarkable research. This is the time to seize the \n     scientific opportunities that lie before us.\n       On May 21, 1997, the Senate passed a Sense of the Senate \n     resolution stating that funding for the NIH should be doubled \n     over 5 years. Regrettably, even though the resolution was \n     passed by an overwhelming vote of 98 to nothing, the Budget \n     Resolution contained a $100 million reduction for health \n     programs. That prompted Senator Harkin and myself to offer an \n     amendment to the budget resolution to add $1.1 billion to \n     carry out the expressed sense of the Senate to increase NIH \n     funding. Unfortunately, our amendment was tabled by a vote of \n     63-37. We were extremely disappointed that, while the Senate \n     had expressed its druthers on a resolution, it was simply \n     unwilling to put up the actual dollars to accomplish this \n     vital goal.\n       The following year, Senator Harkin and I again introduced \n     an amendment to the Budget Resolution which called for a $2 \n     billion increase for the NIH. While we gained more support on \n     this vote than in the previous year, our amendment was again \n     tabled by a vote of 57-41. Not to be deterred, Senator Harkin \n     and I again went to work with our subcommittee and we were \n     able to add an additional $2 billion to the NIH account for \n     fiscal year 1999.\n       In fiscal year 2000, Senator Harkin and I offered another \n     amendment to the Budget Resolution to add $1.4 billion to the \n     health accounts, over and above the $600 million increase \n     which had already been provided by the Budget Committee. \n     Despite this amendment's defeat by a vote of 47-52, we were \n     able to provide a $2.3 billion increase for NIH in the fiscal \n     year 2000 appropriation's bill.\n       In fiscal year 2001, Senator Harkin and I again offered an \n     amendment to the Budget Resolution to increase funding for \n     health programs by $1.6 billion. This amendment passed by a \n     vote of 55-45. This victory brought the NIH increase to $2.7 \n     billion for fiscal year 2001. However, after late night \n     conference negotiations with the House, the funding for \n     NIH was cut by $200 million below that amount.\n       In fiscal year 2002, the budget resolution once again fell \n     short of the amount necessary to achieve the NIH doubling. \n     Senator Harkin and I, along with nine other Senators offered \n     an amendment to add an additional $700 million to the \n     resolution to achieve our goal. The vote was 96-4. The Senate \n     Labor-HHS Subcommittee reported a bill recommending $23.7 \n     billion, an increase of $3.4 billion over the previous year's \n     funding. But during conference negotiations with the House, \n     we once again fell short by $410 million. That meant that in \n     order to stay on a path to double NIH, we would need to \n     provide an increase of $3.7 billion in the fiscal year 2003. \n     The fiscal year 2003 omnibus appropriations bill contained \n     the additional $3.7 billion, which achieved the doubling \n     effort. In FY 2004, I and Senator Harkin offered an amendment \n     to add an additional $2.8 billion to the budget resolution to \n     ensure that the momentum achieved by the doubling could be \n     maintained and translated into cures. The vote was 96-1. \n     Unfortunately, the amendment was dropped in conference. We \n     worked hard to find enough funding for a $1 billion increase \n     in FY 2004. We fought long and hard to make the doubling of \n     funding a reality, but until treatments and cures are found \n     for the many maladies that continue to plague our society, we \n     must continue our fight.\n       In FY 2005, once again, Senator Harkin, Senator Collins and \n     I offered an amendment to add $2 billion to discretionary \n     health spending, including NIH. The amendment passed 72-24. \n     However, the subcommittee's allocation did not reflect this \n     increase. The final conference agreement contained an \n     increase of $800 million over the FY 2004 funding level.\n       I, like millions of Americans, have benefited tremendously \n     from the investment we have made in the National Institutes \n     of Health and the amendment that we offer today will continue \n     to carry forward the important research work of the world's \n     premier medical research facility.\n       My amendment also intends to ensure that discretionary \n     funding for the Department of Education is not cut below the \n     amount provided by Congress last year. The resolution \n     currently assumes a cut of $500 million below the FY 2005 \n     appropriation. My amendment would add $500 million to \n     Function 500 in order to prevent such a reduction.\n       Many members have pointed out that the budget for the \n     Department of Education has been increased significantly over \n     the past several years. In fact, funding has been raised from \n     $24.7 billion in FY 1995 to $56.6 billion last year, an \n     increase of 129 percent. My subcommittee has taken the lead \n     in providing increases for Title I grants for Disadvantaged \n     Students, Special Education and Pell grants. President Bush \n     has made increases in these important programs a priority, \n     which is why funding for Title I grants is up 45 percent \n     since No Child Left Behind was passed in 2001, funding for \n     Special Education is up 67 percent since FY 2001 and Pell \n     grants are up 41 percent from the level when President \n     Clinton was in office.\n       However, I am concerned that the budget resolution will \n     force my subcommittee to make very difficult choices and cut \n     one education program for another. For example, the budget \n     proposes to eliminate $1.3 billion in funding for the Perkins \n     Vocational and\n\n[[Page S2765]]\n\n     Technical Education program, $306.5 million for the GEAR UP \n     program and $467 million for certain TRIO activities in order \n     to fund a high school reform initiative. Yet, the Senate \n     voted on Friday 99-0 to reauthorize the Perkins program, \n     sending a powerful message to my subcommittee about the \n     importance of this program.\n       I believe that education is a capital investment. As \n     District Attorney in Philadelphia, I have seen what happens \n     when the right investments aren't made and kids turn to the \n     streets without safe and productive learning environments. My \n     amendment seeks to help States, colleges, teachers and \n     families ensure that a quality education is available for \n     all.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains of my 22.5 minutes?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 8.5 minutes.\n  Who seeks time? The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are now on the third day of the budget \nresolution.\n  I inquire of the desk, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. On the Specter amendment, there is \n22.5 minutes in opposition.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Could the Chair inform me how much time is left on the \nresolution?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority has 11 hours 4 \nminutes, the minority has 9 hours 23 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to alert my colleagues that the \ntime is rapidly vanishing. We want to use this time we have efficiently \nand effectively. We don't want to have dead time here on the floor. We \nwant Senators on both sides to have every opportunity to offer their \namendments, so it is critically important that Senators take the \nopportunity that is available to them and come to discuss the \namendments that are in front of us and discuss the amendments they may \nwant to offer so this time is effectively used.\n  I know we are going to get into the situation where Senators are \ngoing to come to us and say: Can't we have some time? There is not \ngoing to be any time very shortly, and then we will go into vote-arama, \nin which there will be very limited time. I wanted to alert my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. GREGG. I believe the Senator from Wyoming was going to speak in \nopposition to the amendment of the Senator from Pennsylvania. He was \ngoing to talk about that. Did the Senator from North Dakota wish to go \nforward off the resolution? Is that the Senator's plan?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That was my plan, take time off the resolution.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is how the time is being \ncharged.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have seen a dramatic deterioration in \nthe budget situation since 2000. One can see what has happened. Back in \n2000, we actually had a budget surplus. Then, despite the President's \nassurances that his fiscal policy would not lead to an expansion of \ndeficits and debt, that is exactly what we have seen. In fact, we are \nnow at record deficit levels, the biggest deficits we have ever had.\n  It is not just with respect to deficits that we have a problem. We \nare also seeing exploding debt. I remember so well, back in 2001, the \nCongressional Budget Office produced this chart of possible outcomes \nfor the deficit. They said this was the range of possible outcomes. \nThey adopted, in their forecast, a midrange. That was adopted by the \nPresident as well. They said, based on that scenario, that we would see \n$5.6 trillion of surpluses over the next 10 years, so many of my \nRepublican colleagues assured me: Don't worry, we will get even more \nmoney because of the tax cuts. I remember being told repeatedly: You \nare going to get more money because of the tax cuts.\n  We didn't get more money. Here is what actually happened. This was \nthe range of possible outcomes, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice. Now we can look back and see what actually happened. What \nactually happened was the deficits were far worse, they were below the \nbottom of their range of projected outcomes. All of that talk about how \nthe tax cuts would generate more revenue just proved to be wrong.\n  The Comptroller General of the United States, the head of the General \nAccounting Office, warns us now that the fiscal outlook is worse than \nclaimed. He says:\n\n       The simple truth is that our Nation's financial condition \n     is much worse than advertised.\n\n  The Comptroller General has it exactly right. Our fiscal condition, \nour financial condition is much worse than advertised. Why? Because \nwhen the President says to us he is going to reduce the deficit, he is \ngoing to cut it in half over the next 5 years, the only way he gets \nthere is he just leaves out things.\n  What does he leave out? First of all, he leaves out of his budget any \nwar costs past September 30 of this year. We have money for this year \nin a supplemental. Some of that will be spent next year as well. But \nthat is $82 billion. The Congressional Budget Office says we ought to \nbe budgeting $383 billion for residual war costs--Afghanistan, Iraq, \nthe war on terror--but it is not in the President's budget.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator from North Dakota yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I certainly would.\n  Mr. SPECTER. This is a procedural question, not a substantive \nquestion. I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  On the scheduling of business, I have to chair an Appropriations \nsubcommittee hearing on Health and Human Services at 10:30. We \nscheduled this amendment at 9:30. I wonder if I could prevail upon the \nSenator from North Dakota to permit Senator Enzi to respond to my \narguments so that I can finish, conclude, and then ask unanimous \nconsent, if that is agreeable, that you be recognized to continue your \npresentation?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to accommodate the Senator in that way. I \nunderstand, as I am hearing it, the Senator has another obligation, and \nhe would like to finish his argument, and he would like to be able to \nrespond.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Maybe we could work out some timing on this so we do \nnot--maybe we could have a mini unanimous consent agreement so we can \nshare this time in a way that does not force up the rest of our \nschedule here?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I think we can do \nthat. I have 8 minutes remaining. There is 22 minutes in opposition. My \nspeculation is that neither of us will use all of our time. I do not \nwant to make a commitment to the other side on that, then, in advance, \nbut probably no later than 10:20, 10:25, we can return to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota for his presentation, taking time off the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent we follow that procedure.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator \nfrom Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I also thank the Senator from North Dakota \nand the Senator from Pennsylvania for making this arrangement so the \nflow of debate on this particular amendment can stay intact.\n  I do rise in opposition to the amendment of Senator Specter to \nincrease discretionary spending by $2 billion. One of my favorite \nthings--and I am sure everybody else's in this Chamber--is to give away \nmoney. You really don't get much opposition when you give away money. \nUnfortunately, we are in a situation where we do not have real money to \ngive away--although, if we pass certain things, it turns into real \nmoney, and the deficit increases. We are making a very concentrated \neffort this year to hold down the deficit--not eliminate the deficit, \nbut to hold it down. You have to do that a little bit at a time.\n  This concept is very similar to family budgeting. There are a lot of \nthings a family would like to spend their money on, that they really \nfeel they ought to spend their money on, but there is just not enough \nmoney to go around.\n  That is the case for virtually every amendment in this budget, there \nis a huge desire to be able to do some very specific things we know \nwill make a difference. We have been doing that for a lot of years. \nThat is part of the reason we are in the problem we are in right now.\n\n[[Page S2766]]\n\n  This amendment increases discretionary funding for Function 500, \nwhich would include additional funding for education and job training--\nmy favorite area--and Function 550, which would include additional \nfunding for health--my second favorite area. That comes under the \njurisdiction of my committee, the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee. It is a huge bite of the apple.\n  I am asked every once in awhile: How did that committee wind up with \nthat much jurisdiction? I said it started out as just the Labor \nCommittee, and then it picked up all the things that had to do with \nlabor negotiations, the benefits that were negotiated, which include \nhealth benefits, job training, and pensions--Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  We have since then made it a four-part equal stool so we can have a \ncomprehensive review of these things. We have been doing that, and we \nhave been making some tremendous headway.\n  My colleague from Pennsylvania has indicated that the additional $1.5 \nbillion in funding for Function 550, included in his amendment, would \nbe allocated to the National Institutes of Health. While I strongly \nsupport the basic biomedical research and other important activities at \nthis agency, I agree with Chairman Gregg that now is not the time to \nspecifically determine the amount of funding for NIH. That can be \ndifficult. That can be done as part of the appropriations process, and \nSenator Specter is certainly in charge of the major determinations \nafter Chairman Cochran makes the allocation. This is not the time for \nspecifically determining that, although we get the impression that very \nspecific determinations are made as part of the budget process.\n  That is partly the fault of the President. The President sends us a \nbillion-page paper that shows how he would spend the money if he were \nspending the money. He doesn't have the authority to spend the money. \nHe doesn't spend $1 of the money. This body and the one at the other \nend of the building have to do all of the appropriations, and we have \nset up a process for doing it. This part of the process is not to go \nthrough the President's items in detail but to establish some caps on \nspending. How much are we willing to increase the deficit? That is what \nwe are debating and deciding. Can we show restraint and fiscal \nresponsibility so that over a period of time we reduce the amount that \nwe are increasing the deficit? Can we reduce the rate of spending? We \nare not talking about huge cuts. We are talking about reducing the \namount of increase, in most cases.\n  As you get into the specific details of the President's guidelines, \nyou will find things that are very distressing because some of the \nplaces he chose to make increases might not be places we would. Some of \nthe places he chose to make decreases might not be places we would. \nWhile the President might have a real desire to decrease a certain \nprogram, Congress might disagree--maybe because it is a pet program of \nours. We have that authority, and we can override any of the baseline \nindicators the President has sent to us, and we do in a lot of \ninstances.\n  I again want to remind people that this is setting the overall cap \nand, of course, giving some suggestions on how to do it.\n  As chairman of the HELP committee, I look forward to modernizing NIH \nthrough the reauthorization process later this year. I am excited to \nbuild on the great work of Dr. Zerhouni, the Director of NIH. We will \nbe considering management reforms, including the NIH Roadmap, which \nwill improve overall efficiency. This is particularly important given \nthat the President has recently fulfilled his commitment to doubling \nthe funding for the NIH. That is a monumental thing. We have doubled \nfunding of NIH over the last several years. I applaud the President for \nimproving scientific research, and I look forward to working with him \nand others to ensure that NIH has appropriate funding to fulfill its \nmission.\n  I commend the NIH for their process of peer review to see what \nresearch has the most potential to result in solutions to illnesses. I \nalso commend the process NIH uses to give priorities to some very \nisolated diseases so that those get research, too. They do a marvelous \njob of allocating what they get. We confer with them regularly to see \nhow they are doing, how quickly they can expand, and how easy it would \nbe for them to include extra money. Like any Government agency or \nbusiness, the more money they have, the more results they can get. The \ndifficulty, again, is taking a look at the overall picture to see what \nwe can do.\n  As chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee \nand a member of the Budget Committee, I am committed to ensuring that \nthere is appropriate funding for all agencies within the Department of \nHealth and Human Services while still keeping in mind the current \nbudget deficit.\n\n  As we all know, the President's budget is a target, and the actual \nappropriations amount for NIH and other agencies at the Department of \nHealth and Human Services will be more fully discussed after we have \nreauthorized the program.\n  Any time we reauthorize a program, there is a need to examine that \nprogram carefully and decide what legislative constraints exist that \nkeep people from doing their job in the most efficient way possible. We \nneed to look at the things NIH has discovered since the last \nreauthorization and decide what programs have been completed and can \nnow be eliminated--this type of reauthorization leads to more \nefficiency and more cost effective solutions.\n  We want more cures. We have an agency that has the kind of direction \nand the capability to do more. As chairman of the authorizing committee \nthat has jurisdiction over this agency, I look forward to working \nclosely with Senator Specter and other appropriators to determine the \nagency's appropriate allocation of funding later this year. I strongly \nsupport the mission of NIH to pursue fundamental knowledge about nature \nand living systems and the application of that knowledge to extend \nhealthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.\n  That is one of the reasons that a couple of weeks ago we passed the \ngenetics nondiscrimination legislation--to make sure people have more \naccess to blood tests without any negative effects as a result of \nthings learned from blood tests and the Genome Project. I was pleased \nthat passed the Senate unanimously, which also shows the concern for \ndoing the right thing with health.\n  We are making amazing progress, and I look forward to modernizing the \nprocess we use to achieve that progress through the reauthorization \nprocess later this year.\n  This amendment also assumes a $500 million increase in the Education \nDepartment to fund that Department at the 2005 level. I understand that \nsome of my colleagues are concerned about the administration's proposed \ncuts to higher education programs such as TRIO, GEAR UP, and vocational \neducation. Again, I want to point out the President's basic structure \nfor arriving at a cap number. We are going to be working on this cap \nnumber. We are not going to be approving or disapproving the way the \nPresident got to those numbers. And, quite frankly, for the 8 years I \nhave been in the Senate, there have been suggested changes by both \nPresidents that would affect TRIO, GEAR UP, and vocational education. \nEvery time, the Senate has made sure those things did not happen.\n  We are interested in vocational education. For example, last week we \npassed the Perkins reauthorization for career and technical education. \nThat was a commitment 99 to 0 by this body that we want to have career \nand vocational education at the high school level, and it is absolutely \nessential that we have that.\n  One of the things we are concerned about is the number of dropouts in \nhigh school. We want to reduce that. The amount that the Federal \nGovernment contributes to solving that problem is very small. In fact, \nmostly what we do is increase paperwork and tests that require \nadditional time out of the classroom. That is not the best way to \nstrengthen education for our kids.\n  We are looking for ways to decrease the dropout rate. I am pretty \nsure, if we eliminate career and technical education, we are going to \nincrease the dropout rate.\n  But we have a plan within the committee authorization to be able to \ndo the things we need to do in education, working them into a logical, \nstaged\n\n[[Page S2767]]\n\nmechanism so we can continue to provide and increase the number of \nthings that are being done in education.\n  This year, the HELP Committee is scheduled to reauthorize the Higher \nEducation Act. The budget resolution contains a $5 billion reserve fund \nfor new higher education spending. I want to review all of these \nprograms in the context of the higher education reauthorization. We \nneed to make sure there is a good map for getting from here to there \nwhich reduces the dropout rate and the wasted senior year and \neliminates the amount of remedial education kids have to do once they \ngo to college. Twenty-eight percent of the kids have to take a remedial \nreading or math class when they get to college. That takes time and \nthat takes money when it is done at the college level. Yet we have some \nwasted senior years. We want to move that back in the process. We think \nwe have that capability in what we are already allowed to do. We looked \ncarefully at the budget. It is not easy, but it is possible to do.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee for working with us so that we \nhave some flexibility within our area so we can achieve what we need to \ndo.\n  Finally, I would like to point out that if the Specter amendment is \nagreed to, it will be the first amendment to the 2006 budget resolution \nto be offset by using Function 920, which is currently an unfunded \nadministrative account.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Specter amendment.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the amendment that \nhas been offered by Senators Specter and Harkin that would increase \nfunding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act by $500 \nmillion.\n  While I support bolstering special education by $500 million, I \ncannot support reducing defense and veterans spending at a time of war.\n  In my time in the Senate, I have worked with my colleagues to almost \ndouble funding for IDEA. That increase has been echoed in my home state \nof Nevada, where the Federal investment in IDEA has almost doubled \nsince 2001.\n  I recognize that we have a long way to go toward reaching the Federal \nGovernment's promise of funding 40 percent of the excess costs to \neducate, but we have made great strides toward that goal. The Federal \nGovernment now funds about 20 percent of the excess costs States and \nschool districts face when educating children in special education \nprograms.\n  We have an obligation to create the best education system for our \nchildren and their children--to do that we must eliminate waste and \nfocus spending on programs that directly benefit our children. This \nbudget accomplishes that goal. This budget, as did the President's \nbudget, contains a $500 million increase for IDEA funding. While this \nis not the $1 billion increase many of us would like to see, it is a \nsignificant increase over last year's funding. During this time of \nlarge deficits and war in Iraq, it is necessary to temper funding \nincreases. This includes funding for education.\n  This budget provides generous funding for the Appropriations \nCommittee to work with. It is then the appropriators' job to determine \nwhich programs receive cuts or increases in funding. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to ensure \nthat IDEA receives the increase in funding it needs to stay on track \nand meet the Federal Government's 40-percent promise.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't need any time to discuss the \nmatter. I need a unanimous consent request. I wonder if the Senator \nwill yield to me to do that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This has to do with a time allotment on our side for \nthe debate. We have 45 minutes on our side on debate with reference to \nthe exploration in Alaska.\n  I ask unanimous consent that 45 minutes be distributed as follows to \nSenators on our side to speak on the Cantwell amendment up to 5 minutes \neach: Senator Allen, Senator Talent, Senator Thune, Senator Murkowski, \nSenator Inouye, who would have up to 10 minutes--he is the only \nexception--and Senator Stevens and Senator Domenici. That would be 45 \nminutes. Some might use less and give it to other Senators.\n  I wanted the Republican Senators to know they are all in line at some \npoint during the debate, with 45 minutes of our time for them.\n  I thank the chairman. I appreciate it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. On the Specter amendment, the \nSenator from Pennsylvania has 7 minutes 23 seconds. The Senator from \nNew Hampshire has 7 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me speak, and then the Senator from \nPennsylvania can wrap up.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I should be able to conclude and save \nsome of that 7 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Pennsylvania \nbringing this amendment forward. I know of his deep commitment to NIH \nand education, and as chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee which \nhas jurisdiction over both of these accounts on the discretionary side, \nit is challenging, to say the least. He has the second largest \nappropriating account in the Senate after defense, but he probably has \nthe job with the most demands on it well beyond defense, and he has \nattempted to balance those demands very effectively. However, in this \ninstance, I believe we should stay with the basic numbers we have put \nforward in this budget.\n  It is critical if we are going to have fiscal discipline around here \nto have a top-line discretionary number which we have agreed to--843--\nand that we not within the budget process try to redirect funds within \nthat number in a way that either negatively impacts other accounts or \npositively impacts accounts. That would be a unilateral activity of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania when he starts marking up the bill.\n  The 920 account, if it is used here, will have the practical effect \nof an across-the-board cut on all other accounts in the Government that \nare discretionary so that it creates a pressure that will be difficult \nto handle if it is put forward in this way.\n\n  On the specific issue of funding, we all recognize NIH is a premier \ninstitution and has done an extraordinary job, but we have to recognize \nthis Congress has been extraordinarily generous over the last few years \nwith NIH. Beginning at the beginning of the Bush administration, there \nwas a decision to double the funding of NIH, and that is exactly what \nhappened. It has grown at rates of 13 and 14 percent annually \ncompounded. It has gone from $13 billion to a $27 billion account and \n$28 billion account in the last 5 years, a huge expansion in the \ncommitment to research in the area of health care.\n  There are some concerns with whether we should not take a brief \nbreathing period and make sure dollars are being used efficiently. The \nPresident has proposed an increase for NIH but not as much as maybe NIH \nbelieved it would like, but certainly in the context of the dramatic \nincrease in funding over the last few years it is appropriate.\n  In the education accounts, this President has committed huge \nincreases in education. The numbers are staggering, quite honestly. It \nis the commitment the administration has made relative to the prior \nadministration. In the area, for example, of the overall discretionary \nbudget, the Department of Education has gone up 33 percent since the \nClinton years. In the area of No Child Left Behind, it has gone up 46 \npercent, title I has gone up 52 percent, IDEA has gone up 75 percent. \nThe way the President structured the budget was to say let's take a \nlook at the miscellaneous educational programs that are targeted that \nhave a small impact and see whether those priorities, in comparison \nwith the big programs in which the Federal Government has a major role, \nsuch as No Child Left Behind, special education, Pell grants, and title \nI, the President decides to put more money into those programs rather \nthan to the specific targeted programs.\n  Obviously, it will be up to the Senator from Pennsylvania, working \nwith his committee and working with Senator Enzi, chairman of the \nEducation Committee, to make decisions as to how that should shake out. \nBut in this\n\n[[Page S2768]]\n\nbudget the President has proposed significant increases in the core \neducational programs. In special education he is up $450 million; in \ntitle I, he is up $1 billion; and in No Child Left Behind, up $1 \nbillion; in Pell, which is not reflected appropriately, in my opinion, \nin this budget, or has not been discussed appropriately, he is up half \na billion. We have specifically raised the cap--hopefully, it will end \nup there, but we have no control over how the allocations occur--to \ngive Senator Specter's subcommittee an additional half billion \nspecifically for Pell. So the grants can go from $4,150 and give it \nauthority to allow the Pell grants to be restructured so you can get a \n$5,100 Pell grant under the new structure which is being proposed under \nthis bill should Senator Enzi's committee decide that is how they want \nto proceed.\n  In addition, we have set aside $5.5 billion in the budget in a \nreserve fund specifically to fund a new Higher Education Act, the \npurpose of which is to dramatically expand the Pell grants and take \nthem up to $5,100 for those who go to school 4 years and dramatically \nexpand borrowing for students through the Guaranteed Student Loan \nProgram.\n  Education is strong in this budget and I hope we will stay within the \nterms of this budget rather than expanding beyond that.\n  I recognize the problems the Senator from Pennsylvania has are \ndifficult, probably the most difficult of any of the Appropriations \nsubcommittees, and I understand why he brought this amendment forward.\n  I presume I have used all my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute two seconds remains.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I disagree strongly with my distinguished colleague from \nNew Hampshire. When he says we shouldn't redirect the funds, that is \nthe purpose of this process. That is what the budget resolution is all \nabout.\n  I say, in evaluating the funding for the National Institutes of \nHealth and educational funding, as chairman of the subcommittee which \nhas the appropriations responsibility, and having had a decade of \nexperience there and 24 years experience on the subcommittee, that I am \nin a position to make an evaluation that may be preferable to the \nevaluation of the Budget Committee. But that is what this resolution is \nabout. That is the purpose of Senators offering amendments.\n  When the Senator from New Hampshire talks about the funding which the \nPresident has increased in the past, I point out that a good bit of \nthat has come from the Congress. And when you are looking at a budget \nfor education in excess of $54 billion, if you figure the inflation \ncut, that is about $1.5 billion, and besides that, the level of funding \nis not even present. We have more than $500 million left from last \nyear, an aggregate in education of $2 billion. Considering education is \na major capital asset in this country, that is not an appropriate \nallocation of resources in the opinion of this Senator.\n  I think to add $500 million to the education budget is modest. When \nyou talk about the Pell grants, that is a complicated matter, but it \ndoes not help the tremendous number of programs that have been cut.\n  If I might have a brief discussion with the distinguished Senator \nfrom Wyoming on a couple of points which were made, when he says there \nis no cut in NIH, I respectfully disagree. When you have biomedical \nresearch up 3.5 percent on $28 billion, what you have is a cut of $980 \nmillion, almost $1 billion. There was a modest increase, $145 million, \nso NIH is short in real dollars by $835 million. So I say it is not a \nmatter of no increase, it is a matter of a cut.\n  The one question I have to ask my distinguished colleague is, on the \nPerkins vocational grants, he pointed out that it was a 99-to-0 vote. \nHe voted for it as did I. And I agree totally with what the Senator \nfrom Wyoming has said, that it is ``absolutely essential'' to have \ncareer and vocational training, and if you don't there will be an \n``increase in the dropout rate.'' But the budget which has been \nsubmitted by the education department of my subcommittee zeros out the \nPerkins grant.\n  How can we reconcile the importance of the Perkins educational grant \nand eliminate the funding?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, again I say what we are looking at when we \nsee the President's proposal is their suggestions for how we get to the \nbudget cap number they talk about.\n  The House and the Senate agree and have made a decision--I am pretty \nsure the House voted on it--that is going to be an essential part of \neducation. So as we have done in the past, we will take money from \nother areas and shift it into vocational training. The President's \nproposal was to take that money from vocational education and put it \ninto the high school No Child Left Behind Program. Those numbers are \neven in the President's budget, but we have chosen that there are other \nways we can do high school improvement other than taking away this \nvocational money and putting it into the high school No Child Left \nBehind Program.\n  What we are doing is flexing even within what the President said and \ntaking the money they were going to take from the vocational education \nand put in some increased testing and accountability and moving them \nback into vocation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senator from Wyoming does the best he \ncan with his argument, but the difficulty is that when the \nsubcommittee's budget has been cut from $143.5 billion to $141.3 \nbillion, we don't have room to make reallocations. We just do not have \nthe room.\n  If you take a look at a 3-percent inflation rate, that would be about \nanother $4 billion. So what we are left with is a $6 billion shortfall. \nThis is just illustrative of the Perkins programs which is a very \nimportant program. I agree with the Senator from Wyoming, it is a very \nimportant program, but one of many very important programs which are \nbeing eliminated.\n  That is why I say to my colleagues I have come here modestly asking \nfor $500 million for education, and very modestly in asking for $1.5 \nmillion for the National Institutes of Health so we can win the war on \nsickness.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senator Harkin be added as a cosponsor to \nthis amendment. Senator Harkin has other commitments, but had he been \nhere he would have offered superb arguments at decibel levels \nsubstantially higher than that which has taken place here today.\n  If the Senator from Wyoming is prepared to yield back his remaining \ntime, I am prepared to do the same and that would conclude the \npresentation on this amendment.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield back our time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Could the Senator restate his request for the yeas and nays?\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is to be recognized.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 168\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent we move to the Cantwell \namendment regarding ANWR and use up that time and recognize the Senator \nfrom North Dakota when he returns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 90 minutes for debate \nequally divided in the usual form in relation to amendment No. 168.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I have submitted to the desk the \namendment to strike the language out of the budget that would recognize \nrevenue from drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We \nstarted this discussion last night with colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to talk about why America should not be focusing on drilling in a \nwildlife refuge, turn down the recognition of this revenue, and focus \ninstead on an energy policy that will put America in better stead, get \nus off our dependency on foreign oil, reduce pollution, and focus on \nthe technology that will truly make us energy independent.\n  Many have discussed or seen the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. To \nremind my colleagues, we established this refuge because we believed in \nprotecting the wildlife that existed there--the porcupine caribou herd, \nthe polar bears, grizzly bears, wolves, sheep, falcons, migratory birds \nas shown in this\n\n[[Page S2769]]\n\npicture. We wanted to fulfill our international fish and wildlife \ntreaty obligations. Also, we wanted to provide an opportunity for \ncontinued subsistence for local residents and we wanted to ensure water \nquality and necessary water quantity within the refuge.\n  These pictures from the refuge show a delicate coastline area in the \nnorthern parts of our country. The purpose of designating and \nprotecting the wildlife refuge was because of its unique nature. One of \nthe Episcopalian bishops from Alaska who was here yesterday spoke about \nthe refuge as actual sacred ground and the fact that the preservation \nof it means so much to many Alaskans as it does to many people \nthroughout America.\n  But we are here today on what I call a budget end run to recognize \nrevenue in the budget as a way to try and open drilling in ANWR, to \nopen drilling in this pristine wildlife area.\n  Now, why, if you want to support drilling in Alaska in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge, do you want to try to do it on the budget? My \npoint is, it starts a precedent for opening other areas by simply \nputting money in the budget. Why not expedite timber sales by simply \nrecognizing revenues in the budget? Why not open drilling on the \ncoastal regions of the country by recognizing revenues in the budget? \nWhy not open drilling in Yellowstone National Park by recognizing \nrevenues in the budget? It is a bad precedent.\n  It is a bad precedent for America because if you look at the \nPresident's potential U.S. oil and gas plan for America, you can see \nthat the administration has oil plans for all over the country: up in \nthe Northwest in the State of Washington, which I represent; and \nneighboring States, Oregon and California; along the eastern seaboard; \nin Florida, significant areas; up in the Great Lakes region. These are \nall the potential areas that the administration has designated as \nopportunities for oil drilling.\n  Do we want to stick in the budget revenue recognizing oil production \nin these areas and simply subvert the normal process that would allow \nus to debate and consider whether we should have these oil sources \nrecognized?\n  This particular Senator agrees with some of the editorials around the \ncountry when it says this sets a bad precedent. In fact, there are many \nnewspapers, particularly from coastal regions such as mine that are \nconcerned. Let's go to the St. Petersburg newspaper. It said: So why \nshould Floridians be concerned about the caribou? Obviously, there are \nno caribou in Florida. But the caribou being driven out of their icy \nhabitat by oil rigs, because of this, for Florida, ``means there, by \nthe grace of Congress, go we.''\n  That is what the St. Petersburg newspaper is trying to say. If you \ndecide to drill in Alaska and recognize in the budget this revenue, \nwhat will stop them from doing this in other parts of the country?\n  Another Florida newspaper said:\n\n       The costs and risks of drilling in the Alaskan refuge \n     outweigh the benefits. [And] opposition to the drilling off \n     Florida's coast would be compromised.\n\n  So this is not only this Senator saying this, these are people from \nacross the country who are concerned about this process of sticking \nmoney in the budget as a way to achieve the goals of opening the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge.\n  Well, I can tell you, I think opening the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge to oil drilling is the wrong direction for America. It is the \nwrong direction for America for many reasons. As I said, we have a \npristine wildlife area we want to protect. If someone thinks it can \ncoexist, if somehow drilling for oil in this region and the wildlife \nrefuge can coexist, I would like them to think about this.\n  In the Prudhoe Bay area, we have averaged 500 oil spills a year. From \n1972 to 1986, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation \nreported 23,000 spills of oil and hazardous materials on the Northern \nSlope. Annual emissions from air pollutants on the Northern Slope \ninclude at least 4,000 tons of hydrocarbons, more than 6,000 tons of \nmethane gas, 6,000 to 27,000 tons of nitrogen oxide.\n  If that is not enough, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife studies have \nreported that the snowfields around Prudhoe Bay have high \nconcentrations of heavy metals such as zinc, lead, and copper. For some \nof those chemicals, the nitrogen oxide level is as much as in \nWashington, DC. And we are talking about just an area in Alaska.\n  If you think drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge can coexist with \nthe refuge, I would also like to suggest we take a look at the even \nnewer Alaskan oilfields which have significant problems with \nenvironmental management.\n  In February 2000, one oil company was sentenced to pay $15.5 million \nin criminal fines and to implement new environmental management \nprograms, and to serve 5 years probation for failure to report illegal \ndumping of hazardous materials in certain oil wells. They also paid an \nadditional $6.5 million in civil penalties, while its contractor pled \nguilty to 15 counts of violating the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and paid \na $3 million fine.\n  A 2003 study of by National Academy of Sciences, which studied the \ncumulative effects of current drilling on the Northern Slope of Alaska, \ndocumented significant environmental and cultural effects that have \naccumulated after three decades of oil development on Alaska's Northern \nSlope.\n  So I think it is very foolish to say oil development and a wildlife \nrefuge can coexist, not when we are talking about clean water, not when \nwe are talking about preserving a wildlife habitat, not when we are \ntalking about continuing to preserve what has been called a very unique \narea of our country.\n  But there is something I think the Senate needs to understand as we \ntake this vote. This is a good proposal for Alaska, and I don't fault \nmy colleagues for trying to propose this particular proposal. I would \nmuch rather, as I said last night, work with my colleagues on a natural \ngas proposal and provide the resources necessary to build a pipeline \nand access a significant source of natural gas supply that would help \nus in America getting off our dependence of oil in general and develop \na much cleaner supply for Americans. But there is nothing in this \nlanguage that guarantees the oil produced in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge \nwould even stay in the United States. The oil companies are free to \nexport that oil. So for those who say somehow this is going to affect \ngas prices--and, believe me, we will not see this oil for 10 years, and \nit is only a 6-month supply, and it will have a minimal impact on \nmarkets--it certainly has no guarantee to have an impact on price or \nsupply in the rest of the U.S. market because the oil drilled in the \nrefuge can be exported.\n  I also question whether the estimates of money in the budget \nresolution are even valid, whether the numbers are even correct. That \nis because current law requires that there be a 90-10 split between \nrevenues that go to Alaska and the Federal Government. This budget \nresolution supposedly recognizes a 50-50 split, which I do not \nunderstand how one gets to that conclusion, because it is not current \nlaw. In any case, that split means Alaska residents would get $717 per \nperson per year. So I get why it is a great deal for Alaskans. But it \nis not a great deal for Americans.\n  Americans need to move ahead and produce a variety of sources of \nenergy supply. I am going to talk about that in a few minutes, but I \nwant to recognize some of my colleagues who also want to speak.\n  What we need to recognize is that drilling in the refuge only \nincreases America's reliance on fossil fuel, and that, according to \nanother newspaper editorial in our country, is being recognized by \nAmericans all over. They know that would increase America's reliance on \nfossil fuels and do little to limit our dependence on imported oil.\n  That is what the other side would like to say the debate is about, \nimproving our independence. What we should do instead is invest in new \ntechnologies and change our strategy. We do not need to open a wildlife \nrefuge and continue to depend on something that we know has a very high \nchance of polluting the environment and harming the wildlife, but get \non to investing in the technology that will diversify our energy supply \nand give us a secure future.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 28 minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I would like to yield to the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts for 10 minutes.\n\n[[Page S2770]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Cantwell for her \nleadership.\n  I regret we are here at this time on the budget talking about a major \nlegislative issue, a major energy policy issue which is being \napproached through the backdoor. This is the equivalent of the \n``nuclear option'' that is being talked about with respect to judges. \nThis is a ``nuclear option'' on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  You cannot drill, you cannot have oil exploration and preserve a \nrefuge, nor even a wilderness. The oil companies themselves have said \nthat. They have made it crystal clear. ConocoPhillips pulled out the \nother day and said they do not want to drill in Alaska. BP does not \nwant to drill in Alaska. And these companies have had the courage to \nadmit publicly that wilderness and drilling simply do not coexist. But \nbecause the votes do not exist to do this through the proper channels \nof the Senate, there is a new process being put in place to do this on \nthe budget.\n  It is symptomatic of what is happening in the Congress. The Ethics \nCommittee in the House is importuning to change the rules for \nCongressman Tom DeLay. Now they are talking about changing the rules \nfor how to get judges. They do not like the rules; change them.\n  This does not belong in the budget. It belongs in a debate on the \nenergy policy of the United States. But even on the merits, every \nsingle argument that has been made about the Arctic Wildlife Refuge \nfails to withstand scrutiny. We have heard that drilling in the refuge \ncan be done in an environmentally friendly manner. But even the \nadministration's own reports, the National Academy of Sciences, and \nothers, all show that is not true.\n  We have heard that drilling in the refuge will reduce our dependence \non foreign oil. We have heard that drilling in the refuge is going to \nbring gas prices down at the pump. We have even heard that drilling in \nthe refuge belongs in the national budget because of the revenues from \nthe lease sales. We have heard it is the only available location to \nlook for new oil, notwithstanding that the largest unexplored and as \nyet unexploited area of oil for the United States is in the offshore \ngulf, deepwater drilling. We have heard the oil industry is eager to do \nthis even though oil industry executives tell you otherwise in private, \nand several major companies in public have pulled out of the effort.\n  We say here that less than 1 percent will be affected and only 2,000 \nacres is going to be the footprint. Yet there is nothing containing \nthat 2,000 acres into one contiguous area.\n  The fact is, that 1.5 million acres will be opened and you could have \n20 different sites or 40 different sites of individual drilling. The \nmaps show the roads, the gravel pits, the gravel roads, and other needs \nof airport, and so forth, to service those particular areas.\n  I would think most of my colleagues would understand that by \ndefinition wilderness and an industrial zone do not coincide. By \ndefinition they cannot occupy the same space.\n  In 1960, the Eisenhower administration first recognized the \nextraordinary wilderness value of the area and it was established to \nprovide a unique wildlife landscape. Building a massive oilfield, no \nmatter how you describe this imprint--we do not have time, \nunfortunately, to go into great detail, but every description of how \nthis would actually be done defies the notion that this is going to be \ncontained to an area the size of Dulles Airport.\n  Oil companies want you to think whatever oil may be found in the \nrefuge is in one compact area. But if you go look at the North Slope \noilfields west of the Arctic Refuge, that development sprawls over an \nextraordinarily large area. It stretches across the Coastal Plain.\n  According to the U.S. Geological Survey, potential oil under the \nCoastal Plain is not concentrated in one large reservoir but it is \nspread across the Coastal Plain in many small deposits. To produce oil \nfrom this vast area requires a network of pipelines. Roads will be \nbuilt. And that will change the habitat of the entire Coastal Plain.\n  Now, I acknowledge there is new technology. I know we have made \nprogress with respect to horizontal drilling. We all understand that. \nAnd it is more efficient. And, yes, it is less harmful than we have \nbeen in the past. But the advantages are extraordinarily exaggerated, \nparticularly with respect to what will happen to the imprint in the \nArctic Wildlife Refuge. Even new technology such as directional \ndrilling does irrevocable damage. Permanent gravel roads, busy airports \nare still used for access to production wells that are scattered across \nmore than a million acres of coastal plain. And the entire complex, \naccording to the analyses made by independent groups, will produce more \npollution than the city of Washington itself.\n  No matter how well done, oil development has significant and lasting \nimpacts on the environment. The industry itself has said this. British \nPetroleum has said:\n\n       We can't develop fields and keep wilderness.\n\n  And if the facts and the frank admission of an oil company are not \nenough, colleagues ought to read the National Academy of Sciences \nstudy. They should read the Department of Interior study and others who \nhave all come to the same conclusion.\n  In addition, let me point out that every onshore oilfield today on \nAlaska's North Slope has permanent gravel roads, every single one, even \nthe original Alpine field promoted to this day as a roadless \ndevelopment. I read Secretary Horton's article in the New York Times on \nthe weekend talking about roadless development. It isn't roadless. It \nhas a road connecting its drill sites from the time it began pumping \ncrude oil in the year 2000. In December of 2004, a new road into the \nNational Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, and others, connected the initial \noilfield pump to 33 miles of Alpine roads, and BLM predicted 122 more \nmiles are going to be needed for the next phase of Alpine expansion.\n  Even today this promotion of ``roadless'' is fictitious. It is not \ngoing to happen. The roadless concept has not been abandoned. This is \nwhat the Bureau of Land Management says:\n\n       The roadless concept has not been abandoned. Roadless \n     development never meant no roads, only that the construction \n     of permanent roads would be minimized.\n\n  How many times do the American people have to listen to clear skies \nthat aren't clear, healthy forests that are not healthy, and now \nroadless rules that are not roadless? The fact is, this is going to be \ndestructive. It changes wilderness forever.\n  What about dependence? We hear this is going to change America's \ndependence on oil in the world. Go talk to anybody on Wall Street who \ndeals with oil. Go talk to any of the people who trade oil prices, \ncrude barrels. The fact is that this is not going to have any impact. \nTen years from now at the peak year, you may change the percentage of \nAmerican dependency from 62 to 60 percent.\n  The United States only has 3 percent of the world's oil reserves. \nNothing we could do in Alaska will affect the long-term security of the \nUnited States. The only thing that will do that is to recognize we need \nto move to alternative, renewable, different forms of fuel. The effort \nof the Senate should not be to destroy a wilderness area. The effort of \nthe Senate ought to be to accelerate that research and development in \nAmerica. Because with 3 percent of the oil reserves of the world in our \nhands, including Alaska, you can't drill your way out of America's \npredicament, you have to invent your way out of it. And that is not \nwhat this bill seeks to do. It is a drilling solution. It is a drilling \nsolution with extraordinarily negative consequences.\n  The fact is, the price of oil will not drop. The price of energy will \nnot drop. The price of gasoline will not drop. And one of the reasons \nwhy is that China, with its 1.2 billion people, and India, with its 1.-\nplus billion people, are all increasing their cars on the roads, \nincreasing their development. That is raising the demand curve to a \npoint that nothing the United States does is going to accelerate our \nproduction of oil sufficiently to have an impact.\n  May I have an additional 2 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I yield the Senator an additional 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. We should not take the energy policy of the United States \nand\n\n[[Page S2771]]\n\ndump it into a tiny debate on the budget for a backdoor effort to find \n50 votes-plus in order to do what has traditionally been done according \nto the rules of the Senate. This is an abuse of power. It is also an \nabuse of common sense. It will result in a policy that is against the \nwill of the vast majority of the American people. Once again, special \ninterest effort is defeating the desires of the American people to \npreserve wilderness and preserve something we have preserved to this \ndate for future generations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield myself time off of the resolution.\n  The representation by the Senator from Massachusetts that somehow \nthis is outside the rules to proceed within the rules is a very unique \nview of the rules. We are using the rules of the Senate. That is what \nthey are. Reconciliation is a rule of the Senate set up under the \nBudget Act. It has been used before for purposes exactly like this on \nnumerous occasions.\n  The fact is, all this rule of the Senate does is allow a majority of \nthe Senate to take a position and pass a piece of legislation, support \nthat position.\n  Is there something wrong with majority rules? I don't think so. The \nreason the Budget Act was written in this way was to allow certain \nunique issues to be passed with a majority vote. That is all that is \nbeing asked for here.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. No, I will not yield.\n  The point, of course, is this: If you have 51 votes for your \nposition, you win. Fifty-one votes to say there should not be drilling, \nthat there should not be exploration, that this small postage stamp of \nland in this vast area of land should not be looked at for the purposes \nof giving us some independence in the area of energy, addressing our \nenergy needs as a nation--if you have 51 votes to say that, you win.\n  If, on the other hand, the Senators from Alaska, who feel that in \ngood conscience they had a commitment from the Senate for many years \nthat they would be allowed to pursue this initiative and that they can \ndo it in an environmentally sound way, have 51 votes for their \nposition, they win. That is the way the rules of the Senate are set up.\n  So it is totally inappropriate for a Senator to come to this floor \nand represent that this is some sort of unethical act, as was implied \nby the Senator from Massachusetts. We are using the rules of the Senate \nas they are set up to be used, and that happens to be the rule of the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, at this time I yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, in listening to the debate, I will tell you \nwhat people in the real world care about and that is not process. What \npeople care about, when you see them in the hallways, or anywhere \nacross our country, they care about these high gasoline prices they are \nhaving to pay. I agree with the Senator from Washington, to some \ndegree, that we do need to embrace a national energy policy that \nutilizes the advances of technology. We need more electricity being \nproduced by clean coal technology, propulsion by fuel cell vehicles, \nand also we need to look at nuclear as a part of the mix, as opposed to \nnatural gas for electricity base-load generation.\n  Rather than talk about process, let's talk about reality. The Senator \nfrom Massachusetts is talking about process that no one in the real \nworld cares about. But what I understand is my own experience. I have \nbeen to the North Slope, Prudhoe Bay in late November. It was like the \ndark side of the moon. I also studied this over the years and have seen \nthat Prudhoe Bay has development. I think it is a magnificent \nengineering feat. In the summer, it is full of mosquitoes, and at other \ntimes there are herds of animals that have to be fairly hardy animals \nto live up there.\n\n  So the argument ends up being, gosh, if there is a pipeline, there \nwill be a gravel road. All of what happened in Prudhoe Bay has not had \nan adverse impact on the animals up there, or the mosquitoes, and if \nthere is a gravel road in an area the size of Dulles Airport in a \nrefuge the size of South Carolina, a few gravel roads won't have much \nimpact. I know the occupant of the Chair, who is from South Carolina, \nknows that doesn't stop deer in his State. It certainly doesn't stop \nany other animals.\n  The reality is we have high gas prices, gasoline, and natural gas. It \nis affecting our travel and people in their homes. There are three \nreasons this amendment needs to stay and we get this revenue from this \nproduction. No. 1, security. We are overly dependent upon foreign \nsources of energy. We are being jerked around and sitting here reading \ne-mails to see what OPEC is going to do. Are they going to increase \nproduction by a few hundred thousand barrels? What impact will that \nhave? Yes, other countries, such as India and China, are taking coal \nand taking energy, such as oil.\n  But the point is we should be less dependent and reliant for our own \nsecurity on OPEC and Venezuela and all these different countries, \nprimarily in the Middle East, for our own security. We are presently \n58-percent dependent upon foreign oil. It is going to go up to 68 \npercent in the next 15 years. That is the estimate.\n  Second, this is for jobs. Jobs will be created. Hundreds of thousands \nof jobs in everything from manufacturing, mining, trade, services, \nconstruction, and others. It is going to have an impact mostly on \nAlaska, but also across the country. That is good for our country as \nwell.\n  Talking about this being Yellowstone, I would not open up exploration \nat Yellowstone. Nobody is suggesting that. The west coast of Florida, \nthe people there, if they want to have a reasonable distance from oil \nproduction that doesn't draw the line all the way to Mississippi and \nLouisiana, respect the will of the people of the west coast of Florida. \nIf the people of Charleston, SC, don't want drilling off the coast of \nSouth Carolina, we ought to respect those people.\n  In Alaska, having been chairman of the Republican Senatorial \nCommittee, looking at poll after poll last year, it is amazing how \nuniform the support is among the people of Alaska--Democrats, \nRepublicans, Indians, Eskimos, and even in the sub-categorized \nliberals; liberals in Alaska are in favor of this pipeline. They \nunderstand it can be done in an environmentally sound way. It means \njobs, revenues. And for us outside of Alaska, the lower 48, and Hawaii, \nthis means energy security.\n  Finally, in addition to security and jobs, there is competitiveness. \nThis country needs to have a reliable, affordable source of energy, \nwhether that is oil or natural gas. Many fertilizer and chemical \nmanufacturers, paper, plastic--even in Danville, VA, where they \nmanufacture tires at a Goodyear plant, they are concerned about the \nskyrocketing costs of natural gas. Natural gas is available in other \ncountries around the world at a more affordable price. They are \ncompeting to get Airbus airplane tires. They got the contract, but \nobviously tires can be made in Southeast Asia, or elsewhere in the \nworld.\n  It is important for our competitiveness that we have a more stable \nand affordable energy supply. So I ask you all, my colleagues, to do \nwhat is right for the security of this country and jobs for Americans \nand, most important, for the competitiveness of our country. Support \nwhat the Budget Committee has done. Let's use those resources on the \nNorth Slope of Alaska for American job security and competitiveness and \ndo what is right by the people in the real world, who would like to see \nus act, as opposed to worrying about what people in OPEC say about our \ngas prices.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes off the resolution to \nthe Senator from Massachusetts so he may be able to answer the \nquestions that were put to him.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I would like to \ntake 1 minute to say something about what we heard, because the Senator \nfrom Virginia tried to minimize the impact of what would happen out \nthere. Let me read what happened from the Clean Air Act Violations in \n2004:\n\n\n[[Page S2772]]\n\n\n       The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation imposed \n     an $80,000 civil penalty on ConocoPhillips for Clean Air Act \n     violations in the Alpine oil field. In addition, over 2.3 \n     million gallons of drilling muds--toxic, manmade fluids \n     pumped into wells--disappeared into the Colville River in \n     1998. The following year, 24,654 gallons of hazardous \n     drilling fluids spilled at the Colville River pipeline \n     crossing.\n\n  Oil industry activities for the Alpine fields caused 170 spills, \ntotaling 36,000 gallons of hazardous substances by 2004, and that is \naccording to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation.\n  So this is not without harm. I stand by what I said about this being \na violation of the rules, going outside the rules. I ask the Senator \nfrom North Dakota this, as he is a budget expert, respected by \neverybody in the Senate on the subject of the budget. The \nreconciliation process was put into place not to permit legislation for \nsomething that has been voted on as a matter of energy policy for years \nbut for deficit reduction. This is not deficit reduction. I ask the \nSenator from North Dakota if that is not correct, that under the budget \nreconciliation rules, reconciliation is for the purpose of deficit \nreduction?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would say, in answer to my colleague, my \nown belief is whatever one's views on opening the Alaska national \nwildlife refuge for exploration, whatever one's views are, my own \nbelief is this is an inappropriate way to reach that policy conclusion.\n  The Senator is correct. Reconciliation is a process outside normal \nrules of the Senate. Reconciliation takes away from every Senator their \nmost fundamental right, and that is the right to unlimited debate, the \nright to have an amendment, and the right as a member of the minority \nto resist the passage of legislation.\n  Reconciliation is a fast-track procedure that was put in place to try \nto address what was then record budget deficits. It was an attempt to \nprovide a special protected procedure, not for the purpose of making \npolicy changes that were incidental to the budget process but that were \ncentral to the budget process.\n  I do not think there is much question that this is a policy change \nbeing put in reconciliation that is incidental to the budget process. \nIt is an attempt to change legislative policy that is far beyond an \nattempt to effect budget policy. For that reason, I personally believe, \nwhatever one's views on ANWR, that this is an abuse of the process.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the distinguished Senator. If I could also ask him \none further question, according to the expectations of drilling, the \ntime it will take and when revenues would flow to the United States, \nthere will be no revenue that will flow from this legislation that will \nreduce the deficit; is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I do not have before me the anticipated flow of revenue. \nBut, really, that is not so important as the fundamental underlying \nquestion: Is this an attempt to do something by way of a policy change \nthat is merely incidental to the budget process? I think one would have \nto answer: Clearly it is. That makes it an abuse of the process.\n  Reconciliation, again, for my colleagues, was designed to be used for \ndeficit reduction. This cannot be seen, seriously, as a deficit \nreduction plan.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator. This is not a deficit reduction plan. \nThat is the fundamental choice here.\n  For those colleagues who are wavering about this, who wonder about \nit, this is a precedent. Some people around here may take these \nprecedents casually and the moment may seem very opportune. What goes \naround comes around. Someday these folks over here may be in the \nminority and they will want the rules played by properly. That is \nreally what is at stake, not just the issue of the Arctic Wildlife \nRefuge but how the Senate is living up to its own standards and its own \nrules.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  MS. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes from our side to the \nSenator from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, during the past several weeks, my office \nand I have received hundreds of letters, telephone calls, e-mails, most \nof them condemning drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. \nSome were threatening. Some were very sensitive. I would like to take \nthis opportunity to respond to these letters and telegrams and e-mails.\n  I do this with mixed feelings because I am well aware that the \nmajority of my colleagues on the Democratic side are not with me and \nthat I may be one of the very few on our side. But I have taken this \nposition for many years. This is not the first time. So I think I have \na few things I would like to share with you.\n  Last night, I watched a television ad put out by people who are not \nfor the drilling. If one looked at it objectively, you got the \nimpression that the drilling would be done in all of Alaska. It showed \npristine scenes of wildlife, of plants. You could not help but feel, my \nGod, are we going to destroy all of this?\n  How large is ANWR? As the Senator from Virginia stated, it is about \nthe size of the State of South Carolina. The area that will be set \naside for this drilling would be about 2,000 acres--2,000 acres out of \n19 million acres.\n  Put another way, if ANWR were the size of a page of the Washington \nPost, and you put something on it about a square quarter inch, that \nwould be about the size of the drilling footprint of ANWR.\n  We are not devastating the State of Alaska. We are not devastating \nANWR.\n  This debate has gone on for a long time. Many of the debates centered \naround the statements of an Indian tribe, the Gwich'in. The Gwich'in \nvillage at one time offered their lands for lease to drill and develop \noil. They had no conditions to it. They said just go ahead and drill on \nour land, we would like to have that done. But when the test drills \nwere made and they found that there was no oil or gas, then, suddenly, \nthe Gwich'ins found themselves in opposition.\n\n  There are 230 Indian tribes and tribal villages in the State of \nAlaska--230. One tribe is against it, the Gwich'in tribe. For the past \n15 years I was chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. My mandate \nfrom my colleagues was that we should listen to the Indians. Mr. \nPresident, 229 tribes said yes, we want it. One tribe said no.\n  The Gwich'ins have cousins on the Canadian side, and the Canadian \nside Gwich'in land is being drilled at the same time, and they seem to \nbe happy.\n  The question comes up, how many barrels will ANWR produce? The U.S. \nGeological Survey suggests that ANWR holds between 5.7 billion and 16 \nbillion barrels of oil, an average of about 10 billion barrels. The \nsite will produce an additional 876,000 to 1.6 million barrels a day. \nThis makes it the single greatest prospect for future oil production in \nthe United States. It will produce over 36 million gallons of much \nneeded gasoline, jet and diesel fuel and heating oil. To put this in \nperspective, while ANWR can produce 1.6 million barrels a day, Texas \nand California each offer about 1 million daily.\n  Development of ANWR alone will reduce U.S. dependence on foreign \nsources by 4 percent. Some would say: 4 percent, that's not much. Tell \nthat to the driver who has to go to the pump today and pay that extra \nprice. Four percent makes a big difference.\n  But equally as important, I have heard many of my colleagues suggest \nthat the war in Iraq is a war on oil. If they believe so, why don't we \nproduce our own oil so we don't have to fight for it?\n  I close by sharing with you something that happened many years ago \nwhen the Trans-Alaska Pipeline was being debated. It was a long time \nago, and most of the Members of the Senate were not here at that time. \nDire predictions were made. Environmentalists came forward and said: \nYou are going to destroy Alaska. The caribou herd will be demolished \nand diminished. They will become extinct.\n  Those are the words that we heard. At the time the Congress \nauthorized the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, there were 5,000 caribou. Today, \nthere are 32,000 caribou. Instead of diminishing the herd, the pipeline \napparently has helped them. But this is not a debate on the pipeline, \nit is a debate on ANWR.\n  I hope my colleagues will give this opportunity to the people of \nAlaska. When 229 out of 230 tribes tell me they want it, I am ready to \nrespond, sir.\n\n[[Page S2773]]\n\n  Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nSouth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  How high do gas prices have to get? How over a barrel does OPEC have \nto get us before we realize what the American people realized a long \ntime ago that we have an energy crisis in America today? We have gas \nprices that continue to soar. We have supply problems because we rely \non the geopolitics of the Middle East.\n  Earlier this month, I was glad to join Energy Secretary Sam Bodman, \nInterior Secretary Gale Norton, and four of my colleagues, including \nthe Senator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski, on a trip up to the Arctic \nWildlife National Refuge. It is a big place.\n  Alaska is 386,000 square miles. My home State of South Dakota is \n77,000 square miles. We think we have a lot of wide open space in South \nDakota. But you could put seven of my States of South Dakota into the \nState of Alaska.\n  If you look at Alaska in its totality and look at what we are talking \nabout in terms of the exploration and possible production in ANWR, it \nis 19.6 million acres on the wilderness area, ANWR area. Eight million \nacres of that is wilderness. The area we are talking about for \ndevelopment and exploration is 1.53 million acres.\n  Furthermore, the area that would be used under the legislation limits \nit to 2,000 acres.\n  That is the equivalent in South Dakota terms of about three sections \nof farmland in an area that is 19.6 million acres in a State that is \n586,000 square miles, where we could put seven of the State of South \nDakota.\n\n  We had the opportunity when I was up there to look at technology. It \nis remarkable what has transformed over the last 30 or 40 years. You \nprobably can't see it on the map, but Prudhoe Bay technology is 1970s \nvintage technology compared to 1980s vintage technology. We went to a \nsite called the Alpine site, which is the millennium technology. The \nchanges that have taken place are dramatic, and the way it has evolved \nminimizes the impact and the footprint that is left. In fact, at the \nAlpine site, there were 97 acres, which included the runway where they \nland the planes to provide their supplies and the lake they get their \nwater from. They are generating 120,000 barrels of oil a day on 97 \nacres. Why? Because the technology allows them to go underground, to \ndrill horizontally, and to drill directionally. It minimizes the impact \nabove the ground.\n  We saw where they use ice roads for exploration to get back and \nforth. In the winter, the roads disappear. Below the frozen tundra is \nthe single largest and most promising onshore oil reserve in America--\nsomewhere between 6 billion and 16 billion barrels of oil. The average \nof that would be 10 billion barrels.\n  How much is that? A million barrels a day that we could add to our \nproduction in this country. That is 5 percent of what we use--20 \nmillion barrels a day in the United States. We get 10 million barrels a \nday today from outside the United States.\n  This would lessen our dependence on foreign sources of energy.\n  Put another way, it could power the State of South Dakota for 499 \nyears.\n  We are talking about a significant resource that we need because \nAmerica is facing an energy crisis.\n  Gas is over $2 a gallon. A barrel of oil is near record highs. Make \nno mistake about it, America's energy crisis is an economic crisis that \nimpacts every American. This country needs energy legislation which \nfosters more oil production and increases the alternatives, such as \nrenewable fuels and ethanol that we produce in my home State of South \nDakota.\n  I hope we can get a comprehensive energy bill that increases the use \nof ethanol in this country. Right now, we do about 3.5 billion gallons \na year in ethanol, but we use 120 billion gallons a year of gasoline in \nthis country. It has to come from somewhere.\n  Right now, we are paying all the money to the folks in the Middle \nEast who have gotten us over a barrel. We need to change that. We need \nto reduce our dependence on politically unstable foreign sources of \noil.\n  Specifically, the United States imports about 3 million barrels of \noil a day from the Persian Gulf. The estimated daily domestic supply \nfrom ANWR would reduce that number by half.\n  Passing this legislation will reduce America's dependence on foreign \nsources of oil, strengthening our economic security, strengthening our \nenergy security, and strengthening our national security.\n  When I was in the House, we passed an energy policy, but it got stuck \nin the Senate.\n  We have an opportunity to finally finish the job that the American \npeople sent us here to do and to reduce our dependence on foreign \nsources of oil.\n  Listen to the people of Alaska. Mr. President, 57 out of 60 members \nof the Alaska State Legislature support this. You just heard the \nSenator from Hawaii talk about most of the tribes in Alaska support \nthis. The congressional delegation, the Governor, the people's \nrepresentatives here in Washington and in Alaska believe this is \nimportant to the future of that State.\n  It is important for the economy of this country and to the people who \nare having to pay the price at the pump because we fail and refuse to \ndo something that is so important--to tap the vast reserves that exist \nright here in America rather than relying on the Middle East for our \nenergy supply.\n  I hope my colleagues here today will join with me and with those in \nthe past who have supported this and vote for this so that we can begin \nthe process of lessening our dependence on foreign sources of energy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield an additional 10 minutes off the \nresolution under the control of the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I would like to yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Cantwell for her wonderful \nleadership on this issue.\n  I sit here and I am listening to this debate which we have been \ninvolved in so many times. Now I know why Christie Todd Whitman wrote \nher book ``It Is My Party, Too.''\n  When you look at who set aside the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, \nit was a Republican President. Here the biggest forces for opening \ndrilling are coming from the Republican Party, fervor about how this is \ngoing to solve our energy problems when everyone admits if we get oil \nout of their at all it is not going to be for another 10 years, and the \neconomically recoverable oil is 6 months, maybe. So the zealotry that \nwe hear shows the changes in the Republican Party. That is a fact of \nlife.\n  Now, let's see what President Eisenhower's Secretary of Interior, \nFred Seaton, said about this area. He said this was ``one of the most \nmagnificent wildlife areas in North America . . . a wilderness \nexperience not duplicated elsewhere.'' Senator George Allen called it \nthe dark side of the Moon. So who is right--President Eisenhower or \nSenator Allen? Let's take a look at some of the photographs because we \nneed to see this dark side of the Moon.\n  The first thing we see is the porcupine caribou herd, the mother and \nthe little calf. Quite beautiful. It does not look much like the dark \nside of the Moon to me. The U.S. Geological Survey Biological Resource \nDivision found the porcupine caribou herd may be particularly sensitive \nto oil development.\n  Let's look at the effects on the caribou and other animals, including \nbears. This is my favorite, a polar bear photograph taken by a \nwonderful photographer who spent 18 months in the wildlife refuge. It \ndoes not look much like the dark side of the Moon to me. And polar \nbears are particularly sensitive to oil development because they den in \nthe winter--exactly the time the oil companies want to drill.\n  Millions of migratory birds--over 130 species--journey to our States, \nso our States will be impacted. To me, this is a God-given environment. \nWith all the talk about faith-based politics, if you do believe, as I \ndo, that these are gifts, then we have to be careful in what we are \ndoing here today.\n\n[[Page S2774]]\n\n  My friend from Alaska says we are going to do this very sensitively. \nThey were very sensitive at the Exxon Valdez. They were very sensitive \nin Santa Barbara when we had the unbelievable oil spill that led to, \nactually, the very first Earth Day because it was so devastating to see \nwhat happens. We know that the economic activity that comes from oil \ndrilling is going to have an impact. So anyone who tells you anything \nelse simply is thinking in a wishful fashion. We are alive today, we \nsee what happens with the spills. Let's be careful what we are doing. \nIf this is something that will make us energy independent, that is one \nthing. But the fact is, it won't.\n  Let's look at some of the scenes because there was talk about how \nbarren this area is. We will look at some of the landscapes because it \nis important to look at this and decide for ourselves if it is worth \nrisking this for 6 months' worth of oil.\n  This is along Marsh Creek in the coastal plain, in the very area they \nsay is completely barren. One of my colleagues said it only looks that \nway for a few weeks. Well, it certainly looks that way at a point in \ntime. When I sent my environmental legislative assistant up to that \narea, she was overcome. I went to Alaska. It is true there are other \nmagnificent areas of Alaska, but this is one of those beautiful areas.\n  Here is the issue. The oil companies are backing out. They do not \nwant to be involved in this controversial area. Many have already \nbacked out. BP, ConocoPhillips, and ChevronTexaco have pulled out \nbecause they know what they are walking into here, and they don't want \nto drill. It may be that even if we get the vote, no one will drill \nthere. We are not sure of that. Why is this happening? I say it is \nhappening because if they could open this area, they can open any area. \nDon't take my word for it; you can take the Bush administration's word \nfor it. That is what they have said in essence. They admit it.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I alert my colleagues of the time situation. I gave 10 \nminutes off the resolution to Senator Cantwell to control to even up \nthe two sides. Here is the problem: I only have 3 minutes left on the \nresolution before the 1 o'clock vote. I would be happy to give the \nSenator from California 1 of those 3 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Here is the point. This area was set aside by a \nRepublican President who found it to be most pristine. We understand \nthere are certain times in this Senate when we do something as radical \nas this, which is to open up a wildlife refuge, we may want to have a \nfew more votes. That is kind of the rules of the Senate. They are doing \na backdoor, so they may get 51 votes here, and with 51 votes they open \nthis--for what, maybe 6 months' worth of oil. If we close the SUV \nloopholes, if we said over time they should get the same mileage as \ncars, we would have seven ANWR fields over 40 or 50 years.\n  We do not need to do this. If you believe this is God-given land, \nlet's protect it. At the end of the day, that is our job. I hope we get \nthe votes. If we do not get them today, this will be a big issue out in \nthe country. I hope the oil companies will continue to walk away from \nthis because clearly it is very controversial to go into this pristine \narea.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have an inquiry.\n  The Senator from Washington has 5 minutes she was going to use. I was \nunder the impression that the Senator from Washington had 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. If she is willing to wait, I ask unanimous consent I be \nyielded 10 minutes off the underlying resolution.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, let me make certain I \nunderstand the request. The problem we have, I say to the Senator, all \nof the time has been allocated. Maybe there is some additional time you \nhave on your side. We have locked in a 1 o'clock vote, and if you add \nthe time for the veterans amendment and the ANWR amendment, there is 2 \nminutes remaining before 1 o'clock to come off the resolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could, I understand there is a substantial amount of \ntime on the underlying resolution. I was hoping to speak not just on \nANWR but also on NIH and Amtrak. I thought it should come off the \nunderlying resolution, not just Amtrak, and I have been sitting here \nfor almost an hour. I thought, with the flow back and forth between \nsupporters and opponents of the amendment, that it would be appropriate \nI be allowed to speak at this time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, how much time do we have on the resolution \non our side before we get to the 1 o'clock vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 24 minutes 53 seconds. There is 4 \nminutes of unpromised time on the resolution before 1 o'clock.\n  Mr. GREGG. And we have coming up 45 minutes on the two veterans \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  The Senator from Washington has already taken 10 minutes off the \nresolution on this amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I might, I gave time off the resolution on our side, \nbut I was very careful to check with the timekeeper that there was time \nthat would not impinge on the 1 o'clock vote. That is the problem we \nhave.\n  Mr. STEVENS. But it still unbalances this time. I ask unanimous \nconsent I have 10 minutes, equal to the Senator from Washington, off \nthe resolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe it was my request that is pending.\n  Let me make a couple of observations. First, whenever Senator Stevens \nwishes to speak, I will defer to him. Second, since we only have 4\\1/2\\ \nminutes of time, I would be willing to take just 4\\1/2\\ minutes to \nspeak only on ANWR and come back on the other issues at another time.\n  I amend my request to ask that I be allowed to take this 4\\1/2\\ \nminutes if it is off the resolution so I can address this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have a pending request, also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi has a request, \nand the request is to be recognized for 4\\1/2\\ minutes. Does anyone \nobject?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Off the resolution. And that uses all the time until 1 \no'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I do not object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Parliamentary inquiry. Could I inquire, has Senator \nStevens' time already been identified before this 1 o'clock vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He has made the request.\n  Mr. LOTT. Has not been----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He has made the request. The Senator has been \nrecognized for 5 minutes on the ANWR amendment. But as the Chair \nunderstands it, the Senator from Alaska is asking to speak for 10 \nminutes before 1 o'clock and the time be taken off the underlying \nresolution.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, as a way to resolve this, I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Stevens be given 10 minutes off the resolution and \nthat the vote occur at 1:10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, let me say to my colleagues, that is the last agreement I \nwill enter into because we are rapidly running out of time on the \nresolution. We have spent a great deal of time on this matter. \nCertainly in recognition of Senator Stevens' long service, and his \nintense interest on this issue, we will agree to that one moving back \nof the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Chair's understanding we will \nproceed as follows: that the Senator from Mississippi will speak for 4 \nminutes, that the Senator from Alaska will be given 10 minutes, and the \nvote will be at 1:10, and the Senator from Washington has 5 minutes to \nbe taken off the underlying resolution yet to be used. Is that correct?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, then how much time remains on the ANWR \ndebate for both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 17 minutes 4 seconds for the \nminority; 24 minutes 53 seconds for the majority.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n[[Page S2775]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am glad I could assist the Chair in \nclarifying the time at this point. This is a very important issue. It \nis time, I agree, we should get it resolved. I think it should be \nresolved with a majority vote. We can argue over the rules as long as \nwe like. But to me, this is a critical issue. It symbolizes what we are \ngoing to do about the future in the energy area.\n  I do not have some beautiful picture I am going to show today. If I \nwere going to show one, I would show one of my four grandchildren. Are \nwe going to have energy production in our country or not? Are we going \nto continue to put various areas off limits where we cannot have more \nproduction? There are some people, I guess, in this institution who \nthink we can conserve ourselves into an energy policy.\n  We need to produce more oil, more natural gas, more coal with clean \ncoal technology, hydropower, all of it, and have conservation and \nalternative fuels. And we should produce this oil in Alaska, or natural \ngas, or whatever it is up there.\n  When I came to the Senate, I spent some time talking to the \nexperienced hands around here, and I asked about how you deal with \ndifferent issues. One of the things I was taught by my predecessors \nhere in this institution is you pay attention to the Senators from \ntheir State when it is an issue involving their State.\n  This is an issue that is supported by the two Senators from Alaska, \nsupported by an overwhelming number of people in that State. It is \nsupported by the Native Americans in that State. This is the right \nthing to do from their standpoint. I do not understand why Senators \nfrom Massachusetts and Washington and Maine are trying to dictate what \nshould happen in this area in production that we need as a country. I \nam absolutely floored by all of this.\n\n  I think it is time we consider what is for the good of the overall \ncountry and get over all these dire threats of doom of what we might do \nif we have exploration in this very limited area. And, ladies and \ngentlemen, it is about jobs. It is about revenue. Why do you think most \nof the unions are supporting this? They were in my office today saying: \nWe are for this, because they understand it would involve jobs. They \nunderstand it would involve more revenue coming into the Federal \nTreasury. They understand it is about energy independence.\n  When are we going to learn? The price of a barrel of oil is $54 a \nbarrel. Gasoline is somewhere close to $2 a gallon, in some areas as \nmuch as, I think, $2.16 a gallon. Venezuela made it clear recently they \nwould like to cut us off completely. We are dependent on a very \nvolatile area of the world for our oil supply. Probably about 60 \npercent of our energy needs is supplied by foreign oil.\n  Even in this remote area of Alaska we are saying we cannot produce \nmore oil and gas. Who is going to lose if we do not have energy \nsources? We are going to have it in my State. We are going to produce \nour own oil and natural gas and coal. We are going to have excess \npower. By the way, if they are willing to pay for it, we will be glad \nto wheel it up to Pennsylvania and Massachusetts and Connecticut. We \nwill share.\n  But I will tell you, if we do not have oil and gas and coal to run \nour powerplants, the electricity is going off. It is time we get \nserious about this issue. We should vote down this amendment.\n  I commend Senator Judd Gregg and the Budget Committee for taking this \naction. I think we should do this if for no other reason than because \nof support for the Senators, particularly Senator Stevens, who has \nspent a career trying to do the right thing for Alaska. Who has done \nmore for conservation and environmental issues in Alaska than Senator \nTed Stevens? Nobody. He has made every possible plea for this. So I \nhope we will do it. It is the right thing to do. We should do it in his \nhonor.\n  I thank my colleagues for giving me this opportunity to vent a little \nbit. I am amazed at the irresponsibility of this Congress and the \nprevious Congress and the American people to a degree in the energy \nfield. We want it, but we do not want to do anything to produce it. So \nI hope maybe this will be a sign today, when we vote to defeat this \namendment, that we are finally getting serious about more energy \nproduction in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, if I could take a few moments to point \nout that this Senator certainly wants America to move forward with the \ndevelopment of new energy supply. In fact, I am saying the whole debate \nshould be about supply and not recognizing revenue in the budget for an \nill-conceived project in a wildlife refuge.\n  We can get as much supply or more by doing the Alaska natural gas \npipeline. That natural gas supply would save 6 billion barrels over 10 \nyears; use of off-the-shelf renewables and energy efficiency \ntechnologies, 4.9 billion barrels in the next 10 years; increasing use \nof ethanol in our gasoline, 5.1 billion barrels over 10 years; \nimproving tire inflation and automobile maintenance--you don't have to \ncome up with a new place to drill--5.4 billion barrels; increasing \nautomobile fuel efficiency standards, 10 billion barrels. So we \ncertainly are about supply; we are just for a cleaner supply.\n  Why are we for a cleaner supply? Because if you look at it, and you \ncompare the various proposals I have outlined with drilling in the \nArctic Refuge, you get increased pollution from refuge drilling, \nincreased CO2 levels, you impact Federal lands, and I don't \nbelieve you are going to have any immediate impact on our country's \nenergy resources. These other actions I have outlined actually decrease \npollution levels. Those are the actions we should be taking, not refuge \ndrilling.\n  Now, a lot has been said about gasoline and gasoline prices. We ought \nto be investigating why gasoline prices are so high, not accepting that \nwe are going to have to be more dependent on foreign oil. In fact, a \nrecent attorneys general office statement stated that gasoline \nproducers marked up prices 152 percent between January and March of \n2003. In the first 3 months of 2003, average gasoline prices increased \n57 cents in California alone.\n  A trade industry magazine talked about the peculiar incidence of \nexporting distillate. That is taking our supply and exporting it. What \ndoes that do? It decreases the supply in the United States, and it \nincreases the spot market prices at refineries. There is nothing in the \nbudget resolution that guarantees we are going to lower gasoline \nprices. And there is nothing in the language of the budget resolution \nthat guarantees any supply recovered from the Arctic Refuge will even \nstay in the United States.\n  I wish my colleagues would embrace these facts and guarantee that if \nwe are doing to go into a wildlife refuge and drill for oil, at least \nwe should require that we keep whatever oil we produce in the United \nStates for our domestic use. But I doubt they will guarantee that. So \nnow we are talking about drilling in a wildlife area. In doing so, we \nwill increase pollution and not get our country off our foreign oil \ndependence and certainly not lower gasoline prices any time in the near \nterm.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the Cantwell amendment to strike the reconciliation \ninstruction to the Energy Committee that allows for drilling in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge. I first thank Senator Cantwell for her \ntremendous leadership on environmental issues in general and especially \nher strong leadership on this very important environmental issue.\n  The other side can say what they want as many times as they want. The \nfact is, this provision is an abuse of the reconciliation process. Yes, \nit is. The Senator from New Hampshire may be right that it is \ntechnically not a violation of the rules of the Senate, but it is an \nabuse of the process. It is what you do when you get frustrated. You \ncan't win under the normal rules, 60 votes, the way we have debated \nthis issue year after year. You get frustrated and you say: Here is \nwhat we will do. We will use a revenue assumption in the budget so we \nonly have to have 51 votes.\n  We should be debating this issue when we take up the Energy bill \nrather\n\n[[Page S2776]]\n\nthan engaging in a backdoor maneuver on the budget resolution. I feel \nstrongly, as a Senator who has always worked on a bipartisan basis year \nafter year on the budget and the budget rules, that this one is over \nthe line.\n  This fact is clearly evidenced by the speculative nature of the \nrevenue assumptions from drilling in the Wildlife Refuge. A February \n21, 2005 New York Times article about the refuge quotes a Bush adviser \nas saying that ``even if you gave the oil companies the refuge for \nfree, they wouldn't want to drill there.'' He continued: ``No oil \ncompany really cares about [the Arctic refuge.]''\n  British Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, and ChevronTexaco have all pulled \nout of the pro-drilling Arctic Power lobbying group. BP abandoned a \ntest well right next to the Arctic Refuge because of a lack of \nproduction. ChevronTexaco has moved its executives from Alaska to \nHouston. A Halliburton official said that ``enthusiasm of government \nofficials about ANWR exceeds that of the industry'' and that ``evidence \nabout ANWR is not promising.''\n  CBO concedes it did not address the oil industry's lack of interest \nin drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge in its projections. So these \nprojections don't add up. Authorizing drilling in the Arctic Wildlife \nRefuge through the budget process is simply the latest in a series of \nabuses of Senate procedures, and I believe the American people know it.\n  This is a backdoor scheme for drilling because the drilling \nproponents don't have enough votes to deal with this issue in the \nEnergy bill. The public doesn't want it; major oil companies don't \nappear to want it; and it does not belong in the budget resolution.\n  The proposed transfer of revenues from drilling in the Arctic Refuge \nto fund popular conservation programs is, on its face, also an \naccounting gimmick. The President's budget zeroed out the State \nrecreation grant program of the land and water conservation fund and \nreduced Federal lands acquisition dollars to its lowest funding level \nin 10 years. To further erode our environmental protections by drilling \nin this pristine wildlife refuge to generate public revenues for these \nimportant conservation programs underscores the administration's \ninsincerity in claiming to support conservation.\n  Even if you think we should drill in the Arctic Refuge, this is not \nthe time or place for this debate. If we can contort the budget process \nto authorize drilling in a wildlife refuge, why couldn't we use the \nbudget process to allow drilling off the coasts of Florida or \nCalifornia or the Carolinas or the Great Lakes? When you abuse the \nbudget process in this way, it invites even greater mischief down the \nline and undermines the very purpose for which these procedures were \nestablished.\n  We should not abuse the budget and the budget reconciliation process, \nas one of our colleagues put it years ago, ``in order to be immune from \nunlimited debate.''\n  Allowing oil drilling in the Wildlife Refuge which many of us believe \nshould be protected as pristine wilderness is too important an issue to \nbe handled in this way. We should have this debate in the open during \nan energy debate, not a debate on the budget resolution.\n  Therefore, I will vote for the Cantwell amendment and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor Senator Cantwell's amendment to the budget resolution protecting \nthe coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Senator \nCantwell's amendment aims to strike a controversial provision that \neffectively paves the way to allowing oil and gas exploration in one of \nour Nation's most pristine and unique wild places. This is a common-\nsense amendment, which upholds the will of the American people in \npreserving this remote area. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting it.\n  There is a strong consensus among all of us here, on both sides of \nthe aisle that decisive steps need to be taken by this Congress to \nsecure our Nation's future energy needs. We know that energy demand is \nrising not only in our own country but around the world, especially in \nnations such as India and China. We also know that there are grave \nnational security implications for remaining reliant on foreign oil. \nAnd we know first-hand from our constituents, many of whom are \nstruggling to heat their homes this winter, that the price of oil \nremains disturbingly high.\n  Drilling proponents want us to believe that resource exploration in \nthe Arctic Refuge will be a one-stop solution to these critical energy \nchallenges and that by doing so we will be closer to securing our \nfuture energy needs. This insinuation is flat wrong.\n  Even drilling proponents concede that any recoverable oil that the \ncoastal plain would yield would not reach world markets for at least \nanother 7-12 years. This will do absolutely nothing to help my \nconstituents who have sticker shock at the gas pump or are seeing \nrecord home heating prices today. Even during peak production, expected \naround 2025, the amount of oil from the Arctic Refuge would reduce \nAmerican imports by only around three percent according to the Energy \nInformation Agency.\n  On numerous occasions I have come to the Senate floor urging my \ncolleagues to adopt real solutions to our Nation's pressing energy \nchallenges. We should be increasing the nation's fuel economy \nstandards, which have remained unchanged for over 10 years. We should \nalso be making a stronger commitment to the development of renewable \nenergy and energy conservation technologies by offering tax incentives \nto both producers and consumers. It is mind-boggling to me that \ndrilling proponents have provided so little leadership in forwarding \nthese policy solutions. Instead they continue to offer the American \npeople a false choice between environmental protection and energy \nsecurity.\n  In another bold move, the administration has tried to sugarcoat oil \ndevelopment in the Arctic Refuge by massively inflating the projected \nrevenues from anticipated lease sales there. The administration claims \nthat lease sales will generate $2.5 billion in revenue in 2007. To get \nto that amount, leases would have to sell for between $4,000 and $6,000 \nper acre. In comparison, leases on the North Slope of Alaska have \naveraged only $50 per acre over the last 20 years. When I questioned \nInterior Secretary Norton about this discrepancy she could not explain \nhow the administration got to its $2.5 billion estimate. What Secretary \nNorton and the administration don't want to acknowledge is that these \nrevenues are disturbingly inflated. They also don't want to acknowledge \nthat oil companies have lost interest in drilling in the refuge. Only \none company is still a member of the lobbying group pushing for this \nprovision in the budget resolution. The fact is that there are other \nplaces the oil companies prefer--places where it is cheaper to drill \nand where the environmental impacts are far less.\n  So why are we here today? Opening the refuge will do nothing to help \nreduce gas prices. It will do nothing to make us less dependent on \nforeign oil. Most oil companies are not asking for it. I can certainly \ntell you that Vermonters do not want to see this special place \ndeveloped. In Vermont, we cherish the natural resources of our state. \nWe cherish the special resources of this country--Yellowstone, Acadia, \nthe Grand Canyon. I would put the Arctic Refuge on the same level as \nthese national treasures.\n  Let me make clear though. I do not oppose energy development in this \ncountry. But not here, not in the Arctic Refuge. It's time to put this \nissue behind us and devote our time to working together on a \nsustainable, reliable energy supply for the future.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Cantwell \namendment to strike the language in the budget resolution that would \nallow oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  The decision whether or not to allow drilling in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge is a defining moment for national energy and \nenvironmental policy.\n  This debate reflects two divergent views of our Nation's values and \nfuture.\n  We have a choice: either we can continue building oil wells in \nenvironmentally sensitive areas, or we can broaden our Nation's energy \nbase while honoring our commitment to our natural heritage.\n  Instead of diversifying our energy supply, investing in new energy \ntechnologies and promoting energy efficiency, the Bush administration's \npriority is to look for the next domestic oil field.\n\n[[Page S2777]]\n\n  No matter how clever they view this backdoor scheme to insert this \nproposal into the budget, the proponents of drilling in the Arctic \nRefuge cannot escape the facts.\n  The Arctic Refuge is home to an unparalleled diversity of wildlife \nincluding 130 species of birds, caribou, polar bears, musk oxen, \ngrizzly bears, and wolves.\n  Estimates show there may be only 6 months' worth of oil, and it would \nnot be available for 10 years.\n  The three largest oil companies in Alaska have stated they are not \ninterested in drilling in the Arctic Refuge.\n  This proposal will do nothing to reduce the price of gas at the pump \nand will do nothing to make our country more energy independent.\n  This issue is too important to the public and to future generations \nto be snuck through in the budget bill. It should be brought to a vote \non its own merits.\n  Supporters of oil drilling will not stop at the Arctic Refuge. The \nWhite House and its allies continue to push to drill in the Arctic \nRefuge because they believe it will create momentum to drill in other \nenvironmentally sensitive areas in the Rocky Mountains and off the \ncoasts of California and Florida.\n  Ninety-five percent of Alaska's North Slope is already open to \ndrilling and exploration. The last 5 percent--the Arctic Refuge--is the \nonly wild stretch of Alaska's North Slope that remains off limits.\n  America produces just 3 percent of the world's oil, yet we consume 25 \npercent of that supply.\n  The answer to our energy challenge will not be found in the Arctic \nRefuge. It will be found in our willingness to encourage American \ninnovation and break the habit of spiraling energy consumption.\n  We have met this test in the past. In the 1970s, Congress increased \nfuel efficiency standards and began to encourage the development of \nrenewable fuels.\n  Today, those fuel efficiency standards save our country the cost of \nthree million barrels of oil every day, and renewable energy \ntechnologies produce the equivalent of the oil we currently import from \nIraq daily.\n  I believe we have a moral responsibility to save wild places such as \nthe Arctic Refuge for future generations. Our national park, wildlife \nrefuge, and wilderness systems are a living legacy for all Americans, \npresent and future, and are widely envied and emulated around the \nworld. The Arctic Refuge is one of the greatest treasures. It should be \nprotected.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Cantwell amendment to strike the \nlanguage to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nCantwell amendment.\n  First, as a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I strongly believe \nthat the Arctic Refuge language does not belong in the budget bill and \nI am deeply concerned about the precedent this sets. The Arctic Refuge \nprovision in the budget resolution provides special reconciliation \nprotection to a major piece of environmental legislation. This is wrong \nand an abuse of the budget process. Reconciliation was designed to help \nCongress pass a large package of measures to reduce the deficit, not to \nbe used to resolve one major policy issue.\n  If this provision is allowed to stand, those who advocate drilling in \nAlaska could pass a bill opening up Arctic Refuge and we would not be \nable to offer amendments to increase our use of renewable fuels unless \nwe got 60 votes. This is unfair and would not allow for a full debate \non energy and environmental policy like we had in last Congress.\n  Now let's talk about the facts when it comes to drilling in the \nArctic refuge.\n  First, the Arctic Refuge would provide a 6-month supply of oil--which \nwould not be available for 10 years. This is not a political argument \nbut one based on nonpartisan scientific analysis of this issue. \nAccording to the 1998 U.S. Geological Survey study, there is estimated \nto be 3.2-5.2 billion barrels of economically recoverable oil in the \nArctic Refuge. This is equivalent to the amount of oil the U.S. \nconsumes in about 6 months. According to the nonpartisan Congressional \nResearch Service, production from the Arctic refuge would not even come \non line for 10 years or more.\n  The Arctic Refuge would not affect current oil or gasoline prices. \nThe price of oil is a world price and is largely determined by the \ninternational market. Given the U.S. share of the global market, the \namount of oil available from Arctic Refuge production would not \nsignificantly impact global oil prices, or U.S. oil or gasoline prices.\n  Ninety-five percent of Alaska's North Slope is already open to oil \nand gas drilling. Ninety-five percent of the potential oil reserves of \nAlaska's North Slope are already designated for potential leasing or \nopen to exploration and drilling.\n  The last 5 percent--the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge--is the \nonly wild stretch of the coast of Alaska's North Slope that remains \noff-limits. Established by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1960, the \nArctic Refuge remains the only conservation area in North America that \nprotects a complete range of arctic and sub-arctic landscapes.\n  The Arctic Refuge would not reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. \nAccording to the Energy Information Administration, EIA, the \nindependent analytical agency within the Department of Energy, drilling \nin the Arctic Refuge is projected to reduce the amount of foreign oil \nconsumed by the U.S. in 2020 from 62 to 60 percent--only a 2 percent \ndecrease! Drilling in the Arctic Refuge will not make a dent on our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  One of the arguments I have heard from across the aisle is that \ndrilling in Arctic Refuge would create jobs. My home State of Michigan \ncurrently has the second highest unemployment rate in the country. \nThere is nothing more that I would like to see on the Senate floor than \na bill to create jobs and I would vote wholeheartedly for such a \nproposal. But that's not what we have before us now.\n  We are not debating a well-funded highway bill that would create \njobs. Last year's Senate bill would have created over 830,000 jobs \nacross this country--99,000 jobs in Michigan alone--but it died in \nconference because of the Bush administration's opposition.\n  We are not debating the rising cost of health care and how it's \nhurting our manufacturers. In 2003, General Motors, the largest private \npurchaser of health care in the world, spent more covering 1.2 million \nindividuals than it did on steel.\n  We are not debating how to stop Chinese currency manipulation which \nunfairly taxes our U.S. goods overseas, and is forcing our American \nmanufacturers to close their doors.\n  We are not even debating the construction of the Alaska natural gas \npipeline which would create more than 400,000 new jobs and provide a \nhuge opportunity for our steel industry.\n  Instead we are debating drilling in one of the most environmentally \npristine areas in the world just for a 6 month supply of oil. This \nisn't an energy solution and it certainly isn't a jobs solution. I urge \nmy colleagues to support the Cantwell amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to outline my \nreasoning for my vote today against the Cantwell amendment to remove \nthe assumption of Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, ANWR, oil and gas \nexploration lease revenues from the fiscal year 2006 budget resolution.\n  I have looked at this issue very closely. I have read a great deal of \ninformation, met with many concerned groups, and listened to arguments \non both sides. And I have come to my own conclusions.\n  First, I believe exploration will have a minimal impact on the \nenvironment. The plans include drilling on a footprint the size of the \nPhiladelphia Airport. It can be done safely by limiting the acreage \neligible for exploration, combined with today's technology to mitigate \nenvironmental impacts of exploration in the area. Such technological \nadvances include: The extended reach of multi-directional drilling, \nwhich can decrease ``footprints'', reduce waste, and increase the \namount of product recovered; high resolution imaging that produces more \nprecise well locations and consequently reduces the number of wells \nneeded to access reserves; and the use of ice roads and winter season \ndrilling techniques to maximize the season and reduce the amount of \ntime to bring the reserves to market, while recognizing the needs of \nwildlife.\n\n[[Page S2778]]\n\n  While there could be a network of pipelines, I have visited ANWR and \nlooked at it personally. I saw caribou near the existing pipeline near \nANWR. The environment in Alaska can be protected consistent with our \nlaws and values.\n  Second, ANWR exploration can be part of our overall effort at oil \nindependence. We should be doing a lot more, and I have led the fight \non conservation measures. While debating energy policy during the 107th \nand l08th Congresses, I supported significant increases in renewable \nenergy, generated from wind, the sun, biomass, water and geothermal \nsources. I have also supported expanding tax credits for clean coal \ntechnologies, and I led efforts to mandate a reduction of U.S. oil \nconsumption by one million barrels per day by 2013.\n  It is only through concerted efforts to reduce projected U.S. oil \nconsumption and to utilize domestic energy resources that our Nation \nwill be able to become energy independent. If we do not take the steps \nI have outlined, our dependence on OPEC will grow. While fighting for \nthese energy policies, I have pressed for the U.S. to sue OPEC under \nantitrust laws. I have urged the current and former administrations to \ntake OPEC to the U.S. Federal courts for conspiracy to limit oil \nproduction and raise prices. This cartel has manipulated the oil \nmarkets in violation of U.S. and international law, and it should be \npursued.\n  We must take action to address the rising costs of home heating oil, \ndiesel fuel, gas at the pump, and our long-range national security \nneeds. I believe that ANWR oil and natural gas reserves can and should \nplay a role in this effort. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in the Senate to ensure that any such action only proceed in \nthe most environmentally safe manner.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \ndrilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  A sound energy policy is critical to our Nation's security. The \nUnited States is currently 57.8 percent dependent on foreign oil. By \n2025, this number is expected to rise to 68 percent. At that time, more \nthan 66 percent of our imports will come from OPEC nations, a prospect \nthat causes great concern.\n  In light of these statistics, what course should the United States \ntake? Should we open ANWR, using up what well may be the last major \nU.S. reserve of oil or should we pursue alternative approaches that \nwill encourage conservation and the development of alternative \ntechnologies?\n  Instead of rushing to deplete our last major oil reserves, I believe \nwe should develop energy efficiency and alternative technologies. Doing \nso will not only make more of an immediate difference than drilling in \nthe Arctic, but also will ensure we leave our children with ample \nenergy supplies and a broader array of energy options.\n  President Teddy Roosevelt once stated: ``I recognize the right and \nduty of this generation to develop and use our natural resources, but I \ndo not recognize the right to waste them, or to rob by wasteful use, \nthe generations that come after us.'' That is sound counsel.\n  Americans have a right to develop our energy resources, but not to \nwaste them. We could do far more to reduce our reliance on foreign oil \nby increasing the efficiency of our automobiles, which would save one \nmillion barrels of oil a day. Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge today would be akin to wasting resources that should rightfully \nbe there for future generations. We must embrace an ethic of \nstewardship of our most treasured national resources.\n  According to one scientist who testified before the Senate Government \nAffairs Committee several years ago, the United States could cut \nreliance on foreign oil by more than 50 percent by increasing energy \nefficiency by 2.2 percent per year. This is a much greater benefit than \ndrilling in ANWR would provide, and the benefits could start almost \nimmediately. The United States has a tremendous record of increasing \nenergy efficiency when we put our minds to it: Following the 1979 OPEC \nenergy shock, the United States increased its energy efficiency by 3.2 \npercent per year for several years. With today's improvements in \ntechnology, 2.2 percent is attainable.\n  America needs to both increase fuel supplies and decrease demand, but \nin our effort to meet current energy needs we should not use up our \nlast major reserves. If we increase energy efficiency and further \ndevelop alternative energy sources, we will reduce our reliance on \nforeign oil, save consumers money, increase our economic \ncompetitiveness and military effectiveness, and protect the \nenvironment.\n  In his parting words from the Oval Office, President Dwight \nEisenhower--who first set aside the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--\ntold the Nation: ``As we peer into society's future, we . . . must \navoid the impulse to live only for today, plundering for our own ease \nand convenience, the precious resources of tomorrow.''\n  I call upon my colleagues to leave intact the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge. Let us instead develop a balanced energy policy that \nprotects our environment, improves efficiency, and develops our \nrenewable resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of Senator \nCantwell's amendment to strike the reconciliation instructions in the \nbudget resolution to allow for the opening of the Arctic Refuge.\n  I am strongly opposed to opening the Alaskan wilderness to drilling \nfor oil. Stated simply we cannot drill our way out of this problem.\n  While I agree that we are too dependent on foreign oil, and need to \nreduce that dependence, drilling for oil in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge is simply not the answer.\n  Reducing oil consumption is the answer and raising our corporate \naverage fuel economy--or CAFE--standards is the superior route to \nenergy security.\n  The bottom line is that, according to estimates from the United \nStates Geological Survey, the Arctic Refuge would likely yield less \nthan 10 billion barrels of economically recoverable oil--less than a \nmillion barrels of oil per day at peak production, or less than 4 \npercent of the country's projected daily needs and the oil would not \nflow for at least 10 years.\n  In contrast, simply raising average fuel economy standards for sport \nutility vehicles could save us more than a million barrels per day by \n2020. The savings would come sooner than oil from ANWR, and unlike oil \nfrom ANWR, the savings would not run out. Raising the standards for all \nvehicles would reduce even further the amount of oil used in the United \nStates.\n  The United States contains only 2 percent of the world's oil reserves \nand only 4 percent of the world population. And yet Americans consume \n25 percent of the oil produced worldwide. Almost two-thirds of that oil \ngoes to fuel the Nation's transportation sector.\n  Given our current level of consumption in relation to our domestic \nreserves, it is clear that modest increases in domestic production--as \nfrom ANWR--will not solve our energy problems. Reducing consumption is \nthe key to increasing America's energy security.\n  Drilling in ANWR would not save consumers money because drilling \nwould not decrease the quantity consumed and would not affect the world \nprice of oil.\n  So, unlike increasing CAFE standards, drilling in ANWR would not \nsignificantly increase our energy security, would not fight climate \nchange, and would not save consumers money.\n  The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a crown jewel of the National \nWildlife Refuge system. It is the only conservation unit in the U.S. \nencompassing a complete range of arctic ecosystems and serves as \ncritical habitat for caribou, muskox, snow geese, polar bears and other \nspecies.\n  The coastal plain, which proponents of drilling paint as small and \nrelatively insignificant, is the ecological heart of the refuge and the \ncenter of wildlife activity.\n  Developing the coastal plain would threaten the refuge's abundant \nwildlife. The approximately 130,000 caribou of the porcupine herd rely \non the coastal plain as a calving area. One hundred thirty-five species \nof migratory birds use the coastal plain during the summer.\n  The coastal plain provides critical habitat for many of the refuge's \nspecies.\n  Drilling would also threaten the traditional livelihoods of the \nGwich'in people dependent upon the porcupine caribou for subsistence.\n  Proponents of drilling would have us risk all of this damage for a \nsmall\n\n[[Page S2779]]\n\namount of oil that would not even begin to flow for 10 years and would \nbarely reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  In short, the refuge's coastal plain is too precious, and contains \ntoo little oil, for us to allow drilling to take place.\n  Increasing fuel efficiency is the better solution.\n  Future generations will thank us for our foresight in protecting the \ncoastal plain and its wildlife. They will thank us for finding other \navenues to increased energy security.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Cantwell's amendment.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today is a sad day for the environmental \nmovement in this country. The Senate has taken the first step toward \nopening up the vulnerable Arctic National Wildlife Refuge by using an \narcane budget maneuver that will protect this provision from a Senate \nfilibuster. Supporters of drilling in the Arctic, knowing they could \nnot defeat a filibuster, have shoehorned a provision into the budget \nprocess that goes against the spirit, if not the letter of the rules. \nThis is a shame and sets a precedent that will certainly come to haunt \nthis Chamber.\n  I oppose drilling for oil and gas in ANWR because of the irreparable \ndamage that would be done to its fragile ecosystem that is inhabited by \n45 species of land and marine mammals. I do not believe short-term \neconomic considerations should take precedence over permanent damage to \nthe environment. We only have to look at ANWR's neighbor in Alaska to \nsee what environment cost drilling would have to this pristine \nlandscape. At Prudhoe Bay, home to one of the world's largest \nindustrial complexes, 43,000 tons of nitrogen oxides pollute the air \neach year. Hundreds of spills involving tens of thousands of gallons of \ncrude oil and other petroleum products occur annually. Decades-old \ndiesel spill sites still show little re-growth of vegetation. Why would \nthis be different for ANWR if oil companies are allowed to drill there?\n  Along with the grave environmental impact drilling would cause ANWR \nthe amount of useable oil is not sufficient to make a significant \nimpact on oil prices. U.S. consumption of oil exceeds 18 million \nbarrels per day, an amount higher than the yearly consumption for all \nof Europe, all of Africa, or all the States of the former Soviet Union. \nBased on the United States Geological Survey and Energy Information \nAgency, there are roughly 10.3 billion barrels of oil in all of ANWR's \n19 million acres. Of this amount, only 2.6 billion barrels are \n``economically recoverable,'' the equivalent of a 6-month supply of \noil. In addition, the cost of the infrastructure necessary to transport \nthe oil to the lower 48 States makes this a money losing endeavor for \nthe United States.\n  Supporters of drilling would have us believe that this oil will \nimprove the energy security of the United States, but this is not \naccurate. The oil companies that will drill in ANWR have no commitment \nto sell this oil in the U.S. In fact, the oil that comes out of Alaska \nwill be sold on the world market to the highest bidder. No one who \nsupports drilling requires that the oil that comes out of our soil stay \nin our country. We should not be surprised then when oil from Alaska \nends up in China, Korea, and Japan instead of Wisconsin.\n  I think it is clear that drilling in ANWR will not provide enough \ndomestic oil supply to minimize the control that OPEC has on the \npetroleum market. Insulating ourselves from the world prices of oil \nwill not come from increasing domestic production. We cannot drill \nourselves out of our oil dependency, there is simply not enough oil \nwithin our borders. Instead, the U.S. can reduce its vulnerability to \noil price shocks by decreasing its demand for oil altogether. The way \nto ease the impact of high oil prices on consumers is to give consumers \ntools to reduce their demand for oil. Cleary this debate should be \nabout alternative energy sources, such as ethanol or hybrid vehicle \ntechnology, and not wasting our time with an oil reserve were the costs \noutweigh the benefits.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Cantwell \namendment to protect America's National Arctic Wildlife Refuge.\n  I traveled to Alaska in the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez spill in \n1989. What I saw there was terrible. More than 11 million gallons of \noil had spewed into the Prince William Sound. I saw animals covered in \noil, many of them dead. I saw workers wiping oil off of birds and other \nwildlife. It was a devastating tragedy, and it made a big impression on \nme.\n  I thought about my children and grandchildren. I felt that they \ndeserve to inherit the earth in its beautiful natural State not ravaged \nat the hands of man.\n  In 1990, Exxon released a video claiming that long-term effects of \nthe massive oil spill were minor. That's what Exxon said in 1990. But \ntoday, 16 years after the disaster, nature tells a different story. \nToday, large portions of the Prince William Sound remain contaminated.\n  Several Alaskan families visited my office last year to tell their \nstory. One old fisherman said, ``My grandson will never get to fish for \nherring. We've been fishing for herring for three generations in my \nfamily. But since the spill, there is no more herring.''\n  Even today, pools of toxic oil can be found just below the surface \nand sometimes on top the ground. In my office, I have a sample that the \nAlaskan families left with me when they traveled all the way to \nWashington to ask for our help. They found rocks drenched in oil just a \nfew inches beneath the surface of the ground.\n  Some might say nothing on such a scale could ever occur in the Arctic \nRefuge because the oil would be transported by pipeline, not tanker. \nBut nothing built by humans is perfect or accident-proof. And even \nunder a best-case scenario, drilling for oil could ruin the Arctic \nRefuge.\n  I had the privilege of visiting the Arctic Refuge a few years ago. It \nis a remarkable place where more than 100 species of birds breed. \nCaribou migrate 1600 miles to reach the Refuge, where they give birth \nto their calves.\n  Proponents of drilling in the refuge say it will have a negligible \neffect, barely noticeable in that vast expanse. I have seen the oil \ndrilling complexes on the North Slope and I would hardly call them \nnegligible.\n  The fact is the exploration for oil in the Arctic Refuge has already \nmarred its pristine beauty. I visited there, I saw the debris of human \nintrusion, acres of rusting pipes and dilapidated structures. As my \nplane flew across Deadhorse, near Prudhoe Bay, I saw the tundra \nlittered with refuse, oil rigs and other abandoned equipment.\n  This was left behind by the same oil companies that now promise they \nwill be good stewards of the Arctic Refuge. Why would we risk \ndevastating this national treasure? For what gain? Even under the most \noptimistic projections, the U.S. Geological Survey says the Arctic \nRefuge could provide about a million barrels of oil a day for 20 years. \nCompared to our total energy needs, this is not even a drop in the \nbucket it is a drop in the barrel.\n  There is a better way.\n  Simply by closing the loophole that exempts large SUVs from our fuel \nefficiency standards, we can save as much oil as the oil companies \ncould possibly produce in the Arctic Refuge.\n  Mr. President, when President Eisenhower designated this special \nplace as a Wildlife Refuge, our nation made a promise to future \ngenerations. We promised that some places on earth would always remain \nunspoiled by the hand of man.\n  Let's not break that promise. Let's not sell our children's \nbirthright for a few barrels of oil.\n  Instead, let's develop a real energy strategy for the 21st Century--a \nstrategy that uses oil more efficiently, and employs American know-how \nto harness new sources of energy.\n  Mr. President, the American people know what is at stake. My office \nhas received 15,000 messages this week urging the Senate not to despoil \nthe Arctic Refuge.\n  I will vote for the Cantwell amendment, and I urge all my colleagues \nto do likewise.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment to \nstrip ANWR from the budget resolution. I am pleased that ANWR is in the \nbudget this year. As a matter of fact, I returned from ANWR just last \nweek. After visiting it, I am even more confident in my support for \ndrilling there.\n  I went with a group of Senators, Secretary Norton, and Secretary \nBodman\n\n[[Page S2780]]\n\nto ANWR to see firsthand what all the talk was about. We met with \nenvironmentalists and villagers on the border of ANWR and talked to \nthem about the United States' desperate need for more domestic energy \nsources. There were a few residents who expressed opposition, but they \nwere in the minority. The majority of the people living near ANWR--more \nthan 75 percent--support drilling in ANWR.\n  I know that there are some in the Senate who are desperate to stop us \nfrom opening ANWR. The facts about ANWR, however, are not on their \nside. Some of these facts I think need to be repeated, especially for \nthose Senators who are new to the debate.\n  ANWR itself is roughly the size of South Carolina. It's absolutely \nenormous. It's 19.6 million acres or 30,000 square miles. But, when we \ntalk about drilling in ANWR, we're talking about clean drilling in an \narea of less than 2,000 acres--that's 0.001 percent of the total \nacreage of ANWR. It's smaller than many airports.\n  To say that drilling in this limited portion of ANWR threatens the \nentire environment of the refuge is farfetched and just plain wrong. \nDuring my trip, I visited the sites at Alpine and Prudhoe Bay. There is \nnow no doubt in my mind that we can develop ANWR in a safe and \neffective manner.\n  Drilling will only be a small footprint in ANWR that can be carried \nout in an environmentally sound manner. State of the art techniques \nwill lessen the environmental impact. The old stereotypes of dirty oil \ndrilling just don't apply anymore. In fact, if we do start drilling in \nANWR, the drilling operations would be conducted under the most \ncomprehensive environmental regulations in the world.\n  We all want to do what we can to protect the environment.\n  But it's just not credible to say that looking for oil in this small, \nlimited part of ANWR is a dangerous threat to the entire region. I also \nthink that many environmentalists fail to see that if we do not begin \noil production in ANWR, foreign oil companies will take up the slack \nand drill in places such as the Middle East where environmental \nregulations are much less restrictive than ours. Opening ANWR could \nactually be more environmentally sound than the alternative.\n  We consume over 20 million barrels of oil a day and our consumption \nis expected to increase to 28 million barrels a day over the next 20 \nyears. Yet, we haven't built an oil refinery in the last 25 years. We \nmust increase our energy supplies to keep up with the demand of our \ngrowing economy.\n  ANWR is the most promising domestic source of oil that we have. If \nthe Senate passes ANWR, it will make a huge difference for our domestic \nconsumption. There are 10 to 30 billion barrels of oil recoverable in \nANWR. Just to put this in perspective, that's enough to fuel all of \nKentucky's oil needs for at least 79 years.\n  ANWR would boost Alaska's oil production. And with the new Alaska \npipeline, we could get it quickly to the rest of the United States. It \nwould provide the United States with nearly 1 million barrels a day or \n4.5 percent of today's consumption for the next 30 years.\n  Drilling in ANWR would also take a tremendous strike toward ensuring \nour national security. We currently import more than 55 percent of the \noil we use. The price of oil has remained at over $50 a barrel. OPEC \nestimates that within 2 years the price of oil could jump to $80 a \nbarrel. These high prices mean we are just throwing money needlessly at \nother countries.\n  If we open ANWR for drilling, that would mean we would not be sending \nover $800 billion to areas like the Middle East for our oil. Instead, \nwe could be investing that money on American soil. Being dependent on \noil imports from other regions of the world, puts America's energy and \neconomic security at risk.\n  ANWR offers the realistic opportunity to produce enough oil to \nreplace the volume we currently import from Saudi Arabia or Iraq for \nthe next 25 years.\n  If the choice comes down to avoiding our domestic oil resources \nbecause of dated and irrational environmental concerns versus drilling \nin ANWR to lessen the chance that we will have to rely on undemocratic \nregimes in the Middle East for our oil, then there's no choice at all.\n  And ANWR would provide more than just oil to meet our energy needs. \nThe region also has a vast amount of natural gas. We don't have enough \nnatural gas supply in this country to meet our demand. Natural gas \nprices keep going up and up. In the area where drilling would take \nplace, there is up to 10.9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.\n  Right now, they are circular pumping the natural gas back into the \nreserves in Alaska.\n  Instead of pumping ANWR's natural gas back into the earth, we should \nuse this for our energy needs. Opening ANWR up for drilling won't \nchange our dependence on foreign sources of energy overnight. No single \nsource can totally end our dependence on foreign energy.\n  But opening ANWR and boosting production will definitely be a huge \nstep toward America becoming self sufficient for our own energy needs \nand strengthening our national security.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment and to support the \nenergy independence which ANWR offers.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Alaska's \nindigenous peoples, the Alaska natives. I will oppose the Cantwell \namendment. My position is based on my experiences in Alaska when I \nvisited the village of Kaktovik in 1995 and spoke to the Inupiat \npeoples who greatly desire this opportunity for economic self-\ndetermination. My position is not new--I have remained firm in the \nposition for the last 10 years. In developing this position I have met \nwith individuals and organizations who have advocated on both sides of \nthis issue.\n  For me, this vote is not a vote just about preservation of the \nenvironment versus development. It is a vote about the self-\ndetermination of an indigenous people and their homeland. The Inupiat, \nwho live within the boundaries of the coastal plain, are a people with \nstrong cultural values, and are deeply in touch with their environment \nand everything that lives there. It is the Inupiat who have been the \ncaretakers of the Arctic region for thousands of years.\n  To some of my colleagues, the debate about ANWR is about energy. To \nothers, it is about the environment. To me, ANWR is really about \nwhether or not the indigenous people who are directly impacted have a \nvoice about the use of their lands. The Inupiat know every mile, every \ncurve in the landscape of the coastal plain, and every animal that must \nsurvive there, for their own survival depends on this. They have the \ngreatest incentive of anyone to preserve their environment, including \nthe plants and animals that live on the coastal plain, in order to \nmaintain their way of life.\n  They too depend on the caribou and they have participated in the \nprotection of the caribou while monitoring and working with the oil \nindustry at Prudhoe Bay. Their experience has demonstrated that a \ncareful balance is possible, and that preservation and development are \nnot mutually exclusive. My colleagues, I do not live on the coastal \nplain. For that reason, I trust the wisdom and knowledge of those who \nhave lived and cared for the land there for many, many generations.\n  I will vote to provide the Inupiat with the opportunity to provide \nfor themselves and their future generations. They have spoken and have \nbeen steadfast in their position for many, many years. I am confident \nthat they will protect their homeland and utilize its resources with \nthe native values that have served them well since time began. Their \nposition is supported by the Alaska Federation of Natives, which \nrepresents 110,000 Alaska natives, and the native village of Kaktovic.\n  This has not been an easy decision for me given the fact that this is \none of the few times that I am not voting with the majority of my \ncolleagues in my party. As much as I would like to vote with my \ncolleagues, I must remain true to myself and my values. For me, this is \nan issue about economic self-determination. This is an issue about \nallowing those who have lived on the coastal plain and cared for the \ncoastal plain for many, many generations, to do what they believe is \nright with their lands.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I don't know what all the fight is about. \nIf the\n\n[[Page S2781]]\n\ncomments are true, that they think no one will bid, why do they oppose \nthis? I am interested in the Senator from Wisconsin and his great \ndefense of wildlife refuges. This area we are talking about is not \nwithin a wildlife refuge. It is not wilderness. But in his State, he \nhas three pipelines running through wildlife refuges. Wisconsin has \nstood aside for all that they want.\n  And as a matter of fact, the Senator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell, \nsaid that only Alaskans benefit from oil development. This happens to \nbe oil development on Federal land. It is not true that only Alaskans \nbenefit from development of our State. We happen to have a unique State \nin that we share the income we get from royalties on oil and natural \ngas that came from Prudhoe Bay where the State owns the land.\n  Incidentally, I want to tell my friend, the former Presidential \ncandidate, Mr. Kerry, I take umbrage at his comment that I am guilty of \nunethical conduct because I am supporting the budget resolution \nreported by the Budget Committee. That smacks very much of something \nthat is a subject of personal privilege, and I shall consider that \nlater. Maybe Senator Kerry would like to come explain why he has \nsingled me out for unethical conduct. But beyond that, I must express \nmy amazement that my colleague from Washington has offered this \namendment.\n  In 1980, the former Senator from Washington and my good friend, Henry \n``Scoop'' Jackson wrote a letter discussing the importance of ANWR and \nthis 1.5 million acres. He said ANWR was:\n\n     . . . crucial to the nation's attempt to achieve energy \n     independence. One-third of our known petroleum reserves are \n     in Alaska, along with an even greater proportion of our \n     potential reserves. Actions such as preventing even the \n     exploration of the Arctic Wildlife Range . . . is an ostrich-\n     like approach that ill serves our nation in this time of \n     energy crisis.\n\n  That is the former Senator from Washington. Not only does ANWR serve \nour important national security interests, it serves the economic \ninterests of the State of Washington. As a matter of fact, Washington \ngets a great deal more out of Alaska's oil development than anyone. The \neconomic health of the Puget Sound is tied directly to Alaska, as is \nillustrated by a report commissioned by the Tacoma-Pierce County and \nGreater Seattle Chambers of Commerce. Of particular importance is the \noil production from the North Slope. Washington's refining industry \npurchases almost its entire crude stock from Alaska.\n  The report states that:\n\n       Direct impact from the refining of Alaska crude oil within \n     the Puget Sound region includes 1,990 jobs and $144.5 million \n     in labor earnings. In 2003, oil refineries in the Puget Sound \n     imported $2.8 billion worth of crude oil from Alaska.\n\n  Alaska oil provided 90 percent of the region's oil refinery needs. \nOil development is a major contributor to the health of Washington's \neconomy. As oil wealth in the State of Alaska increases, so does demand \nfor Puget Sound goods and services. That is why the chambers of \ncommerce of Washington State support ANWR. They understand that with \nPrudhoe Bay declining--today it only produces about 950 thousand \nbarrels a day; it used to produce 2.1 million barrels a day--additional \noil resources must be developed to ensure the continued economic \nviability of the Puget Sound region. The Puget Sound region has the \nluxury of purchasing our oil. Otherwise it would be purchasing oil from \ndistant foreign shores.\n\n  The development of Prudhoe Bay has contributed more than $1.6 billion \nto the Washington economy. And ANWR alone is estimated to create over \n12,000 new jobs in Washington State alone, in addition to the revenues \nit will generate. None of these benefits will take place if the \nSenator's amendment is allowed to pass. Not only are decreasing oil \noutput and declining revenues affecting the health of Washington, its \nmajor businesses are feeling the heat, particularly the aviation \nindustry.\n  The rise in fuel prices is greatly impacting Washington's aviation \nindustry. Our airline industry has lost over $25 billion in the last 3 \nyears. Sustained high jet fuel costs of $1.50 per gallon, which is \nalmost three times that of 1999, continues to hamper the health of this \ncritical industry. Every dollar per barrel the cost of oil rises costs \nthe airline industry an additional $2 million per month. High energy \nprices also prevent job creation in the transportation sector. The Air \nTransport Association estimates that for every dollar increase in the \nprice of fuel, they could fund almost 5,300 airline jobs. That should \nbe worrisome to a person who represents the area of the aerospace \nindustry of this country and wants to deny us access to this oil.\n  Let me speak about access to this oil. Washington consumes 17.6 \nmillion gallons of petroleum per day, including 7.3 million gallons of \ngasoline and $2.5 million for jet fuel. It produces no oil at all. Were \nit not for oil from my State, the Puget Sound region would be \ndestitute.\n  Now, some people argue we should not develop ANWR because it would \ndevastate the traditional lifestyle of Alaska's Natives. I think they \ndo a disservice to the Alaskan Native people. They talk about the \nGwich'ins. Let me be sure that everybody understands that the \nGwich'ins, which the Democrats parade around this town, are from the \nSouth Slope. They are not in the North Slope. They have no traditional \nrole in the North Slope. The only thing they share with the North Slope \nis the fact that the porcupine caribou herd, which comes from Canada up \nto the North Slope, goes through their area on up to the North Slope, \nand that is where they calve. But not every year. Some years they don't \ngo. Why? Because their relatives in Canada kill too many.\n  The Gwich'ins hunt caribou in Canada and they can serve it \ncommercially. For them, it is a sports animal versus a subsistence \nanimal on our side. They have benefitted from oil production. They have \nprovided revenues for schools, clean water, sanitation, electrical \npower, health clinics, roads, and Natives.\n  I don't think most people understand that because of the situation in \nterms of the Alaska Land Claims Settlement Act, when one region gets \nmoney from natural resources, it must share with the other 11 regions. \nThe 7(i) concept is the most unique concept in America. That is why all \nof the Natives in Alaska have an interest in ANWR.\n  If the Natives of the North Slope get money--and they will--from this \ndevelopment, they must share that with the other 11 regions. I have \nworked closely with them to enact the strictest environmental standards \non the planet, dealing with the developments on the North Slope.\n  People don't realize that the petroleum industry has been able to \ncoexist with wildlife in the Arctic, and it really has the support of \nthe Natives who live in that area. Thirty-three percent of unemployed \nAlaskans are Natives. Twenty percent of Alaskan Natives have incomes \nbelow the poverty line. Development of ANWR holds the potential to \nimprove their situation. That is why they are in this city now trying \nto tell Members that they want ANWR developed.\n  We have been accused of trying to use strange procedures. I don't \nthink it is strange. We had the same provision in last year and they \nwere able to take it out. They knew they had the votes last year and \nthey were not screaming like they are now. This year, things have \nchanged. There has been an election.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a quick point?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a list of the times the reconciliation process has been used \nfor actions very similar to this, many of which were in periods when \nthe Democrats controlled this Senate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Sample of ``Policies'' Enacted in Reconciliation Bills\n\n                        (Not an exhaustive list)\n\n\n               OMNIBUS BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1982\n\n       Froze dairy price supports\n       Reduced COLAs for food stamps\n       Required home buyers to pay a lump-sum premium for FHA \n     mortgage Insurance\n\n\n         CONSOLIDATED OMNIBUS BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1985\n\n       Raised offshore drilling revenues\n       Increased PBGC premium rate\n       Made Medicare HI tax mandatory for State and local \n     government workers\n\n\n               OMNIBUS BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1986\n\n       Required sale of government's share of Conrail\n\n[[Page S2782]]\n\n               OMNIBUS BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1987\n\n       Required sale of federally-held loans for rural \n     electrification, telephone bank, and water projects\n       Reduced agriculture subsidies and price support programs\n\n\n               OMNIBUS BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1989\n\n       Raised the SS wage base\n       Increased broadcasting and nuclear regulating fees\n       Limited Medicare hospital and physician reimbursement rates\n       Reduced spending on farm programs and subsidies\n       Tightened student loan program to deal with defaults\n\n\n               OMNIBUS BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1990\n\n       Raised income taxes\n       Raised gasoline taxes\n       Extended unemployment insurance tax\n       Reduced spending on veterans' compensation and pension \n     benefits\n\n\n               OMNIBUS BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1993\n\n       Mandated auctioning of FCC licenses for spectrum\n       Reduced AFDC match rates\n       Delayed military COLAs by several months\n\n\n PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY, WORK OPPORTUNITY, AND MEDICAID RESTRUCTURING \n                              ACT OF 1996\n\n       Overhauled welfare (did welfare reform)\n       Restructured supplemental security income\n       Put in place new procedures to establish paternity and \n     enforce child support orders\n       Restricted benefits for legal and illegal immigrants\n\n\n                      BALANCED BUDGET ACT OF 1997\n\n       Set discretionary caps\n       Established Paygo rules\n       Raised the debt limit\n       Significantly altered Medicare--expanded choice, created \n     MSAs, changed payment rates, changed Medicare reimbursements \n     to hospitals, reduced payments for physician services\n       Gave more flexibility to Medicaid to put enrollees in \n     managed care\n       Created state children's health insurance (SCHIP)\n       Further reformed welfare\n       Veterans cost savings\n       Education cost savings\n       Spectrum sales\n       Petroleum reserve--allowed foreign governments to lease \n     unused space in Louisiana salt caves that stored the \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am winding down. We have sent this item \nto the President to ask why we don't follow the usual procedures. \nPresident Clinton vetoed it on the request of the people on that side. \nWe passed this in the Senate twice.\n  The trouble is, for 24 years we have tried to carry out commitments \nmade by Senators Tsongas and Jackson that this area would be explored. \nFor 24 years, there have been devices used by the other side to prevent \nit. But they forget even Congressman Mo Udall stated that nothing stops \na future Congress from allowing exploration for these uses if they are \nof sufficient national importance. The question is whether they are of \nsufficient national importance.\n  Those who voted for this amendment will tell you they are voting \nagainst ANWR, but they won't tell you what they are for. Where are they \ngoing to get the oil? A vote for this amendment is a vote for the \nstatus quo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will use a couple more minutes off of our allotted \ntime.\n  My friend Ronald Reagan used to say that ``status quo is Latin for \n'the mess we are in.' '' A vote for this amendment closes our domestic \nresources to production. It is a vote for continuing our current policy \nof importing more than 60 percent of our Nation's oil. It is a vote for \noutsourcing more than 1.3 million American jobs a year. A vote for this \namendment is a vote for increasing home heating bills and \ntransportation costs. It is a vote to diminish our national security by \nrelying on rogue nations, nations with unstable regimes.\n  I don't think there is a Senator in this Congress who would offer a \nbill that exports 1.3 million American jobs every year, will cost $200 \nbillion annually by 2025, and leaves our national security vulnerable \nto the whims of unfriendly foreign regimes. That is what this does.\n  A vote for this amendment is not just a vote against ANWR; it is a \nvote for closing our Nation's single greatest prospect for future oil \ndevelopment and backing out of the promise made to Alaskans in 1980--\nand all Americans--when Senators Jackson and Tsongas created section \n1002 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.\n  A vote for this amendment is a vote against the people of Washington \nState, who rely almost completely on Alaska for their oil for their \nindustrial base and energy consumption.\n  Above all, a vote for this amendment is against Alaska Natives who \noverwhelmingly support development in ANWR because they know they can \nbalance stewardship and conservation with the development. Alaska \nNatives would use a portion of the revenues to finance schools, water \nsystems, and health clinics while pursuing their way of life.\n  Again, every Alaska Native will share in the money that is received \nby the North Slope people. They all share because of the bill this \nCongress wrote, the Alaskan Native Land Claim Settlement Act.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, information was provided by the \nPresident's own economist and energy supply analysts who were asked \nrecently about whether refuge drilling was going to have any impact on \noil prices. Even the President's own economist at the Energy \nInformation Administration found that opening ANWR will have negligible \nimpact on prices.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the resolution by the National \nCongress of American Indians be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Resolution #SD-02-108\n\n       Supporting the Subsistence Lifeways of Alaska Tribes, \n     Gwich'in, Inupiat, Tlingit, Athabaskan, and Saint Lawrence \n     Island Native Peoples, and of Related Indigenous Peoples in \n     Canada and Russia, and Opposing Efforts by Multinational \n     Economic and Political Interests that Would Endanger These \n     Lifeways\n       Whereas, we, the members of the National Congress of \n     American Indians of the United States, invoking the divine \n     blessing of the Creator upon our efforts and purposes, in \n     order to preserve for ourselves and our descendants the \n     inherent sovereign rights of our Indian nations, rights \n     secured under Indian treaties and agreements with the United \n     States, and all other rights and benefits to which we are \n     entitled under the laws and Constitution of the United \n     States, to enlighten the public toward a better understanding \n     of the Indian people and their way of life, to preserve \n     Indian cultural values, and otherwise promote the health, \n     safety and welfare of the Indian people, do hereby establish \n     and submit the following resolution; and\n       Whereas, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) \n     was established in 1944 and is the oldest and largest \n     national organization of American Indian and Alaska Native \n     tribal governments; and\n       Whereas, the subsistence traditions of Alaska Native \n     peoples and other related indigenous peoples vary \n     considerably among regions and cultures but are tied together \n     by the common strands of their importance for indigenous \n     cultural survival, and their vulnerability to attack from \n     outside parties that lack respect for these subsistence \n     traditions and would destroy or endanger these traditions in \n     pursuit of their multinational economic or political \n     objectives; and\n       Whereas, like the Yupik people of the Akiak Native \n     Community and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta of Southwest Alaska, \n     the Gwich'in Athabaskan people of Eastern Alaska and Canada's \n     Yukon Territory, the Athabaskan nations throughout Alaska, \n     the Inupiat people of northern and western Alaska, the Saint \n     Lawrence Island Natives of the Bering Sea, the Siberian Yupik \n     Familial Relatives of Saint Lawrence Islanders who live on \n     the Russian side of the Bering Sea, and other Indigenous \n     peoples of Eastern Siberia, all depend on the perpetuation \n     of their various subsistence traditions across the \n     generations for the very survival of their indigenous \n     cultures; and\n       Whereas, legal barriers and ecologically destructive \n     practices imposed by multinational economic and political \n     interests can and have disrupted indigenous hunting \n     traditions in places around the world, and even where these \n     disruptive actions may have ultimately proven temporary in \n     nature, they have interfered with the perpetuation of \n     indigenous subsistence traditions across the generations, \n     thereby threatening the very survival of indigenous cultures; \n     and\n       Whereas, the cultural survival of the Gwich'in is so tied \n     to the survival and continuation of the migratory cycle of \n     the Porcupine Caribou Herd of Canada and Alaska that the \n     Gwich'in are known as the ``People of the Caribou''; and\n       Whereas, the Inupiaq people have likewise been referred to \n     as the ``People of the Whale'' because of their profound \n     cultural relationship with the bowhead whale, which provides \n     the foundation of their subsistence diet, and serves as a \n     central organizing factor for a culture that is largely \n     structured around whaling crew affiliations and associated \n     familial relationships; and\n       Whereas, the Saint Lawrence Island natives are likewise \n     dependent upon whaling\n\n[[Page S2783]]\n\n     for their cultural survival, and the Native peoples of \n     eastern Siberia, have only recently begun the difficult task \n     of trying to reclaim and reinvigorate subsistence whaling \n     traditions suppressed under decades of Soviet rule; and\n       Whereas, the people of Southeastern Alaska are likewise \n     dependent on herring for their subsistence lifeways; and\n       Whereas, all Alaska Natives are dependent on the river ways \n     for their traditional lifeways related to the Salmon; and\n       Whereas, all of these subsistence traditions are currently \n     threatened by multinational political and economic interests \n     that place them at risk; and\n       Whereas, the cultural survival of the Gwich'in people is \n     threatened by multinational oil companies and pro-industry \n     officials in the highest ranks of the United States \n     government forces that would callously place the survival of \n     the Porcupine Caribou Herd at risk, by gambling that oil \n     exploration and development on the Herd's calving grounds in \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge of Alaska would not have \n     the devastating effects on the herd that many biologists and \n     people with indigenous knowledge of the Caribou believe such \n     actions would; and\n       Whereas, the cultural survival of the Inupiat people, the \n     Saint Lawrence Island Natives, and the indigenous peoples of \n     Eastern Siberia are likewise threatened by recent development \n     before the International Whaling Commission, where Japan \n     succeeded in blocking the allocation of whaling quotas for \n     Alaska Natives and indigenous Siberians, beginning in 2003, \n     and did so solely out of a desire to retaliate against the \n     United States for its opposition to the resumption of a \n     commercial whaling industry in Japan, as well as offshore \n     exploration and drilling, and\n       Whereas, it is morally wrong and a violation of basic human \n     rights for multinational corporations and national \n     governments to place the survival of indigenous cultures at \n     risk, especially to pursue excess wealth or international \n     political advantage, and it is important that the NCAI oppose \n     these assaults on indigenous lifeways that are currently \n     being perpetuated in the international arena.\n       Now therefore be it resolved, that the NCAI does hereby \n     oppose the efforts of multinational oil companies and certain \n     high ranking federal officials to open the public lands of \n     the Arctic Refuge to 1002 area to oil exploration and \n     development in complete disregard of the risks such action \n     would create for the cultural survival of the Gwich'in People \n     of Alaska and Canada, and calls upon the government of the \n     United States to reject any and all proposals that might \n     create such risks, excluding any interest in the 92,000 acres \n     of Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation (KIC) privately held land; \n     and\n       Be it further resolved, that the NCAI similarly opposes the \n     efforts of commercial fishing interests which adversely \n     affect the subsistence salmon and herring customary and \n     traditional fishing rights of all tribes of Alaska, and\n       Be it further resolved, that the NCAI similarly opposes the \n     efforts of the government of Japan and Japanese commercial \n     whaling interests to play international power politics by \n     shutting down indigenous whaling in Alaska and Siberia at the \n     expense of indigenous cultures that must be allowed to \n     survive and perpetuate their way of life, and that NCAI calls \n     upon the governments of the United States, Russia, and Japan \n     to take appropriate steps to end this callous and abusive \n     mistreatment of indigenous cultures on both sides of the \n     Bering Sea border; and\n       Be it finally resolved, that this resolution shall be the \n     policy of NCAI until it is withdrawn or modified by \n     subsequent resolution.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. We have heard a lot about tribes in Alaska. I want to \npoint out to my colleagues that the National Congress of American \nIndians, an organization representing more than 500 tribes across the \ncountry, have previously opposed drilling in the wildlife refuge, and \nthat certainly is what we are talking about--a debate of national \nsignificance.\n  I point out that many people in Puget Sound and across the country do \nbelieve this isn't going to do anything to meet our country's energy \nneeds. This newspaper article says:\n\n       Drilling in the refuge would increase America's reliance on \n     fossil fuels and do little to limit our dependence on \n     imported oil.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut, who \nhas been so outspoken and important to this debate. I thank him for his \nleadership on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 6 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for her principled \nleadership on this fight.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I come to this debate with some long \nhistory here, as other Members of the Senate have as well. This was one \nof the reasons I ran for the Senate. I was troubled by the plans to \ndrill for oil in the Arctic refuge. It was an issue in my 1988 \ncampaign. I have been battling this ever since.\n  Why does it matter so much to me? Sure, it relates to our national \nenergy policy. Does it develop enough oil to really matter to price or \navailability? No. Can we drill our way out of energy dependence on \nforeign oil? No. We have to think and innovate and entrepreneurize our \nway out of it.\n  This all begins, for me, with the beginning--with the Bible and the \ninstructions God gave to Adam and Eve that they should both work and \nguard the Garden of Eden, which is to say that they should develop and \ncultivate it but also protect it, because we are here for a short time. \nThe Psalms tell us that the Earth is the Lord's and the fullness \nthereof. You have a responsibility to protect the beauty of nature that \nhas been given to us for the generations that will follow us--to work \nand to guard.\n  Let me come to the North Slope.\n  We come to this day with a judgment having been made. Ninety-five \npercent of the North Slope in this part of Alaska is open for \nexploration, oil exploration and potential drilling. We drew a line. \nOur predecessors drew a line: This 5 percent should be preserved as a \nwildlife refuge; if you will, a small piece of Eden, preserved in this \nmagnificent State.\n  Now we are going to break that line, we are going to destroy that \nremaining part and have an inevitable negative consequence, both on the \nwilderness, the wildlife there, and also on the native people who \ndepend on it and of whose heritage it is part.\n  We can go back and forth about which side the native people are on.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nRobert Thompson, Kaktovik Arctic Adventurers, containing a petition \ndrive, which has secured 57 signatures from the people in Kaktovik, \nlikely a majority of the voting adults there--it sounds like Dicksville \nNotch, doesn't it?--who support Senator Cantwell's proposal.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                   Kaktovik Arctic Adventures,\n\n                                      Kaktovik, AK, Mar. 14, 2005.\n       To the Senators of the United States: I am writing in \n     regards to concerns relating to preserving the culture of my \n     people, the inupiat, and the culture of my friends, the \n     gwich`in.\n       There is an area that is being considered for oil and gas \n     exploitation, the 1002 area of the arctic national wildlife \n     refuge, for years there has been a perception that the \n     inupiat of the north slope were all in favor of this. Perhaps \n     previously this was so as it seemed the oil infrastructure \n     was far away and people benefited from it. This is changing \n     rather dramatically. A recent petition drive in Kaktovik, \n     which is still in progress, has secured 57 signatures, that \n     is likely a majority of the voting adults in Kaktovik.\n       Such a small amount considering the larger population of \n     the U.S. However if this drive were to have taken place a \n     month ago it is doubtful that there would have been more then \n     ten sign. We have had many events happen in the Bush \n     administration that make people realize that we don't really \n     count for much in their plan.\n       The ocean is aggressively being leased. On Feb. 22, Gov. \n     Murkowski clearly stated the state's position on developing \n     state near shore, off-shore areas. He implied that if the \n     residents were told that restrictions to drilling during \n     whale migrations were offered we wouldn't mind. He did not \n     consult with us. Our concerns go way beyond that. Oil spilled \n     in the arctic ocean can not be cleaned up to any standard \n     that is acceptable to us.\n       Federal offshore areas are being offered to oil companies \n     also. This is the area that is central to our culture, our \n     whaling culture. People are realizing that the 1002 area \n     being sold is the last 5% of our lands. Big oil has access to \n     95% of the north slope. Leases are happening at a very fast \n     pace. If the 1002 area is leased, big oil will have almost \n     100% of the north slope to exploit. Why is almost 100% of the \n     north slope being sold to the oil companies? And why can't we \n     save the last 5%? The people should know there is an area \n     that is 23,500,000 acres, the national petroleum reserve that \n     has huge quantities of oil, that in addition to known \n     reserves that are readily available.\n       I am honored to be part of this movement to save our land, \n     our ocean and our culture. When a person realizes that those \n     signing this petition did so with the full realization that \n     in doing so they would possibly be losing a large amount of \n     money, it is magnified to an honorable action, it is people \n     standing with their people for the good of all. I am not in a \n     corporation here so my involvement is not the same. The \n     signors are doing it for the preservation of our culture for \n     future generations. I hope that you senators will give full \n     consideration to this event. We are attempting to use the \n     democratic process to save our culture.\n       Before this it could be said and often was, that we wanted \n     all that oil money. You are now facing a group of people who \n     are saying that no amount of money is worth exchanging our \n     culture for. However this goes, future\n\n[[Page S2784]]\n\n     generations of inupiat can look back and say, those people \n     who signed tried to do the right thing. Somehow, I feel that \n     it will be important to them to know that someone cared.\n       In closing I would like to thank our friends in Hawaii for \n     their efforts to help us save our culture. I have visited \n     there and have heard people talk about the large corporations \n     that had adverse effects on their culture and their stated \n     desire to help us prevent that from happening to us.\n       Your many efforts are sincerely appreciated.\n           mahalo,\n     Robert Thompson.\n                                  ____\n\n       Kaktovik's people don't want development on ANWR. Petition \n     has a large number of voting adults opposing opening of the \n     Refuge for oil development.\n       No doubt the oil industry has become commonplace for the \n     Inupiaqs of the Slope. A tolerant culture of the oil industry \n     has long been acclaimed as a righteous society of the North \n     Slope as a result of the oil boom over the past 30 years. No \n     taking into consideration the impacts in regards to the \n     traditional, subsistence & social lifestyle of the Inupiaq & \n     the corruption of the subsistence lands that we use. People \n     of the Slope have accepted the oil industry indoctrination's \n     by allowing them to sponsor our vi1lage events & celebrations \n     designed to foster this for revenue propaganda without \n     willing to ask or examine if this is a desirable outcome for \n     the Inupiaq. Oblivious to the oil industry's subtle invasion \n     & eradication of our subsistence hunting lands, as well as \n     our traditional & cultural practices.\n       Perhaps it was a good idea in the beginning to use the \n     revenues of the oil industry for the economy of the North \n     Slope. But the oil & revenues have declined & the ``for \n     profit firms'' & those that have become dependent on the oil \n     revenue are now going after the last 5% of the land that is \n     not open to drilling. This beautiful Arctic ecosystem that \n     has sustained & provided the Inupiaqs in many ways could \n     possibly be replaced with an oil industrialized city. Which \n     is now realized that this is precious to them in terms of \n     their subsistence ways. No one wants to see oil rigs when \n     they are out hunting or camping like some of the other areas \n     across the Slope have seen, which has impacted their \n     subsistence ways & social structure.\n       The people are realizing that ANWR may only bring temporary \n     employment & revenue, for there may be no oil found in ANWR. \n     Which will leave for our future generation the further \n     despoilment of the land & subsistence lifestyle of the \n     Inupiaq, if ANWR is opened up for oil development. Some no \n     longer agree with the Government, the ``for profit firms'', \n     or anyone's idea of trading the subsistence lands that the \n     Inupiaq depend on for any amount of oil or revenue. We feel \n     that it's not worth all in the long run for the future of \n     generations of the Inupiaq. Our investment is in keeping the \n     last remaining 5% of our land intact for our future \n     generation to continue our subsistence & traditional way of \n     life.\n       Because hunting and the relationship to the land are of \n     profound cultural and spiritual importance to the Inuit of \n     the North Slope. The meaning of life for most Inupiaq is \n     still found in land and our subsistence lifestyle. Hunting \n     off the land provides a link to the past and a cultural \n     identity. It is valued for its contribution to independence, \n     self-esteem, respect from others, psychological well-being, \n     and healthy lifestyle. ``Going out on the land'' is a means \n     of spiritual renewal and a method of re-establishing the \n     ancient connection to the land that has sustained Inupiaq for \n     thousands of years. A sense of personal pride and fulfillment \n     is gained from providing food from the land for family and \n     sharing with others in accordance with age-old tradition.\n       With the increasing threat of offshore development, which a \n     majority of Inupiaq whalers across the Slope oppose. Many are \n     beginning to realize that opening of the Arctic Refuge will \n     set a precedent to offshore development. The drilling \n     proponents have said as recently as February 22 that the \n     network of industrial base camps in the Arctic Refuge will \n     provide the jumping off point to develop a ring of oil rigs \n     just north of the Refuge off shore in the Beaufort Sea. In \n     fact Governor Murkowski mentioned there is a good possibility \n     that offshore will develop in the future but mentions the \n     interest off the oil companies is to wait for the \n     determination of ANWR by Congress. Offshore leases have been \n     offered in the past by the State of Alaska, in which no oil \n     companies bid. It is more profitable & less hazardous to have \n     the ground to lay the infrastructure down permanently then go \n     offshore from there. The Inupiaq people have had so much of \n     their traditional lands & subsistence lifestyle divested; now \n     even the whaling culture is at stake.\n       A petition being circulated has nearly half of the voting \n     adults in Kaktovik opposing opening the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge to oil development. In fact we are still \n     collecting signatures & we are only short a few signatures to \n     make more than half of Kaktovik's voting adults that oppose \n     oil development. We haven't seen other Kaktovik residents \n     that are away from the village at this point. Many across the \n     Slope are beginning to feel the land of ANWR is essential to \n     the longevity of our subsistence livelihood & our traditional \n     ways. For oil development will directly affect all those \n     across the Slope, not only the residents of Kaktovik, but \n     others as well. For the precedent it will set for offshore \n     development. The message in the past has been that the \n     Inupiaq want ANWR opened for oil development, which has been \n     spoken mainly by the ``for profit corporations'' which are \n     paid interests of Arctic power. The Regional Corporation have \n     signed exploration and option agreements with oil companies, \n     and these regional corporations have begun to appear to be \n     politically aligned with their oil corporate partners. And \n     often has been the voice in Arctic for oil development.\n       A protest was held against Arctic Power paid group (Gail \n     Norton, Lisa Murkowski & other senators) on their visit to \n     Kaktovik on March 6th. But we did not get much media coverage \n     opposing ANWR development despite the fact that the media had \n     accompanied the Senators. For another thing the coverage they \n     let out is very misleading & let's not forget these reporters \n     came up to Alaska with Arctic Power. Sean Hannity presented a \n     series of misleading claims to advance the Bush \n     administration's efforts to permit oil drilling in Alaska's \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n       The caribou herd is not our main concern, we know it is \n     thriving. It's the land that will be overcome by oil rigs & \n     restricting our subsistence lifestyle & the impacts of our \n     social structure that we Inupiaq are worried about. And the \n     impacts in the Arctic ecosystem as a result of the worsening \n     global warming problem, as more fossil fuels are burned are a \n     concern for us. As well as the health concerns of the future \n     as pollution gets worse. We don't even care the amount of oil \n     if there is any. We don't want any more of the oil industries \n     impacts inflicted upon us as a whole. Especially for our \n     future generation. The public didn't get much notice about \n     Arctic Power & the Senators visit to Kaktovik to begin with. \n     And due to the fact that they came early on a Sunday morning, \n     not many residents attended the meeting. Yet on their visit \n     to Barrow Alaska, they did not even meet with the public. \n     They only met with the for profit corporation entities that \n     support oil development such as the ASRC representatives.--\n     Mary Margaret Brower, Kaktovik, Alaska.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                Petition\n\n       The following residents of Kaktovik, are opposed to oil \n     development in the 1002 area of the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge: (SIGNED BY 50 PEOPLE).\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Let me come to the process. While I am on the Bible, I \nwas taught as a kid those famous words:\n\n       Justice, justice shalt thou seek.\n\n  Why the double mention of justice? Because, I was told, you have to \npursue what you believe is justice in a just way.\n  We have different ideas of what justice is, what a good result is \nhere. But I want to speak to the method, and that is to do this as part \nof a budget resolution, which clearly is an end run around the existing \nrules, an end run around the healthy fair fight we have been having for \na lot of years about whether oil drilling should be allowed in the \nArctic Refuge and the 60-vote requirement that has stopped that from \nhappening.\n  That is why the filibuster is there. People talk about the ``nuclear \noption'' with regard to judicial nominations. We have been looking over \nin this direction. The nuclear weapons have been fired from over here. \nThis is the nuclear option. It sets a precedent. It allows anything \nthat generates revenues, whether incidental or at the heart of the \npurpose, to be attached to the budget resolution and only require 51 \nvotes.\n  Just listen to the advocates, my dear colleagues and respected \nfriends, proponents of the drilling in the Arctic Refuge. They are not \ntalking about generation of revenue as its main purpose. They are \ntalking about the provision of oil, provision of jobs, energy \nindependence. We can debate that. But the revenues obtained here are \nincidental, and our rules make clear that when that is so, this kind of \nprovision should not be on this budget resolution.\n  It does set a precedent, where anything else, where the generation of \nrevenues is merely incidental, whether on environmental matters or \nanything else, and something that has not been able to obtain the \nsupermajority 60 will be able to be adopted by 51, when put on a budget \nresolution.\n  Incidentally, one effect of this budget process in Congress is the \nbudget process has broken down. We do not pass a budget resolution \nanymore. If we start putting what I believe respectfully are extraneous \namendments, substantive battles on to the budget resolution, it is \ngoing to be harder and harder to follow the orderly budget process that \nthe law and our rules provide.\n\n[[Page S2785]]\n\n  So for reasons of substance and reasons of procedure, I ask my \ncolleagues to support the Cantwell amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to my colleague from \nIdaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Alaska for \nthose few moments to speak to what I believe and many of us believe to \nbe a phenomenally important issue for the Senate to be addressing. Let \nme try to set the record straight.\n  I believe it is now the noon hour, in the middle of the day. The Sun \nis up. The lights are on in this Chamber of the Senate. We are in the \nmiddle of a workweek. And somebody says this is not the place or the \ntime to debate this issue? It is not midnight. It is not in a smoke-\nfilled room. The lights are not turned down. C-SPAN is on and the \nAmerican public is watching and you darned well bet this is the right \nplace and the right time to debate a critical issue for the American \npeople. So don't suffer the illusion or play the rhetorical game that \nsays, ``ain't never happened before.''\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee has just submitted a long list \nof times when the other side used the budget resolution to produce \nmajor public policy. So it is the right time, the right place, the \nmiddle of the workweek; and we are doing the job of the American \npeople, to debate this very critical and important issue.\n  I am always amazed when someone takes the coastal plain of Alaska, \nwhere today it might be 60 below and the wind may be 40 miles an hour, \nand calls it an Eden. That is not my vision of Eden. I am not \nsuggesting it is not a rare place--it is. It is unique to the world, \nand we recognize that, and all of the environmental safeguards are in \nplace. If we are allowed to go there and find oil and bring it to the \nlower 48, there will not be any damage to the environment. That is a \nfact for anybody who has been there.\n  Let us adjust the vision of Eden just a little bit. I don't think we \nare allowed to interpret it every way every day.\n  My last thought is quite simply somebody said--I believe the Senator \nfrom Washington just said--it will not bring down the price of oil. It \nprobably will not. What it might do is stop the price of oil from going \nup. I just paid $2.11 a gallon for regular gas in the District of \nColumbia. I drive a very efficient small car. It still costs me $25 to \nfuel it. I have the good fortune of having a pretty-good-paying job, \nbut there are a lot of Americans who do not. Just keeping the price of \noil down, not letting it go up, would be a major victory for energy \npolicy in this country. And it would fill the refinery at Anacordis \nthat is now operating at 50-percent capacity. It would provide the jobs \nin the State of Washington that the Senator from Alaska spoke to. That \nis the reality of what we are talking about today--getting our country \nback into the business of producing energy for every American, whether \nthey have high-paying or low-paying jobs. We live on our energy and it \nis time we put our country back into full production. I strongly \nsupport the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 19 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask the Chair to let me know when I have used 9 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator will be notified.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is important that we do attempt to \nset the record straight. It is interesting to listen to the back and \nforth that goes on across the aisle. If Alaska were not my home, if I \nwere not born and raised there, if I had not had an opportunity to know \nand understand all parts of my incredibly beautiful and diverse State, \nI would think that they were talking about another place, another world \nthat I was not familiar with. So I feel compelled as an Alaskan to \nstand before you and talk about the reality of ANWR, the reality of the \nworld that exists up North.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts made a statement. I apologize if it is \nnot exactly as he stated it, but the inference was that wilderness \ncan't exist with industry, and that is why we should not move forward \nwith opening ANWR to exploration.\n  The area we are talking about exploring is not in a protected \nwilderness area. It is in an area that has been designated \n``reserved,'' if you will, because of its vast potential oil and gas \nreserves. It has been recognized by the Congress, by the executive \nbranch, for its potential. It is not in wilderness status. It is not in \nwilderness status like the 8 million acres directly below the 1002 \ncoastal area. It is not in wilderness status like some 58 million acres \nof wilderness that are currently in the State of Alaska. The 1002 area \nis not wilderness.\n  Therefore, don't mix it in up. Don't make that suggestion.\n  Others have said we are talking about exploring and drilling in a \nwildlife refuge. As my colleague from Alaska mentioned to the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin, in his State of Wisconsin there are pipelines going \nthrough three separate wildlife refuges. There are currently nearly 400 \nproducing wells in the national wildlife refuges nationwide.\n  The National Audubon Society has received $25 million in royalties \nfrom oil development in its sanctuary in Louisiana. It has been \nreceiving this money for decades.\n  There is nothing unusual nor improper about allowing careful \ndevelopment in a refuge.\n  We are using 21st century technology. I haven't seen this wildlife \nrefuge which the National Audubon Society has in Louisiana, but I am \ncertain they are making sure, if they are developing it, that they are \ndoing it in concert, in balance with the environment. That is exactly \nwhat we will be doing if we are given permission to go forward in ANWR. \nHow can I tell you we will do that? Because we have been doing it up \nNorth for 30 years. We have been refining the technology, the Arctic \nengineering and technology that goes with extraction of a resource in a \npretty harsh environment. Yet, as harsh as it is in the wintertime, it \nis a very fragile environment during those summer months. Alaskans \nappreciate our climate and our geography. We figured that we have to do \nit right or we could cause harm to the environment.\n  When we talk about the roadless areas we have available for \nexploration, we mean it. We do mean that we are going to put down an \nice road that will disappear when the summer comes. In fact, we are so \nrigid on it, we don't even lay the ice road for the following year in \nthe same area just so there is no impact to that tundra, no impact to \nthat area.\n  I take great offense to the preliminary implication that some of my \ncolleagues have made that, somehow or other, the North Slope is some \nindustrial wasteland. They made the comment that the air and the skies \nwere like the pollution in Washington, DC. Let me tell you, as an \nAlaskan, I am outright offended at that kind of a comment.\n  You come up North, you look at the air, and you breathe the air, if \nit is not too cold. The fact is, we have put environmental safeguards \nand standards on our industry unlike any other place in the world. I \nhave seen what we have done in the lower 48. Quite honestly, I can \nunderstand why some of my colleagues are concerned about industry in \nAlaska, because they have seen it in their States. They have seen what \nthey can do. But we have said no. We have learned from your mistakes. \nWe are going to make sure that when you have a vehicle, you put a \ndiaper under that vehicle. It sounds crazy, but we are not going to \naccept any kinds of spills. We are not going to accept any kind of \nenvironmental degradation. We have controls over it. We are going to \nmake sure we do it right.\n  When they talk about the spills--I mentioned yesterday on the floor \nthat we have spills. We require in the State of Alaska that everything \nyou drop on the ground is reported. Do you know what is mostly \nreported? It is the seawater, the saltwater that is used to inject. \nWhether it is a spill of saltwater, whether it is a spill of chemicals, \nor a gallon of oil, hydraulic oils, you have to report it. You report \nit, and you clean it up.\n\n[[Page S2786]]\n\n  When I took these colleagues North with me 2 weeks ago, they were \namazed at the environmental culture within the industry. It is not \nnecessarily because the industry has said we should do it; it is \nbecause we in Alaska care, and we are going to make sure you are going \nto do it right. If you are not going to do it right in our State, you \nare not welcome to do business. It is more expensive to do business in \nAlaska because we are a long way away, which sometimes makes it \ndifficult. Part of it is we demand that you do it better.\n  Where does that put us? We are a nation reliant on oil. We are 58 \npercent reliant on foreign sources of oil. Oil just hit 56 bucks a \nbarrel, and we are 58 percent reliant on foreign sources.\n  We have an opportunity to make a difference in this country.\n  I have had some of the opposition suggest there is not really that \nmuch there. Let us take the median. Let us just assume for purposes of \ndiscussion here today that we are able to get a million barrels of oil \na day. At the height of the Prudhoe fields, we were at 2 million \nbarrels a day through our pipeline. We were providing 20 percent of \nAmerica's domestic needs.\n  What is a million barrels? Aside from the fact that you get a million \nbarrels 365 days a year, what is it? It is enough fuel to run the State \nof Maryland for 100 years. It can fuel every car in every home in \nWashington State for 68 years. It is enough fuel to replace all of our \nimports from Saudi Arabia for 25 years--25 years. It is enough fuel to \ndouble all of the oil taken out of Texas for the past 75 years. It is \nenough oil to save America from writing a $54 million check to OPEC \nevery day at the current prices. Fifty-four million dollars is what we \nare writing to OPEC today. Actually, I think that number goes up \nbecause the price of oil has now bumped up to $56 a barrel.\n  The fact is, it is not just about increased domestic production. We \nneed to have balanced our energy policy. We know we can't drill our way \nout of it. We know we can't conserve our way out of it. We know we have \nto work on balance, promote conservation, efficiency, developing \nalternatives, but it has to also include more domestic production to \nreduce our dependency on OPEC and other unstable regimes.\n  We have to do more.\n  I used the phrase yesterday: We have to think globally and act \nlocally. Let us not export our issues overseas. Let us not be reliant \non Russia, Columbia, Africa, or Venezuela. We need to recognize, \nthough, if we park every single car in America today and say that is \nit, we are going to take a step, we are not going to be so reliant on \noil, the fact is we would still need oil, whether it is for Band-Aids, \nCDs, or heart replacement valves. We use oil every day in our world. We \nneed to do what we can at the domestic level to meet our energy needs \nto the fullest extent possible. ANWR offers us that opportunity.\n  Please give us in Alaska the chance to show you how we will continue \nto do it right for years to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls 8 minutes.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I yield the remainder of the time to the Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time is on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The other side has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  (Ms. MURKOWSKI assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, let me say to Senator Stevens that it \nhas been a pleasure working with him on this issue.\n  Some people have asked: Why don't we listen to the people of Alaska? \nIt is their livelihood. They live there. I had the pleasure of going up \nthere and talking with them. I can tell the Senate without any doubt \nthat the overwhelming majority--maybe 70 to 75 percent--of Alaskans \nwants this to be developed. I think that means, at a minimum, they have \nseen some development, they have seen the benefits of it, and they have \nassured themselves that it can be done in such a way that it will not \nharm the environment which they so much cherish and in which they live. \nThey don't want it to be destroyed.\n  Now, I want to talk about some comparables. Many ask--not that there \nis a direct relationship--why don't we do more in renewables? I want to \ntalk about what 1 million barrels of oil a day means compared to a \nrenewable source of energy such as wind production. For those that say \nwe ought to do more in renewables like wind, to make sure we do things \nin an environmentally sound way, here is the evidence. One million \nbarrels of oil a day is the equivalent to 24,000 megawatts of \npowerplant production per day. That equals 24 powerplants, which in \nturn equals 92,500 windmills. The anticipated production from ANWR \nwould be the equivalent of 5,781 square miles of windmills, the \ncombined size of the States of Rhode Island and Connecticut. And 70 \npercent of the surface of the State of Massachusetts would be covered \nwith windmills in order to equal 1 million barrels a day in electric \ngenerating capacity.\n  I want to talk about a couple of things. First, how important this \nproduction is and that we proceed with it. The United States of America \nis in a state of crisis. Some people wonder whether this is serious. \nIndeed, it is. We do not know what to do and how to get out of our need \nfor oil and oil products for American's daily lives, for our economic \nwell-being, and for our transportation needs. I don't have an answer to \nthat. We will all work hard to try to change that, but it will take \nmany decades to change.\n  Some say we ought to conserve more and they say we should conserve \ninstead of producing this oil. I can only say we need to do everything. \nWe are in such a crisis we have to conserve and we have to produce \nwhere we can, because right now the United States of America is \nabsolutely vulnerable to the fact that we import oil from a dangerous \nand fragile world.\n  What happens if oil is denied America by unfriendly foreign \ncountries? Would you believe that this big superpower called America \nwill be brought to her knees? We talk about our future security. We \nwill not be a world power if somebody decides to deny us oil. I regret \nto say we are there now--not 10 years from now, today. And it will only \nget worse.\n  Alaska, of course, is a State in our great Union. This is not a \nforeign country. It is part of the United States. And we have by far \nthe most promising site for onshore oil in the United States in this \n1.5 million acres in the State of Alaska. You can call it what you \nwant, but it says in the law that this 1002 area is open for \nexploration if Congress wants to so vote. That is what we are talking \nabout here. We are not here to destroy anything. We are here to vote on \nthe proposition that Congress originally set this 1.5 million acres \naside for--to go and look for oil. The laws says Congress will make the \ndecision. We are making the decision here today. Do we want to do that \nor not?\n  Let's talk about the United States and what a predicament we are in. \nThe American reserves of oil, the entire reserves in all of our States, \nis 21.9 billion barrels. That is terrible. We are the 11th in the world \nfor oil reserves. According to the estimate arrived at by the United \nStates Geological Survey, the area at issue contains 10 billion barrels \nof oil. The USGS did a similar estimate for Prudhoe Bay but they \nunderestimated it by 30 percent. But let's just use their numbers, \nwhich I call low: 10 billion barrels. With the oil estimated from ANWR, \nAmerica's total reserves would be over 30 billion barrels of oil. That \nmeans this particular part of America contains one-third of the total \nreserves of oil of the United States of America.\n  Imagine saying we don't need it. Opponents want us to do something \nelse instead.\n  Senator Everett Dirksen used to say about dollars, a billion dollars \nhere and a billion dollars there and pretty soon it adds up. I can say \nto Senators and those listening, as far as America's energy future, a \nmillion barrels here and a million barrels there really adds up. And \npretty soon it is terribly important to America's future. That is the \nfirst point.\n\n[[Page S2787]]\n\n  No one knows how to get off this dependence. We have to find ways to \nminimize the damage while we conserve, change our ways and go to \nhydrogen cars, but none of that will happen for a long time.\n  In the meantime, we send all our money overseas, to foreign \ncountries. The distinguished junior Senator from Alaska was talking \nabout how many dollars a day we send out. On a yearly basis this 1 \nmillion barrels adds $18.6 billion to the merchandise trade deficit; \nthat is, the trade deficit between us and the world. What we pay for \nforeign oil is almost 26 percent of the trade deficit. But it is not \nimportant, say some, that we increase our reserves by 10 billion \nbarrels, which is adding one-third to our reserves for the future.\n  My second point has to do with the fact that some say this is not the \nright way to do it, that we should not be using a budget resolution. I \nsaid last night it happens to be that this Senator knows a little bit \nabout budget resolutions. I know a little bit about reconciliation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for 1 minute off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And I want to make sure our Senator, the senior \nSenator, speaks in wrap-up.\n  I close by saying there is no doubt in my mind that America must do \nsomething. This is an opportunity to do something very significant. We \nare not going to damage anything.\n  This is a picture of a production well. All of that is done off of \nice roads. When we are finished, we take it away and you see the little \nspeck is what remains, the end product of an exploratory well. You can \ngo there and prove up the reserves and leave that speck in a 1.5-\nmillion-acre piece of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for 2 minutes off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. For the information of Senator Kerry, British Petroleum \nis currently investing over $500 million annually in Alaska and is \ndrilling now over 100 new wells.\n  I hope my colleagues consider this amendment. What I really want to \nask, finally, is to vote no. I have been fighting now for 24 years to \nget Congress to keep its word. In a fight such as this, the Senator \nreally learns and realizes who his true friends are. I know those who \nvote against this amendment are doing so because it is the right thing \nto do for the country. But I count you among those of us from the World \nWar II generation who understood that oil is ammunition and understand \nwhat it means to keep a promise. And I shall not forget it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes remaining. The Republican \nside has no time remaining.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. As we close debate on the Cantwell amendment, which I \nhope my colleagues will support, I feel we have had a hearty discussion \nthis morning about what America should do as it relates to the Arctic \nWildlife Refuge but, more importantly, what we should also do about \nplanning for America's future.\n  I point out that today a Gallup poll was released that shows where \nthe American people are. We may be very divided in the Senate, but the \nAmerican public is consistent in its concern about and interest in \nconservation. In fact, Americans by a 2-to-1 margin say the United \nStates should emphasize greater consumer conservation over existing \nenergy supplies, rather than production of oil, gas, coal, or other \nsupplies.\n  Now, that is what the American public wants. That is certainly what \npeople in the State of Washington want. That is certainly what the \npeople in Puget Sound want. I say that because I think they are like \nmany Americans in that they want to reduce CO2 emissions. \nThey want to do something about global warming. They want to do \nsomething about diversifying our nation's energy supply. We have great \ncompanies in my state that are adding to the Washington economy, and \nthey want to diversify into various energy technologies that will help \nus in the future.\n  So, no, the majority of Washingtonians do not want to see drilling in \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. They want to see it protected. In \nfact, it is the one thing I think they feel most strongly about; that \nis, they want to lead the way on a new energy economy and show that we \ncan have higher CAFE standards, produce alternative fuels, make a dent \nin our gasoline use by blending it with ethanol, and get energy \nconservation plans moving.\n  But when it comes to gasoline prices, I think they are like every \nother American, they are darn concerned about the high gasoline prices \nin America and wonder why they are so high when four refineries are \nlocated in the State of Washington. And for a market that was \nmanipulated on electricity prices, and with very little help from the \nother side of the aisle in getting those market manipulation contracts \nvoided, the Puget Sound economy remains concerned about why the price \nof gasoline, which is a commodity that is refined so close to home, is \nthe highest price in the country.\n  Now, there is nothing in the budget resolution language that says \nthat oil produced in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge will stay in \nthe United States. That is right, no guarantee at all. The oil will be \nexported to other countries. So as the President's economist has said, \nit will have negligible impact on the price of gasoline. To open up a \nwildlife refuge for a minimal amount of oil, that even the President's \neconomist says will have a negligible effect on price and supply, is an \nill-advised plan.\n  My colleagues have already talked about the pollution and the \nenvironmental problems caused by drilling. But I want to point out, \nAmerica does have a different future. I will work with my colleagues \nfrom Alaska on a proposal that is three times the job creation for us \nand for Alaska--the Alaska natural gas pipeline.\n  America was smart enough, in the 1970s, to get off our dependence on \nhome heating oil because we decided as a country we could not continue \nto be held hostage by Middle East oil policy. We had a 35-percent \nreduction in home heating oil use. It is time to do the same with \ngasoline, but not by producing more oil, but by changing and focusing \non developing alternatives.\n  We can focus on building a pipeline to capture Alaska's natural gas; \nit is the equivalent of 6 billion barrels of oil. We can focus on \nefficiency and renewables. We can focus on ethanol. We can focus on \nimprovements in efficiency of transportation, of tires, and increasing \nthe fuel efficiency of our cars, which some of the speakers on the \nother side, I should note, do not support a higher automobile fuel \nefficiency standard. That would be a great way, by reducing the need \nfor 10 billion barrels of oil over the next 10 years, of saving and \ngetting us off of our overdependence.\n  A young woman who came in to see us yesterday presented us with a \ntire gauge, and she showed us that if Americans had the right level of \ninflation in their car's tires it could save over 200,000 barrels of \noil a day.\n  So we have a choice. We have a choice about whether we are going to \ncontinue down this road of a fossil-fuel economy to the degree that we \nare going to say it is even worth it, it is even worth it to go into a \nwildlife refuge to find oil, or we are going to move our country \nforward on a new energy plan.\n\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the Cantwell amendment and \nstrike this language from the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSnowe be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendments Nos. 171 and 149\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 35 minutes of debate on the\n\n[[Page S2788]]\n\nveterans amendments No. 171 by Senator Ensign and No. 149 by Senator \nAkaka.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 10 minutes of \ntime to make this statement about my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, the budget resolution fails veterans. It \nis that simple. I am pleased to stand with my colleagues who joined me \nin offering this veterans health care amendment to add $2.85 billion \nfor VA health care.\n  Let me say that I agree with the President on the overall amount \nneeded for VA health care. But we differ in where to get the funding. \nAnd I must say, I enjoy working with my friend, the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Craig, and we both feel this committee needs more \nfunding than it has. We are offering different amendments to try to \nreach that funding.\n  The President asks veterans to shoulder the burden with a higher \ncopay for medications and a new user fee for middle-income veterans. I \ndisagree. I am pleased that the Budget Committee summary rejected the \nPresident's proposals. As my colleagues pointed out last night, \nunfortunately, funds have not yet been included to compensate.\n  How did we arrive at this amount of $2.8 billion? The answer is that \nit comes directly from the administration's own estimates. VA needs \n$1.4 billion just to cover inflation. The level in the budget \nresolution before us does not even come close to covering that amount.\n  And VA requires funding to absorb new patient workload. The budget \nresolution before us doesn't contain funding for this.\n  We also need to reverse the President's decision to cutoff enrollment \nto middle-income veterans. To date, 200,000 veterans have been turned \naway--10 percent of whom live in Nevada, Louisiana, and Texas.\n  Our amendment provides the money to make the system truly accessible. \nIt is just wrong to differentiate between veterans entitled to care. It \nis dangerous to say that some veterans deserve more than other \nveterans. This sends the message that serving during peacetime is not \nas important as going to war, or being drafted to serve is not as noble \nas volunteering to serve. Everyone who has served in our Armed Forces \nhas contributed to our national security and to protecting the \nprinciples on which our Nation is founded. Needless to say, the budget \nresolution before us does not maintain open access for all veterans.\n  The other side of the aisle has offered an amendment, as well. In \ndoing so, we at least are hearing for the first time an acknowledgment \nthat the President's budget and the budget resolution before us do not \ngo far enough. Unfortunately, neither do the amendments that are being \noffered.\n  The amendment on the other side adds $410 million for VA care. This \nis simply not enough to avoid the drug copay increase and the user fee \nfor middle-income veterans. And it is not enough to avoid the \nPresident's cuts to nursing home beds. And the Ensign amendment will \nnot help the 21,000 veterans who were turned away for care in Nevada, \nLouisiana, and Texas. All told, the Ensign amendment is nearly $2.5 \nbillion short of what is needed.\n  The amendment on the other side can be considered a gesture. And \nsince the Ensign amendment takes the money from global health accounts, \nit is a gesture that will likely hurt worldwide AIDS programs and other \nhumanitarian assistance.\n  The President saw the value in this global health account and chose \nto increase spending for it. The Ensign amendment cuts funding for this \naccount. Instead my amendment closes corporate tax loopholes rather \nthan cutting funding for needed programs.\n  I would also like to say a word about the record when it comes to \nveterans funding. The Bush administration and my colleagues in the \nmajority have stated that veterans funding has increased 47 percent \nduring this President's tenure.\n  While funding has increased, it has been based on the efforts by \nCongress in supporting amendments such as the one I am offering. The \nsimple fact is that the administration has requested less than half of \nthe new funding made available to veterans during its tenure. Congress, \nby approving amendments to increase VA funding, has added another 39 \npercent of funding. Even with a 47 percent increase since FY 2001, this \nis an average annual increase of less than 10 percent to accommodate \nhigh medical care inflation and high annual growth in patients. It is a \nfact that per patient resources have increased by about 13 percent \nwhile the number of patients has increased by 25 percent since FY 2001. \nThat means that the growth in the number of patients is almost twice \nthe amount of growth in resources. These facts underscore the need to \nsupport my amendment.\n  We have an opportunity to fund the veterans health care system--to \nprotect veterans from waiting times for appointments, from harsh new \nfees, and from cuts in long-term care. Let us go more than half-way to \nmeet veterans' needs. Let us do the right thing. I ask all of my \ncolleagues to join me in voting to provide the funds necessary to care \nfor our veterans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Chair notify me when I have consumed 10 minutes \nof time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I will.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, we are on the floor today debating a very \nimportant portion of the budget resolution for the Senate. That is the \nmoneys that will fund the Veterans' Administration and serve the \nmillions of America's veterans who are in need of this service and new \nveterans coming in out of the Iraq/Afghanistan wars.\n  All of us who serve on that committee and examine the needs of our \nveterans recognize the importance of new dollars and the importance of \nsustaining what we have been able to do effectively over the last 4 or \n5 years, to tremendously increase the quality of health care coming \nfrom the Veterans' Administration and increase enrollment.\n  The question is, when you look at the Murray amendment versus the \nEnsign amendment, how much is enough? How much is enough to sustain the \nwork and the quality of work that goes on and to accept the incoming \nveterans who are truly needy of and deserving of the services provided \nby the Veterans' Administration?\n  Let me show a couple of charts that are fundamentally important and \nthat many fail to recognize. Because the Senator from Hawaii is \nabsolutely right: In 4 years we have increased spending in the \nVeterans' Administration by 43 percent. During that time enrollment has \ngone up from 4.9 million to about 7.7 million from October 1, 2000. And \nthe quality of health care has gone right along up. Now the veterans \nhealth care facilities are rated as some of the finest in the Nation, \nranking with the quality delivered from some of the top private health \ncare facilities.\n  Here are the numbers: Medical care, 2001, $21.07 billion; 2005, \n$29.64 billion, a phenomenal increase, not millions, not hundreds of \nmillions, but billions of dollars that the American taxpayer has \ncommitted to the quality care of veterans.\n  Let's look at the other portion of the veterans budget called \ndiscretionary spending. We have not been absent from that either. \nDuring the Bush years, 2001-2005, $25.7 billion up to $37.1 billion, \nagain, billions of dollars. What was happening during the Clinton \nyears? In two of those years, 1998 and 1999, the Clinton administration \nsaid: Let's cut veterans. Congress said no. Bush said no. We said no. \nWe plused up what our President offered us. This President's budget is \nan increase. But we don't like the level of increase or how he has \narrived at the increase. So we are changing those numbers \nsubstantially.\n  But the bottom line still remains, how much is enough to sustain this \nquality, to assure the door remains open, to assure that our veterans \nare served effectively? Do we throw money at it or, in a tight budget \nenvironment, do we constrain ourselves a little bit? Do we shape the \nissues? And in so doing, do we sustain levels of increase?\n  Here is what has happened in the last 4 years. Those are the \nnumbers--a 43-percent increase. Probably no other area of the Federal \nGovernment has gone up that much outside of defense,\n\n[[Page S2789]]\n\nand it hasn't, to my knowledge, gone up that much. But it does show a \nclear recognition on the part of Congress as to the importance of \nveterans to all of us.\n  If I may, for a few moments, I will break down the reality of what we \nare doing because we recognize, as certainly the Senators from Hawaii \nand Washington, that there are needs out there and that those needs \nmust be met. We recognized in the President's budget that there were \nitems we simply would not advance--copays, a nonstarter. I was willing \nto look at fees for sevens and eights in certain categories with higher \nincomes. But collectively Congress says, at least on this side of the \nRotunda, no to that also. I accept that.\n\n  Here is what I recognize and here is what the Ensign amendment does. \nThe President pluses up the budget by $751 million. The chairman's mark \npluses it up again by $40 million. The Ensign-Craig-Vitter-Hutchison \namendment pluses it up another $410 million, a net increase without \nreconciliation instructions. And that is very important. While that may \nbe inside language for those of us who work the budget, it is very \nimportant to know that those are real dollars hitting the ground, not \ncompromised, new money to the Veterans' Administration. Total it all \nup, between the President, the chairman's mark, and the Ensign \namendment, and you have $1.201 billion, a 3.7-percent increase in a \ntight budget year.\n  I must say, this is one chairman of what I believe is an important \ncommittee who says that is responsible. That is the right thing to do. \nAnd we don't raise taxes to do it. We go inside Government spending and \nfind the resources. And we have offset them appropriately in an account \nthat last year increased 12 percent.\n  The irony is in the fact that in attempting to undo the President's \nproposal to charge additional fees on higher income vets, the Murray \namendment charges another type of fee on veterans--and all Americans, \nfor that matter--in the form of higher taxes. The Ensign-Craig \namendment goes elsewhere inside current levels of spending. It does not \ndo that. Yes, veterans do pay taxes. They are out there, hard-working \nAmericans like nearly everyone else. And if you raise taxes, you raise \nit on them, too. I don't dispute the worthiness of the argument. I do \ndispute the resources involved and whether they are actually necessary \nin a very tight budget year when we are struggling to keep this economy \nalive, rewarding that economy that more money stays out there in it \nthat stimulates job growth. And it has and it has proven that it is \nworking because those numbers keep coming up in America as more \nAmericans go back to work.\n  We ought not penalize that sector of our economy while we are truly \ntrying to help a sector of our economy that is less fortunate and, most \nimportantly, that has served this country well.\n  The men and women in uniform of our services, who stood in harm's \nway, we recognize their service but we also recognize there are limits \nwithin the budget. In those limits, we will have to say there are \ncertain things we will do and certain things we cannot do. That is the \nchoice, and it is a tough choice that we as Senators are asked to make \nwhen we shape budgets. But it is a necessary and a responsible choice. \nSo we have said no to the enrollment fees, no to the copays.\n  We have also said no to something else very near and dear to the \nheart of the Senator from Washington, the Senator from Hawaii, and me, \nand that is State homes. Those beds, 20,000 across the Nation, with 285 \nin my State, are a cooperative relationship between the State and \nFederal Government in assuring that the truly needy of our veterans \nhave a place to go--in their final years, in many instances. The \nadministration had asked to drop that per diem. We said no to that and \nensured the stability and the strength of those homes, at a time when \nStates' budgets are tight--certainly in many instances tighter than \nours. So I believe that was the right and responsible thing to do.\n  Last week, we heard extensively from all of the service \norganizations. What were their greatest frustrations? The fees, copays, \nand the homes. What have we done? We have taken all three of those \nmajor frustrations away because we listened to the service \norganizations. We heard them during that series of bicameral hearings, \nheld both in the House and Senate.\n  Let me go back to my original statement. The question remains, \nwhether you are looking at the amendment of the Senator from Washington \nor the amendment of the Senator from Nevada, how much is enough? Is a \n1.201 plus-up, with no reconciliation instructions, enough? Does it \nsustain this quality of health care? Yes, it does. Or do we go further \nby asking the American people to pay higher taxes for more money that \nis questionably necessary? We could throw a lot more money at the \nVeterans' Administration, and we might get greater results. But we \nwould be going beyond what I think is necessary and appropriate today, \nand I think most of my colleagues agree with me.\n  So we sustain the work we have done. I ask my colleagues in the \nSenate to support the Ensign amendment, support the work of the \ncommittee, sustain the vibrancy of the veterans health care system, and \nto vote down the Murray amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an issue on which I hope \nwe can find common ground. Today, we have thousands of brave men and \nwomen risking their lives for us halfway around the world. At home, we \nhave millions more who were equally courageous in defending our freedom \nduring generations past. When it comes to honoring these soldiers and \nthese veterans, there is never any shortage of words and praise from \nleaders of both parties, and there should not be.\n  I commend the previous speaker, the outstanding Senator from Idaho, \nwho is also chairman of the Veterans Committee, for his deep concern \nand regard for our veterans. But I have to contest some of the \nstatements that were made because, unfortunately, based on our \nanalysis, this budget has a very real and unacceptable shortage of \nfunding for the benefits and health care that our heroes have earned.\n\n  Make no mistake, these are not just complaints coming from \nWashington; these are complaints we are hearing from veterans all \nacross the country--in Illinois, Washington, Hawaii, and Idaho.\n  Senator Ensign's amendment increases the veterans health care budget \nby $410 million. That is a modest improvement and to be commended, \ncompared to the original budget offered by the President. Yet, these \ndollars, I should point out, come directly out of important \ninternational programs that fund child health care, global AIDS \nassistance, disaster, famine assistance, and more. We can have a \nfurther discussion as to whether it is wise for us to rob Peter to pay \nPaul. But even if we go ahead and take this money from these vital \nprograms and place it into veterans, it is still $2.5 billion short of \nsufficiently funding veterans health care services.\n  That is why I am joining my colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, ranking member Akaka and Senator Murray, to support an \namendment to increase funding for veterans health care by $2.85 \nbillion.\n  Today, the state of care for America's veterans is not worthy of \ntheir service to this country. There are roughly 480,000 compensation \nand pension claims still unprocessed. This budget provides for 113 new \nemployees to help deal with this backlog.\n  There are thousands of veterans who cannot afford to get the health \ncare they need, and I am glad to see the Ensign amendment eliminates \nthe copayments. But the budget in front of us still tells veterans who \nmake as little as $30,000 a year they are too wealthy to enroll in the \nVA health care system.\n  There are VA hospitals on the brink of closing down around the \ncountry. But this budget cuts $351 million in funding for veterans \nnursing homes and eliminates more than $100 million in State grants \nthat are desperately needed by VA facilities. When the troops who are \nfighting bravely in Iraq and Afghanistan return home as veterans, what \nkind of care will they find? Already we know that soldiers are coming \nhome with post traumatic stress disorder, with traumatic brain injury \nthat could lead to epilepsy, and with conditions that may result in \nover\n\n[[Page S2790]]\n\n100,000 soldiers requiring mental health treatment when they come home. \nIf we cannot care for the veterans who are already here, how will we \ntake care of the veterans who will be returning in a few years?\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in sending veterans the right \nmessage. Our amendment will provide funds for VA staff so veterans who \nare waiting to file disability claims are not waiting months to have \ntheir case heard. It will provide adequate funding so that veterans of \nall incomes can access the VA system, as was promised.\n  When it comes to America's veterans, it is not only our patriotic \nduty to care, it is also our moral duty. When our troops return from \nbattle, we should welcome them with the promise of opportunity, not the \nthreat of poverty.\n  Senator Ensign's amendment is a modest improvement over the \nPresident's original budget. But as Senator Akaka has already stated, \nit still leaves the veterans short. It is time to reassess our \npriorities. A budget is more than a series of numbers on a page; it is \nthe embodiment of our values. The President and everyone in this \nChamber never hesitate to praise the service of our veterans and \nacknowledge the debt we owe them for their service, and I commend my \ncolleagues and the President for that. But this budget does not reflect \nthat praise or repay that debt. Neither does the budget resolution on \nthe floor today.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask what time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 7 minutes. The minority has \n4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues from Hawaii and \nIllinois for standing up for veterans in this country and for their \npassion for their States and the people they represent.\n  We are here this afternoon because veterans throughout our country \nare waiting for the health care they have been promised, and it is our \nresponsibility to make sure it is delivered. They are facing \nunderstaffed and overcrowded VA hospitals. They are dealing with \npaperwork and redtape, and they are not getting the service we promised \nthem when we sent them to fight for all of us.\n  Every day the system is getting more and more crowded and the waiting \nlists are growing longer, and this body has to do something about it. I \nhave heard several claims from the other side, and I want to take a few \nminutes to refute a few of them.\n  They claim we are going to be raising taxes. I remind you there will \nbe $65 billion in this budget for tax cuts when our amendment passes. I \nbelieve we have a responsibility in this country to make sure we keep \nthe promise to our veterans, and that is why I believe our amendment is \nresponsible in its funding mechanisms.\n  Second, we have heard our opponents say that veterans funding has \ngone up by 43 percent, so veterans do not need another dime. I remind \nmy colleagues that the number of veterans in VA care has gone up by 88 \npercent at the same time that medical inflation has gone up 92 percent. \nInflation is rising, the cost of care is rising, and the number of \nveterans is rising. Forty-three percent is commendable, but it does not \nmeet the promise we made to our servicemen when we sent them overseas \nthat we would care for them when they returned.\n  Another claim we have heard over and over again is that the VA is \nsitting on $500 million. That does not stand with this Senator. I \nbelieve the VA officials here in Washington, DC, have a responsibility \nto get those funds out to our veterans across this country. They are in \nwaiting lines. We do see clinics that are not opening or are closing. \nOur veterans need the services and the VA should not be withholding \nthat money and it should go out there.\n  We have also heard from our opponents that veterans funding has \nincreased by $900 million. That is simply not true. We had printed in \nthe Record last night the true cost, which is $80 million, far less \nthan the $900 million we have heard on this floor.\n  Let me just say I know veterans organizations across this country--\nVFW, AMVETS, Paralyzed Veterans of America, Disabled Veterans of \nAmerica, American Legion, Vietnam Veterans--many other veterans \norganizations are watching us. They know there is a difference between \nthe amendments offered on the Republican side and Democratic side. On \nthe Republican side they are offering an additional $410 million; on \nour side, $2.85 billion--the difference between serving 68,000 \nadditional veterans and 475,000 veterans; the difference between \ntelling veterans, some of them, that they will be in waiting lines or \nwill not get their service, and the ability for us to serve all of \nthem.\n  Let me end my time today on this amendment by reminding all Senators \nwhat George Washington said back in 1789. I think it holds true today \nmore than ever.\n  The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in \nany war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional as to \nhow they perceive the veterans of earlier wars were treated and \nappreciated by their country.\n  These words hold true today. Voting for our amendment on our side \nwill assure that we show these veterans that we appreciate and support \ntheir service. It will send a message to the next generation of young \nmen and women we are asking to serve that we keep the promise.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Idaho, the chairman of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, for offering his amendment. But I say the veterans \nwill know which amendment will make a difference in the lives of \nveterans across this country and I urge my colleagues to support the \nAkaka-Murray amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe Akaka amendment #149 to add desperately needed funds to this budget \nfor veterans health care. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this \namendment.\n  The spending level in this budget for veterans health care defies \nlogic. We are 2 years into a war. Yet this budget fails to provide \nadequate resources for those who have served this country so valiantly. \nAmerican servicemembers are wounded in Iraq each day. Thanks to new \nadvances in battlefield medicine, more wounded soldiers than ever \nbefore live to return home. But in a greater percentage of cases, they \ncome home with horrific wounds, both visible and invisible. The \nDepartment of Defense should be commended for keeping wounded soldiers \nin its medical system for longer periods of time and for shouldering a \ngreater share of the costs. However, the long-term costs of health care \nand rehabilitation still fall heaviest on the Veterans Administration. \nThis budget responds to those needs by underfunding the VA by almost \n$16 billion over the next 5 years. This is simply not acceptable!\n  Over the past year, unprecedented numbers of National Guard and \nReserve troops have been mobilized. When these Guard members and \nReservists come off active duty, they are entitled to 2 years of access \nto the VA health care system. In my home State of Vermont, over 1400 \nNational Guard members have been called to active duty. While I am \nincredibly proud of the White River Junction VA Hospital, which has \ndone award-winning work in their field, even they cannot be expected to \nhandle this new influx of veterans without additional funding. We owe \nit to both the veterans and the VA employees to provide them with the \nfunding and services they require. The Akaka amendment would provide an \nadditional $2.85 billion to the VA for just this mission.\n  A significant number of Iraq veterans have complex and long-term care \nissues. Improved body armor has saved many lives, but among the \nwounded, we now see a higher percentage of lost limbs and head \ninjuries. These traumatic injuries have a significant emotional \ncomponent to their care. It has been estimated that as many as one-\nthird of all returning service members have some type of mental health \nneeds. VA hospitals are working hard to ensure these needs are met \nimmediately, before they develop into more serious manifestations such \nas post traumatic stress disorder. It has become increasingly clear \nthat we need a better understanding of the emotional and mental health \naspects of both the war and traumatic injury. I believe that we must \nincrease VA research on mental health and post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, research that is critical to both\n\n[[Page S2791]]\n\nthe Department of Defense and veterans health care. The National Center \non Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is doing excellent work along these \nlines, but a great deal remains to be done. We must pass the Akaka \namendment if we hope to do better on this score.\n  The Budget Committee thankfully removed two provisions from the \nPresident's budget that have caused a great deal of concern among \nveterans. The President proposed to charge some veterans a $250 fee \njust to enroll in the VA health care system. The President also put \nforward an increase in the co-pay for prescription drugs from $7 to \n$15. I am pleased that the Budget Committee saw the error in both of \nthese provisions, and cut them out of its budget.\n  Mr. President, it is critical that we pass the Akaka amendment. This \nshould not be a partisan vote. Support for our troops is not a partisan \nmatter. Taking care of their health care needs should not be a partisan \nissue either. If we cannot come together on this fundamental issue of \nfairness, what can we agree on? For the sake of our veterans, and in \nhonor of their service, I urge all my colleagues to support the Akaka \namendment. We owe our veterans this, and more.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Akaka \namendment to increase funding for VA medical care.\n  When America is at war, there should be no greater priority than to \nsustain our brave men and women in uniform. And just as we owe a debt \nof gratitude to those brave men and women that are fighting to keep us \nsafe in Iraq and Afghanistan and the far corners of the world, we owe \nthat same debt to the veterans who served before them. We need to get \nbehind our troops and our veterans, and use this budget to support \nthem. Our veterans need to know that America is behind them, and behind \ntheir families, 100 percent.\n  As the former ranking member on the VA-HUD Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I fought to add more than $1 billion to last year's \nPresidential budget to make sure our veterans had the health care and \nbenefits that they earned. Yet as Yogi Berra would say, we have deja vu \nall over again with this year's budget resolution.\n  Once again the White House has sent us a budget that does not keep \nthe promises we made to our veterans.\n  At a time when private insurance is failing and the cost of \nprescription drugs is skyrocketing, the VA's 2006 budget request puts \nnew toll charges and means tests on our veterans. It fails to fully \ncover the costs of medical inflation, and it cuts back on services for \nvulnerable veterans. And it fails to do enough to expand care for \nveterans returning from the Middle East--especially those with special \nmental health or prosthetics needs.\n  Specifically, the budget proposes four things. First, the budget \nproposes to keep the VA closed to Priority 8 veterans. These are \nveterans who are not disabled as a result of their service, whom the VA \nconsiders to be higher income.\n  Second, the budget proposes a new $250 enrollment fee for middle-\nincome veterans in Priority Groups 7 and 8. Third, the budget proposes \nto increase prescription drug copayments from $7 to $15 for these same \nveterans. These two measures have been twice rejected by Congress, yet \nthe administration included them yet again in the 2006 budget.\n  Finally, the budget proposes to slash long-term care availability for \nveterans in Priority Groups 4 through 8 who are not ``catastrophically \ndisabled.'' What does this mean? That means that VA won't provide long-\nterm institutional care for many veterans, even some who are below the \npoverty line or have serious medical conditions that are not service-\nconnected. The VA budget shifts the cost of paying for long-term care \nto Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurance, leaving some of the most \nvulnerable veterans without a safety net.\n\n  More than 2 years ago, the VA health care system stopped accepting \nnew Priority 8 veterans. Manufacturing is fading and private health \ninsurance is failing. And many of those affected are Priority 8 \nveterans. Many corporations involved in manufacturing had defined \nbenefits plans that included health plans with guaranteed retiree \ncoverage. For these veterans, VA healthcare is their last safety net, \nuntil they turn 65 and are eligible for Medicare.\n  Many of my colleagues have heard me talk about the plight of veterans \nwho worked for the former Bethlehem Steel Corporation--in Maryland \nthere are nore than 10,000 Bethlehem Steel retirees alone. Their \nsituation sums up the needs that too many of our Nation's veterans \nface.\n  Many former Bethlehem steelworkers are Vietnam veterans. They came \nback from serving their country at war, and they continued to fight for \nAmerica's national and economic security by working in our steel mills. \nBut now, many have lost their health insurance because of Bethlehem \nSteel's bankruptcy. They are not eligible for Medicare yet. Under this \nbudget, many will be turned away from VA--the safety net they counted \non will not be there because VA will continue to shut out Priority 8 \nveterans.\n  Bethlehem Steel's veterans, and other veterans who worked in \nmanufacturing or for other businesses that don't offer health \ninsurance, fought for their country and now they will have to fend for \nthemselves on the open market for health insurance. I am deeply \nconcerned that this policy and many other potholes in VA's budget leave \nour veterans paying toll charges, standing in lines, or without any \nhealth care at all.\n  In the last 5 years, the VA-HUD subcommittee has provided large \nincreases for medical care--$1.3 billion in 2001, $1 billion in 2002, \n$2.4 billion in 2003, $3 billion in 2004, and $1.2 billion in 2005. We \ndid this to honor our commitment to our veterans, to give them the \nhealth care and benefits they have earned on the battlefield. We did it \nbecause our veterans didn't stand in waiting lines when they were \ncalled up or they volunteered to serve our country. So they shouldn't \nhave to stand in line to see a doctor, and they shouldn't have to face \ntoll charges to get the health care that is owned to them.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support our veterans in this \nbudget by supporting the Akaka amendment.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment No. 149 by \nSenators Akaka and Murray and to praise them for their years of work on \nveterans issues.\n  This is a needed amendment because the budget resolution, as written, \nwill break our promises to America's veterans.\n  The budget resolution closely tracks an administration request that \nwill do little to meet growing costs and will force the VA to continue \nto ration care.\n  I am angry that thousands of veterans are being turned away from the \nVA. This represents a fundamental breach of trust with our fighting men \nand women. Since January 2003 when the VA announced suspension of \nenrollment of new Priority 8 veterans, 192,000 veterans across the \ncountry and 2,000 Colorado veterans have sought VA care and been turned \naway. The administration's new budget hopes to kick 1.1 million more \nso-called low-priority veterans out of the system next year with \ndraconian cuts in service and increased fees.\n  The administration's budget also would kick thousands of veterans out \nof nursing homes. It would limit the VA's per diem reimbursement to \nState VA nursing homes to priority ones, twos, and threes. These \nheartless cuts could kick 80 percent of State nursing home residents \nout onto the street. Last week, I met with the administrator of a State \nnursing home in Walsenburg, CO. She told me that these cuts would force \nher to kick out 93 of her 100 residents. State administrators tell me \nthat these cuts could force the entire system to go under. These are \nour most vulnerable veterans, who often have no place else to go.\n  Another problem is waiting periods. Administrative backlogs at the VA \nhave been reduced, but there are still 321,000 veterans waiting for \ndisability and pension claims to be processed. At the VA clinic in \nGrand Junction, there is a 400-person waiting list. That is a 4 to 5-\nmonth wait. Just last week I asked Secretary Nicholson to explain to me \nwhy numerous Coloradans are waiting months to get their GI bill \nbenefits, forcing them to miss tuition deadlines. This budget agreement \nwill do little to cut these administrative backlogs.\n\n[[Page S2792]]\n\n  Senator Akaka's amendment would go a long way to restoring needed \nfunding and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this budget comes to Congress from the White \nHouse at a time when our country is fighting two wars. In Iraq and in \nAfghanistan, the young men and women of our Armed Forces are on the \nfront lines, risking life and limb in service to our country.\n  These troops follow in a proud tradition that stretches back for \ngenerations. The troops who now serve in Baghdad or Kabul may well have \nfathers who served in Saigon or the Mekong Delta. The fathers of these \nfathers may have fought at Okinawa or Normandy, and their fathers might \nwell have served in the second battle of the Marne. But no matter where \nthese troops were sent to defend our country, no matter when they \nserved our country, they have all earned the title, veteran.\n  Veterans have sacrificed for this country, but the budget proposed by \nthe Bush Administration, and the budget resolution being debated on the \nfloor of the Senate, forces more sacrifice upon our veterans. This \nbudget short-changes veterans health care by billions. This budget \nwould force many veterans to pay $250 dollar annual enrollment fees. \nThis budget would require veterans to pay more for prescription \nmedicines.\n  In fact, this budget is intended to drive so-called ``low priority \nveterans'' out of the VA health care system. The Department of Veterans \nAffairs budget documents foresee a 16 percent reduction in the number \nof ``low priority veterans'' that can receive care in VA hospitals.\n  What a shameful phrase that is: ``low priority veteran.'' There were \nno ``low priority soldiers'' during the Tet offensive. There were no \n``low priority sailors'' at the battle of Midway. There were no ``low \npriority Marines'' at the battle of Fallujah.\n  But when these same soldiers, sailors, and Marines go to the VA \nhospital to get the health care they earned through serving our country \nin times of war, the Bush Administration is trying to give some of them \nthe brush-off: ``Go somewhere else,'' this budget says to hundreds of \nthousands of veterans. ``Your health care is a low priority for the \nU.S. Government.''\n  It is no wonder that the Disabled American Veterans call the Bush \nbudget proposal ``one of the most tight-fisted, miserly budgets for \nveterans programs in recent memory.''\n  I stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our nation's leading veterans \nservice organizations, as I have always stood with them, in calling for \nCongress to correct the President's ill-considered budget proposal that \nunder funds veterans health care and raises fees for millions of so-\ncalled ``low priority veterans.''\n  During markup of the budget resolution in the Budget Committee, I \nvoted for an amendment offered by Senator Murray to increase spending \non veterans health care by $2.85 billion in the next fiscal year. This \namendment would have provided the funds necessary to reverse the \nadministration's policy on cutting access to VA health care by certain \nveterans. It is shameful that this amendment fell victim to a party \nline vote. Providing adequate funds to support our veterans should \nnever be a partisan issue.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to once again support an amendment to add \n$2.85 billion to the veterans health care budget. I commend Senator \nAkaka and Senator Murray for bringing this important amendment to the \nfloor of the Senate. I stand with the veterans of West Virginia and the \n49 other States of the Union in supporting these funds that are owed to \nthose who have served our country in times of war, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have 7 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me again thank all who participated in this debate. \nThere are differences as to how we approach providing for our veterans. \nYou see those differences embodied in part in the two amendments that \nare before us, either the Murray amendment or the Ensign amendment. I \nthink it is important, though, that we do, for the record, correct or \nat least add information to some of the statements. My colleague from \nIllinois is concerned, as we all are, about PTSD. The Ensign-Craig \namendment would provide an additional $100 million that can be devoted \nto, of course, mental illness. It is of great concern to us as our \nveterans come home from Iraq, Afghanistan, possibly whole in body but \nnot whole in mind. That is recognized both by the President, by the \nVeterans' Administration, and by all of us, and we plus up that budget \nsubstantially to do so.\n  Another area that has not been mentioned that is critically necessary \nfor rural veterans who find themselves in an emergency environment and \nneed to gain access to emergency rooms of the hospital and the \ncommunity and not a veterans facility--we have $43 million in the \nbudget to ensure that veterans who seek emergency care in nonveteran \nfacilities are treated exactly the same as they would be as if they \nwere in veterans facilities.\n  Let's do the numbers. The Senator from Washington says the \nPresident's numbers only include $80 million. That $80 million is \ngeneral revenue and the balance is in collections and that is real \nmoney and that is there all the time and that is in the budget and that \nis $751 million. You have to do all the math, all the time. That is \nwhat we are doing here to make sure the numbers are accurate.\n  So you take the $751 million in the President's request, general fund \nrevenue and collections, and you take the chairman's mark of $40 \nmillion, and you take the Craig-Enzi amendment or Enzi-Craig amendment \nof $410 million and add it up and it is a 1.201 increase, health care, \n3.7 percent increase over last year. It is not a tax increase.\n  I always find the rhetoric interesting. My colleague from Washington \nsays there are $70 billion worth of tax cuts in this proposal. They are \nnot tax cuts. If you don't enact it, it is a tax increase. Those cuts \nare already in place. This is the assurance of the continuum of those \ntax cuts. Take them out, it is a tax increase. It is a matter of \nsemantics. It is also a matter of fact. What is being offered by the \nSenator from Washington, as she pluses up the veterans budget, is \ngained by tax increases.\n  Let me put it this way: Taxes that would be asked to be paid by \nworking men and women, America's workforce, America's veterans. They \nare not paying them now. They would pay them then. My suggestion is \nthat is a tax increase.\n  Let me close with a couple of more analyses. We are mighty proud of \nwhat our President and what we have done over the last 4 years for the \nveterans of America and for the quality of health care and service \ndelivery of the Veterans' Administration. Here it is, a 43-percent \nincrease. We have gone from $48.8 billion in 2001 to $69.8 billion in \n2005, and we are now plusing that up into the $70-plus billion range, \n$71 billion. That is total spending.\n  Let's look at health care for a moment. There are substantial \nincreases there. We increased health care when veterans were asking for \nit. They went from over 4 million vets into the services in 2001 to now \nalmost 8 million vets, and we have an increase from $21 billion in 2001 \nto $29.6 billion. In doing so, America now says the veterans health \ncare service is one of the finest health care delivery services in the \ncountry.\n  The test for Senators ought to be: Do we damage it? No, we do not. Do \nwe assure those coming out of Iraq and Afghanistan with the true needs \nof the services provided have access? Yes, we do. No question about \nthat.\n  The President assured it. He approached it a different way. We assure \nit by approaching it from within the Federal budget instead of raising \ntaxes to accomplish that.\n  I believe the Enzi-Craig-Vitter-Hutchison amendment does exactly what \nmost Senators would want to ask of us in relation to the care for our \nveterans. It is a responsible approach. It is clearly a defensible \napproach. We believe that we have approached it in the right manner to \nsolve the problems and retain the consistency of quality, of \nimprovement and access to the veterans health care system.\n  I believe all time has expired.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields the remainder of his time. \nThe Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n[[Page S2793]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that prior to the \nvote which is about to occur on the amendment by Senator Byrd, there be \n1 minute on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I also ask that be applied to the next vote, which will be \non ANWR.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 158\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Amtrak amendment \nand would use the 1-minute time I believe was just allocated. Is that \nappropriate parliamentary procedure at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have a long history of being supportive of \nAmtrak. I was chairman of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee when \nwe passed the last reauthorization. I have the honor of serving there \nagain this year. I am committed to trying to find a way to get a \nreauthorization and get a reliable stream of funds for Amtrak so its \nfuture can be certain and so this does not have to depend just on \nannual appropriations.\n  We are going to get that done. This puts the cart before the horse, \nbefore we get a reauthorization. We are going to designate more money \nfor it.\n  To make matters worse, the $1.2 billion, while it is significant, \nwill just continue the drip, drip, drip of funds for Amtrak but yet not \nenough for them to do what they need to do in track improvements and \ncapital improvements.\n  I believe this is the wrong place to do this amendment.\n  Last but not least, it does it by raising unspecified taxes.\n  While I support the intent of the Senator from West Virginia and I \nsupport Amtrak and I am determined to get this job done, we shouldn't \ndo it in this way at this point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Byrd amendment to restore funding to Amtrak--a critical \nmode of transportation in Illinois.\n  I want to emphasize that there are serious inefficiencies with Amtrak \noperations. I do not support the restoration of Amtrak funding because \nI believe in a return to the status quo. I do believe, however, that \nthe elimination of all funding, as the President has proposed, and as \nthis budget resolution reflects, will lead Amtrak not to reform but to \nruin.\n  A strong national rail system is not just a convenience for \ntravelers. It also serves other important national objectives, such as \nensuring multiple travel options in the event of regional or national \nemergency, reducing our heavy dependence on foreign oil, and improving \nair quality. In recent years, Amtrak has increased the number of trains \nit operates and has achieved a record level of ridership, with more \nthan 25 million passengers using Amtrak last year.\n  In Illinois alone, more than 3 million people use one or many of the \n50 daily Illinois trains, including business leaders traveling to and \nfrom smaller cities and towns; tourists who visit Illinois attractions, \nand students who attend world-class Illinois colleges and universities.\n  Responding to calls for reform, Amtrak's leadership has streamlined \nits operating costs, engaged in ongoing discussions to evaluate current \npolicies and increase efficiency, and created a strategic plan for \nfuture improvements. The proposed cuts in Federal funds would cripple \nAmtrak beyond repair.\n  We cannot--and should not--allow that to occur. I urge my colleagues \nto support the Byrd amendment and restore Federal funding for Amtrak to \nthis year's budget.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I stand today to speak in support of \nSenator Byrd's amendment to restore funding for Amtrak. The amendment \nwould increase funding for Amtrak by $200 million over last year's \nlevel of $1.2 billion.\n  Starving Amtrak into bankruptcy may appear to be the quick and easy \nsolution to the bleak picture that some have imposed upon this \nfundamental element of America's transportation system. Nonetheless I \nremain convinced that the simplest and most effective answer lies with \nthe amendment before us. I join my esteemed colleague Senator Byrd to \ninsist that we fully fund rail travel in this country and guarantee \nAmtrak the opportunity to secure its future in the 21st century.\n  In just over three decades, Amtrak has grown to encompass a passenger \nrail network that connects 46 States, including my home State of \nVermont. Through the years Amtrak has stood resilient in the face of \nfinancial peril and today it carries 24 million passengers annually and \nemploys 22,000 Americans.\n  Amtrak serves a diverse ridership that depends on the continued \nexistence of safe and reliable transportation. Amtrak shuttles \ncommuters to their jobs, brings college students home for the holidays, \nand increases mobility for the elderly and the disabled. In urban \nareas, passenger rail relieves traffic on overcrowded highways. In \nrural States like Vermont, passenger rail ensures access to \nmetropolitan centers and provides public transportation to regions \nwhere it might otherwise be too costly or unavailable.\n  As fuel prices remain unstable and our Nation's highways and airports \nsuffer ever-increasing congestion and delays, Amtrak offers an \ninvaluable alternative upon which Americans have come to rely.\n  I think one of my Vermont constituents expressed this sentiment best \nin a letter I recently received. Colby Crehan of Burlington, Vermont \nwrote of her Amtrak trip across the United States: ``I was able to \ntravel safely and comfortably on a train while seeing the beautiful \nlandscape that covers so much of this country. Amtrak introduced me to \nthe rest of America in a way that a car or plane trip could never do. \nThese trips confirmed my feeling that train travel is the safest, most \nconvenient and relaxing way to travel perhaps you can share my story.''\n  Our choice today is clear. We can forfeit our prior investments and \nthe investments of State and local governments back home, or we can \nuphold our responsibility to ensure that passenger rail remains an \nintegral part of our Nation's transportation system. The future of \npassenger rail in this country belongs in the hands of Congress, not in \nthe bankruptcy courts. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this \namendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Byrd and my \nother colleagues to offer this amendment, to repair a major flaw in the \nbudget resolution.\n  I was shocked when the President sent his budget here earlier this \nyear, without a dime for intercity passenger rail. Not a dime. Not one \nred cent.\n  How could they possibly refuse to fund our passenger rail system, \nthat carries 25 million passengers a year? What are they thinking? \nWhere will those 25 million travelers go? Back onto our overcrowded \nhighways? Should they take a place in the security lines in our \nairports?\n  We know what they are thinking, Mr. President. We have been told, in \nmany public statements by the administration, that they intend to \nblackmail us in the Congress into accepting a plan to breakup Amtrak, \nin exchange for the funds the system needs to keep running.\n  Instead of fixing that problem, this resolution repeats the blackmail \nthreat: breakup the system, or no funds.\n  No passenger rail system in the world operates without support. \nAlmost no passenger rails system in the world operates on the low level \nof support inflicted on Amtrak over the years.\n  We have starved the system of one of its most basic needs: capital. \nFrom the day we created it over 30 years ago, Amtrak has been put in \nthe impossible position of trying to increase its ridership, to \nincrease its own revenues, while we have refused to provide it with the \nresources needed to do the job.\n  Railroading is a classic capital-intensive industry. The huge costs \nfor the right of way itself, which Amtrak owns all along the Northeast \ncorridor, the costs of maintaining the locomotives and passenger cars--\nthose are the costs that virtually every other advanced industrial \neconomy in the world undertakes today.\n\n[[Page S2794]]\n\n  They don't do it out of nostalgia for the golden age of rail. They \ndon't do it because they lack other kinds of transportation. They do it \nbecause modern economies need a full mix of transportation options, a \nbalanced system. They do it because it takes pressure off highways and \nairports, because passenger rail is clean and safe.\n  Here on the Senate floor, we are told: Don't worry, we aren't \nserious. We didn't mean it when we refused to put a dime in this budget \nfor passenger rail.\n  But the adminstration put it differently in its budget. They actually \npropose zeroing out Amtrak with the goal of causing a bankruptcy, \nwhich, and I quote, ``would likely lead to the elimination of \ninefficient operations and reorganization of the railroad through \nbankrupcty proceedures.''\n  That is their idea of reform. That is their idea of how to make \ntransportation policy: Let a bankruptcy judge figure it out.\n  They are creating a crisis, and using the threat of bankruptcy to \nforce changes on the system.\n  What is their plan? What do they propose?\n  First, they want to push more costs off onto the States. That is a \ntheme we are seeing throughout the budget. It looks like saving money, \nbut it simply shifts costs. Ask our mayors, ask our Governors what they \nthink of the Federal Government shifting costs onto them. That is not a \nplan that will work.\n  They also want to break Amtrak up into capital and operating units. \nThey tried something like that in Great Britain, and they regret it. \nThen they want to let other companies come in and bid to run operations \non the most profitable lines. That is a formula for breaking up the \nsystem, encouraging cherry-picking, tearing up contracts with the \nunions, and leaving passengers stranded.\n  That is not reforming a national passenger rail system; that is \nbreaking up the system we have.\n  This is no way to accomplish reform.\n  Right now Amtrak has a growing ridership, for good reasons. With \nsecurity concerns and hassles, with the cost-cutting and crowding, air \ntravel is less attractive. Our highways are already congested.\n  Amtrak has earned that new ridership, with its new fleet of high-\nspeed Acela trains, with a commitment to maintaining and upgrading \nequipment. A lot of that work goes on in my State of Delaware, at our \nshops at Wilmington and at Bear.\n  But by starving the system of the capital it needs, we have put it \ninto crisis. Without more investment, it cannot attract riders. Without \nmore passengers, it cannot earn more money. The way out of the impasse \nis to make the investment in the passenger rail system our Nation \nneeds.\n\n  Amtrak has a 5-year capital plan that could attract more passengers, \nand earn them more operating revenues, but they have not received the \nfunding they need to make that plan work.\n  Starved of the capital they need to succeed, then blamed for not \nmaking money, now Amtrak is facing blackmail and bankruptcy under this \nbudget.\n  Senator Byrd, who is our leader on this amendment, knows the history \nof Amtrak's funding problems. His amendment is not extravagant; in \nfact, it is less than we should be giving Amtrak as it struggles to \nimprove. I am sure Senator Byrd feels the same way. But the $1.4 \nbillion this amendment would provide would remove the threat of \nbankruptcy and keep the system running.\n  It is the only responsible anwer to an irresponsible budget.\n  While I am speaking Mr. President, there is one other aspect of \npassenger rail I want to mention: security. In the aftermath of the \ntragic events of September 11, over 3 years ago, I came to the floor \nwith an amendent to the $15 billion airline bailout and security \nspending bill. That amendment would have begun the process of raising \nsecurity on our rails, just as we recognized the need to increase \nsecurity on our airlines.\n  In deference to the emergency in the airline industry, I withdrew \nthat amendment. In the years since, I have tried, with the help of \nSenators McCain, Hollings, Carper, Schumer, Clinton, and others, to \nmove legislation to upgrade rail security.\n  Over 3 years later, in the face of explicit warnings and evidence \nthat terrorists are targetting passenger rail here in our country, a \nyear after the tragic bombings in Madrid, we have done virtually \nnothing about Amtrak's security needs.\n  It should be a scandal that this Congress and this administration \nhave not even authorized, much less spent a dime for, a plan to secure \nour rail system.\n  More people pass through Penn Station in New York City than through \nLa Guardia and JFK airports combined.\n  Union Station, just two blocks from here, is the busiest site in \nWashington, DC, with 25 million people passing through.\n  Amtrak is expected to patrol those sites with its own meager forces. \nIn Penn Station, only six to eight security guards patrol on weekdays. \nAnd they have the weekends off.\n  Whatever you think of passenger rail, it is unconscionable to propose \nno money--zero, nothing--to increase the security of the 25 million \nAmericans who ride Amtrak every year.\n  This amendment by itself will not take care of those security needs, \nbut it will address the basic needs of passenger rail in our country. I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, for fiscal year 2006, the President's budget \nseeks the complete elimination of direct subsidies for Amtrak. The \nbudget resolution presumes enactment of the budget proposals for \ntransportation which would result in bankruptcy for Amtrak. My \namendment, which has cosponsors on both sides of the aisle, would \nincrease Amtrak funding by $1.05 billion in fiscal year 2006.\n  If Senators really desire all Amtrak services to come to an immediate \nand grinding halt for lack of a Federal subsidy in 2006, they will vote \nagainst the amendment. Across the Northeast corridor, the busiest urban \ntransportation corridor in the Nation, elimination of Amtrak's premier \nservice would be a transportation disaster. Elimination of Amtrak \nservice would have disastrous results in both rural and urban America.\n  The elimination of an Amtrak subsidy is not a recipe for a \nstreamlined railroad; it is not a recipe for a more efficient railroad. \nIt is a recipe for a dead railroad--a dead railroad, dead, dead, dead \nrailroad.\n  I urge Senators to vote for my amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on agreeing to the Byrd \namendment No. 158.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Cantwell amendment No. 168.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against \nthe Cantwell amendment. We have an opportunity today to open a very \ntiny portion of Alaska's coastal plain to exploration and opportunity. \nThis is an opportunity for us to focus on energy security, economic \nsecurity, and environmental security. The price of oil just bumped up \nto 56 bucks a barrel this morning. What we are talking about in terms \nof the security for domestic reserves is on average a million barrels \nof oil per day.\n  The other side has said it doesn't mean much. Let me tell you what it \nmeans. It is enough fuel to run the State of Maryland for 100 years. It \nis enough fuel for every car and every home in Washington State for 68 \nyears. It is enough fuel to replace all of our imports from Saudi \nArabia for 25 years. It is enough fuel to double all of the oil taken \nout of east Texas in the past 75 years. This needs to be part of an \noverall energy plan.\n  I urge the Senate to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I urge Members to support the Cantwell \namendment. It is clear what our options are today. We can continue this \nproposal to try to drill in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge, even though \nCongress previously has said let's not do that and let's preserve the \nwildlife. We know that the amount of oil generated, according to the \nPresident's own economic advisers, will have a negligible impact on oil \nprices. Maybe that is because there is no guarantee that the revenue \ncollected from this or the oil from the Arctic Wildlife Refuge will be \nkept in America. This oil will be exported, part of international \nmarkets, and do nothing to help us get our overdependence on oil off \nthis track and on to the right track.\n  I urge my colleagues to turn this argument down and to start on an \nenergy future that is about renewables, about conservation, about new \nenergy technologies.\n  Our legacy on this floor is not going to be a pipeline in Alaska but \npreserving a wildlife area and getting on with an energy future that \nAmerica wants and needs.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

PAY-AS-YOU-GO POINT OF ORDER IN THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Pay-as-you-go Point of Order in the Senate.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of Senate enforcement, it \n     shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any direct \n     spending or revenue legislation that would increase the on-\n     budget deficit or cause an on-budget deficit for any one of \n     the three applicable time periods as measured in paragraphs \n     (5) and (6).\n       (2) Applicable time periods.--For purposes of this \n     subsection, the term ``applicable time period'' means any 1 \n     of the 3 following periods:\n       (A) The first year covered by the most recently adopted \n     concurrent resolution on the budget.\n       (B) The period of the first 5 fiscal years covered by the \n     most recently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget.\n       (C) The period of the 5 fiscal years following the first 5 \n     fiscal years covered in the most recently adopted concurrent \n     resolution on the budget.\n       (3) Direct-spending legislation.--For purposes of this \n     subsection and except as provided in paragraph (4), the term \n     ``direct-spending legislation'' means any bill, joint \n     resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that \n     affects direct spending as that term is defined by, and \n     interpreted for purposes of, the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n       (4) Exclusion.--For purposes of this subsection, the terms \n     ``direct-spending legislation'' and ``revenue legislation'' \n     do not include--\n       (A) any concurrent resolution on the budget; or\n       (B) any provision of legislation that affects the full \n     funding of, and continuation of, the deposit insurance \n     guarantee commitment in effect on the date of enactment of \n     the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990.\n       (5) Baseline.--Estimates prepared pursuant to this section \n     shall--\n       (A) use the baseline surplus or deficit used for the most \n     recently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget; and\n       (B) be calculated under the requirements of subsections (b) \n     through (d) of section 257 of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 for fiscal years beyond \n     those covered by that concurrent resolution on the budget.\n       (6) Prior surplus.--If direct spending or revenue \n     legislation increases the on-budget\n\n[[Page S2796]]\n\n     deficit or causes an on-budget deficit when taken \n     individually, it must also increase the on-budget deficit or \n     cause an on-budget deficit when taken together with all \n     direct spending and revenue legislation enacted since the \n     beginning of the calendar year not accounted for in the \n     baseline under paragraph (5)(A), except that direct spending \n     or revenue effects resulting in net deficit reduction enacted \n     pursuant to reconciliation instructions since the beginning \n     of that same calendar year shall not be available.\n       (b) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended in the \n     Senate only by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (c) Appeals.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of \n     the Chair relating to any provision of this section shall be \n     limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the appellant and the manager of the bill or \n     joint resolution, as the case may be. An affirmative vote of \n     three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly chosen and \n     sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal of the ruling \n     of the Chair on a point of order raised under this section.\n       (d) Determination of Budget Levels.--For purposes of this \n     section, the levels of new budget authority, outlays, and \n     revenues for a fiscal year shall be determined on the basis \n     of estimates made by the Committee on the Budget of the \n     Senate.\n       (e) Sunset.--This section shall expire on September 30, \n     2010.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment \nwith the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Chafee, and a bipartisan group \nof other Senators. Our amendment is the same amendment we offered last \nyear and that this body passed with bipartisan support. It would simply \nreinstate the pay-as-you-go rule that had been such an effective \nrestraint on the fiscal appetites of both Congress and the White House.\n  Over the past 4 years, we have seen a dramatic deterioration in the \nGovernment's ability to perform one of its most fundamental jobs, and \nthat is balancing the Nation's fiscal books.\n  We are all familiar with the history. In January of 2001, the \nCongressional Budget Office projected that in the 10 years thereafter, \nthe Government would run a unified budget surplus of more than $5 \ntrillion. Little more than 4 years later, we are now staring at almost \na mirror image of that very positive 10-year projection, except that \ninstead of healthy surpluses under any reasonable set of assumptions, \nwe are now facing immense deficits and a backbreaking debt.\n  This has to stop. We have to stop running deficits because they cause \nthe Government to use the surpluses of the Social Security trust fund \nfor other Government purposes rather than to pay down the debt and help \nour Nation prepare for the coming retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration. We have to stop running deficits because every dollar we \nadd to the Federal debt is another dollar we are forcing our children \nto pay back in higher taxes or fewer Government benefits.\n  When the Government and this generation choose to spend on current \nconsumption and then to accumulate debt for our children's generation \nto pay, it does nothing less than rob our children of their own \nchoices. We make our choices to spend on our wants, but we saddle our \nchildren and our grandchildren with the debts that they have to pay \nfrom tax dollars, their tax dollars, and their hard work.\n  We all know that is not right. That is why I am offering this \nbipartisan amendment to fully reinstate the pay-go rule. We need a \nstrong budget process. We need to exert fiscal discipline.\n  Mr. President, you remember when the pay-go rule was in effect, tough \nfiscal discipline governed the budget process. Under the current \napproach, it is pretty much the opposite, it is the other way around. \nWhat happens now is the annual budget resolution determines how much \nfiscal discipline we are willing to impose on ourselves. This just \nhasn't worked. When Congress decides it would be nice to create a new \nentitlement or enact new tax cuts and then adjust its budget rules to \npermit those policies, we are really inviting a disastrous result, and \nthat is just what we have seen happen.\n  As an example, if somebody wants to lose weight, you set the total \nnumber of calories you are allowed to consume first, and then you try \nto make the meals fit under that cap--not the other way around. Imagine \nif you tried to lose weight by deciding what you want to eat first and \nthen setting a calorie limit to accommodate your various cravings. If \nyou want to eat cake, fine, you just dial up that calorie intake limit \nand you are all set. If you want a couple of extra beers, that is fine, \ntoo, under this kind of system; you just raise the calorie limit \naccordingly.\n  It may taste pretty good at the time, but you will probably end up \ngaining weight, just like this Nation is racking up debt because this \nill-advised diet is exactly how the current mutated version of pay-go \nworks, and we have seen the results--the debt we are leaving our \nchildren and our grandchildren has been putting on massive amounts of \nweight. This amendment would simply return us to the rule by which \nCongress played for the decade of the 1990s, and that was instrumental \nin balancing the Federal budget.\n  Let's remember, that was not an era where one side had control of all \nthe Government or the other side did. For most of the nineties, most of \nthis time, we had a Democrat President and Republican control of both \nHouses, and we all agreed and we all worked together on the principle \nthat the pay-go rules were helping us move toward the goal--in fact, \nthe achievement--of having a balanced budget by the year 2000, by the \ntime President Bush took office.\n  Many of us here lived under that rule, and we know just how effective \nit was. If this budget does nothing else, it should reinstate the \nclassic, the old pay-go rule. If we do that, maybe we can begin to turn \nthese annual budgets around and stop racking up these deficits and \nadding to the already enormous Federal debt.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, time-tested fiscal \ndiscipline.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask the Presiding Officer to let me know \nwhen I have spoken for 5 minutes. I would appreciate that.\n  This amendment should be opposed primarily because there is a big \ndifference between requiring offsets for spending increases and \nrequiring offsets for tax cuts. They have dramatically different \neffects on economic growth. The goal here should be a strong private \nsector economy.\n  Let's go back to basic principles. Money does not belong to the \nGovernment, so we should not be concerned about how much a particular \npolicy ``costs'' the Government. Money belongs to the people and when \nallowed to work in the private sector economy it can become a powerful \nengine for economic growth and job creation and a better standard of \nliving and productivity for all Americans. And one more thing: it could \nreally help the Federal Government because the more wealth that is \nproduced, the more that is taxed, and the more revenues go to the \nFederal Government as taxes. So a growing, vibrant economy not only \nhelps us all as individuals and families, it helps the Federal \nGovernment, too, because there is more economic growth and revenue and \nwealth to tax.\n  The key here is to keep economic growth going strong. We are also \nconcerned about the size of the deficit, and that is why we have the \nso-called pay-go rule for spending. If we are going to raise spending \nin one area, what the budget says, and correctly so, in another area is \nwe need to reduce it someplace else because we need to net it out at an \neven amount. We don't want to go above the spending level in the budget \nthat the President and the Budget Committee have set. That makes sense.\n  But with respect to tax cuts, what is the purpose of a tax cut? The \npurpose of a tax cut is to ensure that we can continue to sustain \neconomic growth, to create jobs, basically to provide more capital to \nbe invested into businesses which can hire more people, can produce \nmore goods, which can create more revenue. And again, what happens with \nthat growing economy--revenue increases to the Treasury.\n  The purpose of the tax cut is to keep all of that going.\n  Suppose you had a pay-go rule that said you have to ``pay'' for tax \ncuts by giving the Federal Government an equivalent amount of money \nthat you are reducing as a result of the tax cuts; in other words, that \nsomehow the money belongs to the Federal Government, and if you are \ngoing to let people keep more of their own money somehow that has to be \nmade up to the Federal Government.\n  That makes no sense at all. That is basically robbing Peter to pay \nPaul by\n\n[[Page S2797]]\n\ntaking money out of one pocket and putting it into another pocket--\nbasically saying if we reduce taxes in the private sector in order to \nstimulate economic growth, somehow we have to go back in that private \nsector and pull an equivalent amount of money out to give it to the \nFederal Government to make up the difference. It makes no sense at all.\n  All you have do in that case is reduce the amount of money in the \nprivate sector, producing revenue by reducing the amount that goes to \nthe Federal Government in revenues. This has been demonstrated. As a \nmatter of fact, since the tax cut of 2003, if you judge the year from \n2003 to 2004 in the same period, we saw an increase in revenues to the \nTreasury from taxes of 10.5 percent compared to the same time in 2003. \nThe aftertax revenues to the Government were more than before we cut \nthe tax rates.\n  How could that be? In economic theory--we know this to be true--take \nthe case of capital gains taxes. Since both dividends and capital gains \ntax reductions are presumed to be included in this budget cut, we know \nthat when the tax rates on capital gains were high, people didn't sell \ntheir assets. They didn't turn them over because they would have to pay \na big tax. As soon as we reduced the tax rate on capital gains, it had \nan unlocking effect in the economy, and then people were willing to \nsell their assets because they did not have to pay nearly as much taxes \non the gains.\n  Conversely, it is also true that the higher the rate, the less \neconomic activity.\n  There was a direct relationship between reducing the taxes and \nincreased revenue to the Treasury. The Nobel Prize economist, Dr. \nEdward Prescot, who teaches at Arizona State University, got his Nobel \nPrize for pointing out the same being true with respect to individual \nincome tax rates. It is not true that the higher the income tax rate, \nthe more revenue you bring in.\n  Suppose you had a 100-percent tax rate on your income. How many \npeople would work? You are working the entire amount of time for the \nFederal Government. The highest possible income tax rate produces the \nleast possible income tax revenue.\n  Instead, what you need is a rate at which people would feel they can \ncontinue to work and make enough money for themselves so it is \nworthwhile to continue to work. But at a certain point, you are taxing \nthat next dollar earned at a point at which people will no longer work.\n  That is what has happened to the European economy. Their higher tax \nrates over there have resulted in less work, less productivity, less \nincome to their treasury as a result of their taxes.\n  Pay-go works perfectly fine for the increases in spending that need \nto be offset, but it doesn't work at all--in fact, it is \ncounterproductive--with respect to reductions in taxes, which is what \nwe are trying to preserve by the budget by the reconciliation \nconstruction.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nColorado who cosponsored this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise in support of the classic pay-go \namendment and commend my colleagues, especially Senator Feingold for \nhis leadership on this issue.\n  We took the first step in opening one of the country's most pristine \nareas for potential development. I would have preferred to have given \nmy daughters Melinda and Andrea that choice to make in the future.\n  Let me put it plainly. I do not want to let my daughters down again. \nWhen we pass budgets with enormous deficits, that is the same as taxing \nour children and our grandchildren. They will be taxed to pay for our \nspending. They will be taxed to pay for our unwillingness to say that \nenough is enough.\n  Our kids and grandkids don't get to vote for the Senators and \nCongressmen who are imposing these future taxes on them. That is \ntaxation without representation, and that is something the leaders of \nour War for Independence had some thought about.\n  It is wrong and it is un-American to impose taxes on our children and \nour grandchildren to pay for the spending spree of the Federal \nGovernment. It is long past time to restore to Congress the same \ncommonsense budgetary approach that every family in America has to live \nby. That approach is simple. If you can't pay for it, don't spend it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado who \nmade an important connection between the last vote on the Alaska refuge \nand this amendment.\n  On the Alaska amendment, one side became frustrated, so they decided \nto change the rules. We are going to decide that instead of having 60 \nvotes for a normal procedure on an energy bill, we will go with 51 \nvotes using the budget process, which I think is inappropriate. They \nwon. Now we see a different attempt to deal with the rules.\n  We had rules on paying in the 1990s that worked, and worked very \nwell. Both parties came together. We balanced the budget.\n  When the rules get in the way, apparently, they do not want to have \nany rules, any procedure, any discipline when it comes to either \nmandatory spending or tax cuts. They want to make sure they achieve \ntheir objective, regardless of rules.\n  That is a serious problem. It is a serious problem for this \ninstitution, it is a serious problem for this country, and as the \nSenator from Colorado said so eloquently, it is going to be a serious \nproblem for our kids and grandchildren who will be bound by the kind of \ndecision we make about the Arctic Refuge and having to acquire this \nhuge debt which this Congress is refusing to address.\n  This Congress is, frankly, becoming openly hostile to the principle \nof fiscal discipline--openly hostile.\n  I thank the Senator from Colorado very much for his remarks.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota and thank him for \nhis great leadership on these issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin. He has \nbeen the leader on pay-go and budget discipline that says no spending \nand no tax cuts. You can have them, but you have to pay for them. There \nis a novel idea around here. You have to pay for them.\n  Our colleague from Arizona indicated this concept--that if you cut \ntaxes, you get more money. The only problem with that concept is it \ndoesn't work in the real world. It is a wonderful idea. I wish it were \ntrue. But it isn't true.\n  Here is what happens with revenues as a percent of our national \nincome. In 2000, we were getting 20.9 percent of gross domestic product \nin Federal revenue. We passed a series of tax cuts, and what happened \nto revenue? It plunged to the lowest since 1959.\n  That is what happened when we cut taxes. We got less revenue. The \nrevenue side of the equation simply dropped out. That is why the \ndeficits have exploded.\n  I can remember so well back in 2001 when the Congressional Budget \nOffice told us the range of possible outcomes on the deficits was \nexpressed by this chart, which I call the fan chart. This was what \nwould happen on the low end of their forecast, and this is what would \nhappen on the high end. They chose the midrange, as did the President, \nwhich told them we were going to get $5.6 trillion of surpluses over \nthe period.\n\n  When I said to my Republican colleagues, let's not be so sure of \nthat, let's not bet the farm on that, they assured me: Kent, you are \nbeing much too conservative. Don't you understand with the tax cuts we \nare putting in place we will get much more revenue? We are not going to \nbe at the midpoint of the range, we will be above the midpoint of the \nrange.\n  We can go back now and look at what actually happened. Here is what \nactually happened. We are not at the bottom of the range, we are below \nthe bottom. Here is what happened in reality: we are way below the \nbottom.\n  All these tax cuts, what did they lead to? They led to less revenue, \nand coupled with the increases in spending for defense and homeland \nsecurity as a result of September 11, the deficits exploded.\n\n[[Page S2798]]\n\n  Here is what has happened: our Republican colleagues, who used to be \nfiscally conservative, have now become borrow-and-spend advocates. They \nhave no intention of doing anything about these budget deficits except \nadd to them. Here is what that policy has achieved: record budget \ndeficits.\n  The question of pay-go, which is the budget discipline we had back in \nthe 1980s and 1990s that helped us turn record deficits at that time \ninto record surpluses, pay-go is a budget discipline that has worked, \nand the budget discipline that was in effect then is the budget \ndiscipline being offered by the Senator from Wisconsin now.\n  This is the Federal Reserve Chairman on the question of restoring \nreal pay-go. Congressman Spratt on the House side asked:\n\n       Is it still your position that if we renew the paygo rule \n     it should apply to both; that if we have tax cuts including \n     the renewal of the expiring tax cuts in 2010, that these \n     should be fully offset?\n\n  Chairman Greenspan:\n\n       It is still my position. That we have some form of paygo \n     system, which is agreed upon by the Congress, in my judgment, \n     is the overriding consideration here, because, as you point \n     out, it's been quite effective in actually stemming budget \n     inefficiencies and expansion during a period that it was law.\n\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan:\n\n       All I'm saying is that my general view is I would like to \n     see the tax burden as low as possible. And in that context, I \n     would like to see tax cuts continue. But, as I indicated \n     earlier, that has got to be, in my judgment, in the context \n     of a paygo resolution.\n\n  When further asked, the Chairman made clear a pay-go approach that \napplies to both spending and to taxes.\n  The pay-go ledger in the Senate GOP budget allows massive deficit \nincreases. It allows a $33 billion increase from 2006 to 2010. It \nallows almost a $260 billion increase in deficits in the period 2011 to \n2015.\n  Finally and in conclusion, the Republican budget before the Senate is \nadvertised as cutting the deficit in half over the next 5 years. But \nthe Republicans' own budget document shows something quite different \nfrom their assertions.\n  On page 5 of the Republican budget document they provide their \nforecast of how the debt will increase every year for the next 5 years. \nHere is what it shows: A $669 billion increase in the debt this year, a \n$636 billion next year, $624 billion the year after that, $622 billion \nin the fourth year, and $611 billion in the fifth year.\n  Those are the Republican estimates of the increase in debt if we pass \ntheir budget. That is a $3 trillion increase in the debt of the United \nStates if this budget is passed. There is nothing in there that is \ngoing to protect us from massive increases of deficit and debt.\n  The opportunity to be fiscally disciplined is the opportunity offered \nin the amendment of the Senator from Wisconsin. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I rise in opposition to the Feingold amendment. I do \nthat with a realization that there is a great need for deficit \nreduction. Who can find fault with the objectives of Senator Feingold's \namendment? Those objectives are good.\n  I am going to demonstrate that his proposal is not realistic. It also \nignores the reality of the tax relief of the current law. It unwisely \nignores a bipartisan will to maintain current tax relief for millions \nof taxpayers. Without maintaining existing tax policy, if we would just \nlet that expire, we would have the biggest tax increase in the history \nof the country without Congress acting. It seems to me if we are going \nto have the biggest tax increase in the history of the country, \nCongress ought to make the decision to do it.\n  I will talk about how the Senate Finance Committee approaches tax \npolicy. We have used pay-go on taxes, but we do it outside of the \nbudget. Two kinds of tax relief bills have come out of the Finance \nCommittee in the last 4 years. One set of bills contained widely \napplicable tax relief. Those bills, if you take them together, and they \nwere done under reconciliation, were bipartisan. I emphasize that \nbecause everyone around the country thinks everything around here is \npartisan. But these tax cuts were bipartisan and they were net tax cuts \nfor virtually every American taxpayer. Those bills enacted in 2001 and \n2003 did not contain offsets.\n  The secondary category of bills our committee works on would cover \nall other bills coming as part of our committee business. Those bills \ndealt with specific categories of tax relief. I will give some \nexamples: A charitable giving tax bill, the bill to deal with exports \nin manufacturing, a bill to deal with the Armed Forces tax relief for \nour folks in Iraq putting their lives on the line--there are many other \nexamples of tax relief fully offset by our committee.\n  In a few rare cases, such as the energy tax relief, for example, \nbills were partially offset. Now, this pattern is applicable during my \nchairmanship of this committee, and it is fair for me to say there was \na similar pattern occurring when my Democratic colleague and \ncounterpart, Senator Baucus, was chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  By and large, then, the Senate Finance Committee, when dealing with \ntax policy, has produced revenue-neutral bills. The exceptions occurred \nwhen there was bipartisan support for widely applicable tax relief. And \nI emphasize the word ``bipartisan.''\n  By the way, had we not responded with that bipartisan tax relief, \nthere would have been no widespread economic stimulus that resulted. In \nother words, the economic depression that set in with the NASDAQ losing \nhalf of its value in the year 2000, and then with the September 11 \nattack on New York City and the resulting downturn in the economy, we \nwould not have had in place an economic stimulus to bring back economic \ngrowth to where we are now.\n  Chairman Greenspan said tax relief was responsible for the economic \nturnaround.\n  Also, we had the most recent Nobel economic prize winner tell us that \nour tax relief in 2001 and 2003 was not as big as it should have been \nto get the maximum economic stimulus. But we have had an economic \nturnaround justifying, without question, those tax relief packages.\n  So let me be clear. With tax policy outside the budget, the Finance \nCommittee has, in effect, operated on a pay-go basis. The exceptions \nwere built into the budget, and those exceptions had bipartisan \nsupport.\n  I would like to challenge any of the critics of this budget to show \nthe same record on the spending side. No, it seems like others want to \nspend. And all of these amendments that are being offered are adding up \nto positive proof that the same people who are against tax relief do \nnot want to reduce the deficit. What they want to do is spend more \nmoney.\n  If I could ever find from the other side how high taxes had to be, \nhow high they had to be to satisfy their appetite to spend money, I \nmight go that high, if I knew I never had to go any higher. But I \ncannot ever get any consensus about that. So the only conclusion you \ncome to: taxes can never be high enough.\n  The other point is, I might be willing to vote for some increase in \ntaxes if every dollar increase in taxes resulted in a lower deficit, \nwent to the bottom line to lower the deficit. But, no, every time we \nraise $1 of taxes around here, it is a license to spend $1.10, $1.20, \nand sometimes more. So we need out of the other side the same concerns \nabout spending.\n  The Feingold amendment is not realistic about current tax relief. \nSenator Feingold's amendment would undo the tax policy resources in the \nbudget. Let me explain why. The budget's tax cut number covers expiring \ntax relief. It extends all widely applicable tax relief. It includes it \nall. The number covers dividends and capital gains. It also covers, \nthrough the year 2010, provisions the critics say they support: tuition \ndeduction, low-income savers credit, small business expensing. The \nnumber also covers for 1-year provisions critics say they support: \nbusiness extenders such as R, sales tax deductions, the alternative \nminimum tax hold harmless.\n  The number includes offsets that will get us $20 to $30 billion. So \nwe are talking about $70 billion net. I repeat, that is $70 billion \nnet. It covers a gross tax cut of $90 to $100 billion. That number \ncovers all of the items that folks, particularly on the other side of \nthe aisle, say they are for.\n\n[[Page S2799]]\n\n  Now, critics cannot say they are for these items and not provide room \nin this budget for those tax cuts. You cannot have it both ways. So a \nvote for the Feingold amendment is a vote against expiring tax relief \nthat a lot of these folks say we ought to pass.\n  Realistically, there is probably around $30 billion in offsets. \nRealistically, there is about $100 billion in costs. That is a \nrealistic position. For instance, we have heard a lot about the \nalternative minimum tax. ``When are you going to do something about \nit?'' is a question from the other side. The cost of a 1-year hold \nharmless on the alternative minimum tax is $30 billion. That is $30 \nbillion for AMT for 1 year alone. So don't tell people back home you \nare for AMT relief if you vote for the Feingold amendment.\n  Let's go through some of these other expiring tax relief provisions. \nDeduction for State and local sales tax: It is covered in the number in \nthe budget. It is important for States such as Nevada, Washington, \nFlorida, and South Dakota.\n  Mr. President, could I have more time?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I yield the chairman of the Finance Committee \nanother 5 minutes, if that is sufficient.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, we have a savers credit, an incentive for low-income \nsavers. It is covered in the budget number. Deduction for college \ntuition: It is covered in the budget number. Extension of research and \ndevelopment tax credit--it is important to lots of States--it is \ncovered in the budget number. Extension of wind and alternative energy \ntax credit: It is covered in the budget. I know that is important to a \nlot of people, a lot of people who are critics of this budget.\n  So you cannot have it both ways. If you exclude room in the budget \nfor tax relief, you cannot say you support that same tax relief. The \ntwo positions are not in sync. The budget resolution provides room for \ntax relief. So a vote for the Feingold amendment is a vote against \nexpiring tax relief. You cannot have it both ways. Either you are for a \nbudget that has a realistic plan to maintain current tax relief--and \nthis budget has that realistic plan--or you are for the Feingold \namendment, which means you are not serious--not serious--about \nmaintaining current tax relief levels.\n  Now, the Feingold amendment is also a stealth tax increase. The \npremise of the Feingold amendment is that tax relief should be treated \nless favorably--less favorably--than spending. How can that be, you \nmight ask? Well, here is the answer. Entitlement spending such as \nSocial Security and Medicare and discretionary spending can grow under \nthe Feingold notion of pay-go. Contrariwise, much of the current law of \ntax relief expires, and in some cases tax relief, such as the AMT hold \nharmless, runs out after year's end. That is 9 million tax filers, \nmostly middle-income families, who are hit by the Feingold regime.\n  There is no comparable hit on the spending side. See the bias for tax \nincreases automatically, and no bias against spending increases. \nEntitlement spending would continue to grow without limit under the \nFeingold amendment. So the Feingold amendment backstops runaway \nentitlement spending. Taxpayers are left out. Taxpayers are out in the \ncold under the Feingold regime. A vote for the Feingold amendment is a \nvote against status quo tax relief and a vote for status quo spending. \nThat does not sound like evenhanded fiscal discipline to me.\n  So I urge a vote against the Feingold amendment because it is \ndefective on these several points. And most importantly for me, as the \nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee, it ignores the Finance \nCommittee's prudence under both Democratic chairmanship and Republican \nchairmanship. It ignores the reality of current tax relief which is \nexpiring. It contains a stealth tax increase on at least 9 million \ntaxpayers who are going to be caught up in the alternative minimum tax. \nIt creates a double standard by treating a dollar of out-of-control \nspending more favorably than a dollar of current tax relief.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleagues engaging in a \ndebate on this amendment. But I have to say, how did something that \nboth of these Senators, the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from \nIowa, supported vigorously in the 1990s suddenly become a Feingold \nregime? These are the pay-go rules of the 1990s. This is not some new \nscheme or new approach. These are exactly the rules we had before that \nboth parties worked together on and used to balance the budget.\n  Both Senators suggest that this is going to prevent tax cuts. I ask \nthem: How in the world, then, did we have the 1997 tax cut bill? If \nthis regime, as they call it, prevents tax cuts, how did that happen? \nThese rules were in place at that time.\n  These rules don't prevent tax cuts. These rules just say, either you \npay for them or you get 60 votes. Last year there were a number of \nmiddle class tax cuts I supported. They received something like over 90 \nvotes. We didn't prevent those tax cuts. They simply met a standard \nthat was easily met of 60 votes.\n  The Senator from Iowa has mischaracterized this amendment grossly \nwhen he says it doesn't affect spending. It is my amendment that puts \nsome rules back on mandatory spending. It is my amendment that covers \nmandatory spending. The reason why we had a $400-billion unfunded \nMedicare bill last year is because the current rules were in place \nrather than the amendment I have offered. This relates to spending as \nwell as taxes.\n  The entire argument that somehow this isn't evenhanded, that it only \napplies to taxes and not to spending is absolutely false. That might be \nwhy we have four or five Republican cosponsors because they would never \nsupport something that favors spending over tax cuts.\n  It is very troubling when we have a debate and the debate is not \nabout what is actually before us. What is before us is rules that have \nworked before, rules that relate to spending and taxes and merely \nrequire us to be responsible.\n  I now very happily yield 15 minutes to my cosponsor, Senator \nVoinovich.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Voinovich-\nFeingold amendment to restore integrity to our current pay-go process.\n  These are not ordinary times and it is not a time for business as \nusual. The United States is the largest debtor Nation in the world, and \nour trade deficit is the worst it has ever been. The U.S. dollar is \nweak, and too much of our debt is in the hands of other nations.\n  Just 2 weeks ago it was rumored that the Japanese central bank was \npulling their money out of dollars which sent a shiver of panic in the \nmarkets. Alan Greenspan and David Walker have served as modern-day Paul \nReveres alerting us to the need to do something now before it is too \nlate.\n  I recommend to my colleagues the pamphlet issued by the GAO entitled \n``21st Century Challenges, Reexamining the Base of the Federal \nGovernment.'' It is well worth reading.\n  This is the beginning of my second term in the Senate. One of the \nreasons Ohio sent me back here is because they know I am committed to \ndoing something about balancing the budget and paying down debt, \nfundamental, sound Republican principles to which I have been committed \nthroughout my career.\n  At this stage in my life, I am more worried than ever about the \nlegacy that our country will leave our children and grandchildren. God \nhas blessed my wife Janet and me with three living children and six \ngrandchildren. My daughter Betsy is expecting her third child. What \nkind of world will they live in?\n  One thing I know is that it will be more competitive than ever \nbefore, and they will have to work harder and be smarter to maintain \nthe standard of living to which Americans have become accustomed.\n  I am sure you are asking: What does this have to do with pay-go? It \nhas everything to do with pay-go because pay-go is a tool which \nCongress can use to enforce fiscal responsibility. Without fiscal \nresponsibility, without responsible stewardship of the public's money, \nthe gathering storm clouds of deficit and debt will darken more.\n  That is why I encourage my colleagues to do the right thing and \nsupport the amendment offered by Senator\n\n[[Page S2800]]\n\nFeingold and me to restore integrity to the current pay-go process. \nAccording to CBO estimates, the national debt increased by $600 billion \nbetween 2003 and 2004 and will increase by at least the same amount \nbefore October 2005. This is a $1.2 trillion increase in Federal debt \nin just 2 years.\n  Raising the debt limit has become an annual ritual. This chart shows \nwhere we are. It is interesting that some of the charts I have seen \nfrom some of my colleagues on my side of the aisle, all they show is \nthat over the next 5 years we are going to bring the deficit down. But \nthey never talk about the fact that our national debt is escalating up \nlike a rocket. We are in trouble. Where is it going to end?\n  I am in favor of controlling spending. My votes in the Senate reflect \nthat. This is a very tight budget when it comes to spending, and I \nsupport that. In fact, I commend Senator Gregg for producing the most \nfiscally responsible and honest budget resolution I have seen in 7 \nyears in the Senate. I would like to point out, with all due fairness \nto my colleague from Wisconsin, that the fact is, in that budget are \nprovisions that were in the Truth in Budgeting Act that Senator \nFeingold and I introduced a week ago: Three-year discretionary spending \ncaps; a new 60-vote point of order against legislation that would cost \nmore than $5 billion in any 10-year period between 2015 and 2055; a 60-\nvote point of order against unfunded mandates--I particularly \nappreciate this provision because I worked very hard to get unfunded \nmandate relief passed when I was Governor of Ohio and active in the \nNational Governors Association--a 60-vote point of order against \nlegislating exceeding appropriations spending limits; a $23.4 billion \ncap on advance appropriations; limits on the use of emergency \ndesignations. All of these provisions were in the Voinovich-Feingold \nTruth in Budgeting Act. So we have those in the budget.\n\n  I only wish the budget resolution also forced us to make equally \ndifficult choices about tax policy. None of us like to take tough votes \non programs we believe in, but most of us are willing to cast the \ndifficult vote if that is what it takes to get Federal spending under \ncontrol.\n  I say to my colleagues, how can I or any of us stick to this tough \nbudget that we have and at the same time say to people who are \ncomplaining: Senator, you are saying you want to do something about the \ndeficit, but at the same time you voted to extend tax reductions. How \ndo you justify these two positions?\n  I was interested to hear the chairman of the Finance Committee \nindicate that we are going to deal with AMT. I would like to remind my \ncolleagues that that is not in the budget. AMT will be on the floor of \nthe Senate before the end of this year. And the allegation that the \nFeingold-Voinovich amendment is going to prevent us doing anything \nabout AMT is poppycock. What it will require is that a budget point of \norder would be made against it. We would debate it, and if there are 60 \nvotes to waive the point of order, that would go into effect.\n  Another issue that I know is going to be on the floor of the Senate \nwhere we are going to have to borrow money is in dealing with Medicare \nreimbursement. We all know that today Medicare reimbursement, if we \ndon't do anything, will be reduced by 5 percent. None of us want that \nto happen. Again, that will be brought to the floor of the Senate.\n  This amendment does not prevent that from happening. It says: Pay for \nit or, in the alternative, debate it on the floor and get 60 votes.\n  Last but not least, this budget sets out $50 billion for the war in \nIraq and Afghanistan, doing things in Afghanistan. In my opinion, if \nyou are realistic, it is not going to be enough money. We don't still \nknow what the cost of this war is going to be to the American people.\n  One other aspect I have to point out is that this is against a \nbackdrop in which most experts agree that by 2030, spending for Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid alone will consume 18 percent of our \nGDP, about the same amount of money we are spending today for all \noperations of Government combined. That is why folks should read David \nWalker's pamphlet. It lays it out for us.\n  What does pay-go do? Pay-go forces us to stop and think before \nproposing legislation or amendments that will increase the deficit. \nPay-go demonstrates the Senate is serious about reducing the deficit. \nPay-go will provide a chance to stop and more carefully consider all \nalternatives before increasing spending or cutting taxes. Pay-go \nensures that programs that will impose additional debt on our children \nand grandchildren must gain an overwhelming level of support.\n  Some of my colleagues wanted to ensure increased spending now or cut \ntaxes now and hope that somehow the economy will save us or Congress \nwill simply fix the problem. This would be a major mistake. Depending \non the economy to save us from the impact of fiscal irresponsibility is \nlike hoping that a hurricane misses your house.\n  Over the past 10 years, we have gone from having deficits to having \nsurpluses and back to having deficits.\n  This is what has happened on this chart. During this period of time, \nwe were running surpluses. We came here and then in 2003 we started to \ncome down. Here is where we are now. The predictions are that they \ncould go that way or that way.\n  I think all of us who are conservative would have to say that we have \nto prepare for this hurricane that may hit us and not take the rosy \npicture that everything is going to be all right; just keep reducing \ntaxes, everything is going to be fine. We are going to grow our way out \nof this problem. I remember that during the 1980s when we saw the \ndeficit climb substantially, which required in 1991 and 1993 the fact \nthat we had to raise taxes. Borrowing money to run the Government is \nthe equivalent of a future tax increase for the American people.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at this from a fairness point of view, \nto eliminate from the budget resolution the $70 billion that we have \nput in there to extend some of the taxes that are now in place. Let's \npay for them. Alan Greenspan, David Walker, and Pete Peterson have all \nsaid the reduction on capital gains, on dividends, has helped the \neconomy. But they all say pay for it. If you cannot pay for it, let's \ndebate it on the floor of the Senate, as we did last year when we \ndebated whether we were going to continue the marriage penalty relief, \nthe lower marginal rates, the refundable child tax credit. But why \nsneak it into the budget resolution where we are only going to need 51 \nvotes to get the job done? I think it is not fair.\n  I appeal to the common sense of my colleagues in the Senate. Here is \nwhere we are. We are putting this money in our budget resolution, \ninstructions to the Finance Committee, to say $70 billion, and you can \nextend these tax reductions. At the same time we are doing that, we are \ntelling the American people that we are going to have a flat-funded \nbudget.\n  My feeling is, let's just clean it out of there. Take these \nextensions that everyone thinks are wonderful for the country and let's \ndebate them. See if we can get 60 votes. If they are so good, they will \nget 60 votes. If they are not, we will pay for them. I just don't \nunderstand how we can continue to go this way. I think we are living in \na dream world. This deficit continues to grow. We are the highest \ndebtor Nation in the world. Our trade deficit is one of the worst we \nhave ever seen. Unless we start to understand the seriousness of the \nsituation we have, we are in deep trouble.\n  Mr. President, I think we all care about our families. We have to \nthink about our legacy. I am 68 years old and I am running out of time. \nI think this country is running out of time. It is up to our generation \nto leave a better legacy than what it appears we are going to be \nleaving. There has to be some Republican who says: George, I agree with \nyou. Let's do it.\n  If they vote for this amendment, they are simply saying we are not \ngoing to put the money in the budget resolution to give the \ninstructions to the Finance Committee to go ahead and extend taxes up \nto $70 billion. What it will say is, Hey, guys, we are not going to do \nthat. If we want to extend these, let's bring them up and debate them \nand let's either pay for them or waive the budget resolution and do it \nthat way.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from\n\n[[Page S2801]]\n\nWisconsin, Senator Feingold, in supporting a real pay-as-you-go system \nin the fiscal year 2006 budget.\n  This amendment is about restoring fiscal common sense to the budget. \nIt would require 60 votes for tax cuts and mandatory spending increases \nthat increase the deficit.\n  The current budget proposes a flawed paygo rule that expires in 2008, \neven though this is supposed to be a 5-year budget. It also includes \nexemptions and holes that effectively amount to a ``pay-if-you'd-like'' \napproach, not a bonafide paygo system.\n  What we're proposing are sensible and responsible guidelines that \nwill reduce the record red ink that we've accumulated in the past 5 \nyears.\n  The Federal budget outlines not only revenue and spending, but more \ncritically how the Federal Government ranks its programmatic \npriorities. This budget resolution reveals only a glimpse of the long-\nterm fiscal outlook without telling Americans the hard truth about how \ntax cuts and spending run amok in Washington.\n  For example, the budget ignores large expenses such as the costs of \nmilitary operations in Iraq and Afghanistan beyond September 2006, and \nlong-term relief from the alternative minimum tax, which could affect \n41 million taxpayers in 2013, if Congress does not act. These are \nimminent expenses that we would be remiss to omit from the budget. Yet \nthe President excludes the costs from his budget blueprint.\n  And I haven't even mentioned the upwards of $5 trillion in \ntransitional costs over the next 20 years for the President's Social \nSecurity plan.\n  With regard specifically to paygo in the Budget Committee markup, one \nof my colleagues noted that a paygo rule that applies only to spending \nis akin to trying to keep a boat afloat by plugging one hole when, in \nfact, there are two holes in the boat. And this is precisely the case. \nThat is precisely the fiction that this Budget Resolution promotes.\n  If made permanent, the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 will cost the \nFederal Government $11 trillion over the next 75 years. That's more \nthan three times the shortfall of Social Security over that period. But \nthe President's budget doesn't apply paygo rules to these tax cuts.\n  Studies show that 25 percent of these tax cuts went to the wealthiest \nAmericans, those with the top 1 percent annual income. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, 74 percent of our budget deficits since \n2001 have been caused by decreased revenues. Only 26 percent is due to \nincreased spending.\n  We ought to be honest with ourselves about this fact. In my view, a \npaygo system that ignores revenues is not a paygo system at all.\n  If the Senate is sincere about restoring fiscal discipline, then we \nought to establish rules that say, ``If your legislation is going to \ncost money, you've got to pay for it, or get 60 votes.''\n  I believe that this amendment poses a crucial question to this body: \nDo we recognize that decreased revenues increase the deficit? I, for \none, will not turn a blind eye to the real budget picture.\n  If we are to balance the budget--as we did during the Clinton \nadministration--we should not do so solely through draconian cuts in \ncritical programs. This budget cuts back on programs for working \nAmericans and local governments that cannot run budget deficits as the \nFederal Government can.\n  I do not believe that fiscal responsibility necessarily requires us \nto shift the financial burden to our towns, cities and States as this \nbudget does through cuts to Medicaid and the Community Development \nBlock Grants, to name just two. As a former mayor, I know the value of \nthese programs in California and throughout the United States.\n  Tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans should not take precedence over \nthe needs of law enforcement, our children, the elderly, and veterans. \nIf my colleagues agree, then I ask that they join me in supporting this \namendment.\n  It is time to get our fiscal house in order, and to do so, we ought \nto reinstate a true paygo rule.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \namendment offered by my colleagues Senator Smith and Senator Bingaman \nto strike the reconciliation instructions to the Finance Committee and \nreplace them with a reserve fund for the Bipartisan Commission on \nMedicaid to undertake a comprehensive review of the Medicaid program \nand make recommendations to Congress within 1 year.\n  The Medicaid program provides essential medical services to low-\nincome and uninsured children and their families, pregnant women, \nsenior citizens, individuals with disabilities, and others. Last year, \nnearly 55 million Americans were enrolled in Medicaid, including more \nthan 300,000 in Maine where one in five people now receive health care \nservices through MaineCare, my State's Medicaid program.\n  Individuals who rely upon Medicaid-funded health services have no \nother option. Without Medicaid, they would join the ever growing ranks \nof the uninsured in this country, which now numbers an all-time high of \nmore than 45 million Americans who lacked health coverage at some point \nlast year. These two groups represent a total of 100 million Americans \nwho would have no health insurance, were it not for Medicaid coverage \nwhich reaches just over half of them. And to the extent that the \nFederal Government reduces its support for Medicaid funding, the \nnumbers of uninsured Americans will rise even more rapidly.\n  Medicaid is a critical part of our Nation's health care system. It \nprovides health coverage for people in the doctor's office, rather than \nthe emergency rooms, where care is more expensive. It also plays a \ncrucial role in preventing health care costs for the uninsured from \nbeing shifted to the private sector, which in turn increases hospitals' \ncosts.\n  The economic downturn which state economies experienced several years \nago, and from which many States are only now emerging, has continued to \nleave many families jobless and without health insurance, forcing them \nto turn to Medicaid. This has put an enormous strain on the states \nalready strapped with budget scarcities. Many States reduced Medicaid \nbenefits last year and even more restricted Medicaid eligibility in an \neffort to satisfy their budgetary obligations.\n  As the Senate considers the budget resolution for fiscal year 2006, I \nbelieve that we must take a balanced approach that is fiscally \nresponsible yet reflects our long-standing commitments to provide \nhealth care for many of the low-income and uninsured through the \nMedicaid program. Decisions on Medicaid funding involve issues of \nfairness and balance, and it is our responsibility to balance these \nconcerns on both the spending and revenue sides of the ledger.\n  I believe in fiscal responsibility, and I believe that reducing the \ndeficit is critical for our Nation's fiscal health. We should not pass \ndown a legacy of debt to our children. At the same time, we should do \nno less than to meet our obligations to our uninsured children and \ntheir families, senior citizens, and individuals with disabilities.\n  My home State of Maine is a relatively poor state which relies \nheavily on Medicaid matching funds. Maine's Federal match is roughly 65 \npercent, compared to the national average of about 57 percent. This \nmeans that for every dollar in State funds spent on Medicaid, the State \nreceives nearly $2 in Federal matching funds. Of the $7.7 billion spent \non health care in Maine in 2004, $2 billion--26 percent--came from the \nMaineCare program. Of the $2 billion in Medicaid spending, nearly two-\nthirds, or $1.4 billion, came from Federal Medicaid dollars.\n  Maine has suffered disproportionately from a loss of manufacturing \njobs--and the health insurance coverage that goes with them. Medicaid \nhas helped cover those uninsured, allowing our overall rate of \nuninsurance in Maine to stay even or improve for those with income \nbelow 200 percent of the poverty level.\n  Medicaid is also an essential program for providing health services \nto children and other vulnerable populations Children are nearly half--\n44 percent--of Maine's Medicaid clients yet they require less than one \nquarter of the funding, clearly a very cost-effective use of our health \ncare dollars. Children need access to health care to do well in school, \nand to do well in life, and Medicaid plays a key role in narrowing the \n``achievement gap.'' Children who are\n\n[[Page S2802]]\n\nin pain, or sick, are not able to pay attention and learn, and those \nwith untreated illnesses can develop long-term disabilities, such as \nhearing impairments, that require expensive special education and make \nit harder for them to do well in school.\n  It is crucial that we continue to provide sufficient Federal funding \nfor Medicaid, a program which has worked extremely well since it began \nproviding care for some of our most vulnerable populations 40 years \nago. That's why I believe we must proceed cautiously before making \nsignificant changes that could damage the program.\n  As we debate the budget resolution and consider the instructions for \nspending cuts that the Finance Committee would be required to produce--\nwith Medicaid squarely in its sights--we must recognize that the \nFederal Government cannot simply abandon its responsibility to help \nstates provide health care to our most vulnerable citizens. Finding \nworkable solutions on the financial sustainability of Medicaid will \ntake time, expertise, and bipartisan consensus and are more \nappropriately the province of a bipartisan medicaid commission than a \nbudget debate.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, how much time do both sides have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 24 minutes 40 seconds. The \nSenator from Wisconsin has 14 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have had this debate before. Here we go \nagain. I think it is an important debate and we need to think very \ncarefully about it. I certainly agree with Senator Feingold and Senator \nVoinovich that Congress has been spending money recklessly over the \npast few years. We need to restore fiscal discipline. Unfortunately, \nthis amendment does very little to address that problem.\n  I cannot help but remember that during the late nineties and the \nearly part of this century, we had a balanced budget for 4 years. We \nactually had surpluses. How did that happen? There was some fiscal \nresponsibility. We forced President Clinton to join us in a balanced \nbudget amendment in 1997. But we also cut taxes in a way that \nencouraged growth in the economy. We grew bigger.\n  That is one thing you need to think about. The economy is showing \ngrowth. It was pretty fragile last year, but it continues to show \npositive signs in terms of production, and unemployment is at 5.4 \npercent. It should be headed the other way. More people are being \nhired. There are positives in the economy. I talked to the experts \nabout how did that happen. Part of it happened because we did tax cuts \nwhere we let people keep more of their money instead of bringing it to \nthis city and wasting it. We encouraged growth in the economy. We \nencouraged family tax relief, families with children, research and \ndevelopment, we cut taxes on dividends. We took some actions that made \na huge difference. That is how we had balanced budgets and surpluses.\n  But then, for a variety of reasons, we started spending more and more \nagain. A variety of things happened. First, we got used to having \nsurpluses, so we started spending money, whether we should or should \nnot. We made commitments on Medicare and Medicaid that we should have \nmade, and then the economy started going down. Then, we had 9/11 and we \nhave had all the extra spending for the defense of our country, our \nmilitary actions in Afghanistan and Iraq, and we spent a lot of money \non homeland security. We wasted a lot of it, in my opinion. But we are \ndoing a better job and we are doing some things that had to be done. We \nare going to continue to have to spend money to try to make America \nsafe against terrorists.\n  But the combination of overspending in the beginning of the century, \na falling economy in 2000 and 2001, and 9/11, has led us to the \ndeficits we now have. One of the interesting things to me about this is \nthat the focus is on, by the way, you cannot let people keep more of \ntheir money unless you cut spending or raise taxes. The focus should be \non how we control spending. Year after year, this administration, \nprevious administrations, and we have spent more and more and more. I \nwill be glad when we get to the point where you cannot raise spending \nfor Amtrak or NIH or anything else that you don't offset in some way. \nWe need fiscal responsibility, but this is not the way to get it, in my \nopinion.\n  On the floor this week, there have been amendments offered on the \nbudget--mostly by Democrats, with the complicity of some Republicans \noccasionally--to add $50 billion more in spending--just so far. By the \ntime the smoke clears this week, there will be amendments that would \nadd probably $200 billion or who knows how much more than what the \nPresident budgeted, which is a significant budget; $843 billion is not \nchicken feed. Then you add entitlements on top of that. So we have a \nproblem.\n  Here is the real kicker. If we pass this amendment, this is really a \ntax increase. If we don't have the ability to extend some of these tax \ncuts that we already passed, we committed to the people--if you ask the \nexperts what would happen if we didn't extend these tax cuts in these \ncritical areas of capital gains and dividends, they would say: We are \nnot worried about that. We have factored that into our economic \nthinking. You are going to do that.\n  Well, could we get 60 votes for it? Are we going to do that? Can we \nbe assured we are going to get that accomplished? This would lead to \ntax increases of $70 billion on working Americans and families with \nchildren. That is why I cannot support it. You might say, well, I can \ngo down the list and say one after the other to my colleagues on both \nsides, Do you think we ought to do something about the AMT tax relief \nproblem, the fact that 9 million Americans are being forced into higher \ntax brackets because of the AMT that we got into years ago?\n  Do my colleagues think we should not address that? Why, the Senator \nfrom Ohio would say, we are going to have to do that; why, absolutely \nwe are going to do that, and we should do that.\n  Does this mean we should not have money for the tax extenders for \nsuch things as R tax credit, the work opportunity tax credit which \nhelps business employ millions of Americans who might not be employed \notherwise? Oh, no, everybody says, no, I am for that.\n  Does this mean my colleagues do not want dollars for small business \nexpensing, which is really a tax increase on small businesses? They are \nthe ones where the jobs are really being created. That is where the \nreal entrepreneurial spirit is. But most people say: No, no, I want to \nencourage small business, so I would want to extend that.\n  What about capital gains and dividends? Well, I guess some people in \nthe Senate might say: I do not want to do that; that is the middle \nincome or upper income people. Tell that to the millions of Americans \nnow who do receive dividends, and they are not wealthy Americans, \neither.\n  So if we do not extend these, the result is going to be we are going \nto have a tax increase on millions of these working Americans. It would \nhave a devastating effect on the economic growth that we are \nencouraging. There would be fewer jobs and even more dependency on the \nGovernment.\n  I have watched it over the years in my own State. Year after year we \nwere one of the poorest States in the Nation. We thought we could spend \nour way out of poverty. We were not in debt because we had a \nconstitutional amendment that said we could not do it. So we kept \ntrying to spread money out to people, saying that if we keep supporting \neverybody--one-quarter of the entire population in my State is on \nMedicaid. Finally, a few years ago, we said: Wait, we are not going to \nbe able to spend our way out of being the poorest State in the Nation. \nWe are going to have to take some aggressive action to have better \nquality education, better infrastructure. We are going to have to go \nout there and create jobs, solicit jobs. We are going to have to have \ntax reform. We are going to have to cut taxes.\n  What has happened? We are creating jobs. We are not the poorest State \nin the Nation anymore. We are glad to give that title to another State, \nmaybe South Dakota, West Virginia, or Arkansas. They can fight over \nthat title.\n\n[[Page S2803]]\n\nWe do not want it. We finally got up off our knees and said: We are \ntired of being poor. We want to grow the economy. We want our people to \nhave an opportunity to get a good education, have jobs, and create \njobs.\n  That is why we have Nissan, Textron, International Harvester, and \nFedEx in my State. Northrop Grumman has two different new plants in my \nState to build unmanned aerial vehicles. That is why Lockheed Martin, \nBoeing, and Eurocopter, and now the newest steel mill in America is in \nMississippi, because we quit trying to spend our way out of poverty. We \nstarted trying to figure out ways to attract people and create jobs and \nallow people to make more money, have a decent paying job, and keep \nmore of their own money. Yes, we cut taxes, and we started growing. \nHallelujah. We also had tort reform to get these frivolous class action \nlawsuits under control.\n  So that is why I think this is totally wrongheaded, goes absolutely \nin the wrong direction. I hope my colleagues will not fall into this \ntrap. The Finance Committee would have to come up with at least $30 \nbillion probably in revenue raisers over the next 5 years to cover \ndealing with these tax provisions. We would not really be getting \nanything for it in return.\n\n  Chairman Grassley tells us that if we had to come up with this $30 \nbillion, it would basically max us out because that is the bare minimum \nwe need to prevent a tax increase on Americans without looking at what \nwe need to have some growth in the economy and help working families in \nAmerica.\n  This is a responsible budget that we have come up with. We should not \nput this provision in it. Let me understand this. We want to discourage \ntax cuts on working people being able to keep their money, and instead \nwe want to force tax increases and spending cuts? I like the spending \ncuts idea. That is the only part I really heard that I like, but we \nneed to think about what we are doing.\n  Finally, maybe we can begin to top out this spending orgy that we \nhave been involved in and begin to come down. By the way, everybody on \nthe floor, we are all screaming and hollering: Oh, my goodness, you do \nnot mean agriculture, do you? Oh, wait, you are talking about some of \nour beloved education programs? No, we did not mean that. You do not \nhave money for Amtrak, you do not have enough money for shipbuilding, \nyou do not have enough money for highways?\n  Everybody ought to have to ante up a little bit. The problem is not \ntax cuts and tax relief for working Americans and families with \nchildren; the problem is we cannot control our insatiable appetite for \nspending.\n  By the way, I acknowledge that I am guilty. I have been a \nparticipant. I tried to get more of my fair share in Mississippi \nbecause for 135 years we did not get our fair share. Why did we not get \nit? Because we did not stand up and ask for it. We did not play on the \nnational team.\n  This is not the way to go. Senator Gregg has provided leadership and \ncourage. I have been speaking against things today and over the last 2 \nweeks. I support Amtrak. I am from an agriculture State. I want more \nhighway money anyhow, anywhere, any way I can get it, but at some point \nwe have to ask, how much is enough?\n  There is an amendment to add money for NIH. I have been a part of the \nRepublican commitment over the past few years to double the spending \nfor NIH, and we have done it. Now we are being told that is not enough, \nwe need $2 billion. We need to sober up, and this resolution will help \nus do it. It is not going to be easy. We are going to have withdrawal \npains, but we need to stop spending. We need to try to find some way to \nhelp reduce this deficit by encouraging growth in the economy.\n  I urge my colleagues, vote against this so-called pay-go provision, \nand let us go with this resolution the way it was written. I hope this \ntime we can get a conference report, too, because if we do not, we are \ndoomed around here. If we cannot do these little tiny cuts, some \nminimum reforms, wait until we really have to deal with the big \nchoices. They are coming. They are coming down the road, and it is a \nMack truck. Unfortunately, the roads are not in very good shape. I hope \nit does not fall into a pothole or a bridge before it gets here.\n  We need to pass a highway bill. As much as I would like for that \nhighway bill to be $318 billion, $350 billion--we cannot come up with \nenough highway money to suit me--I am going to vote for some restraint. \nIf it is over $184 billion and it is not paid for in an appropriate \nway, I will vote to sustain a veto. We have to all do this. We talk \nabout it.\n  The Senator from North Dakota knows we need to do this. He wants to \ndo it. We have to have some help. We have to have some ``followership'' \nand courage. Now is the time to do it. This amendment is not the way to \ndo it.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am going to yield to a couple of \ncolleagues, but first I will say that the Senator from Mississippi \nindicates we need to sober up on the issue. I suggest that anybody who \nbelieves this is a responsible budget needs to sober up. In the 12 \nyears I have been here, this is the most obviously outrageous and \nirresponsible budget I have ever seen. The notion that this is a tough \nbudget that seriously addresses our deficit in the coming years is, \nfrankly, absurd. The Senator from North Dakota has done a wonderful job \nof making that point.\n  I will turn to my Republican colleagues who support this amendment \nand think it makes sense. I yield first 2 minutes to the Senator from \nOhio and then 5 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island, who has been \none of the true stalwarts on this issue and, frankly, the lead author, \nand has been with us all the way on the issue of pay-go.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I will correct the impression that my \ngood friend, the Senator from Mississippi, shared with us. The fact is \nthat this amendment would subject tax continuation to the same 60-vote \npoint of order we have for spending. In other words, why should we not \nsubject continuing tax reductions, two of which are not going to even \nbe up until 2008, to a lesser vote than we do when we are talking about \nspending more money than what the budget provides?\n  Let us apply the same standard to tax extensions that we do to trying \nto spend more money on the Senate floor. It is not a tax increase. It \nabsolutely is not. All it does is say that 51 votes can extend it. All \nwe are saying is this: If we want to do that, then subject it to the \nsame test that all of us are going to have to adhere to when someone \ntries to spend more money than what the budget provides. Fair is fair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of the \namendment offered by the Senator from Wisconsin. I support this \namendment because of my grave concern about our budget deficit. We in \nCongress have an obligation to put and keep this Nation's fiscal house \nin order. By passing this tough pay-go amendment, we can send a signal \nthat we do not intend to shirk this duty.\n  I think all of the Members of the Senate know what this amendment \ndoes. It simply imposes a budget rule that requires any new tax cuts or \nentitlement spending to be offset. If no offset exists for new tax cuts \nor entitlement spending, then 60 Senators will need to vote to override \nthe rule. In short, this amendment forces Congress to make the tough \nbudget choices. There is no doubt that we would all like to provide the \nAmerican people with more tax cuts. Many would also like to provide \nbetter and more efficient entitlement programs. Under the current \nbudget rules, we are not forced to make many, if any, difficult \ndecisions about our priorities. If we want more entitlement spending or \ntax cuts, we simply provide for them in the budget. That is no way to \nensure fiscal discipline. I wonder what effect a true pay-go rule would \nhave had on our debate regarding the new Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit. Would Congress have thought the new benefit was so important \nthat we were willing to re-prioritize and actually pay for it?\n  I have listened to distinguished Senators argue against this \namendment because the economy is showing improvement. But, the fact \nthat aspects\n\n[[Page S2804]]\n\nof the economy are improving does not mean that our Federal budget is \nin good shape. Forsaking measures that require budget discipline is the \nwrong policy. With all due respect, it is the type of thinking that got \nus into the current problem in the first place.\n  In 1990, Congress, which at that time included many of the same \nSenators here today, realized that Federal spending was out of control. \nCongressional will to control spending was not enough to put us on the \npath to fiscal responsibility. So, as part of the Omnibus Budget \nReconciliation Act of 1990 Congress enacted some tough budget \nmeasures--including pay-go. Pay-go was extended in 1993 and again in \n1997. Senators realized then that pay-go was a good idea and it was \nactually working.\n  We went from deficits and red ink ``as far as the eye can see'' in \n1990 to an actual $236 billion budget surplus in 2000. It is at this \npoint that Congress thought the need for budget discipline had ended. \nSo, when pay-go expired in 2002, it was not extended. This has led us \nto the point where we find ourselves today. In 2004, the Federal \ndeficit was $412 billion. In 5 short years, we have gone from a $236 \nbillion surplus to a $412 billion deficit.\n  Pay-go is not perfect. Congress has found, and will continue to find \nif it is included in this budget, ways to get around it. But, despite \nits flaws, it does have a proven track record. It tests policies of \nboth parties in the same way--pay for your priorities, or find 60 \nSenators willing to override the rule. This is the way it should be. At \na time when our budget is awash in red ink it only makes sense to bring \ndiscipline and accountability back to the budget process. If new tax \ncuts or entitlement spending is so important, shouldn't we be able to \nfind a way to address the costs? Including pay-go in the budget made \nsense in the 1990's, when the stock market was at historic highs and \nunemployment at historic lows, and, it makes sense today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we should follow the advice of the \nchairman of the Budget Committee on the matter before us. The chairman \nof the Budget Committee in a floor debate on June 5 of 2002 said this:\n\n       The second budget discipline, which is pay-go, essentially \n     says if you are going to add a new entitlement program or you \n     are going to cut taxes during a period, especially of \n     deficits, you must offset that event so that it becomes a \n     budget neutral event.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n     . . . if we do not do this, if we do not put back in place \n     caps and pay-go mechanisms, we will have no budget discipline \n     in this Congress and as a result we will dramatically \n     aggravate the deficit which, of course, impacts a lot of \n     important issues but especially impacts Social Security.\n\n  That is the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee in 2002, saying \npay-go ought to apply to both spending and to taxes. He was right then. \nAnd it is the right position now. Pay-go should apply to both spending \nand taxes. That is what the amendment of the Senator from Wisconsin \ndoes. It deserves our support.\n  I want to say a word about the remarks of the Senator from \nMississippi, who said it is time to get serious, it is time to get \ntough on deficits. He is right. But he is badly mistaken if he thinks \nthis budget does anything about deficits. The only thing this budget \ndoes about deficits is to make them worse.\n  This budget before us increases the deficit by $130 billion in excess \nof what would happen if we did nothing. If we just put this economy on \nautopilot, we would reduce the deficit by $130 billion compared to this \nbudget.\n  I see my colleague is holding up a chart over there that shows the \ndeficit going down. But what he ought to do is take a look at their own \nbudget document on page 5 where it reveals how much the debt increases \nif this budget passes. This is not my estimate. This is their estimate. \nIt says the debt is going to increase by over $600 billion each and \nevery year of this budget resolution.\n  This is not a budget that does anything about reducing the increases \nin the debt, except to extend budgets that explode the debt.\n  They can put up all the fancy charts they want. This one shows the \ndeficit being cut in half. The problem with it is it just leaves out \nthings. The only reason they get to a reduction in the deficit under \nthis plan is they just exclude things we all know are going to cost \nmoney.\n  I heard the Senator from Mississippi say we ought to do something \nabout the alternative minimum tax. Indeed, we should. There is not a \ndime in this budget to do it--not a dime.\n  Under pay-go, you can have any tax cut you want. You can have any \nadditional spending you want--if you pay for it or you get a \nsupermajority vote. Paying for things, that is a new idea around here. \nOur Republican friends have adopted the policy of borrow and spend, \nborrow and spend, borrow and spend. They don't want to raise the \nrevenue to cover their spending and they don't want to cut their \nspending to match the revenue they will support. Instead, they just \nwant to put it on the charge card, run up the debt, shove it off on our \nkids and wait for the roof to cave in.\n  That is a mistake. Pay-go is restoring the budget disciplines that \nworked well in the past. We ought to adopt the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin.\n  I thank the Chair and yield my time to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly against this \namendment. Really, what we are looking at is a tax increase unless this \nbudget resolution passes. In other words, what they are saying is we \nare either going to have to find further cuts--and, of course, our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle continue to oppose reductions in \nthe rate of increase of entitlement spending like Medicaid or \nMedicare--but at the same time they say, in essence, you have to pay \nfor these tax cuts. What they mean by that is you have to raise taxes \nto do so.\n  While I hate deficits as much as the next person, this budget \nactually works to reduce the Federal deficit by half, over the next 5 \nyears.\n  We are taking a constructive approach to reduction of the deficit.\n  But let me point out that over the last 21 months since the last tax \ncut, we have seen 3 million new jobs in this country. Frankly, what our \nopponents are proposing is something that would raise taxes on the \naverage American worker and kill the job creation engine that put \nAmerica back to work.\n  Finally, in the short time we have, I want to speak briefly in \nsupport of an amendment that Senator Hutchison and Senator Gregg and \nothers offered yesterday that would increase the number of Border \nPatrol agents to 1,000 per year for each of the next 5 years. Unlike \nsome other amendments, this one is actually budget neutral because we \nfind offsetting cuts to pay for it. Our security in this country ought \nto be and ought to remain our highest priority.\n  The fact is, our borders are uncontrolled and porous. While we know \nour Border Patrol agents do their job in a highly professional way with \nwhat they have, the fact is, they are underequipped and outmanned. The \nfact is, our 2,000-mile southwestern border is open game for anyone who \nwants to try to come across, notwithstanding the good work that is \nbeing done. We have a lot more to do, but we are not there yet. We need \nthe Border Patrol agents and the equipment to get it done.\n  The fact is, these porous borders not only admit people who want to \ncome to the United States and work, people for whom I have a great deal \nof compassion and sympathy, and we need to find a way to deal with that \nin a realistic way--and we will--but it also allows entry into this \ncountry of people who want to come here to kill us.\n  Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Admiral James Loy said it is no \nsecret that al-Qaida and other enemies of this country are going to try \nto take advantage of our porous borders, our lack of personnel and \nequipment to protect our borders, to try to infiltrate this country and \ncommit another heinous attack on civilians as we experienced on 9/11.\n  It is absolutely critical that the Federal Government live up to its \nresponsibility and not foist upon State governments that happen to have \nlarge\n\n[[Page S2805]]\n\nborders, such as Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and California--it is \nabsolutely essential that the Federal Government live up to its \nresponsibility.\n  Only by adequately funding Border Patrol personnel, and only by \ncontinuing to deal with the porous nature of our borders can we be \nassured that we are doing everything humanly possible to protect \nAmerica and to keep us safe.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the manager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me make a couple of comments, and then I \nthink the other side will want to close the debate. I will reserve just \na couple of minutes, if anyone else would like to speak on our side.\n  I think there is an important point that needs to be made. When we \ntalk about pay-go, outside the Senate people might wonder what in the \nheck that means. On the spending side, when we increase spending, that \nmeans we also have to find a way to offset that. We have to find a \nrevenue source or we have to cut spending somewhere else. So the net is \nthe same. Just like in your household budget, you are going to spend \nmoney in one area, and you have to reduce the spending in another area \nso you can get back to even. That makes a lot of sense. But paying on \nthe tax cut side is totally different.\n  Who pays to make up the lost revenue to the Federal Government? \nTaxpayers. So it is real easy for Senators to say, well, the taxpayers \nhave to pay more money. But that is not right. It is their money. It is \nnot ours. The Federal Government doesn't own any of that money.\n  When we make a deliberate decision to reduce taxes, our point is to \nlet people keep more of their own money. It is not to have some new \nrule come in here and say, but however much you let people keep, you \nhave to take from them some other way because the Government needs all \nof that money.\n  We are talking about the budget deficit. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, which is the entity that does the scoring \naround here, under the assumptions of this budget, the green line is \nthe deficit. You see it going from 2005, 3.2 percent of our gross \ndomestic product, down to 2.8, 2.2, and 1.8. In less than 5 years, we \ncut the budget deficit in half. Those are under the assumptions that \ninclude the tax cuts that we passed in 2001 and 2003. We are going to \nreduce the deficit with the tax cuts in place.\n  What our colleagues on the other side are saying is, No, we have to \nlet those tax cuts expire, creating the biggest tax increase in the \nhistory of this country because otherwise it won't be fair to the \nFederal Government. My concern is that we be fair to the taxpayers of \nthis country. This budget assumes the tax cuts we want to continue, and \nthat is the right way for us to budget. That is what the budget \nassumes, that is why we should adopt the budget, and that is why we \nshould reject the amendment that has been offered by the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, the \ntime will be charged to both sides.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me respond to two other issues that have \nbeen raised by the proponents of the Feingold amendment. One was that \nthese are the same rules we had back in the 1990s. The fact is, though, \nthey didn't work the same way. In the 1990s, Congress passed spending \nincreases, and we also passed some tax cuts. The result of that under \nthe rule was we were supposed to sequester or to spread those spending \nincreases and tax cuts out over the remainder of the budget at the end \nof the year. But it turned out that at the end of each year we passed a \nbill that said forget about it, and the President signed that into law.\n  The fact is, while the rule was in place, we violated that rule. We \ncannot say this is the same rule we have had forever.\n  Second, my colleagues, particularly the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, made the point that there are a lot of things people on both \nsides of the aisle would like to accomplish this year that they will \nnot be able to do if the Feingold amendment is agreed to.\n  We are not going to be able to do the leasehold improvement \ndepreciation, by the way, which is a great idea. The Senator from North \nDakota sponsored the bill, S. 621, to make the 15-year life for \nqualified leasehold improvements permanent. I cosponsored that bill.\n  We are not going to be able to accomplish that, if this pay-go rule \nis adopted.\n  There are other things we wouldn't be able to do, such as the R tax \ncut. The cost of that is $7 billion over 5 years. In fact, to extend \nthe R tax credit for 1 year, just through 2006, is almost $7 billion.\n  There are simply not enough loopholes to close or revenue to generate \nin order to pay for that.\n  The small business spending, so-called section 179 spending, allows \nsmall businesses to elect to deduct all or part of the cost of certain \nqualifying property in the year that it is placed in service instead of \nover a specified recovery period. This immediate extension has been \ncritical to supporting economic growth and job creation by small \nbusinesses. They will not be able to do it.\n  By the way, the cost of that is over $10 billion over 5 years.\n  The AMT relief we talked about before, there is enough within the \nbudget to do some relief on AMT if we want to do it. Most of us would \nlike to do that. We wouldn't be able to do it under the pay-go rule.\n  The State sales tax deduction that the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee mentioned, the line deduction for college tuition costs, the \nwelfare-to-work and work opportunity tax credit--if you want to do \nthose things this year, you have to vote against the Feingold pay-go \namendment because we wouldn't be able to do that.\n  Not only is it important to keep the economic growth going by \nensuring that we don't suffer the worst tax increase in the history of \nthis country, if we are going to continue some of these tax policies \nthat all of us would like to see extended, we are not going to be able \nto do it if we adopt the Feingold amendment.\n  I encourage my colleagues to appreciate that every one of us wants to \nensure that we have the smallest deficit possible. Under this budget \nand under the President's budget, we are going to cut the deficit in \nhalf within 5 years. The chart I showed a moment ago demonstrates that. \nThose are the budget figures. Those are not made up. Those are the CBO \nnumbers.\n\n  As a result, if we stay on this path, we are going to achieve deficit \nreduction. Part of the reason for that is because we assume the tax \ncuts are permanent. We assume they will continue to generate job \ncreation, economic growth, more wealth in this country which, when \ntaxed even at the lower rates than currently exist, produces more \nrevenue.\n  I hope my colleagues will not get into this notion that somehow all \nof the money belongs to the Government and if we are ever going to give \nit back to the people, we have to have 60 votes to do that instead of a \nmere majority vote. The reason we let people keep more of their money \nin the way of tax cuts is because we understand not only is that the \nright thing to do, but it is the most important thing for the economy. \nWe cannot have a rule around here that you can never have a tax cut, \nyou always have to make the money up some other way, so you never can \nchange the amount of taxes paid by the American public. We have put in \nplace a rule that would be grossly unfair as well as unwise in terms of \neconomic recovery and, as I said, unwise in wanting more revenue to be \ncollected by the Federal Government because a smaller economy produces \nless revenue to be taxed.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Feingold amendment.\n  I yield back any time that remains on this side.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. First, let me ask Senator Carper of Delaware be added \nas the 13th sponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is false as speaker after speaker \nclaims this pay-as-you-go rule prevents tax cuts. It is an absolute red \nherring. That is not what it does.\n  It says, if we are going to do additional tax cuts, either pay for \nit--and you do not have to pay for it through tax increases, you can \npay for it with tax increases or spending cuts--or get 60 votes to \nallow it.\n\n[[Page S2806]]\n\n  How can speaker after speaker come out and say this requirement of 60 \nvotes to go beyond the budget is preventing a tax cut? That is not the \nfact of what has happened.\n  In 1997, under these very rules, significant tax cuts were enacted.\n  I correct the Senator from Arizona regarding his statement that the \nrule was different then. That is untrue. He was talking about the \nstatute. This is the rule. It does not have sequestering. That is \nsimply inaccurate.\n  Last year, when the question was, Do we continue the middle-class tax \ncuts, we voted on it, and I think it got 90 votes for the middle-class \ntax cuts, well over 30 votes over the 60-vote requirement. How can \nsomeone say a rule of 60 votes for tax cuts somehow prevents tax cuts.\n  The Senator from Mississippi talks about the need to deal with the \nalternative minimum tax. He is absolutely right. The Senator from North \nDakota has pointed out that is critical for middle-income families. How \nmany votes do you think that would get? Do you think it would be close? \nDo you think you would get 50 or 55 votes? That would get 90 or 100 \nvotes.\n  There is no barrier whatever in this pay-go rule to tax cuts as long \nas you get enough votes or, better yet, if you pay for it.\n  What has happened in the leadership on the other side is they have \nbecome openly hostile to fiscal discipline; openly hostile to balancing \nthe budget; openly hostile to anything that gets in the way of tax cuts \nregardless of what the consequences are for our budget and our economy. \nThat is a sad moment. To paraphrase an old song, ``where have all the \ndeficit hawks gone.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it is now our plan to vote on four items in \nthe following sequence: The first will be Senator Feingold's amendment \non pay-go; the second will be Senator Ensign's amendment on veterans; \nthe third will be Senators Murray and Akaka on veterans; and the fourth \nwill be Senator Specter on NIH education. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe time will run during the pendency of those votes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and nays be \ndeemed to have been ordered on all four amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been previously ordered \non the Specter amendment.\n  Is there objection to ordering the yeas and nays on all three en \nbloc?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I shall \nnot object, I just want to make sure we have a couple of refinements to \nthis. If we could; one, give people 2 minutes equally divided to \ndescribe their amendment before the vote; second, that after the first \nvote, the subsequent votes be 10-minute votes. And can we send a very \nclear signal to our colleagues. Some colleagues have been missing \nvotes. We have to ask people to stay in the Chamber. Cast your vote. \nMake sure you do not miss a vote. Let's try to get these votes off \nquickly.\n  We have had a couple of votes that took 28 minutes. That just slows \ndown the process for everybody. We should make our colleagues \nunderstand that at this moment we have 150 amendments that have been \nnoticed to the leaders--150 between the two sides. At three votes an \nhour, that would be 50 hours of straight voting.\n  Now, if we want to subject ourselves and our colleagues to that, we \nwill just stay on the current course. If, instead, we want to bring \nsome discipline and some order, then we have to agree to a series of \nshort time limits on votes.\n  What we would like to do is try to conclude work on the budget \nresolution by some reasonable hour tomorrow night, like maybe 10 \no'clock tomorrow night. That could be done, but it is only going to \nhappen if people cooperate. It is only going to happen if we show some \ndiscipline.\n  I urge my colleagues, if you sent a notice that you have an \namendment, please, if there are amendments that are on a similar topic, \njoin with others. Let's try to remove a substantial number of these \namendments so that we can conclude at some reasonable time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me enthusiastically second the fine \ncomments of the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on the floor right now we have the \nRepublican leader, the Democratic leader, and the managers of the bill. \nWhat we have said is absolutely critical. We have the opportunity--but \nit is going to be very difficult and challenging to do--to complete \nthis bill at a reasonable hour tomorrow night. But it is going to take \nthe absolute discipline and cooperation of our colleagues.\n  Right now what that means is the next vote is going to be a 15-minute \nvote, but thereafter in this series of votes they will be 10 minutes, \nand we will be cutting the votes off. Therefore, stay in the Chamber. \nWith that, we are going to be able to finish this bill at a reasonable \ntime tomorrow night. Each time--even after 25 minutes we have been \ncutting off the votes--people complain, saying: You shouldn't be \ncutting off the votes.\n  The message being sent from the leadership of both sides of the aisle \nand the managers is: We are going to adhere strictly to these time \nlimits.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that the request by my friend from New Hampshire be \nmodified that there be no second-degree amendments in order regarding \nthe Feingold amendment and that all votes be 10 minutes after the first \none.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 186\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n186 offered by the Senator from Wisconsin. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 50, nays 50, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 53 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--50\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Voinovich\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--50\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 186) was rejected.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 171\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes \nof debate on the Ensign amendment.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, very simply, the amendment I have offered\n\n[[Page S2807]]\n\nfor myself, Senator Craig, Senator Vitter, and Senator Hutchison \nincreases the spending for veterans medical care by $410 million.\n  The President had increased $751 million over last year's spending \nfor veterans medical care, Chairman Gregg put in an additional $40 \nmillion, and we put in an additional $410 million, which in total is a \n$1.2 billion increase for veterans medical care. We did it without \nraising taxes. We did it with no new copays for the vets, and we did \nnot increase the deficit.\n  The Murray amendment increases taxes to provide for our veterans. We \ndid it in a fiscally responsible way. We provide for our veterans. As \nmy colleagues can see, the last several years we have dramatically \nincreased spending for veterans and veterans medical care because we \nshould do it. It is the right thing to do to make sure we take care of \nthose who have sacrificed for you and me and for our freedom.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, Senator Ensign's amendment is a nice \ngesture, but we all know that a wink and a nod is not going to make the \nwaiting lines go away for the 700,000 veterans who are serving us \nhonorably today. We all know about the understaffed and overcrowded VA \nhospitals. We know about the paperwork. We know about the redtape. We \nknow our veterans are waiting for prescription drug coverage. They are \nwaiting for posttraumatic stress syndrome treatment. That is for the \nveterans who have already served.\n  On top of that, we have new veterans coming home today, and it is our \nresponsibility to make sure we do more than a gesture.

There are 2 minutes equally divided on the \nAkaka-Murray amendment.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senate is now going to consider the \nreal amendment on whether we are going to help our veterans. The \namendment we just passed was a token amount of money to help our \nveterans--laudable but nowhere near what we need. The amendment we are \nnow considering will provide the funding so the 700,000 veterans who \nare waiting will get the services they need.\n  Why do we need this? Because the number of veterans receiving \nveterans care has gone up 88 percent. Medical inflation has gone up 92 \npercent. We made a commitment to those who serve us that we will be \nthere to serve them. That is our responsibility.\n  Across this country, veterans are calling to see if we keep our \npromise to America's veterans to fund health care now. That is what \nthis amendment will do. It is our responsibility. It implies we will \nkeep the promise we made when we asked young people to serve us \noverseas, that we will be there when they come home. It is the \nresponsibility of this body, and I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, fellow Senators, you just voted to increase \nthe veterans budget by $1.2 billion. A 3.7-percent increase over last \nyear's spending meets all the service requirements, meets incoming new \nveterans out of Iraq, serves the needs of America's veterans. The \namendment you are now being asked to vote on is nearly a $3 billion \nincrease, and a major tax increase to offset it.\n  If you want to raise taxes, if you want to go way beyond what is \nnecessary to keep the quality of veterans health care alive, you should \nvote for this. But I hope you would not only serve your veterans but \nwould be fiscally responsible and wouldn't raise taxes on America's \nworking men and women, especially America's working veterans.\n  We ought not have to tax them to serve them in their health care. But \nthat is what the Akaka-Murray amendment does.\n  I ask for a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 47, nays 53, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 55 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Coleman\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--53\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 149) was rejected.\n  Mr. CRAIG.

There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Specter amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we suspend \nthat process for a second so I may make a request for a unanimous \nconsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at the conclusion of the Specter amendment, \nwhich is about to be voted on, we are going to proceed with a series of \namendments and debate. We will begin a debate for an hour, hopefully, \naround 5:10, 5:15 on a Medicaid amendment by Senator Smith. That will \nbe followed by debate from 6:15 to 7 o'clock on the Carper amendment \ndealing with reconciliation, followed by debate from 7\n\n[[Page S2808]]\n\nto 7:30 on a Wyden amendment on bargaining, followed by debate from \n7:30 to 7:45 on a Harkin amendment on education, followed by debate \nfrom 7:45 to 8:05 on a Hutchison-Ensign amendment on Border Patrol, \nfollowed by debate from 8:05 to 8:20 on a Landrieu amendment on----\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Dorgan amendment on runaway plants.\n  Mr. GREGG. Dorgan amendment on runaway plants.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. For?\n  Mr. WYDEN. For a question.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that be the order \nof the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I just heard in the cloakroom the amendment that I am \ninvolved in is the Snowe-Wyden amendment dealing with bargaining power \nwith respect to holding down the cost of prescription drugs.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is the amendment we are presuming the Senator is \ngoing to be offering.\n  Mr. WYDEN. If it would be clear so colleagues understand that my \ncolleague from Maine is the lead author of this amendment and I am her \npartner on our side. It will be the Snowe-Wyden amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. All right. I will identify that from 7 to 7:30 the Snowe-\nWyden amendment on bargaining relative to Medicare will be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator's request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. At the end of this time, we will determine whether we are \ngoing to vote on these amendments tonight. I certainly hope we will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, might I suggest one other refinement, that \nwe agree on no second-degree amendments. That is the agreement we \nalready made between us. Maybe that would give people some comfort.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think we have to see amendments first, but I presume \nthere are going to be no second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think one thing we could say to people is, to make \nclear what we are trying to do between us, the managers. We are \noperating in some ways on faith here, faith of trust between us.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. There will be no second-degree amendments. We may have a \nside by side.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If we have a situation that requires a side by side, then \nthe chairman and I will work it out so we get a side by side.\n  Mr. GREGG. Right.\n  Mr. CONRAD. All right.\n  Mr. REID. Has the unanimous consent been agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Has the unanimous consent request been approved by the \nChair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has been approved by the Chair.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 173\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators \nLincoln, Talent, and Cantwell as cosponsors of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment provides for an additional \n$1.5 billion for the National Institutes of Health. Unless this funding \nis provided, more than 400 applications will have to be rejected.\n  In 1972, President Nixon declared war on cancer, and we still have \nnot made sufficient progress. In a budget of $2.6 trillion, $28 billion \nfor NIH is not enough.\n  The amendment also adds $500 million to education which would bring \neducation up to level funding from last year. The Subcommittee for \nLabor, Health, Human Services, and Education has taken a reduction of \n$2.2 billion. When you figure in inflation, it adds up to a cut of \nabout $6, $7 billion.\n  Virtually everybody in this Chamber, if not everybody, comes to the \nsubcommittee with special requests for programs and for funding on \nmatters relating to safety, worker safety, health, and education. This \nis minimal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask for your support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask Senators to oppose this amendment. It \nis something we would all like to do, of course, but we are in a budget \ncrunch and need to make some small decisions on restraining the rate of \ngrowth. This is one of those places where we need to start. It is \nalways nice to give away money, but $1.5 billion on a fund where we met \nour obligation to double it is not appropriate at this time.\n  On the education front, we have taken a look at all of the funding \nthat is needed. Of course, there are a lot of things we would like to \ndo. I appreciate the Senator from New Hampshire allowing us a $5 \nbillion reserve for higher education reauthorization as well as some \nobligations in the budget process.\n  This amendment uses a little different process than the rest of them. \nIt is the first amendment we have had that balances out of account 920, \nwhich means there is no money in 920. It takes money from every other \naccount and puts it in 920 so it can be used for this. So it would \nactually be stealing from every other priority you might have in the \nbudget. I ask that Members vote against it.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n173.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 63, nays 37, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 56 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--63\n\n     Akaka\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Talent\n     Thune\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--37\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     DeMint\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Smith\n     Sununu\n     Thomas\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 173) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 204\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be a \nperiod of debate equally divided until 6:15 p.m. on the Smith \namendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We are in a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, we are not in a quorum call.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if I could just alert colleagues, if we \ncould hear from Senator Lieberman's office and Senator Clinton's office \nabout their being able to discuss their amendments tonight, that would \nhelp us reach a conclusion on tonight's activities.\n  I ask Senator Gregg if it would not be wise for us to alert \ncolleagues with respect to votes tonight before we start on this hour \nof discussion?\n  Mr. GREGG. Should we go through the list?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, I think people know who is on the list. I have just \nasked Senator Lieberman's and Senator Clinton's office to get in touch\n\n[[Page S2809]]\n\nwith us if they are able to proceed tonight, which I think they are. \nWith respect to votes, if we could alert colleagues as to that, I think \nthat would be useful before this discussion starts.\n  Mr. GREGG. Certainly. It is our expectation that we will run through \nthese amendments this evening and have very vigorous debate on all of \nthem, hopefully add a couple of other amendments, Senator Lieberman and \nSenator Clinton, and on our side hopefully Senator Vitter and Senator \nAllen will speak on their amendments. As a result, we will not have any \nfurther votes this evening, but my colleagues can expect that we will \nhave a large number of votes tomorrow and plan to be here for awhile \nvoting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, it is not easy for me to come to the Senate \nfloor and propose an amendment that I know makes life difficult for my \nbudget chairman. It is not easy for me to oppose the President of the \nUnited States, Secretary Leavitt, Dr. McClellan, or all those in the \nadministration who are grappling with a budgetary tsunami approaching \nour country related to entitlements. I am brought here as a matter of \nconviction, conscience, passion, on a matter that I hold as a \nprinciple, that in good times and bad, the people we do not abandon or \nput at risk are those who are most needy in our society.\n  Twelve years ago, I first won public office as an Oregon State \nsenator. By chance, I was given a seat on the Senate Health Care and \nBioethics Committee. I went into that role knowing little about \nmedicine and its many intricacies, knowing it only as a consumer and as \na businessman trying to meet a payroll. I came to that committee at a \ntime when Oregon was leading the country in many ways as a medical \nreformer, a pioneer.\n  Oregonians are used to blazing new trails, and the Oregon trail, in \nthe spirit of my State, led to the creation of the Oregon health plan. \nThe basis of that was to take the Medicaid resources, plus State \nrevenues which we raised, to provide for the needy, the disabled, the \nchronically ill, the children of working but uninsured, preventive \nhealth medicine, and the most medical care available for the dollars \navailable.\n  In the course of my service on that committee, I came to know quite a \nbit about Medicaid and about the plan that Oregon was developing. It \nhas been with some consternation that I have watched, during the recent \nrecession, Medicaid budgets all over this country pushed to extremes, \nand for that reason I was one of the Republicans on the Finance \nCommittee last Congress to precondition my vote for tax relief with \nrelief to the States to help try to find a bandaid so that we do not \ntake the most vulnerable of our citizens, push them out of nursing \nhomes, deny them the basic vaccines of preventive medicine, take the \nchronically ill and particularly the mentally ill whose lives are often \nimperiled at their own hands, and put them in a position where their \nonly recourse is the emergency rooms of our hospitals, where the care \nmight be well meaning but the outcome is least effective, and the costs \nincurred then are shifted on to the plans of private employers, further \nmaking it difficult to expand health care and provide for the \nuninsured. So we grow the uninsured population at the expense of the \nprivate sector.\n\n  I speak to this from personal experience--trying to meet a payroll \nthat provides health care that is growing at unsustainable rates.\n  Now comes along a proposal in this budget from men I care for and \nadmire, for whom I have deep personal affection, and I understand that \nMedicaid is a $300 billion annual bill. I understand that in the course \nof the next decade it is going to double. I also understand some States \ngame the system. I understand wealthy people transfer their assets to \ntheir kids so they can get $60,000 in Medicaid in a nursing home at our \nexpense. I understand there are all kinds of abuses. I am committed to \nMedicaid reform. But what I am not prepared to do is to put the budget \nahead of the policy, and that is what is going to happen if this budget \ncontains this provision.\n  I already mentioned 60,000 Oregonians--Medicaid recipients under the \nOregon health plan--already lost their coverage last year. Who are \nthey? They are the most vulnerable Oregonians, with a few exceptions of \nthose who defraud the system. They are people who have no other \nrecourse. So when it comes to saying to this Senator, let us just close \nour eyes, hold our nose, and vote for this budget, it will be okay, \nthere will be an agreement with the Governors, I have talked to the \nGovernors. There is less unity on this issue among them than there is \namong us. Most of them do not know where they are going to go, except \nto push people into the ranks of the uninsured. What that means is \nprivate insurers, employers, will continue to withdraw health care \ncoverage from employees. About 3 percent a year do that. And the \nMedicaid rolls will grow by 3 or 3.5 percent.\n\n  I have to say again publicly, I know President Bush's heart. I know \nGovernor Leavitt. I know Dr. McClellan. These are good men. I know they \ndo not mean ill to these people. But I have no assurance that ill will \nnot occur to these people.\n  Some say we are just slowing the rate of growth. I agree. We will get \nthe reform. But I would rather do this right than do this fast. I \nbelieve, given that we have not had a serious Medicaid commission since \nits creation in 1965, that we ought to have one so that the policy \ndetermines the budget. I don't know whether the proposed $14 billion \ncut is too large or too small. Maybe it is too small. But I don't know \nthat. And I don't know where the $14 billion came from. But I know what \nit is going to mean: Another 60,000 Oregonians maybe losing health \ncare, pressuring private plans, overwhelming emergency rooms.\n  I would rather let the policy determine the budget. I pled with my \nleader, whom I want to sustain, to create this commission, but take \nthis number out of reconciliation. Put in there a number that puts \npressure on the commission to do its job before our next budget cycle \nso we in the Finance Committee can respond quickly to the ideas that \nthey agree upon and we can get working on this, making reforms that \neveryone can agree with. But I can't in good conscience vote aye and \nwatch what happens, because I have seen what happens.\n  I plead with my colleagues, Republican and Democrat alike, to do this \nright and not just fast. We can do it right. We can help to mitigate \nthis entitlement tsunami, and we can weed out the waste, the fraud, the \nabuse, the gaming of Medicaid. But we can do it with an eye to those \nwho it is designed to serve. They are the elderly in nursing homes; \nthey are the children of the working uninsured; they are the \nchronically ill, those too poor to deal with cancer, HIV/AIDS. They are \nthe disabled.\n  I think if we are going to say Medicaid is off the table--I didn't do \nthat. They said Medicaid is off the table; no touching it. That is \nfine. Social Security is all in the fight here. So let's go to the only \nthing that is left, and that is the most vulnerable Americans. I am \nsimply saying: Not so fast and not in a way that will do real human \ndamage to people who cannot fend for themselves.\n  What do I do with this commission? The commission consists of the \nfollowing: It will establish a panel of 23 members: One member \nappointed by the President; two House Members, current or former, \nappointed by the Speaker and minority leader; two Senators, current or \nformer, appointed by the majority leader and minority leader; two \nGovernors, designated by the NGA; two legislators designated by NCSL; \ntwo State Medicaid directors designated by NASMD; two local elected \nofficials appointed by NACo; two consumer advocates appointed by \ncongressional leadership; four providers appointed by congressional \nleadership; two program experts appointed by the Comptroller General. \nThey will have, hopefully in this budget cycle with other budgetary \npressures that are already on Medicaid, all the impetus in the world to \nfix this program. But to include these people.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed a list I have of over 130 \norganizations that support the Smith-Bingaman amendment that are \nscratching their heads about what this means in human terms if we do \nnot do this right.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2810]]\n\n                                                   March 14, 2005.\n     Senator Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith and Bingaman: We, the undersigned \n     organizations, strongly endorse the Smith-Bingaman amendment \n     to the Senate fiscal year 2006 Budget Resolution, which would \n     strike all Medicaid cuts. The elimination of such cuts is \n     essential for the health care of Medicaid enrollees, the \n     providers who serve them, and state and local units of \n     governments.\n       We understand that the Senators' amendment will include the \n     creation of a bipartisan commission in lieu of all cuts to \n     consider the future efficient and effective operation of the \n     Medicaid program. Medicaid is the essential source of health \n     access for 53 million of our nation's most vulnerable \n     citizens, and any changes to the program should be driven by \n     policy and not by arbitrary cuts.\n           Sincerely,\n       AFL-CIO, AIDS Action, AIDS Alliance for Children, Youth & \n     Families, Alliance for Children and Families, Alliance for \n     Retired Americans,

They will come up with long-term goals. They will \ndetermine the populations that should be served and which ones should \nnot. There will be financial sustainability in their work product, \ninteraction with Medicare and the safety net providers. How about the \ndual eligibles? I don't have the answer to those things. That is why \nthis amendment is so important. They will talk about quality of care \nand any other matter of importance to this program.\n  I heard from my friend, Mike Leavitt, that HHS currently deals with \nover 2,000 waiver requests from the States every year--2,000. Those \nprobably represent 2,000 really good ideas. If they are out there, \nlet's put them down, weed them out, take the best, leave the rest, and \ncome up with a program that learns from the laboratory of all the \nStates, from all these waivers; find the efficiencies, get the \ntechnologies in there, determine the populations to be served. But \nlet's do it right; let's not do it fast. Let's let the policy drive the \nbudget.\n  When we look at all the spending we do around here, and a tough \nbudget we already are voting over and over on--and I am determined to \nsupport my leadership on this budget--I am determined that we not leave \nout these most vulnerable Americans or do it in a way that in any way \ndiscounts their vulnerability and the inevitable cost shifts to the \nprivate sector that is already overburdened.\n  I have said it enough. I will be quiet, now, with this plea: Please \nvote for this amendment, the Smith-Bingaman amendment. It may well be a \nmatter of life and death for thousands of Americans.\n  I am pleased to be joined on the floor, not just by my cosponsor, but \nalso by the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Coleman, and yield to him such \ntime as he needs.\n  I ask him to yield then to Senator Bingaman.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, first, I am pleased to rise in support of \nthe amendment offered by my colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, as \nwell as Senator Bingaman. I appreciate the challenges faced by the \nBudget Committee. Finances are tight. Tough decisions have to be made. \nWe understand that.\n  My dad is a carpenter. He builds with his hands. He is very good at \nit. I think in this case I am not so good and I think greatness skipped \na generation. But my dad builds with his hands. Early on he tried to \nteach me: Measure twice before we cut once.\n  Medicaid is the Nation's single largest payer of children's health \nservices. Medicaid accounts, on average, for nearly 50 percent of the \npatient care revenue in children's hospitals. One out of every four \nchildren in the United States relies upon Medicaid for health coverage. \nIt is an essential partner in providing high quality care to all \nchildren.\n  Before we start restructuring or talk about cutting growth--which is \nwhat my colleagues who support the chairman's mark will say, that we \nare just cutting growth--I suggest that we measure twice and cut once.\n  Medicaid is a safety net program that is intended, as my colleague \nfrom Oregon talked about, to protect vulnerable children as well as \nadults struggling with severe chronic illness and disabilities and \nmental illness. I suggest we need to measure twice and cut once.\n  Minnesota's Medicaid Program is the largest health care program, \nproviding\n\n[[Page S2811]]\n\ncoverage for a monthly average of 464,000 low-income seniors, children, \nfamilies, and people with disabilities. Families, children, and \npregnant women make up the largest group, 69 percent, but only capped \nat 22 percent of expenditures. The majority of expenditures, more than \n78 percent, are for people who are elderly or have a disability.\n  As I said, let us measure twice and cut once. What we are proposing \nis simply a commonsense approach to carefully consider an action of \nthis magnitude before we are committed to it. With the commission, we \nstand a much better chance of doing the right thing, in the right way, \nwith broad support.\n  Let us sit down at the table with all the stakeholders and together \ndecide how to make Medicaid better.\n  We pride ourselves on being the world's greatest deliberative body. \nYet today we are faced with the proposal that will substantially change \nand provide funding limitations impacting, as my colleague from Oregon \nsaid, the most vulnerable of Americans, the most vulnerable among us, \nand we are doing it without the kind of rigorous examination that this \nbody should demand, should cry out for.\n  This amendment simply provides that kind of rigorous, vigorous \nexamination--a years's worth--saying step back for 1 year, then put \ntogether a process that allows us to do the examination, deliberation, \nallow the commission to hold public hearings, conduct examination, \nissue its report and recommendations to the President and to the \nCongress and the public.\n  Let us do Medicaid reform. We need to do it. We need to get rid of \nthe gaming. We need to get rid of those who are abusing the system. We \nneed to cut the waste and the fraud, but let us do it in a way which \nensures that any changes to Medicaid provide sustainability, promote \naccess to health care, and doesn't hurt those who need the program the \nmost.\n  Let us look before we leap. We need to look at Medicaid to be sure we \nare on solid ground.\n  I appreciate the tough challenges the Budget Committee is facing. I \nhave deep respect for Chairman Gregg. He has a great heart. He wants \nthe program to work. The chairman's mark is substantially better from \nwhere we began with this proposal.\n  Again, let us do the kind of review that needs to be done.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment and establish a \nMedicaid commission to study this proposal before we act.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this thoughtful amendment.\n  I yield to my colleague who is a coauthor of the amendment, Senator \nBingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 204\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. I \nsend the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for Mr. Smith \n     himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Baucus, Mr. DeWine, \n     Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Chafee, proposes an amendment numbered \n     204.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To create a reserve fund for the establishment of a \n Bipartisan Medicaid Commission to consider and recommend appropriate \nreforms to the Medicaid program, and to strike Medicaid cuts to protect \n                   states and vulnerable populations)\n\n       On page 4, line 7, increase the amount by $1,784,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 8, increase the amount by $2,479,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 9, increase the amount by $3,252,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 10, increase the amount by $3,589,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 11, increase the amount by $3,932,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 16, increase the amount by $1,784,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 17, increase the amount by $2,479,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 18, increase the amount by $3,252,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 19, increase the amount by $3,589,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 20, increase the amount by $3,932,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 16, increase the amount by $1,784,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 17, increase the amount by $1,784,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 20, increase the amount by $2,479,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 21, increase the amount by $2,479,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 24, increase the amount by $3,252,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 25, increase the amount by $3,252,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 3, increase the amount by $3,589,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 4, increase the amount by $3,589,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 7, increase the amount by $3,932,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 8, increase the amount by $3,932,000,000.\n       On page 29, strike beginning with line 23 and all that \n     follows through page 30, line 3.\n       On page 40, after line 8 insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . RESERVE FUND FOR THE BIPARTISAN MEDICAID COMMISSION\n\n       In the Senate, the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget \n     shall revise the aggregates, functional totals, allocations, \n     levels in section 404 of this resolution, and other \n     appropriate levels and limits for fiscal year 2006 and for \n     the period of fiscal years 2006 through 2010 by up to \n     $1,500,000 in new budget authority for 2006 and the amounts \n     of outlays flowing therefrom for an appropriations bill, \n     amendment, or conference report that provides funding for \n     legislation reported by the Senate Finance Committee \n     authorizing and creating a 23 member, bipartisan Commission \n     that--\n       (1) is charged with\n       (A) reviewing and making recommendations within one year \n     with respect to the long-term goals, populations served, \n     financial sustainability, interaction with Medicare and \n     safety-net providers, quality of care provided, and such \n     other matters relating to the effective operation of the \n     Medicaid program as the Commission deems appropriate.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is being proposed by \nSenator Smith and myself, Senator Coleman, Senator Baucus, and other \ncosponsors who are listed on the amendment.\n  I wanted to start by commending my colleague from Oregon for his \nleadership on this very important issue. He has made the exact, right \npoints. I will be brief in my comments because other Senators are here \nwishing to speak as well. I want to give them an opportunity to do so.\n  Medicaid is the most important program that pays for health care \ncoverage in my State today. There are over 400,000 people in the State \nof New Mexico who receive health care because of the Medicaid Program. \nAs he pointed out, these are the people who are most in need of that \ncare, who are least able to cover their own health care costs.\n  There are 53 million of our Nation's most vulnerable children, \ndisabled, and elderly citizens that rely on Medicaid for their well-\nbeing and livelihood. And there are 45 million Americans without health \ninsurance coverage.\n  The President offered a budget proposal that added $140 billion for \nhealth care spending. Even with the proposed reductions in Medicaid \nspending, he was proposing a net increase of $80 billion for health \ncare.\n  In contrast, the budget before us provides no spending for the \nuninsured and a cut in Medicaid of $15 billion over 5 years. This is \nimportant because the administration only got a scored savings of $7.6 \nbillion in Medicaid. So, it is $140 billion short of the President's \nproposal on the uninsured and the cut for Medicaid is scored at twice \nthe level of the President's budget, according to CBO.\n  This budget is seeking to reduce the deficit, but sadly at the \nexpense of the uninsured and our Nation's most vulnerable children, \nelderly, and disabled citizens that rely on the Medicaid program.\n  As a result, I am pleased to be here today with my colleague Senator \nSmith in support of the bipartisan Smith-Bingaman-Coleman-Baucus \namendment to strike the Medicaid cuts and to replace it with a \nbipartisan Medicaid Commission.\n  Senator Smith and I strongly believe that Medicaid needs reform and \nimprovement. For years, Medicaid has been neglected. Democrats are \noften trying to push for universal coverage and neglect fixing issues \nwith Medicaid. Meanwhile, Republicans have proposed block granting the \nMedicaid program without addressing reform. Just 2 years ago, that \nproposal was defeated on the Senate floor.\n  Sadly, we are here again with a proposal to cut Medicaid, but no \nthoughts\n\n[[Page S2812]]\n\nabout how to reform and improve the Medicaid program. We are imposing \ncuts on Medicaid at twice the level the President proposed, as scored \nby CBO, with little more guidance than rhetoric about cutting ``waste \nand fraud in the system.''\n  According to the Budget Committee staff document, ``at least 34 \nStates are estimated to be receiving up to $6 billion a year in Federal \nMedicaid dollars inappropriately.''\n  Which States? I think we all deserve to know who they are and what \nthey are doing before voting to cut funding to them. In the Senate \nFinance Committee, a bipartisan group of Senators asked the Secretary \nfor that list and we still do not have it.\n  However, anybody that asks is being assured not to worry because \ntheir State is not the problem. How can we cut $15 billion to the \nStates without it seriously impacting any State or any of the 53 \nmillion people served by Medicaid? Even the best circus elephant or \ndonkey cannot pull off such a feat.\n  To get scored savings, the Finance Committee will be forced to make \nmajor cuts in funding to the States. Let me emphasize, no State is \nprotected.\n  Also, while some of the proposals have so little detail that we have \nno idea about the impact on individual States, we do know the budget \nassumes saving $1.5 billion by dropping the matching rate for targeted \ncase management in Medicaid from the current matching rate to 50 \npercent Federal and 50 percent State. Again, there is nothing about \nreform here. It is simply about cutting Federal funding to States. And, \nin this case, we do know which States, and they are the poorest States \nin this country.\n  It may come as somewhat of a shock to some in the Senate, but the \ncuts would fall disproportionately on the 28 States of Mississippi, \nMontana, Arkansas, West Virginia, New Mexico, Utah, Idaho, Louisiana, \nAlabama, South Carolina, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arizona, North Dakota, \nSouth Dakota, Tennessee, Iowa, North Carolina, Indiana, Maine, \nMissouri, Oregon, Texas, Georgia, Kansas, Ohio, Nebraska, and Florida. \nPresident Bush carried 26 of the 28 States and those States have 43 \nRepublican Senators and 13 Democratic Senators.\n  Simple mathematics tells us that will not fly in the Senate. So, two \nof the largest proposals for savings truly have nothing to do with \nMedicaid reform and one does not have enough details to allow CBO to \nprovide scored savings and the other has enough detail that we know it \nwill never be enacted.\n  So, what we have here are proposed Medicaid budget cuts in search of \na policy.\n  It is with that in mind that Senator Smith and I come to the floor \ntoday to actually attempt to reform and improve the Medicaid program in \na systematic way. Our proposal is to strike the arbitrary cuts in the \nbudget before us and replace them with the establishment of a \nbipartisan medicaid commission.\n  Why a Commission? Just like Social Security, just like the 9/11 \nCommission which examined the intelligence system, and just like \nMedicare, we believe that Medicaid deserves a comprehensive and \nthorough examination of what is working and what is not by all \nstakeholders--federal officials, state and local government officials, \nproviders, consumer representatives, and experts.\n  Medicaid is a very complicated program. In fact, it is not one \nprogram. It is really four programs.\n  First, it is a program that provides health insurance for 25 million \nlow-income children.\n  Second, it provides a safety net of coverage to 14 million adults, \nprimarily low-income working families that play by the rules and work \nbut do not have access to or cannot afford health insurance.\n  Third, 42 percent of Medicaid spending is actually for what are known \nas ``dual eligibles,'' which are over 7 million elderly and disabled \ncitizens that have both Medicare and Medicaid coverage. Therefore, \nMedicaid fills the holes in both Medicare and private insurance by \nproviding acute and long-term care services that neither Medicare or \nthe private sector is able or willing to cover.\n  And fourth, Medicaid serves as a critical payment system for our \nNation's safety net, including payments to disproportionate share \nhospitals for indigent care or to community health centers and other \nsafety net providers. Without that funding, many of these critical \ncommunity services would end.\n  Medicaid is a critically important health care safety net of four \ndifferent programs that provides services to over 50 million of our \nNation's most vulnerable children, pregnant women, the elderly, and \npeople with disabilities.\n  In New Mexico, Medicaid is, in fact, the single largest payor for \nhealth care. All told, Medicaid covers the health care costs of more \nthan 300,000 New Mexicans--nearly one-quarter of our State's \npopulation.\n  It is why I believe firmly we need to make sure that we do whatever \nwe do right rather than quick. Medicaid is the back-stop to Medicare, \nthe back-stop to private insurance, and the major funding source for \nour Nation's safety net providers. Medicaid is, as Health Affairs has \ncalled it, ``the glue that holds our Nation's health care system \ntogether.'' Therefore, we must make sure reform is done right and \nsystematically, rather than quickly and without being thought through.\n  I would like to take a few moments to emphasize the importance of \nMedicaid to our Nation's children. Again, over 25 million children \nreceive health care services through Medicaid. This includes an \nestimated 42 percent of our Nation's black children and 36 percent of \nour Nation's Hispanic children.\n  Children covered by Medicaid are far less likely than uninsured \nchildren to lack a usual source of medical care or have an unmet \nmedical, dental, or prescription drug need.\n  During the last presidential election, the President recognized that \n9 million children lacked health care coverage and made a proposal that \nhe called ``Cover The Kids.''\n  In his own words:\n\n       We'll keep our commitment to America's children by helping \n     them get a healthy start in life. I'll work with governors \n     and community leaders and religious leaders to make sure \n     every eligible child is enrolled in our government's low-\n     income health insurance program. We will not allow a lack of \n     attention, or information, to stand between millions of \n     children and the health care they need.\n\n  The President put that proposal into his budget, but I do not see it \nin this budget. We should not be going backwards on children's health, \nbut we will in this budget unless this amendment we offer today passed.\n  We should take time and ``first do not harm'' to our Nation's health \ncare safety net. We have tried to enact reform quickly before and it \nhas created many problems. For example, in the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997, Congress cut funding for disproportionate share hospitals and \nMedicare physician payments in rather indiscriminate ways. As a result, \nthe Congress has come back in 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2003 to make what \nare known as ``provider give-backs.''\n  The cumulative pages of legislation to correct the Medicare and \nMedicaid changes from 1997 now far exceed the original legislation, the \nproblems continue and, in some cases, even grow. In fact, we have a \ncrisis with Medicare physician payments that everybody acknowledges \nwill now cost billions and billions of dollars to correct.\n  Unfortunately, these ``fixes'' are not reflected in this budget, but \nwe all know that the Congress will have to address the problem. I fear \nthe budget, as currently proposed, will create more problems that need \nfixing rather than correcting the current problems.\n  Therefore, Senator Smith and I call for a process by which we can \nenact reforms to Medicaid but do it correctly, rationally, and in a \nbipartisan fashion. For example, we should ensure that people have more \naccess to home- and community-based care in Medicaid. Doing so would \nprovide care in more cost-effective and appropriate settings for many \nMedicaid patients.\n  However, despite a lot of rhetoric about how this is one of the \nreasons Medicaid needs reform, the budget proposal before us does not \naddress this problem.\n  There are those that believe Medicaid is ``flawed and inefficient'' \nand that costs are spiraling out of control so the program needs \noverhaul. On the other hand, there are those who believe there is \nabsolutely nothing wrong with Medicaid. I firmly believe neither point \nof view is correct.\n\n[[Page S2813]]\n\n  First, Medicaid is far from broken. The cost per person in Medicaid \nrose just 4.5 percent from 2000 to 2004. That compares to just over 7 \npercent in Medicare and 12.6 percent in monthly premiums for employer-\nsponsored insurance. If that is the comparison, Medicaid seems to be \nabout the most efficient health care program around, even more so than \nMedicare.\n  The overall cost of Medicaid is going up largely, not because the \nprogram is inefficient, but because more and more people find \nthemselves depending on this safety net program for their health care \nduring a recession. While nearly 5 million people lost employer \ncoverage between 2000 and 2003, Medicaid added nearly 6 million to its \nprogram. Costs rose in Medicaid precisely because it is working--and \nworking well--as our Nation's safety net health program.\n  Consequently, Medicaid now provides care to 53 million low-income \nAmericans, including nearly one-quarter of all New Mexicans.\n  On the other hand, it is also not true that Medicaid is not in need \nof improvement. The administration is rightly concerned about certain \nState efforts to ``maximize Medicaid revenues'' via ``enhanced \npayments'' to certain institutional providers. Secretary Leavitt, in a \nspeech to the World Health Care Congress on February 1, 2005, referred \nto State efforts to maximize Federal funding as ``the Seven Harmful \nHabits of Highly Desperate States.'' As a result, he called for ``an \nuncomfortable, but necessary, conversation with our funding partners, \nthe States.''\n  I would agree. However, Medicaid cuts driven by a budget \nreconciliation process is not a dialogue or conversation. It is a one-\nway mechanism for the Federal Government to impose budget cuts on the \nStates. The administration's budget calls for $60 billion in cuts to \nMedicaid over 10 years, including $34-40 billion that would directly \nharm States.\n  Where is the conversation in that? In fact, I believe the States \nwould have quite a lot to say to the Federal Government in such a \nconversation. While I do not speak for the National Governors' \nAssociation, the National Conference of State Legislatures, or the \nNational Association of Counties, some of their grievances are rather \nobvious and I share them.\n  For one, these cuts are merely a cost-shift to State and local \ngovernments that simply force State Medicaid programs to enact cuts in \ncoverage to our Nation's most vulnerable populations or require tax \nincreases to make up for the loss of Federal funding. It is pretty \nsimple. If the Federal Government cuts $15 billion out of Medicaid, New \nMexico will likely lose over $100 million in Federal funding for \nMedicaid. Either some of our State's most vulnerable citizens will lose \ncoverage or benefits, or taxpayers will be asked to pay more.\n  Governor Richardson is a pretty impressive guy, but he cannot \nmagically produce the $100 million that the Federal Government would \ncut to our State under this budget proposal.\n  Second, as figures from the Kaiser Family Foundation indicate, 42 \npercent of the costs in Medicaid are a result of services delivered to \nMedicare beneficiaries. These dual eligibles are also a major driver of \nhealth costs in Medicare and this is a prime example of where the \nFederal Government pushes costs on to Medicaid. Instead, better \ncoordination between Medicare and Medicaid could improve both programs \nand delivery of care to ``dual eligibles.'' States have been calling \nfor better coordination for years to no avail.\n  Third, for all the rhetoric about being concerned about what States \nare doing in drawing down Federal funding, we should acknowledge that \nthe Federal Government passes the buck on to States in other ways. For \nexample, in the Medicare prescription drug bill that was passed by the \nCongress in 2003, the Federal Government imposed what is referred to as \na ``clawback'' mechanism which forces the states to help pay for the \nfederally-passed Medicare prescription drug benefit. Although States \nwere expected to derive a financial windfall from the prescription drug \nbill, they are now finding that it will cost them millions of dollars \nmore annually through what is referred to as the ``clawback provision'' \nthan if the bill had never passed.\n  Furthermore, CBO estimated that States had $5.8 billion in added \nenrollment of dual eligibles in Medicaid due to what they refer to as a \n``woodworking'' effect on dual eligibles trying to sign up for the low-\nincome drug benefit discovering they are also eligible for Medicaid \nbenefits. CBO further estimated that States had $3.1 billion in new \nadministrative and other costs added by the prescription drug \nlegislation.\n  States have no ability to ``have a conversation'' with the Federal \nGovernment about the imposition of such costs on them, but they should \nand will have that ability in our bipartisan commission on Medicaid.\n  Furthermore, due to a recent rebenchmarking done by the Department of \nCommerce's Bureau of Economic Affairs with respect to the calculation \nof per capita income in the States and the application of that data by \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, the Medicaid \nFederal Medical Assistance Percentage, or FMAP, many States, including \nNew Mexico, will see a rather dramatic decline in their Federal \nMedicaid matching percentage. In fact, due to the rebenchmarking and \nother factors, 29 States will lose Medicaid funding in 2006 by an \namount of in excess of $800 million. Again, this occurred with no \ndialogue or conversation.\n  I agree with Secretary Leavitt that there should be a conversation \namong all the stakeholders about the future of Medicaid and about what \nare the fair division of responsibilities between the Federal \nGovernment, States, local governments, providers, and the over 50 \nmillion people served by Medicaid. It is for this reason that the \nbipartisan commission on Medicaid includes all of those stakeholders at \nthe table to have a full discussion and debate about the future of \nMedicaid.\n  It is our intent that the recommendations would not only be focused \non spending inefficiencies but about improving health care delivery to \nour Nation's most vulnerable citizens. However, they are not mutually \nexclusive. In fact, both can and should be done.\n  Before closing, I thank Senator Smith for his leadership on this \nissue and the over 100 organizations--State and local governments, \nproviders, and consumer groups that have endorsed this amendment. We \nhave the attention and support of all these groups to come to the table \nto make Medicaid more efficient and effective in the delivery of care \nto our Nation's most vulnerable citizens. We should not pass up that \nopportunity.\n  The policy needs to drive the budget.\n  As Senator Smith said, and as Senator Coleman said, we cannot just \ntake a figure out of the air and say we are going to cut Medicaid \nbecause we need to make up some money in the budget in order to get to \nthe number that we predetermined we ought to get to. That kind of \narbitrary cut in Medicaid, when we are doing nothing to constrain the \ngrowth of Medicare, when we are doing nothing to constrain the growth \nof spending in a lot of other areas, would be irresponsible. Exactly as \nSenator Smith pointed out, it is important that we do this right, that \nwe do this fast.\n  This first chart I wanted to point to shows the States in red which \nare going to suffer these cuts. There is $4 billion proposed for cuts \nin these States that are depicted in red on this map. It turns out that \nmost of those are the States that supported the President's reelection \nin large numbers.\n  We have a couple of other charts which I very briefly would like to \npoint out. One is a chart that points out that Medicaid is not the \ngreat inefficient program that everyone is pointing to. Medicaid has \ngrown 4.5 percent per year the last few years. Medicare has grown over \n7 percent. The private sector health care expenses have grown over 12 \npercent. There is enormous growth in Medicaid because more and more \npeople are depending on Medicaid. That is the simple point.\n  This last chart points out that 42 percent of the cost of Medicaid is \nbecause of the ``dual eligibles.'' These are people who are covered by \nMedicare, but Medicaid is having to pick up a substantial portion.\n  We need to understand these programs better before we begin cutting \nthem. The Senator from Oregon has provided a real service to us in the \nSenate by focusing attention on this.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment.\n\n[[Page S2814]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I yield time to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I appreciate the leadership that Senators \nSmith and Bingaman are showing with regard to Medicaid.\n  I rise today to speak in support of the pending bipartisan amendment \noffered by Senators Smith and Bingaman to eliminate the $15 billion in \ncuts to the Medicaid program mandated under this resolution. Instead of \nletting the budget process drive Medicaid reform, this amendment \ndirects the creation of a bipartisan Medicaid commission to investigate \nand consider possible improvements to the Medicaid program. In other \nwords, this amendment would ensure that policy drives Medicaid reform, \nnot the arbitrary and unjustified cuts in this resolution.\n  Last week Senators Wyden, Murray, Johnson and I offered a successful \namendment during markup of this resolution. The sense of the Senate we \noffered, which was agreed to unanimously by the Budget Committee and is \na part of this resolution, states that the Finance Committee shall not \nachieve any savings under reconciliation that would cap Federal \nMedicaid spending, shift Medicaid costs to the States or providers, or \nundermine the Federal guarantee of Medicaid health insurance.\n  It simply is not possible to cut $15 billion from the Medicaid \nprogram without violating this agreement. Cutting $15 billion from \nMedicaid means taking $15 billion directly from the States. It means \nthat States will be left with the tough choices of decreasing \nreimbursements to providers, eliminating services like prescription \ndrugs and specialized services for the mentally retarded for families \nand elderly who rely on Medicaid now for these services, or raising \ntaxes to preserve these services.\n  These cuts come at a time in which States are already struggling with \nthe escalating costs of the Medicaid program. In 1985, 8 percent of \nState budgets went to Medicaid. Today, on average, 22 percent of \nStates' budgets are spent on Medicaid. In New Jersey, fourteen percent \nof the State budget is spent on Medicaid. States are having to make \ntough choices about whether to cut critical health services for their \nmost vulnerable or reducing funding for education programs.\n  What this resolution says to States and the 53 million children, \npregnant women, elderly, and disabled who would be uninsured without \nMedicaid coverage is that they are simply going to have tough \ndecisions. We are in tough budget times so you are going to have to \nchoose between cutting health care or education.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues a couple of charts that \ndemonstrate the tough choices that Chairman Gregg and the President are \nasking us to make. This first chart compares the $15 billion in \nMedicaid cuts that the Chairman has assumed to balance the budget along \nwith the $204 billion cost of making the President's tax cuts for \nmillionaires permanent. These are the tough choices--preserving access \nto health care for millions of poor Americans or handing out hundreds \nof millions in taxes to the wealthiest in our country--which this \nbudget poses. Frankly, I don't think this is a tough choice. It is an \neasy one. We must preserve access to health care for our Nation's most \nvulnerable and we must maintain our Federal obligation to the States to \npay our fair share for these services.\n  I would like to point out that States are also facing massive costs \nas they work to transition their Medicaid beneficiaries who are dually \neligible for Medicare into the new Medicare prescription drug benefit. \nStates like New Jersey that have State pharmacy assistance programs for \nnon-Medicaid eligible seniors will also have to bear significant new \ncosts to ensure that these programs coordinate with the new Medicare \ndrug benefit.\n  Not only are States going to have to bear enormous costs of \ntransitioning these beneficiaries, but if they choose to provide more \ngenerous benefits than offered under the Medicare law they will have to \nfinance those benefits with State dollars. My State of New Jersey, \nwhich plans to wraparound the Medicare benefit to ensure that those on \nMedicaid have access to the prescription drugs they need, has estimated \nthat the State will spend an additional $92 million in 2005 and 2006 to \npay for these costs.\n  Now, under this resolution, New Jersey would lose $90 million a year \nin Federal Medicaid funding. How much more money is the Federal \nGovernment going to demand from the States? It is outrageous and unfair \nand it is an abdication of our Federal responsibility to force these \ncosts on the States.\n  I asked my State to tell me what kind of impact that a $90 million \nloss in Federal funding would have on New Jersey's Medicaid program. \nThe Medicaid director in my State gave me two options: the State will \neither have to eliminate health insurance for more than 20,000 low-\nincome children and pregnant women who are considered ``optional'' \nbeneficiaries because they earn just above 133 percent of the poverty \nlevel, which is $20,000 for a family of four. Or the State could \neliminate so called ``optional'' services, including dental care, \npediatric and optometric care, hearing aid services, optical \nappliances, psychological services, hospice care, and medical day care \nfor individuals with Alzheimer's and dementia. And of course, there is \na third option--increasing taxes to maintain these services.\n  We simply can't address the underlying problem of escalating health \ncare costs, which are driving up the costs of the Medicaid program, by \nasking States to cough up more money or by forcing them to eliminate \ncritical services. We need meaningful, long-term solutions that will \ncontrol health care costs across the board for Medicaid, as well as for \nMedicare and private insurance.\n  We need to change the fact that nationally 42 percent of Medicaid \nexpenditures are spent on Medicare beneficiaries. This is because \nMedicare does not provide long-term care. So when we talk about a \nMedicaid crisis, what we really should talk about is the crisis in \nlong-term care in this country. We are an aging population. As my \ngeneration retires, we will demand more long-term care services. Yet we \nhave no long-term care system in this country. As it currently stands, \nthe Medicaid program is our long-term care program.\n  The Smith-Bingaman amendment directs the creation of a bipartisan \nMedicaid commission to investigate these issues and to develop \nrecommendations on how to decrease costs in the Medicaid program \nwithout burdening States or cutting services. A commission comprised of \nmembers of congress, governors, State Medicaid directors, and \nbeneficiary advocates is necessary to develop real policies to \nstrengthen Medicaid. It simply does not make sense to pull a number out \nof thin air like this resolution does. Policy should drive the \nnumbers--not the other way around.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to adopt the sensible approach proposed \nby Senators Smith and Bingaman.\n  I don't understand how we can have a process of Medicaid reform \ndriven by budgets without thinking through where that is going to come \nfrom. We heard our other colleague talk about where the burden of those \ncuts will fall.\n  I specifically asked what would happen if the proportionate deduction \nof cuts in New Jersey were to occur, which would be by the Senate's \nversion about $90 million to the State, and the gross-up would be $180 \nmillion.\n  We are talking about Alzheimer's daycare for seniors. We are talking \nabout hospice care. We are talking about basic dental, chiropractic \ncare, hearing aids, and optical for our seniors.\n  It is impossible to understand how we want to take this hard cut \nwithout knowing the direction we are going to take.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the opponents has expired.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support the \nintelligent and responsible approach that Senators Smith and Bingaman \nproposed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I will discuss for a few minutes this \namendment and the Medicaid Program in our country.\n  I am glad I had a chance to hear the Senator from Oregon and the \nSenators\n\n[[Page S2815]]\n\nfrom Minnesota, New Jersey, and New Mexico. Their amendment would \ndirect the Finance Committee to reduce the growth of Medicaid spending \nby $14 billion over the next 5 years.\n  Before I say anything else, let me point out there is no cut--no cut, \nno cut--of any kind. Medicaid spending over the next 5 years will go up \n41 percent if left alone. The Budget Committee recommends it go up 39 \npercent instead of 41 percent. Where I come from, that is no cut; that \nis a 39-percent increase in the amount of money.\n  The amendment also has a very good idea, which is to enact a \ncommission to take a broad look at the Medicaid Program and report back \nto Congress in 1 year with its recommendations, which means in another \nyear we might get around to doing something about it.\n  The Senator from Oregon talked about the tsunami coming. He is \nexactly right. He is talking about the tsunami in mandatory spending we \nhave all been talking about and how important it is to get spending \nunder control. If I may respectfully say, I believe his position could \nbe fairly characterized as saying we heard the tsunami is coming; let's \nwait around a year or two before we get off the beach and appoint a \ncommission to study. My position is appoint the commission, but the \nprudent thing is to move to higher ground while we study all of this. \nAnd we can move to higher ground.\n  What I want to say in the next few minutes is that in order to \nrestrain the growth of Medicaid spending from 41 percent over the next \n5 years to 39 percent over the next 5 years, which is $14 billion out \nof $1.12 trillion, we know exactly what to do to do it and we should \nmove to higher ground and get going with this before we are drowned by \nthis tsunami of mandatory spending Social Security and Medicaid and \nMedicare that will make it impossible to fund preschool education, to \nfund kindergarten through 12th grade, to fund our research \nlaboratories, our research and health, and maintain the greatest \nresearch universities in the world. That is the choice we will have to \nmake.\n  We heard chilling evidence--there is no other way to talk about it--\nchilling evidence in the Budget Committee this year from the most \nnonpartisan observers, the Comptroller of the Currency, for example, \nabout the tsunami, as the Senator from Oregon discussed, and what it is \ngoing to do.\n  This chart shows all this red in Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid spending as a percentage of gross domestic product today in \nthe neighborhood of 7 or 8 percent. This is the amount of our gross \nproduct, everything we produce in the United States, that we spend on \nthe total Federal Government--a little less than 20 percent. Here is \nwhere Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security are headed. In other \nwords, we will go down the road, 2030, and it is not so long away, and \nwe will be spending 20 percent of everything we produce in the United \nStates just on health care. We are not spending that much today on the \nwhole Federal Government.\n  What the proposers of this amendment are saying is, we see this, we \nsee it is coming, let's stay on the beach another year or two and not \ndo one single, solitary thing about it except appoint a commission to \ntalk about something every Governor in States worries about. We have \ncommittees in this Congress that have studied this for years. We know \nsome things to do. We know how to take a few steps to higher ground.\n\n  Let me put a little perspective on this, if I may, for a moment. I \nask to be told when I have 10 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 minutes 46 seconds.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Let me make another point with another chart. This has \nto do with State government. I have a State perspective. Someone said, \nAlexander is still acting as though he were a Governor, and I hope he \ncan get over that. I hope I never get over it because I think it is a \ncontribution I can make from the point of view of a Governor.\n  What I struggled with as Governor was how to keep Medicaid growth \nunder control, to create centers of excellence, and pay good teachers \nmore for teaching well, and have low taxes. It was a fight every year. \nThe red is the State spending in Medicaid. People here get Medicare and \nMedicaid confused, but Medicaid is a program, as earlier said, that \nhelps many of our low-income Americans. It is administered by the State \ngovernment, but it is funded, about 60 percent or so, by the Federal \nGovernment and run by the State government. The eligibility \nrequirements are basically set up in Washington, and then you go down \nif you are the Governor and you have to run it according to what some \nCongressman decides you need to do. And then as you are running it and \nyou make some decisions, the Federal courts come in and limit what you \ndo. So you have eligibility requirements saying the caseload is going \nup 40 percent over 5 years. That is what the Governors are dealing \nwith. And the CPI, the Consumer Price Index, for health care is three \ntimes that of the normal CPI and Governors are left sitting there with \nFederal eligibility requirements, rising health care costs, and courts \nnot allowing them to make decisions, so they are stuck. I know that \nbecause I was a stuck Governor all during that time.\n  Let me point out what we are trying to say to do today. This is the \namount of money we are going to spend on Medicaid from the Federal \nGovernment in the next 5 years, $1.11 trillion. This is the reduction \nin the growth of spending we are suggesting, $13.9 billion. We are \nsuggesting instead of going up 41 percent, go up 39 percent.\n  That can be done. There are a few steps we know to do today to move \nto higher ground so we can do that while we are doing a full-fledged \nstudy of Medicare. But we cannot do it by repeating a litany of waste, \nfraud, and abuse, and better efficiency and flexibility. That will not \ncut it. We are going to have to change some laws here so Governors have \nmore flexibility and so Federal courts do not interfere as much with \nthe decisions that elected officials are supposed to make.\n  Let me make a few suggestions. I can suggest four or five steps we \ncan take now and we can move to higher ground now that would help save \nthis $14 billion so that States could serve people well while we are \ncontinuing to constrain the growth of Medicaid spending. These reforms \nwould save money for both States and the Federal Government. They would \nbe voluntary, giving the States flexibility, and they would not cut one \nperson off Medicaid insurance options.\n\n  Here are the things we can do. These are a few of the most obvious \nthings to do. We ought to be able to do them in 60 days. One, let \nMedicaid buy prescription drugs the same way Medicare does. That would \nsave money, several billion a year in the first year, but it would \nrequire a change in our Federal law. Allow States to crack down on \nMedicaid spend-out abuses when wealthier individuals give away their \nmoney with the expectation that Medicaid will cover their health care \ncosts if they become ill. We will have to change the law to permit that \nto be done.\n  Allow Governors to require copayments of benefits for optional \nMedicaid population. We require some people to be covered from here. \nStates may add to that. When they do, they should have some \nflexibility.\n  No. 4, allow States to have flexibility to allow mothers and children \nin optional programs to enroll in what we call the SCHIP Program, a \nhealth insurance program.\n  Finally, make it easier for States to provide home and community-\nbased care for beneficiaries who prefer it to more costly nursing home \ncare.\n  We have a 2-year Congress here. We are here every week, about. We are \nhere most weeks. We have lots of committees that have been studying \nthis issue for a long time. We can adopt a budget in March and we can \nhave a Finance Committee hearing and pass a law some time this year and \nwe can restrain the growth of Medicaid spending by $14 billion and give \nGovernors and States a chance to restrain the growth of spending and \nget budgets under control. That would save money here and it would save \nmoney in the States for preschool education and universities and other \nprograms that Governors prefer.\n  There is another thing we need to do. We need to pass the legislation \nSenator Pryor and I and Senator Cornyn and Senator Nelson and others \nhave introduced and Representative Cooper in the House has introduced \nthat would make it easier for Governors to run\n\n[[Page S2816]]\n\nMedicaid and harder for courts and plaintiffs' lawyers to do it. We \nshould put term limits on the outdated consent decrees that keep \nGovernors like the Democratic Governor of Tennessee from doing what he \nwas elected to do. He was elected to restrain the growth of Medicaid \nspending.\n\n  When I left the Governor's office, health care spending was 16 cents \nout of every State tax dollar, and education spending was 51 cents out \nof every tax dollar. Today, because of the growth of Medicaid spending \nin Tennessee, education is 40 cents out of every tax dollar, and health \ncare is 26 cents out of every tax dollar, and going up.\n  We will not have great colleges and universities if we do not start \ntoday to restrain the growth of Medicaid spending. So I would \nrespectfully suggest that a commission could be of some help. A \ncommission could be of some help if we were serious about it, which I \nknow its proposers are, but we are not going to be able to just move \naround the fringes. We are going to have to have a completely different \nview of health care in America. Then we are going to have to transform \nMedicare. Then we are going to have to transform Medicaid. And along \nthe way, we are going to have to do what is a relatively easy thing to \ndo compared to the other two, fix Social Security.\n  Together, those unfunded liabilities, that mandatory spending is \ngoing to grow. This red on the chart is going to grow to make this a \nnoncompetitive United States of America and drown our States in debt.\n  I suggest that it is correct that the tsunami is coming. I suggest \nthat this budget that Chairman Gregg has worked on makes only modest \nsteps in fiscal discipline. Yes, it reduces our deficit if we stay on \nthis path. By the time President Bush goes out of office, our annual \ndeficit will only be half as much as it is this year. But our debt \nstill goes up every year. Senator Conrad has made that point time after \ntime after time.\n  This is the only proposal in this budget to restrain the most \ndifficult part of spending growth, which is mandatory spending. This \nbudget overall spends $2.6 trillion for next year, $100 billion more \nthan last year. That whole $100 billion is mandatory spending.\n  So we are suggesting: Let Medicaid grow at 39 percent instead of 41 \npercent. See the tsunami coming. Appoint a commission to study it. But \ndo the prudent thing. Take a few steps to higher ground that are \nperfectly obvious while we are studying it. We can easily do that this \nyear.\n  I urge that we reject the amendment and that we support the budget \nwhich takes a modest but important step toward controlling the biggest \nchallenge we have budgetarily in Washington, DC, and that is \ncontrolling mandatory spending.\n  I see the chairman of the Finance Committee in the Chamber. I wonder \nif he would like to speak.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Ten minutes, please.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I probably will not use the full 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I have the utmost respect for the Senator from Oregon \nand the Senator from New Mexico. They are both members of the committee \nI chair. They are contributing members, very serious members of the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  They are people who care deeply about providing health care coverage \nfor our most vulnerable citizens.\n  I have listened with interest as my friend from Oregon talked with \ngreat passion about providing mental health services for these fragile \nindividuals receiving public health services.\n  I share the commitment of the Senator from Oregon and the Senator \nfrom New Mexico to providing the necessary care to individuals with \ndisabilities, our senior citizens, and mothers and their children.\n  And yet, knowing all this, I also have a concern that if their \namendment passes, we will fail to enact meaningful improvements to the \nMedicaid system. If we fail to do that, we could ultimately end up \nhurting the very same individuals for whom we show so much concern.\n  I understand that the key feature of the Smith-Bingaman amendment \nwould create a bipartisan Medicaid commission. I have said for a while \nthere needs to be a common language associated with Medicaid reform. \nRepublicans and Democrats alike do not agree even on what the word \n``reform'' means when it is applied to Medicaid. Some believe it means \ncurtailing costs. Others believe it means expanding coverage. A \nMedicaid commission could help bring us together in developing common \nthemes and ideas of needed reforms.\n\n       However, the need to make some critical changes to Medicaid \n     that would capture savings over the next few years and the \n     creation of this commission are not mutually exclusive. We \n     could have both.\n\n  If we simply let the program function in the way that it has been \nover the next few years, States will continue to be squeezed and will \nhave no choice but to begin curtailing services for the elderly and the \ndisabled. To some extent that has been happening in some States.\n  Everyone needs to realize when a State makes a decision to not serve \nMedicaid people and to save State dollars, that saves money at the \nFederal level, but that is not the wisest way to do this. The Federal \nGovernment should not be saving money because the States cannot do the \nthings they need to do. What we need to do is give the States more \nleeway on serving their people in that particular State without \nassuming that we here in Washington have all the answers.\n  Quite frankly, we would be better off working together to see what \ncould be saved, and save State dollars in an intelligent, rational way, \nand, at the same time, save Federal dollars in an intelligent, rational \nway, rather than making States do it in a crisis environment, which \nends up saving us money at the Federal level. That is why it is \nnecessary that we work together with the States to save this money. But \nyou can also set up a commission that would make long-term suggestions \non the change.\n  Now, I know that curtailing services for this class of people helped \nby Medicaid is not a scenario that Senators Smith and Bingaman want to \nsee unfold.\n  First, the Medicaid drug payment system is in significant need of \nreform. The average wholesale price system clearly overpays for drugs. \nJust as we took the average wholesale price out of Medicare in the \nMedicare bill 2 years ago, it seems to me we can and must change this \npayment system in Medicaid.\n  AWP, average wholesale price, is a flawed system, and we all know it. \nAWP is more known today as ``Ain't What's Paid,'' instead of what it \nreally meant to say, ``Average Wholesale Price.''\n  Capturing savings by making this commonsense improvement is not \ninconsistent with a commission. While there is much that we can learn \nfrom a commission, we do not need a commission to tell us that the \naverage wholesale price system of paying for drugs is flawed.\n  A recent General Accounting Office study showed that the best price \nsystem is also significantly flawed. If States are not getting the best \nprice, it costs both the Federal Government and the State governments.\n  There is another Medicaid problem that we know about, and that is a \nproposal to crack down on the schemes that are currently legal whereby \nseniors divest themselves of their assets in order to qualify for \nMedicaid.\n  Mr. President, there is a virtual cottage industry that instructs \nseniors on how to give away their homes, properties, cars, and other \nassets in order for them to qualify for Medicaid. Surely, no one would \nagree this is in the best interest of the Medicaid Program, and surely \nyou don't need a commission to tell us this.\n  The President has rightly put on the table new regulations that will \ngovern asset transfers that allow a senior to go on Medicaid for long-\nterm care. This commonsense proposal, as well, is not one that we need \na commission to make and could ultimately save dollars so States can \ncontinue to spend the money on those who cannot afford care, as opposed \nto spending money on\n\n[[Page S2817]]\n\npeople who can afford care. This would be serving the elderly and the \npersons with disabilities who are very low income.\n  While the change the President is suggesting is simple, we must, in \naddition, continue to discuss the proper role of Medicaid and long-term \ncare. The commission Senators Smith and Bingaman are proposing would be \nvery useful in that context. However, we should not let the perfect be \nthe enemy of the good. There are things we can do this year to make \nimprovements in the Medicaid Program, and we should do that.\n  We should eliminate wasteful practices and we should help States get \nthe flexibility they need to better manage their programs, saving both \nFederal and State dollars.\n  We know Medicaid's share of State budgets is growing at an \nunsustainable rate. Medicaid spending is growing so fast that it is \nbeginning to rival education as a cost in some States.\n  If we take no action this year, we will continue to put States in the \nposition of having to choose between supporting education and providing \nservices to vulnerable populations.\n  I am going to continue to work with Secretary Leavitt. He has been \nworking with a bipartisan group of Governors to identify areas of \nagreement for making changes in Medicaid.\n  I will commit the Finance Committee to a bipartisan process, where we \nkeep in mind principles that guide us in producing better Medicaid. The \nFinance Committee will look at proposals that produce shared savings \nfor the Federal Government and our State funding partners. The Finance \nCommittee will look at proposals that emphasize State flexibility \nthrough voluntary options for States. The Finance Committee will do \nthis while making a commitment not to eliminate coverage for Medicaid \nbeneficiaries.\n  But I cannot be more adamant that doing nothing has negative \nconsequences. If we don't eliminate wasteful practices, if we don't \nprovide States the necessary flexibility--and that is something the \nGovernors are asking for--and if we don't provide States relief, they \nare simply going to do what they have to do: cut people off the rolls \nin order to balance their budgets.\n  Doing nothing is far worse for Medicaid beneficiaries than a \nrational, reasoned approach to protecting and strengthening the \nprogram.\n  While I appreciate the intent of my colleagues, I must oppose the \nSmith-Bingaman amendment, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it as \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 14 seconds.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator for his commitment to work in a \nbipartisan way to create legislation that would give the States the \nflexibility they need to help people on the Medicaid Program and to \nrestrain its growth and do it in a way that saves money for States and \nthe Federal Government, that gives more flexibility, and then avoids \ncutting people off Medicaid.\n  I will sum up in this way. There is talk about fiscal discipline, \nabout reducing the deficit. This is the only significant opportunity we \nhave in this whole budget debate to reduce the growth of mandatory \nspending. What we are suggesting is, instead of letting it go up 41 \npercent, we let it go up 39 percent over 5 years. I suggest if we \ncannot do that, we cannot do anything this year, and we should not go \nhome and say we are interested in fiscal discipline.\n  I don't believe there is anybody in this Chamber who is more of a \ndefender of States than I am, but I believe that between March and \nOctober, we can take a few relatively minor steps, make a minor \nadjustment in the growth of spending, and give States important new \nflexibility.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we amend the \npending order of amendments being considered and add to the list \nSenator Lieberman, from 9 to 9:30, on a homeland security amendment; \nSenator Vitter, from 9:30 to 9:45, on a port security amendment; and \nthat at 9:45, Senator Brownback be recognized for up to 15 minutes for \ndebate purposes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Carper being here, as \nhis time is starting for a discussion on his amendment. The time on \nthese amendments is going to run. If the Members don't show up, the \ntime is still going to run. That will be their opportunity to put their \namendment down and make their point. After Senator Carper, I will note \nthat Senators Snowe and Wyden will come on at 7 o'clock and then \nSenator Harkin at 7:30, Senator Ensign and Hutchison are at 7:45, \nSenator Landrieu is at 8:05, Senator Santorum at 8:20, Senator \nVoinovich is at 8:35, Senator Dorgan is at 8:50. And we mentioned \nSenators Lieberman and Vitter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be a period of debate, equally \ndivided, until 7 p.m. on the Carper amendment.\n  The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 207\n\n       (Purpose: To provide for full consideration of tax cuts in \n     the Senate under regular order)\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Carper] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 207:\n       Strike paragraph (b) of Section 201.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, the amendment I offer this evening is \nactually a fairly simple one. It strikes the section of the budget \nresolution that gives reconciliation protection to some $70 billion in \ntax cuts. The amendment doesn't prohibit those cuts. It simply says if \nwe are going to cut our taxes by another $70 billion, we either need to \ncome up with a way to pay for that or to sort of offset that with the \nTreasury or we need to be able to produce 60 votes here in the Senate.\n  At a time when deficits are already high, I, for one, believe we \nshould not make it any easier to dig the hole deeper.\n  Sometimes I like to quote a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, a \nBritish fellow, who used to say this, talking about the theory of \nholes:\n\n       The theory of holes is when you find yourself in a hole, \n     stop digging.\n\n  The amendment we offer here tonight is based in part on that theory \nof holes made famous by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Faced with the \nkinds of deficits that we do face when we are cutting domestic \nprograms, reconciliation should not be used for tax cuts that dig the \ndeficit hole even deeper. Our Nation should be getting its fiscal house \nin order, not undermining the foundation of that house.\n  If proponents of additional tax cuts wish to cut taxes further, they \nshould pay for them. They should offset them, in my view. We already \nhave that requirement on the spending side of the Federal ledger. I \nbelieve we need to apply the same principle to the tax side. Now, the \nSenate voted on Senator Feingold's and Senator Voinovich's amendment to \nreinstate pay-go requirements that require Congress to find offsets to \npay for any new tax cuts or spending on any entitlement programs. My \namendment takes the area of this budget resolution where we are \nactually spending more money--and that is $70 billion in tax cuts--and \napplies the pay-go standard.\n  As demonstrated by my vote on the Feingold-Voinovich amendment, I \nfavor applying pay-go standards universally, both on the spending side \nand on the tax side. My views are pretty basic. I think when we are \nfaced with budget deficits that are in the area of $400 billion again \nthis year, if I or anybody else wants to raise spending, in effect \nmaking the deficit larger, I would have to come up with an offset for \nit.\n  If I can, I have to muster 60 votes for that offset. Similarly, in an \nera of $400 billion deficits, if I want to cut taxes, as well \nintentioned as that might be, but if doing so simply raises the budget \ndeficit, I should be able to offer that amendment. My amendment says \nthat anyone seeking to do so would have to muster 60 votes to cut taxes \nin a way that raises the budget deficit even further.\n\n[[Page S2818]]\n\n  The reconciliation process is a fast-track procedure that was \ndesigned to facilitate the passage of deficit reduction legislation in \nthe Congress. The process was intended to protect hard-to-pass deficit \nreduction legislation from a filibuster and to ensure that such \nlegislation could pass with 51 votes rather than 60 votes in the \nSenate. In recent years, however, Congress has used these special \nprocedural protections to make it easier to cut taxes, to increase \ndeficits, and to increase our Nation's debt.\n  Tax cuts enacted in reconciliation bills in 2001 and again in 2003 \ncost the Treasury nearly $2 trillion over 10 years. The current tax \nreconciliation instruction would make it easier to pass an additional \n$70 billion in tax cuts without requiring that they be offset or paid \nfor. This is the very opposite of the way these fast-track procedures \nwere intended to be used, and the consequences for our fiscal situation \nhave been mounting deficits and mounting debt.\n  When President Bush took office some 4 years ago, the Congressional \nBudget Office projected surpluses of $5.6 trillion over the next decade \nand that virtually all publicly held debt would be paid off by 2008. \nHowever, if we adopt the policies in this budget resolution, including \nthese tax cuts, debt in 2008 will total $5.7 trillion based on CBO's \nestimate of this budget proposal. In a span of 4 years, we have really \nmoved from a CBO projection of surpluses of $5.6 trillion over the next \ndecade that would have enabled us to have paid off publicly held debt \nby 2008 to where we see ourselves in a situation where CBO says, no, \nforget that; rather, our debt in 2008 will be in $5.7 trillion--not \npaid off, it will have grown to $5.7 trillion.\n  This is not about being against tax cuts but about making the \ndecision that at a time of unprecedented Federal budget deficits, if we \nare going to cut taxes further, those cuts ought to be offset.\n  Reconciliation evolved during the last period of large deficits to \nhelp Congress take the difficult steps necessary to balance the budget. \nIt worked then and it can work again if we use these procedures to \nreduce deficits, not to make them larger.\n  My first tour of duty to Congress was at the beginning of 1983 as a \nMember of the House of Representatives. I had a lot to learn then. I \nstill do. Among the things I needed to learn in 1983 was how the budget \nprocess worked because I did not understand it very well. I had been \nthe treasurer of the State of Delaware for 6 years before that, and I \nwas familiar with the budget process in my State, one that was similar \nto budget processes in many other States. In the State government in \nDelaware, the Governor proposes a budget sometime in the early part of \na calendar year for a fiscal year that starts on July 1. There are \nhearings on the Governor's proposal. The legislature debates the \nGovernor's proposal both for an operating budget and for a \ncapital budget. Sometime before July 1, the legislature usually adopts \nan operating budget and a capital budget. We go out. We run the State. \nWe use those budgets that have been adopted.\n\n  When I got here, I found out it was not that way at all. Sometime in \nthe early part of the calendar year, the President proposes a budget \nthat now kicks in around the beginning of the new fiscal year, around \nOctober 1. There are hearings before the Budget Committees in the House \nand the Senate on the President's budget proposal.\n  The next step is for the Congress to adopt a budget resolution, which \nis not a real specific budget; it is sort of a skeleton or a framework \nfor the budget--roughly, we are going to spend our money in these \nareas, we are going to raise our money from these areas, and in the end \nhopefully it will all balance.\n  After we have adopted a budget resolution, we come back and put the \nmeat on the bones, the meat being the 13 appropriations bills we have \ntraditionally enacted that provide the real detail of the budget \nresolution.\n  At the end of the budget process, usually sometime in September, \nideally, we do some cleanup in order to make sure that we are going to \nhit our balanced budget target or deficit reduction target. At the end \nof the process, we pass a reconciliation.\n  When the Budget Act was adopted in the mid-1970s, the notion was that \nbudget reconciliation would be used to help make sure we made the tough \ndecisions to cut spending or to raise revenues in order to balance our \nbudget or to get us closer to a balanced budget. So keep in mind the \ninitial idea, the reason we had reconciliation, was to ensure that the \nCongress made the tough decisions to reduce budget deficits--in fact, \nto try to balance our budget.\n  One of the great ironies today, is budget reconciliation has come to \nbe used in an entirely different way. It is not used to help us make \nthe tough decisions to reduce deficits, but, sadly, it is being used to \nmake the deficits larger.\n  My point of view is this: Things are worth paying for whether they \nare veterans benefits, defense programs, education, or transportation. \nIf they are worth having, we ought to pay for them. If we are not \nwilling to raise the taxes to pay for them, we simply should not have \nas many or any of those programs in this country.\n  At the very least, I believe if we are going to allow a Member of the \nSenate to stand up and say, I want to raise spending on my favorite \nprogram, and we know that doing so makes the deficit bigger, there \nought to be an offset. If they cannot come up with the offset to pay \nfor that spending increase, they ought to be able to muster 60 votes to \ndo so. I believe the same should apply if this Senator or any other \nSenator wants to come in and cut taxes, however well intentioned that \nmight be. If doing so simply raises the deficit, we ought to have the \nright to offer that proposal, but if it is going to raise the deficit, \nwe ought to also have to muster 60 votes just like we would on the \nspending side. So that is my amendment.\n  Will the Chair inform me as to how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CARPER. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself such time as I might consume.\n  Mr. President, some on the other side on several different occasions \nhave trotted out several multiple arguments against the tax relief \nreconciliation instructions to the Finance Committee that I chair. Now, \nI am not going to get into any debate over whether budget \nreconciliation can, in fact, be used for tax legislation because there \nhas been plenty of precedent established over the years in the Senate, \nwhether the Senate has been controlled by Republicans or controlled by \nDemocrats.\n  As an aside, though, I find it intriguing to consider the views of \nsome on the other side feeling so strongly, as they have indicated, \nthat partisan tax increases such as the 1993 tax hike legislation \nshould enjoy expedited reconciliation process, and somehow our using \nthat this year is wrong. They care not a whit about raising $1 trillion \nin taxes as was done in the 1993 tax bill on a party-line vote under \nthe process that is called reconciliation, but talk about bipartisan \ntax relief in reconciliation and somehow they get very irate. It seems \nto be a big double standard, so I come to the floor not to debate these \npoints. Rather, I want to tell you why we should have a reconciled tax \nrelief package.\n\n  Let's look back just to the last Congress as a precedent. In that \nCongress, late in an election year, we passed a couple of tax relief \nproposals that were allegedly supported on both sides of the aisle. \nWith an election facing them, many on the other side reluctantly \nsupported extension of the family tax relief proposals. Keep in mind \nthat conference vehicle was opened a year earlier--a year earlier. You \nwould think something that passed just before the election should have \nbeen considered over the course of a year, but it was not. You would \nthink it would be simple, by how it finally passed, but there were \nobstacles put in the path of it all the time.\n  We were not as lucky when we took up the FSC/ETI legislation. That \nbill was drawn up in a bipartisan way by Senator Baucus and this \nSenator. The bill came out of the Finance Committee with only two \ndissenting votes,\n\n[[Page S2819]]\n\nand those dissenting votes were Republican votes. Despite the \nbipartisan support, it actually took two cloture votes and the threat \nof a third cloture vote to break a Democrat filibuster on a tax relief \nbill Democrats claimed to support.\n  I have a chart behind me that represents goalposts on a football \nfield. Tax relief bills have a way of becoming political footballs. We \nbrought up the FSC/ETI legislation on March 3, 2004, and did not \ncomplete it until May 11, more than 2 months later, the same year. That \nis over 2 months to do a tax relief bill that had unanimous support \nfrom Democrats on my committee. Members, sometimes for partisan \nreasons, sometimes for other reasons, decide to filibuster by amendment \nor other tactics.\n  Now referring to another bill, referring to the charitable tax relief \nbill that we call the CARE Act, let me point out that we were unable to \ngo to conference because of Democratic leadership objections over the \nyears 2003 and 2004. Also, do not forget that we were unable to get \nenergy tax relief because of a filibustered conference report.\n  So what happens? Reconciliation creates an opportunity for certainty. \nReconciliation, obviously, is not my first choice. Reconciliation \nprevents must-do tax legislation from becoming political footballs, as \nyou see the goalposts move from time to time. In this case, I had hoped \nthat those who say they want to address issues such as alternative \nminimum tax hold harmless would not filibuster. If you say you care \nabout expiring provisions that are going to expire this year, such as \nthe college tuition deduction, you should care about reconciliation--if \nyou want to get that done. It will be tough enough to address expiring \ntax relief provisions. There is demand for revenue of about $90 to $100 \nbillion in this budget, and tax relief numbers of $70 billion. That \nmeans I have to find offsets for about a fourth of that, of $20 billion \nto $30 billion over 5 years, just to keep taxpayers where they are now. \nNot more tax relief--stopping existing tax policy from ending and \nhaving automatic increases in taxes. That will be tough enough without \npolitical football tactics of filibusters by amendment or otherwise, as \nwe saw over the course of last year, that I am just using for an \nexample.\n  But it is a lesson to be learned--to have a process in place where \npeople who say they are for tax relief cannot say they are for tax \nrelief and then stall the process forever and ever. Necessarily, I have \nto have a reconciliation option in this Finance Committee playbook. I \nappreciate the Budget Committee's efforts of providing that option. I \nurge my colleagues to retain that option. Otherwise you are not being \nrealistic when you tell the folks back home that you support extending \nthese tax relief provisions.\n  In other words, I would like to have us avoid the environment where \npeople can say they are for something but then stall for 2 months to \nfinally get it done, moving the football goalposts down the field. What \nreconciliation does is it gives us an opportunity to get done what \npeople say they want done.\n  There are a lot of tax provisions that have to be worked on this year \nthat have almost unanimous support. People can say they are for them \nbut put roadblocks in the way, or move the goalposts to keep them from \nhappening. Reconciliation is going to protect us from that sort of \nactivity.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I would like to make a comment, and then I \nwill yield time to Senator Conrad.\n  For 8 years immediately before coming to the Senate I was privileged \nto serve as Governor of my State. During those 8 years we cut taxes 7 \nyears out of 8. However, for 8 years in a row we also balanced our \nbudget.\n  Tonight, as we gather here, we face a budget deficit for the year \nprobably in the range of $400 billion again. We came off a budget \ndeficit for last year of over $400 billion. Our Nation's trade deficit \nthis year is expected to exceed $600 billion.\n  I say to my friends, that kind of lifestyle is not sustainable. We \nare not going to enjoy the standard of living that we do today if we \ncontinue down this path of spending ever more money as a country than \nwe raise, and forever buying more from abroad than people buy from us--\nnot by just a little bit but by a lot.\n  Our trade deficit for the month of January was, as I recall, about \n$60 billion. We can go back only as recently as 1990, and I think our \ntrade deficit for the whole year was about $30 billion.\n  We are on a dangerous path. For us to continue willy-nilly along the \nsame course is playing with fire. Again, the principle that is part of \nthis, that really underlies this amendment, is if you have a big budget \ndeficit and you want to cut taxes further, and it has the effect of \nraising the budget deficit, you can do that. But when you have a budget \ndeficit of over $400 billion and as far ahead as we can see there is \nmore red ink, we ought to make it a little more difficult to cut taxes \nand, frankly, we ought to make it more difficult to raise spending.\n  I yield to my friend from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, for however \nmuch time he wishes to consume.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Just under 8 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would the Chair advise me after I have consumed 5 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Certainly.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the more I listen to this debate about the \nbudget, the more I feel as though I am in some time warp, or some sort \nof surreal out-of-body experience because the other side talks about \nthe need for more tax cuts and more spending. They never talk about the \nfiscal condition of the country at this moment. They never talk about \nwhere it is all headed.\n  This is the circumstance we face tonight as we meet. This looks back \nto 1980. The green line is the revenue line, and the red line is the \nexpenditure line of the Federal Government. The last time our \nRepublican friends were in control back in the 1980s, we can see the \nexpenditure line is way above the revenue line as a result of the \nmassive deficits.\n  Then a Democrat took office, and the spending line came down \nsteadily. The revenue line went up, and the result was we balanced the \nbudget, we stopped using Social Security money for other purposes.\n  Then we got another Republican administration, and the revenue line \ncollapsed, the spending line moved up, and the deficits again opened up \ndramatically. That is a fact. That is undeniable. That is what \nhappened.\n  Our Republican friends are plenty ready to spend the money, but they \ndo not want to raise the taxes to cover their spending, and they don't \nwant to cut their spending to match their revenue. The result is \ndeficits as far as the eye can see.\n  Here is what has happened since our Republican friends took over. The \ndeficits have gone through the roof. It is not only the deficits, but \nthe debt as well. The debt was $3.3 trillion--publicly held debt--and \nnow it is headed for $9.4 trillion.\n  Our Republican friends come with a budget that they say is fiscally \nresponsible, but their own numbers give lie to the rhetoric. If you \nlook at their own budget document on page 5 where they estimate how \nmuch they are going to increase the debt each and every year of this \nbudget, here is what it shows. They are going to increase the debt $669 \nbillion this year, $636 billion next year, $624 billion the next year, \n$612 billion the next year, and $611 billion the fifth year. They say \nthey are cutting the deficits in half, but the debt goes up every year \nby over $600 billion, according to their own estimates.\n  The Senator from Delaware comes with an amendment that says you \nshouldn't have special protection to further reduce the revenue base. \nYou shouldn't have special protection that says we take the revenue \nbase that has already collapsed and reduce it further with special \nprotections from the traditional way of doing business in the Senate. \nInstead, if somebody wants to have more tax cuts, they should pay for \nthem. There is an old-fashioned idea--pay for it. That is what the \nSenator from Delaware is saying. You can have more tax cuts, but pay \nfor them, either reduce the spending to pay for them, or increase \nrevenue somewhere else to pay for it, but don't tack it onto the debt. \nDon't add it to the deficit.\n\n[[Page S2820]]\n\nDon't shove this onto our kids. Don't add this onto the already \nburgeoning Federal debt. It is a conservative idea. It says let us pay \nfor what we do around here.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I happen to think we need to take care of \nthose taxes where they are expiring. If we don't deal with them, the \nrates are going to go up. We have a number of tax provisions that are \nwithin the 5-year window of the budget resolution that is before us. \nThree of them are what we refer to as economic growth, taxes we \nreduced, investment and job creation incentive, and taxes we reduced.\n  I think one of the most effective taxes in stimulating the economy is \nreduction of capital gains. It is set to expire within this 5-year \nwindow.\n  If you look as far back as the Kennedy administration, he reduced \ncapital gains to create more income during his administration so he \ncould spend on other programs. Because you cut taxes doesn't mean it is \ngoing to reflect a decrease in revenue to the Federal Government. We \nhave seen that happen from time to time. It happened during the Reagan \nadministration. It helped pay for defense spending. We have seen it in \nmy State of Colorado.\n  Right now, we happen to have in my State of Colorado a modified \nnational tax where we build off of the Federal tax bottom line form. \nOne time we didn't, and we reduced capital gains in the State of \nColorado and, lo and behold, revenues increased to the State of \nColorado.\n  We have seen this happen now under the Bush administration with the \ntax incentives we put in place, which included a 15-percent tax rate on \ncapital gains income, and included a 150-percent tax rate on dividend \nincome, and increased 100 percent the deduction for small business \nexpenses. Having done that, here is what we have seen happen.\n  February's nonfarm payroll growth exceeded analysts' expectations and \nwas broad-based. We saw nonfarm payroll increase 262,000 in February, \nabove the 225,000 median analysts' estimates, according to Bloomberg. \nIt was the largest nonfarm payroll gain since October of 2004 and only \nthe second gain of over 200,000 since last May. We saw 121 consecutive \nmonths of job gains, and have added more than 3 million new jobs to the \npayroll. The unemployment rate declined to 5.4 percent from 5.6 percent \na year ago. Now it is below the 1980s peak of 10.8 percent, the 1990 \npeak of 7.8 percent, and the 2000 year peak of 6.3 percent, according \nto OECD, which is an international organization that looked at the \nunemployment rate in the United States and compares it to other \ncountries. According to its rating, the unemployment rate in the U.S. \nis low again in comparison to our major trading partners.\n  The United States has 5.5 percent, France's unemployment rate is 9.6 \npercent, 4.1 percent higher than in this country, Germany is 9.8 \npercent, the Euro area is 18.9 percent.\n  We look at all these figures, and I don't see how anybody can deny \nthe fact that those taxes where we reduced them for the purpose of \ndriving the economy didn't work. It did work. It created more revenue \nfor the Federal Government.\n  We can tax things to the point where you get very little revenue to \nthe Government. I think we have been through an era where spending and \ntaxing both have been on the higher side. When that happens, you \ndecrease production, and the result is you have less revenue. Just \nraising taxes doesn't mean you automatically are going to get more \nrevenue to the Federal Government. On the other hand, because you cut \ntaxes doesn't necessarily mean you are going to get less revenue to the \nFederal Government. It depends on where your tax rate is.\n  We have seen time and time again where we took a tax such as capital \ngains, we reduced it in the Kennedy era, we reduced it in the Reagan \nera, we reduced it in local States, and we have seen the effects by the \nadjustments within the States. We have seen it happen recently with the \nbudget tax incentive and, lo and behold, revenues increased to the \nFederal Government.\n  That is why Members such as myself feel it is important that we keep \nin the reconciliation process the opportunity to begin to extend these \ntaxes. Obviously, they are not going to be extended permanently. I \nprefer to extend them permanently. Obviously, that is not going to be \npossible around here. I am willing to go ahead and extend them again \nfurther on a temporary basis and deal with them later.\n  If you are going to stimulate the economy, I think you have to turn \nto the small business sector. That is the real engine that drives this \neconomy. It is the small business sector. That is where innovation \noccurs. That is where individuals can own their own business and be \nmotivated to produce. We see that time and time again in this country. \nI have seen it in my State of Colorado.\n\n  I am a small businessman myself, having had a veterinary practice. I \nunderstand the vital role small business will play in economies of \ncities throughout this country. We had a 100 percent deduction for \nsmall business on expensing. That had a phenomenal impact on revenues \nto the Federal Government in a positive way. It is one of the taxes \nthat increased revenue to the Federal Government. We saw such a \ndramatic drop in the unemployment rate.\n  It is important we not do away with the goose that laid the golden \negg. We need to look at what has worked historically and we need to \ncontinue that policy. If we do that, we will continue to see our \neconomy grow.\n  The President is on the right track. This budget is on the right \ntrack to, at the very least, extend out those taxes.\n  There are some Members that would have liked to have seen more in the \nreconciliation bill. The $70.2 billion that is in here that they are \ntalking about is a bare minimum as far as I am concerned. I wish we had \na lot more. I think we could have done more to further stimulate the \neconomy.\n  It is not the government that creates new jobs, it is the small \nbusiness people out here that are working. They are the ones who really \ncreate jobs. It is the free enterprise system in this country that \ncreates jobs. When you create jobs, you can hold down government \nexpenses and you can generate more revenue to the Federal Government.\n  There are other expiring tax provisions that the Finance Committee \ncan look at. They are not what I would classify necessarily as economic \ngrowth. They do not stimulate economic growth when you reduce them \nnecessarily, but they help to contribute to the environment that helps \nour economy grow. I look at some of these that will expire within this \nwindow and I hate to turn my back on them, because they are popular, \nmany of them, among the American people. Relief from individual \nalternative minimum tax; the research and experimentation tax credit; \nthe deduction for teachers' classroom expenses; deduction for qualified \neducation expenses; deduction of State and local sales taxes; cutting \nthe welfare-to-work tax credit, work opportunity tax credit, credit for \nelectricity produced from wind, biomass, and landfill gasses, tax \ncredit for hybrid fuel cell vehicles; the first-time home buyer credit; \nand expensing of brownfields for mediation. Just a few of those taxes \nthat will be expiring within the 5-year window that is provided for in \nthis budget.\n  My view is if these are worthy programs, we are much better off to \nreduce taxes in a way that stimulates those programs to grow than to \nsay we will spend Federal dollars and promote these programs and \nsubsidize these businesses. That is the wrong way. We are better off to \nkeep a competitive environment by reducing taxes on some of these \nprograms that are vitally important.\n  I firmly believe the President is on the right track. I firmly \nbelieve the tax cuts we have put in place since the President was first \nelected to office are working, and it would be very disappointing to me \nand I think it would be a wrong track to somehow or other turn our back \non those tax incentives that have proved to do so much for improving \nthe economy in this country and improving revenue not only to the \nFederal Government but the State governments. The figures are looking \nbetter among State and local governments.\n  I for one am going to stand and say, look, we need to have those \nprovisions\n\n[[Page S2821]]\n\nin the budget because we want to continue to see economic growth so \nthat we can continue to have a strong and competitive economy. If we \njust turn loose the free enterprise system, the American people will \ngenerate the revenue that we need to sustain our economy. We just need \nto give them the incentive to produce. We do that, we have done that in \nthe past, and we need to extend these out. It is very important.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes.\n  Mr. CARPER. My friend from Colorado has reflected on the fiscal \nbehavior of his State and I reflected earlier on the fiscal policies of \nmy own State of Delaware. We like to cut taxes from time to time in my \nState. We also understand that at the end of the day we need to balance \nthe amount of money that is coming in with the amount of money we are \nspending.\n  There was a time when Delaware did not do such a good job of reaching \nthat kind of balance. We were best in the country at spending more than \nwe anticipated and writing in less than we estimated. In fact, we were \nthe best in the country in that and ended with the worst credit rating \nin the country in 1977.\n  Whether it is Delaware, Colorado, or actually a country, we cannot \nforever live beyond our means. It is one thing to run budget deficits, \nwhich are a very small percentage of our gross domestic product, maybe \nfor a short period of time. It is another matter when we run budget \ndeficits which are a significant portion of our gross domestic product. \nWhen we look forward to the future, we do not see those deficits \ngetting any smaller unless we assume we will not spend any money on \nIraq or unless we assume we will not spend any money on Afghanistan and \nunless we assume things like we are not going to fix the alternative \nminimum tax.\n  We ought to fix the alternative minimum tax. I would like to extend \nthe R tax credit. There are other provisions of the Tax Code I would \nlike to extend as well. I am sure most of us would.\n  The point I am trying to make is this: If we elect to do those \nthings, they have the effect of making our budget deficits larger and \nto increase our need to borrow money, then we ought to provide for an \noffset. We ought to provide for an offset by reducing the growth in \nspending in other portions of the budget or we need to collect more \ntaxes, do a better job of collecting the taxes that are owed but not \ncollected. We need to close some tax loopholes if there are things that \nare abusive that are part of our Tax Code in order to come up with the \noffset.\n  We cannot sustain this forever. As a nation, we cannot continue going \naround the world and borrowing ever larger sums of money to fund our \nnational debt. We certainly cannot continue to buy so much more from \nother places around the world. This month alone $60 billion more we \nwill buy from the rest of the world than we will sell. It is not \nsustainable. We need to instill a bit of old-fashioned common sense and \nfiscal discipline.\n  I started earlier talking about the Chancellor of the Exchequer \ntheory of holes; my friends, we need to stop digging.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, could we be updated on the time situation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Earlier the Senator from Colorado yielded his \ntime so there is no time on either side.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So the next amendment up would be Senator Wyden; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. From 7 to 7:30 is the Snowe-Wyden amendment. We will put \nin a quorum call so they can prepare to offer their amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, we will recognize Senator Snowe, and we \nwill recognize her on the Democrats' time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 214\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Snowe], for herself, Mr. Wyden, \n     Mr. Feingold, Mr. McCain, and Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 214.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To ensure that any savings associated with legislation that \nprovides the Secretary of Health and Human Services with the authority \n to participate in the negotiation of contracts with manufacturers of \ncovered part D drugs to achieve the best possible prices for such drugs \n under part D of title XVIII of the Social Security Act, that requires \n the Secretary to negotiate contracts with manufacturers of such drugs \n    for each fallback prescription drug plan, and that requires the \nSecretary to participate in the negotiation for a contract for any such \ndrug upon the request of a prescription drug plan or an MA-PD plan, is \n          reserved for reducing expenditures under such part)\n\n       On page 40, after line 8, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1. RESERVE FUND FOR REDUCING EXPENDITURES UNDER MEDICARE \n                   PART D.\n\n       The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget may \n     revise the aggregates, allocations, functional totals, and \n     other appropriate levels and limits in this resolution upon \n     enactment of legislation that provides the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services with the authority to participate \n     in the negotiation of contracts with manufacturers of covered \n     part D drugs to achieve the best possible prices for such \n     drugs under part D of title XVIII of the Social Security Act, \n     that requires the Secretary to negotiate contracts with \n     manufacturers of such drugs for each fallback prescription \n     drug plan, and that requires the Secretary to participate in \n     the negotiation for a contract for any such drug upon the \n     request of a prescription drug plan or an MA-PD plan, by the \n     amount of savings in that legislation, to ensure that those \n     savings are reserved for reducing expenditures under such \n     part.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my good friend and \ncolleague, Senator Wyden, to offer this amendment, and on behalf, as \nwell, of Mr. Feingold, Mr. McCain, and Mrs. Feinstein. The amendment \nwould repeal the prohibition that we now have and was included in the \nMedicare Modernization Act that passed last year that would have \nprevented the Secretary of Health and Human Services from negotiating \nprescription drug prices.\n  I think, as we all know, prescription drugs are an indispensable part \nof modern medicine today. Drug coverage was not originally part of the \nMedicare Program. We deemed it, rightfully so, to be part of the new \nMedicare Program for the future.\n  As we all well know, not only do pharmaceuticals play a critical \nrole, but also we have seen the dramatic rise in prescription drug \nprices as well. In fact, starting within weeks of passage of the \nMedicare Modernization Act, we saw a vastly increased cost estimate for \nthe prescription drug benefit. Mr. President, $534 billion from the \nadministration was the reestimate. In fact, we cannot even get the \nCongressional Budget Office to give us a net cost of this benefit, \nwhich seems to be not only escalating but also changing from time to \ntime since the passage of this legislation. And I think we can expect \nthat to be the case in the future.\n  So it is no surprise that the annual growth in the cost of the \nbenefit will far outpace inflation. As this chart indicates, we see an \nupward trajectory of\n\n[[Page S2822]]\n\ndrug prices that is two and three times the rate of inflation.\n  My good friend, Senator Wyden, and I received a report from the \nGovernment Accountability Office, and the news was not good, as this \nchart illustrates, when you see drug prices going up two and three \ntimes the rate of inflation, especially so that this rate increased \nduring the time of consideration of the Medicare Modernization Act. So \nyou can see the major difference in the price changes that is two or \nthree times over the rate of CPI.\n  It is actually even worse than what this graph would indicate. Those \nwith fixed incomes, for example, have seen the long-term effects of the \nprice increases that seniors are experiencing all across America, \ncertainly in my State of Maine. A senior with $250 in monthly drug \ncosts, in 1999, would need to spend $298 to purchase those same \nprescription drugs in 2003--not newer, not better drugs, but the same \nproducts.\n  But this is the trend. This trend indicates that purchasing power is \neroding, and beneficiaries are not going to realize the full value, the \nfull benefit, and the full promise of the act that passed that included \nthis new Part D benefit.\n  Now, Senator Wyden and I have introduced legislation repeatedly on \nthe very question as to how we can maximize the value of this \nprescription drug benefit. It is in the interest of seniors. It is in \nthe interest of taxpayers. It is certainly in the interest of good \npublic policy.\n  One of the best tools we can give the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices is the ability to negotiate prescription drug prices. There \nwas a prohibition in the Medicare Modernization Act, regrettably. There \nshould not have been a prohibition. We should have been able to give \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services the same authority and \nprerogative that is utilized at the Veterans' Administration, that is \nutilized by the Department of Defense, very effectively, very \nsuccessfully.\n  So why is it that the Secretary of Health and Human Services cannot \nhave that same prerogative and the ability to control prices on \nprescription drugs, something that is utilized all across America, most \ncertainly by seniors? It can make the difference between life and \ndeath, the progression of a disease that ultimately could result in \nmore costly illnesses.\n  So that is what this is all about: whether we are prepared to give \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to negotiate \nprescription drug prices.\n  That is what our amendment does. It allows the Secretary to have that \nauthority. It is permissive authority, but on the other hand, there \nwill be two instances when it would be required. I think it would be in \nthe interest of all of us to understand that this will be an \nimprovement on the legislation that passed that provided the \nprescription drug benefit. One, as you know, there is a fallback \nprovision in the legislation that passed. In areas of the country where \nthere may not be competitive plans, we want to make sure those seniors, \nregardless of where they live in America--urban or rural areas--if \nthere is a fallback plan, we want to make sure they get the best \nprices, competitive pricing.\n  That is why it would require the Secretary, in our amendment, to \nnegotiate prices in those instances, so that they don't become victims \nof high prices because there is a lack of competitive plans to be \noffered in that particular area of the country.\n  The second instance would be, if providers would request assistance \nbecause the manufacturers are not negotiating in good faith. Again, \nthat is another instance which we think would be desirable in the \ninterest of good public policy to ensure that the Government is \nnegotiating the very best prices because, ultimately, it is going to be \nthe taxpayers. It will drive up the cost of the prescription drug plan \nthat went from $400 billion up to $534 billion, and we don't have any \nidea how high it is going to go. CBO is not even prepared to estimate \nit at this time.\n  I cannot imagine why there would not be a willingness on the part of \nthe Senate to embrace this approach and give the negotiating power to \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services. In fact, former Secretary \nThompson indicated that he wished he had had that authority. At his \npress conference, during the time of his resignation as Secretary, he \nindicated:\n\n       I would like to have had the opportunity to negotiate.\n\n  That is a very powerful statement coming from the former Secretary. \nHe well understood that the vital ingredient for controlling the cost \nof prescription drugs was to have this negotiating power in order to \nensure that we could maximize this legislation, this benefit on behalf \nof seniors, most certainly, and also on behalf of taxpayers. We have \nseen the annual increased projections of about 8.5 percent and the cost \nof the Part D benefit. I don't think any of us are under any illusion \nthat if we, the Federal Government, don't have this ability to use and \nexercise this prerogative at key moments in time, we will lose and \ndevalue this benefit for seniors because their purchasing power will \nerode quickly over time.\n  With that, I would like to yield to my colleague, Senator Wyden of \nOregon. I appreciate his leadership on this issue and working to make \nsure we have the very best initiative that would, hopefully, draw a \nmajority of support in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Parliamentary inquiry: I need to speak with the Senator \nfrom Colorado and the Senator from North Dakota. I haven't had a chance \nto speak. Senator Snowe has done a superb job. In 3 or 4 minutes, I \ncould sum up any additional comments. I know other colleagues want to \nspeak and Senator Stabenow wants to speak. Could we work out something \nwhere we would have a few more minutes?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Before we work out that agreement, I would like to be \nable to give those Members in opposition an opportunity to speak. We \nhad this time pretty well set between 7 and 7:30. The time was running \nwhen we were waiting. I would like to call on them and see how our time \nruns. That might be possible.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I think that is very fair. After Senator Grassley is done, \nmaybe we can work it out where I can have 4 minutes and Senator \nStabenow can have 4 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. We will see how the time goes. I will yield to Senator \nGrassley first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would like to be notified when half of the time on \nthis side is used. I want to reserve time for Senator Hatch. Will the \nChair inform me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the amendment by the Senator from Maine \nand the Senator from Oregon about the noninterference clause will not \nresult in savings, and it is going to undermine a drug benefit that is \nnot even up and running yet. I don't know how you can propose changes \nin legislation that effectively doesn't get started until January 1, \n2006. How do you know things are not going to work until you have had \nsome experience with it?\n  I have urged everybody to hold off on changing anything in the \nprescription drug bill until you actually see it functioning. It seems \nto me to be very difficult to work on a piece of legislation like this \nand try to change it before it has been operational.\n  First and foremost, let me be clear about something again. The \nMedication Modernization Act does not prohibit negotiations with drug \ncompanies. That could not be further from the truth. In fact, it \nrequires the Medicare plans to negotiate with drugmakers for better \nprices. These negotiations are at the heart of the new Medicare drug \nbenefit plan.\n  The absurd claim that the Government will not be negotiating with \ndrugmakers comes from a noninterference clause in the Medicare law. \nThis noninterference clause does not prohibit Medicare from negotiating \nwith drugmakers. It prohibits otherwise the CMS from interfering with \nthose negotiations that are provided for.\n  Let me be clear, the noninterference clause is at the heart of the \nbill's structure for delivering prescription drug coverage. This clause \nensures those savings will result from market competition, rather than \nthrough price fixing by the Center for Medicaid Services bureaucracy.\n\n[[Page S2823]]\n\n  Here is what is so funny about what we are discussing today. The same \nnoninterference clause language that we have in the law right now was \nin the Daschle-Kennedy-Rockefeller bill and the Gephardt-Dingell-Stark \nbill in 2000. The Daschle bill was in 2002; the Gephardt bill was in \nthe year 2000.\n  I want to read for you what this says:\n\n       In administering the prescription drug benefit program \n     established under this part, the Secretary may not (1) \n     require a particular formulary or institute a price structure \n     for benefits; (2) interfere in any way with the negotiations \n     between private entities and drug manufacturers, and \n     wholesalers; or (3) otherwise interfere with the competitive \n     nature of providing a prescription drug benefit through \n     private entities.\n\n  Now, where did that language come from? It comes from the bill \nintroduced by Senator Daschle and cosponsored by 33 Democrats, \nincluding Senator Kerry. They all thought their approach, which was \nincorporated in our legislation passed in 2003, and has now been dubbed \nby opponents of it, including the sponsors of this amendment, as \n``preventing Medicare from negotiating,'' was a fine approach when it \nwas suggested from the other side of the aisle.\n  In fact, at the time, this is what Senator Daschle had to say.\n\n       Our plan gives seniors the bargaining power that comes with \n     numbers. . . . Our plan mirrors the best practices used in \n     the private sector. For beneficiaries in traditional \n     Medicare, prescription drug coverage would be delivered by \n     private entities that negotiate prices with drug \n     manufacturers. This is the same mechanism used by private \n     insurers.\n\n  Just for the record, opponents now also have claimed that Republicans \ninsisted on including the so-called ban in the Medicare Modernization \nAct that somehow we ``pushed through.'' I remind these people--and they \nare here right now--that the whole concept was developed by Democrats.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has concluded that the market-based \napproach in the new Medicare law will result in better, higher \nprescription drug cost management for Medicare than any other approach \nconsidered by Congress. That is the green eyeshade people in the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is at 6 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I believe we have two speakers on this \nside who want 4 minutes apiece. I ask unanimous consent that we have 8 \nminutes on this side extended out and that we give Senator Grassley \nanother 4 minutes to wrap up his speech, and then another 4 minutes on \nthe time of Senator Hatch, if we might. There have been some \ncancellations, and we can take it off the time later on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Okay. I quoted the Congressional Budget Office. Here is \nwhat the Congressional Budget Office said about eliminating the \nnoninterference clause in a letter just last year:\n\n       The Secretary would not be able to negotiate prices that \n     further reduce Federal spending to a significant degree.\n\n  The letter went on to say:\n\n       CBO estimates that substantial savings will be obtained by \n     the private plans.\n\n  That is the way we wrote this bill and what the Senator is trying to \nchange.\n  Now, we also have an analysis from the Chief Actuary for the Medicare \nProgram. The Chief Actuary is required by law to provide independent \nactuarial analysis on Medicare issues. The Chief Actuary's report \nstates the view that the Medicare prescription drug plans will achieve \naverage cost reductions of 15 percent initially, and that these cost \nreductions will rise to 25 percent over 5 years.\n  The Chief Actuary has concluded that he does not ``believe that the \ncurrent administration or future ones would be willing and able to \nimpose price concessions that significantly exceed those that can be \nachieved in a competitive market.''\n  In fact, more astonishing, the Chief Actuary points out that if \nMedicare establishes drug price levels, it will reduce competition, not \nincrease it. Their report states:\n\n       Establishment of drug price levels for Medicare by the \n     Federal Government would eliminate the largest factor that \n     prescription drug plans could otherwise use to compete \n     against each other.\n\n  Further, their report points out that the past experience in the \nMedicare Program does not give one much, if any, confidence that \nMedicare will do a good job in setting prices. Far from it. As \nconfirmed by the Actuary's report, prior to the enactment of the \nprescription drug bill, drugs in Part B ``were reimbursed at rates \nthat, in many instances, were substantially greater than prevailing \nprice levels.'' So Medicare does not have a very good track record when \nit comes to price negotiations.\n  So let me be clear: Direct Government negotiations is not the answer. \nThe Government does not negotiate drug prices. The Government sets \nprices, and it does not do a very good job at that.\n  The bill's entire approach is to give seniors the best deal through \nvigorous market competition, not price controls. Again, a quote from \nSenator Daschle when he outlined the principles of his Medicare \nprescription drug benefit:\n\n       Fifth, we should take a lesson from the best private \n     insurance companies: Cost-savings should be achieved through \n     competition, not regulation or price controls.\n\n  Even The Washington Post editorial page wrote on February 17, 2004:\n\n       Governments are notoriously bad at setting prices, and the \n     U.S. Government is notoriously bad at setting prices in the \n     medical realm.\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office said that such a proposal ``could \ngenerate no savings or even increase Federal costs.''\n  So we did not rely on Government price-fixing but instead created a \nnew drug benefit that relies on strong market competition, an approach \nrelied upon by the MEND Act as introduced by Senator Daschle and \ncosponsored by 33 Democrats.\n  The new Medicare drug benefit creates consumer choices among \ncompeting, at-risk private plans. The Medicare plans will leverage the \nbuying power of millions of beneficiaries to lower drug prices. I urge \nmy colleagues to oppose efforts to repeal the noninterference clause \nand oppose efforts to get the Government involved in setting drug \nprices. It is a prescription for higher costs and undermining the \ncompetitive market in the Medicare bill that will result in lower drug \ncosts. Let us not interfere with that with some sort of attempt to \nstrike the so-called noninterference clause.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, every time one turns around, the costs of \nthe prescription drug program go up and up. The bipartisan Snowe-Wyden \nproposal is the only proposal that is being offered in the Senate to \ntake steps to protect taxpayers and seniors. This does not undermine \nanything. Nothing is going to change other than the Snowe-Wyden \nlegislation provides an additional tool in order to hold down the costs \nand protect taxpayers.\n  Without this proposal, Medicare is going to be like a fellow standing \nin line at the Price Club buying toilet paper one roll at a time. \nNobody in America shops that way. If one is buying a car or buying \nanything at a store, they try to get the best value. That is what this \nlegislation is all about. In fact, the only areas where anything is \nrequired is when the private sector says an additional boost in \nbargaining power is necessary or in the case of what are called the \nfallback plans which are so important in the rural areas where there \nare no restraints at all in terms of what can be charged.\n  Given the mounting concern about the cost of this program, where it \nhas gone up almost every couple of months since it was signed, I would \nthink that the other side, the opponents of the Snowe-Wyden \nlegislation, would say: All right, we are going to oppose Snowe-Wyden, \nand here is our proposal. The fact is, the other side seems to say the \nstatus quo is just fine. The status quo with the costs going into the \nstratosphere is something that apparently they are not too upset about. \nSenator Snowe and I see it differently. We believe it is important to \nprovide an additional tool, the kind of tool that is used in the \nprivate sector, and we think it will be meaningful.\n  Ultimately, this vote is a vote about whose side the Senate is on. If \nmy colleagues vote for this bipartisan legislation, they stand with \ntaxpayers and seniors who would like this additional tool so that \nmarketplace forces can be\n\n[[Page S2824]]\n\nused to hold down costs. If my colleagues vote against this, in effect \nthey are voting for the status quo because, I would just emphasize, \nthere is no other proposal being offered by the opponents. They seem to \nsay everything is fine.\n  We do not. We think there is a bipartisan approach that makes sense. \nIt is the approach that is used every single day in the private sector \nof this country. It uses marketplace forces to get the best possible \ndeal, and ultimately what the Snowe-Wyden proposal is all about is \nwhether common sense is going to prevail.\n  I hope my colleagues will support it. Several additional colleagues--\nSenators Leahy, Cantwell, and Kohl--would like to serve as cosponsors.\n  I particularly want to thank Senator Conrad for his patience as this \nhas been developed and gone through various iterations. I note my \nfriend Senator Hatch, who has great expertise in this area as well, \nwants to speak.\n  I wrap up by thanking Senator Snowe. We have been at this for 4 \nyears. Both of us support this legislation. This is an important effort \nto try to get it right. When we started, nobody expected that the costs \nwould escalate the way they have. This is likely to be the only vote \nthe Senate gets to cast this year on prescription drug cost \ncontainment. I hope my colleagues will not pass up the opportunity to \ntake a bipartisan step in the right direction, the direction of making \nthis program work at a critical time when seniors are going to start \nsigning up for the benefit that starts next year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleagues allowing \nadditional time for me to speak. I thank my friends who have introduced \nthis amendment, which I am so pleased to be cosponsoring, Senators \nSnowe and Wyden, for their ongoing leadership. I very much appreciate \ntheir leadership and eloquence in talking about this issue.\n  I find it interesting in this debate that Senator Daschle is used in \nquotes from the other side, from the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee. The reality is that was a different proposal. That \nwas a Medicare prescription drug benefit very different than what we \nended up passing.\n  What is most important is that the former Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, Tommy Thompson, said as he left office that he would \nhave liked to have had the opportunity to negotiate lower prices. If \nthat was in the bill, why, when he left, did he say he wished he had \nthe ability to negotiate lower prices? I am sure it is because the \nformer Secretary knows what every smart buyer knows, that in the \nmarketplace, the more you buy of anything, the better deal you get. \nThat is what we are talking about.\n  Right now, today, the only entity in the country that cannot \nnegotiate for lower group prices is Medicare. What sense does that make \nwhen we are talking about precious dollars going to seniors and the \ndisabled to buy medicine in this country. What sense does that make? \nStates, Fortune 500 companies, large pharmacy chains, the Veterans \nAdministration--they can all use bargaining clout to obtain lower drug \nprices for the patients they represent. In fact, the Veterans \nAdministration has had great success in negotiating lower prices; in \nsome cases, as much as 65 percent.\n  I am told, and I have seen studies that show, if we gave the same \nbargaining authority to Medicare that the VA has, you could actually \nclose the gap in the prescription drug benefit. There is enough savings \nthat you could close the gap so that everyone would be receiving \nprescription drugs without what has been commonly called the donut \nhole.\n  These are huge savings. As a member of the Budget Committee, I have \nwatched the numbers go up for the Medicare bill. We thought it was $400 \nbillion. Now CBO says $593 billion and counting over the next 10 years.\n  We have to do something, provide the tools for Health and Human \nServices to be able to negotiate, to be able to lower those prices. \nRight now we have a situation where that is not allowed. It makes \nabsolutely no sense.\n  When I talk to people at home and they ask me, Why in the world \nMedicare is prohibited from using their full force to be able to \nnegotiate, I say it is crazy. This makes absolutely no sense, unless \nyou are one of those folks who does not want them negotiating, in terms \nof the prices.\n  So I urge the adoption of this amendment and thank my colleagues \nagain for doing an outstanding job in putting it together. I urge the \nSnowe-Wyden amendment giving the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nthe authority to negotiate drug prices on behalf of seniors and the \npeople of our country with disabilities be agreed to. It would be \nwonderful to see a very strong bipartisan vote in favor of this very \nimportant amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes and 43 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. For a minute there I was so out of it tonight when you \nwere talking, I thought it was about the ``Snow-White'' amendment \ninstead of Snowe-Wyden. It took me a little while to catch on here. I \njust couldn't resist that.\n  I have to say, I sat through all these meetings and I never once \nheard Secretary Thompson say that he wanted this authority. In any \nevent, let me just speak about the Snowe-Wyden amendment, which they \nare trying to make into the ``Snow-White'' amendment, it seems to me.\n  In my opinion, this amendment guts one of the most important \nprovisions of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003.\n  Supporters of this amendment imply, wrongly in my opinion, that the \nprice charged to beneficiaries is not subject to negotiation. That \ncould not be further from the truth. The truth is, Medicare \nprescription drug plans will be negotiating with drug makers. These \nnegotiations are the very heart of the new Medicare drug benefit. We do \nnot want to open the door to Government price controls for prescription \ndrugs.\n  The noninterference clause in the Medicare Modernization Act does not \nprohibit Medicare from negotiating with drug makers. It prohibits CMS \nfrom interfering in those negotiations. That is a far cry from some of \nthe earlier statements that have been made on this floor regarding this \nprovision.\n  I happen to care a great deal for the two sponsors of this amendment. \nI have worked very closely with them throughout their tenure and my \ntenure in the Senate. But they are simply wrong on this amendment.\n  Let me be clear, the non-interference clause is at the heart of the \nlaw's structure for delivering prescription drug benefits. This clause \nensures those savings will result from market competition, rather than \nthrough price fixing by the CMS bureaucracy. That is what was behind \nthis. Let's not distort these provisions.\n  What is ironic about what the other side is saying is that the same \nnon-interference clause was in the Daschle-Kennedy-Rockefeller bill and \nthe Gephardt-Dingell-Stark bills in the year 2000, as has been \nexplained by our distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee.\n  In administering the prescription drug benefit program established \nunder this part, the Secretary may not--No. 1, require a particular \nformulary or institute a price structure for benefits; No. 2, interfere \nin any way with negotiations between private entities and drug \nmanufacturers, or wholesalers; or No. 3, otherwise interfere with the \ncompetitive nature of providing a prescription drug benefit through \nprivate entities.\n  What is the source of that language? It is from S. 2541, the Medicare \nExpansion for Needed Drugs, or MEND, Act, introduced in 2000. Think \nabout it, some of the very people who are criticizing this provision in \nthe Medicare Modernization Act tonight supported this language in 2000.\n  I must remind my colleagues that former Senator Daschle once said:\n\n       Our plan gives seniors the bargaining power that comes with \n     numbers. . . . Our plan mirrors the best practices used in \n     the private sector. For beneficiaries in traditional \n     Medicare, prescription drug coverage would be delivered by \n     private entities that negotiate prices with drug \n     manufacturers. This is the same mechanism used by private \n     insurers.\n\n\n[[Page S2825]]\n\n\n  Think about that. I think those who advance these arguments that you \ncannot have competitive work with regard to drug pricing are wrong and \nought to quit playing politics with a bill that is so important for \nsenior citizens all over this country.\n  Those who suggest this non-interference language will drive up the \ncost of implementing the law simply do not have the facts or the \nlegislation on their side.\n  This is what the CBO said about eliminating the non-interference \nclause in a letter last year:\n\n       [T]he Secretary would not be able to negotiate prices that \n     further reduce federal spending to a significant degree.\n\n  I do not ever recall, and I sat through all of the meetings, day \nafter day, hour after hour--I do never recall Secretary Thompson asking \nfor that authority.\n  The CBO in that letter went on to say:\n\n       CBO esimates that substantial savings will be obtained by \n     the private plans.\n\n  Now, let us be clear: Direct Government negotiation is not the \nanswer. The Government does not negotiate drug prices. That would be \nprice control, and it would inevitably cause prices to rise as \ncompanies would not be able to do business in this country as they have \nin the past.\n  The Medicare Modernization Act's entire approach is to get Medicare \nbeneficiaries the best deal through vigorous market competition, not \nprice controls.\n  Let me conclude by saying that this amendment is not something that \nis in the best interest of our Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare \nbeneficiaries do not want or need the Government to determine the cost \nof their drugs. Price fixing will lead to higher costs and does that \nhelp or hurt beneficiaries? I think everyone in this body knows the \nanswer to that question but let me be clear--voting in favor of this \namendment is not in the best interest of beneficiaries because they are \ngoing to have to pay more money for their prescriptions. Voting for \nthis amendment will take away choice in prescription drug coverage--if \nthis amendment passes, drug prices will not be dictated by the free \nmarket, they will be dictated by the Federal Government. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote no on the Snowe-Wyden amendment.\n  Frankly, let me just make that point one more time: The Medicare \nModernization Act does not prohibit Medicare from negotiating with \ndrugmakers.\n  It prohibits CMS from interfering in those negotiations. That is a \nfact.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Snowe-Wyden amendment.\n  I appreciate my colleagues' desire to straighten out some of these \nmatters, but the fact of matter is they are wrong on this issue and we \nshould vote this amendment down.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMaine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mrs. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I want to make some \nclosing comments on behalf of myself and Senator Wyden because it is \nimportant to reiterate several facts about this approach.\n  First of all, the point is the Medicare Modernization Act included a \ndirect prohibition against the Secretary's authority to negotiate, an \nauthority that is already utilized by the Veterans Administration and \nthe Department of Defense. That is a fact.\n  The second fact is those soaring costs with respect to the Part D \nprogram as we know it. Within a month after the enactment, we had a \nrestatement from the administration of $534 billion. The CBO isn't even \nprepared to give a net cost of that legislation. We only expect that \nthe price is going to go up, up.\n  As Senator Wyden indicated, the only tool we have to negotiate prices \nto keep those prices low, particularly in situations, for example, \nwhere the Congressional Budget Office indicated to us in a report that \nwith sole-source drugs, where there are drugs that have no competition, \nwe will realize savings. That is a responsibility we have to seniors \nand to the taxpayers with respect to this program.\n  Finally, it is indicated that Secretary Thompson made this comment. \nHe said, ``I would like to have the opportunity to negotiate.''\n  He was asked a question in his final press conference as Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services. The question was, ``You listed the drug \nbenefit as one of your proudest achievements. Was there anything you \nreally pushed for in that bill that didn't get in or that you would \nlike to see Medicare tackle in the future?''\n  Note the fact that the question didn't even suggest negotiations. But \nhis answer was, ``I would like to have had the opportunity to \nnegotiate.''\n  And for good reason, because the Secretary understood that the price \nof this program and the price of the benefit was only going to go in \none direction, and that is up.\n  It defies logic that we would not allow the Secretary to have the \nability to negotiate the very best prices in certain instances and in \nother instances which the Secretary deems worthwhile.\n  A final point: In a recent poll, 80 percent of the American people \nbelieve the Secretary should have the ability to negotiate on their \nbehalf.\n  In the final analysis, this is the amendment that is going to save \nmoney--save money in the drug program, save money to the taxpayer, save \nmoney to the seniors.\n  It is hard for me to believe anyone would ultimately reject it.\n  I again thank Senator Wyden for all of his support and leadership \nover the last few years to make this happen.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to lend my strong support for \nthe amendment by Senators Snowe and Wyden.\n  Less than 2 years ago, Congress passed a massive expansion of our \nNation's entitlement system, the Medicare Modernization Act, MMA, which \nadded costly prescription drug coverage to the Medicare Program. At \nthat time, we were told that the new benefit would cost an estimated \n$400 billion over 10 years a figure many of us believed to be far lower \nthan the actual cost. Today, the same package is estimated to cost \nbetween $534 billion to $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years. Those \ncosts can only be expected to grow further.\n  To add insult to injury, language was added to MMA which explicitly \nprohibited the Secretary of Health and Human Services from engaging in \nnegotiations directly with drug companies. This language was included \ndeliberately, even though other departments in the Federal Government \nand State governors, under the Medicaid Program, have similar \nauthorities. Prohibiting the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nfrom engaging in such negotiations is an offense against the American \ntaxpayer.\n  Earlier this year, I joined Senators Snowe and Wyden in introducing \nlegislation which would amend the MMA and allow the Secretary to \nnegotiate lower drug prices. The amendment we are debating now calls \nfor those savings to be used for debt reduction a worthy goal given the \nmassive burden we added to future generations through the passage of \nMMA.\n  I voted against the passage of MMA because I believe we can no longer \nafford to flagrantly spend taxpayer dollars and saddle future \ngenerations with the enormous burden of these programs, the cost of \nwhich is spiraling out of control. With the passage of that package, we \nmissed a great opportunity to enact reforms that would have helped to \nensure the Medicare program's financial solvency. Congress has an \nobligation to remedy that mistake and the Snowe/Wyden amendment is a \ngood first step.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to supporting this important amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we give time \nlimits from 7:45 to 8 p.m. for Harkin on his education amendment; from \n8 to 8:20 for Ensign-Hutchison on border security; 8:20 to 8:35 for \nLandrieu on National Guard; 8:35 to 8:50 for Bunning on the AIDS budget \nprocess; and, after that time, we are expecting that maybe we are going \nto have some speakers drop out and we can ask for additional time as we \nneed it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 172\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, and Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Levin, Mr.\n\n[[Page S2826]]\n\n     Kohl, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Durbin, and Mrs. Murray, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 172.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, I understand I have 7\\1/2\\ minutes. I \nyield myself 5 minutes.\n  The budget resolution for 2006, which we are now considering, \nessentially calls for the elimination of funding for an enormously \neffective and popular education program called the Perkins Vocational \nand Technical Education Act, which we all know as Voc Ed, vocational \neducation. This amendment restores the funding to Perkins vocational \neducation and also reduces the deficit by billions of dollars in the \nfuture.\n  The costs of these needed steps, restoring vocational education and \nreducing the deficit, are offset by rescinding two new tax cuts for the \nwealthy, tax cuts which have not even gone into effect yet, the so-\ncalled PEP and Pease phase-out provisions.\n  The budget resolution currently calls, under the President's \nproposal, for eliminating funding for vocational education while \nallowing these two new tax cuts, which will cost $23 billion in the \ncoming 5 years and $146 billion in 10 years that follow, with 97 \npercent of the benefits going to those earning at least $200,000 a \nyear.\n  That is what this chart shows. The distribution of tax benefits under \nthe phase-out of PEP and Pease, 54 percent go to people making over $1 \nmillion when it is fully phased in. Another 43 percent go to those \nmaking $200,000 to $1 million a year--97 percent of all the benefits of \nthese tax provisions which hasn't even gone into effect yet. It goes \ninto effect next year unless we do something about it. Ninety-seven \npercent goes to people making over $200,000 a year.\n  We have choices. To govern is to choose. We have a choice. We \nrecently restored the Vocational Education Act, the Perkins Act, on a \nbipartisan vote of 99-0.\n  We know that vocational education makes possible a broad range of \ntechnical education programs and vocational programs for millions of \nyoung people and adults. Vocational education combines classroom \ninstruction, hands-on lab work, on-the-job training, and it is a true \nlifeline for students at risk of dropping out of school.\n  In Iowa alone, elimination of the Perkins Vocational Education \nProgram would directly impact 93,000 high school students and more than \n337,000 community college students. The impact nationwide would be a \ndisaster for millions of students.\n  The only way that we can be assured of saving vocational education, \nthe Perkins Program, is by adding more overall funding to the education \nbudget for that purpose. That is it. That is the only way it can be \nassured. And that is what my amendment accomplishes.\n  But, moreover, my amendment reduces the deficit as well. By \nrescinding these two tax cuts which haven't taken effect yet--they take \neffect next year--and after they would fully be in effect, we then \nbegin to save $146 billion over the next 10 years.\n  When the phase out of PEP and Pease, as they are called, were passed \nin 2001, the phase-out--I guess the case could be made that they were \naffordable. Thanks to the budget surpluses that President Bush \ninherited from President Clinton, we were looking at a cumulative \nsurplus of over $5 trillion over the coming decade, enough to eliminate \nthe national debt and then some. That was then and this is now. Now we \nare looking at projected deficits in excess of $200 billion a year for \nas far as the eye can see--annual deficits in excess of $500 billion a \nyear, a decade from now, if we keep on this way.\n  It makes good sense to eliminate these two proposed tax cuts. We are \nnot rescinding anything that has gone into effect. They start next \nyear. There is no reason they should start next year.\n  Let us have some common sense here. This amendment says we will fully \nrestore vocational education and we will reduce the deficit. And the \npeople who are making over $200,000 a year I don't think really need \nthis tax cut. People making over $1 million a year don't need it. But I \nwill tell you who does need it--kids who need vocational education in \nthe United States. And, the American people need to avoid an added $146 \nbillion deficit explosion that will occur in the decade after these tax \nprovisions take effect in 2010. That is who needs this.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time does the Senator from Iowa have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 1 minute 54 seconds \nand the Senator from New Hampshire has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment is like a lot of other \namendments that are being brought\n\n[[Page S2827]]\n\nforth. It is well-intentioned. I don't deny that. But its practical \nimplication is that it significantly raises spending and significantly \nraises taxes and it does not necessarily accomplish the goals which the \nSenator from Iowa wishes to accomplish.\n  The Senator from Iowa states he wishes to allocate more money to \nvocational education. The budget does not do that. The budget has \nvirtually no impact on that other than to set a top-line number which \nin this case is $843 billion, which is divided between the Defense \nDepartment and the nondiscretionary defense spending of the Federal \nGovernment. The nondefense discretionary number is approximately $444 \nbillion. Within that are a lot of accounts, one of which is vocational \neducation. How that money flows is not controlled by the budget. The \nbudget has no legislative, statutory effect on those accounts other \nthan to set a top-line number and then allow the committees of \njurisdiction to make the decision as to how that money will be spent.\n  In fact, the history has been that although the Budget Committee \nmakes suggestions as to how money should be spent, and it actually has \na number of different functions, those functions do not correspond to \nthe various appropriating committees of the Senate and the \nAppropriations Committee, and the authorizing committees tend to \ngenerally ignore the suggestions of the Budget Committee relative to \nspecific programs. If they did not ignore us, I would be much more \nspecific, but I have learned it is a pointless exercise to try to tell \nappropriators or authorizers what to do relative to specific programs.\n  We give the Appropriations Committee a top-line number and we say to \nthe authorizing committees they have to reconcile or you have this much \nmoney available under the mandatory accounts. But beyond that, we do \nnot have a whole lot of impact on how they spend that money other than \nto say this is how much you have.\n  So it is the Appropriations Committee that makes that decision. The \nSenator from Iowa actually has a unique role relative to education \nbecause he has been both the chairman and he is now the ranking member \nof the subcommittee on Appropriations. I am sure he takes the position, \nas I am sure his ranking member has, because he has already offered an \namendment that has been adopted, that there is not enough education \nmoney that is going to be allocated to his subcommittee for him to do \neverything he wants to do or for the subcommittee to do everything they \nwant to do. I serve on that subcommittee. But that is our role around \nhere. The priorities should be set by us, the different chairmen of the \ndifferent appropriating committees and the ranking members, and we \nshould move forward from there.\n  We should not, however, in my opinion, do a general raising of \nspending and a general raising of taxes which is what this does. \nRather, we should live within the proposed levels of spending.\n  In the area of education, it should be pointed out this \nadministration has sent up their ideas and, yes, in their ideas they \nsuggest vocational education should be adjusted in the way it is \nfunding. But this administration has a unique position over education. \nThey have dramatically increased funding for education over the last 4 \nyears. They increased it over the Clinton years by something like 40 \npercent. They have chosen as an administration, and I think it is \nprobably the right choice, to pick certain elements of Federal activity \nand to fund those elements aggressively and recognize the Federal \nGovernment cannot be all things to all people, but it does have \nresponsibility in specific areas and it should pursue those \nresponsibilities aggressively. That is what they have done. They have \nincreased funding for special education by somewhere around 60 percent; \nincreased funding for title I by 45 percent. They have increased \nfunding for No Child Left Behind by 46 percent. They have increased \nfunding for the Pell grants, and I don't remember the exact figure, but \nit is a double-digit increase. Those are the accounts they have decided \nto focus on.\n  This bill assumes they will continue that effort, but that is not \nnecessarily what will happen. The Appropriations subcommittee of which \nthe Senator from Iowa is ranking member will have the opportunity to do \nwhat they wish. They can put the extra money into title I, they can put \nthe extra money into special education, they can put the extra money in \nNo Child Left Behind, or they can put more money in the Pell grants or \ninto the program they decide is appropriate and that they think is a \npriority.\n\n  This budget itself has significantly focused on education. We set a \nreserve for higher education with $35.5 billion made available to the \nEducation Committee to allow them to put in place a new and more \naggressive higher education bill.\n  We have proposed in this bill an additional almost half a billion \nover what the President requested as the top line--in other words, \ninstead of having a top line of $843 billion, we have a top line of \n$843.5 billion and the reason is because we expect that extra $500 \nmillion to be put into the Pell grants for next year and raise those \ngrants from $4,050 to $4,150.\n  In addition, we suggested in this bill a proposal to the Education \nCommittee--I hope they will follow it; they don't have to--which would \nallow them to increase Pell grants up to $5,100, a massive increase in \nPell grants for students who go to school over 4 years either to a \ncommunity college and vocational college and then move on to \ntraditional college. Huge commitments which we have suggested can be \naccomplished under this budget.\n  The budget is aggressive in the context of a fiscally restrained \neffort in the area of education. This administration's record on \neducation has been strong and vibrant over the last 4 years, uniquely \nso compared to the Clinton administration before and the budget itself, \nand I have to reinforce this point, does not address line items. So \nwhen you offer a bill, an amendment like this, all you are doing is \nspending more and taxing more. You are not necessarily in any way \nadjusting the budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I respectfully answer my friend from New \nHampshire, first talking about priorities. This is priorities, all \nright. You want a tax provision that goes into effect, starts phasing \nin next year that 97 percent of the benefits go to people making over \n$200,000 a year; or do you want to fund vocational exercise? It is as \nsimple as that. Who gets these tax breaks? When fully phased in, those \nwith over $1 million income, you get $20,000 a year, and if you are \nunder $75,000, you get a big fat zero.\n  It is about priorities. My friend from New Hampshire said something \nabout raising taxes. All we are saying is a tax that has been in effect \nfor 15 years will continue and will not be phased out. We are not \nraising anyone's taxes at all.\n  Third, I point out this is the first budget in 10 years that has a \nreduction in education. My friend from New Hampshire says, well, we can \nmake the decision in Appropriations about what we want to do. It is \nlike this. This is what my friend from New Hampshire has presented. It \nis like a puzzle as this chart shows. We have Pell grants, we have \nafterschool, we have title I, special education, bilingual, impact aid, \nall in this box. We have the money for that. He says, well, if you want \nto put voc in, put it in, but if you put it in, take a piece out.\n  Would the Senator from New Hampshire tell us which of these to cut? \nEd tech or TRIO are all left out, but this is the box we are in.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire says, well, you can put it back in. \nBut that means we have to take out special education or title I. The \nonly way to do it, I say, is to enlarge the box. And that is what we do \nwith this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next 20 minutes is devoted to the \namendment of the Senator from Texas.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 218\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for herself, Mr. \n     Ensign, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Kyl, Mr. McCain, and \n     Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an amendment numbered 218.\n\n\n[[Page S2828]]\n\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To fully fund the level of Border Patrol Agents authorized by \nNational Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 and as recommended by the 9/11 \n                              Commission)\n\n       On page 23, line 16, increase the amount by $352,400,000.\n       On page 23, line 17, increase the amount by $317,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 21, increase the amount by $35,400,000.\n       On page 9, line 15, decrease the amount by $352,400,000.\n       On page 9, line 16, decrease the amount by $317,000,000.\n       On page 9, line 20, decrease the amount by $35,400,000.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is an amendment cosponsored by \nmyself and Senator Ensign. Senator Ensign has done so much work in this \narea on the intelligence reform bill, assuring there would be 2,000 \nauthorized Border Patrol agents. We also have as cosponsors Senators \nDomenici, Cornyn, McCain, Kyl, and Feinstein. Mr. President, I would \nlike to be notified at the end of 10 minutes, after which I will yield \nthe rest of the time to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Earlier this month, FBI Director Mueller told Congress that people \nfrom countries with ties to al-Qaida are crossing into the United \nStates through our porous border with Mexico.\n  Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security James Loy recently said that \nintelligence reports suggest al-Qaida is considering using the \nSouthwest border to infiltrate into the United States, either with \nfalsified documents or by crossing the border in other illegal ways.\n  We have today 11,000 Border Patrol agents for the borders between \nMexico, the United States, and Canada, as well as in the Border Patrol \ncenters that are throughout our country. It is clearly not enough.\n  Mr. President, 97 percent of illegal intruders are filtering through \nthe Southwest border. But they do not stay in the South. They go \nthroughout our country.\n  The Border Patrol does an amazing job. We applaud their work. But we \nneed to give them more help. Recent stories and intelligence reports \nshow that terrorists are planning to use our border, and it should be a \nwakeup call.\n  Since 2001, 1,300 agents have been added to the force. But we have \n6,900 miles of border with Canada and Mexico. My State of Texas alone \nhas over 1,200 miles of border with Mexico. In most places there are no \nfences. In Texas, the Rio Grande River can sometimes be waded across or \nis completely dry.\n  We are seeing an increase of 137 percent in immigrants who are from \ncountries other than Mexico. These immigrants, which are called OTMs, \n``other than Mexicans,'' are coming into our country in the largest \nnumbers we have ever seen. But due to a lack of resources, they are \noften caught and released, or they are not caught at all.\n  Recognizing our serious border vulnerability, Congress passed the \nintelligence reform bill last year and authorized an increase of 10,000 \nBorder Patrol agents over 5 years. It included provisions to add 8,000 \ndetention beds and 800 additional interior investigators. \nUnfortunately, the budget before us only allocated enough to cover 210 \nagents, 143 investigators, and 1,920 beds for detention.\n  The Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection recently said:\n\n       We do not have enough agents; we don't have enough \n     technology to give us the security we need.\n\n  Let me give you some examples of recent happenings.\n  In Detroit, Mahmoud Youssef Kourani was indicted in the Eastern \nDistrict of Michigan on one count of conspiracy to provide material \nsupport to Hezbollah. Kourani was already in custody for entering the \ncountry illegally through Mexico and was involved in fundraising \nactivities on behalf of Hezbollah.\n  The two groups of Arab males were discovered by patrol guards from \nWillcox, AZ. One field agent said:\n\n       These guys didn't speak Spanish, and they were speaking to \n     each other in Arabic. It's ridiculous that we don't take this \n     more seriously. We're told not to say a thing to the media.\n\n  This is a field agent for the Border Patrol.\n  Last July, in Burlington, VT, police raided an international \nsyndicate that forced Asian women to work as sex slaves. The women told \ninvestigators they had been smuggled from Asia to Mexico, entering the \nUnited States through Arizona, Texas, and other States. They ended up \nin Vermont.\n  Take the example of the capture of terrorist suspect Jose Padilla. \nThe Justice Department says Padilla and an accomplice planned to enter \nthe United States through Mexico to blow up apartment buildings in \nmajor cities such as New York.\n  Or the case of suspected al-Qaida sleeper agent Mohammed Junaid \nBabar, who told investigators of a scheme to smuggle terrorists across \nthe Mexican border. He is tied to a terror plot to carry out bombings \nand assassinations in London.\n  Further stories indicate there are real concerns about terrorists \nentering our country through the southern border.\n  Along the Mexican border there have been stories of suspicious items \npicked up by local residents, including Muslim prayer rugs and \nnotebooks written in both Arabic and Spanish. These items came from \nOTMs and a subcategory called special interest aliens, who are illegals \ncoming from terrorist-sponsoring countries.\n  Intelligence reports suggesting that 25 Chechen terrorism suspects \nhave illegally entered the United States from Mexico have refocused \nattention on a porous border from which many believe the next major \nattack on Americans could come.\n  Patrol agents told one Arizona newspaper that 77 males ``of Middle \nEastern descent'' were apprehended in June of last year in 2 separate \nincidents. All were trekking through the mountains and are believed to \nhave been part of a larger group of illegal immigrants. Many were \nreleased pending immigration hearings.\n  Also last July, an Egyptian man United States authorities described \nas one of their most wanted smugglers of humans was arrested on charges \nof operating a ring that illegally brought people from Egypt and other \nMiddle Eastern countries to the United States. The indictment says \nAbdallah and his associates would direct people seeking to reach \nthe United States to travel to one of several Latin American countries, \nand from there to Guatemala. They would then be transported to America \nthrough Mexico in return for payments of thousands of dollars in \nsmuggling fees.\n\n  The amendment we are offering tonight will add $315 million to the \nPresident's request for the Border Patrol. This will provide for the \ntraining and equipping of 2,000 agents. This would be the full amount \nauthorized and will have a dramatic impact on the security-related \nproblems we have on the border.\n  In order to maintain a fiscally responsible bill, and not increase \nthe top cap of discretionary spending, we are offsetting this increase \nwith an equal reduction in the international affairs section of the \nbudget because protecting our borders from foreign threats is an \ninternational affair.\n  Today, with my colleagues Senators Ensign, Domenici, Cornyn, McCain, \nKyl, and Feinstein, I am calling on Congress to do more than add 210 \nBorder Patrol agents that are in the underlying budget. We are asking \nfor the full contingent authorized of 2,000. This is still not enough. \nAnd I hope we will be able to come back next year and get up to the \nfull 2,000 again.\n  But the warning flag has gone up. We must heed the warnings we have \nbeen given. Every incident I mentioned is a call to the United States \nto make sure that our borders with Mexico are secure. We need more \nBorder Patrol agents and more detention facilities to make our borders \nsecure.\n  The people of our country deserve this security, and our amendment \nwill take one step in the right direction. I hope my colleagues will \nwork with me to pass this in the budget and then later in the \nAppropriations bill. We must do everything to heed the warning call we \nhave gotten.\n  Mr. President, I yield the rest of our time to the Senator from \nNevada, who has also worked very hard on this amendment. I appreciate \nvery much his cosponsoring this amendment with me today.\n\n[[Page S2829]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Texas for \nall the work she has done to strengthen our borders. Living in a border \nState, she understands the difficult issues of protecting our borders. \nSince 9/11, protecting our borders has taken on a completely different \nmeaning and has only increased the importance of what our amendment is \nattempting to do.\n  Mr. President, I rise to call for the Senate to stand by its \ncommitment to increase border security by adding 2,000 new Border \nPatrol agents.\n  In the decade before 9/11, al-Qaida studied how to exploit gaps and \nweaknesses in the border entry systems of the United States and other \ncountries.\n  This week, intelligence officials confirmed that the terrorist, \nZarqawi, plans to infiltrate America through our porous borders and \ncarry out attacks on soft targets--whether it is while we are taking \nour family to a movie theater, our friends to a restaurant, or our kids \nto school. Additionally, a yearlong investigation recently concluded \nafter authorities captured 18 people in an alleged plot to smuggle \ngrenade launchers, shoulder-fired missiles, and other Russian military \nweapons into this country.\n  Let's face it, the dual threat of the illegal border crossing of \npeople who wish to kill us and the weapons they need to do it on a \nlarge scale is very real.\n  We are not dealing with rational actors. We are not dealing with \npeople who respect life or freedom. We must continue to be diligent in \nour fight to defeat terror and to protect our homeland.\n  The amendment we are offering ties directly to one of the important \n9/11 Commission Report recommendations prohibiting terrorist travel to \nour country.\n  Pre-9/11, INS had only 9,800 Border Patrol agents. With the \npriorities of the agency concentrated on immigration and narcotics, no \nmajor counterterrorism effort was underway.\n  More than 3 years after the devastating terrorist attacks, the men \nand women who serve at the border's front line of defense are \noverwhelmed.\n  Statistics show that with current personnel levels, our agents only \ncatch about one-third of the estimated 3 million people who cross the \nborder illegally each year. It only took 19 to change the course of \nthis country.\n  We must commit resources to block terrorists who attempt to enter our \ncountry. Last year, I sponsored an amendment to the National \nIntelligence Reform Act that authorized 2,000 new agents to patrol our \nborders each year for the next 5 years.\n  Unfortunately, the President's budget this year only provides funding \nfor 210 agents. This amendment allows Congress to fulfill its \ncommitment by providing the additional $352.4 million needed to fully \nfund 2,000 Border Patrol agents, and it does it without raising taxes. \nIt does it with an offset to what is called ``function 150,'' or the \ninternational relations function.\n  Doubling the number of Border Patrol agents from pre-9/11 levels will \nallow increased protection on both our southern and our often neglected \nnorthern border, helping to thwart al-Qaida and prevent these \nterrorists from circumventing our security.\n  The Commission found that many of the 19 9/11 hijackers, including \nknown operatives, could have been watch-listed and were vulnerable to \ndetection by border authorities. However, without adequate staff and \ncoordinated efforts, the evildoers were allowed unhampered entry.\n  The world has changed dramatically since 9/11, when terrorists used \nour open and trusting society against us.\n  We cannot allow a repeat of that tragedy. This amendment will help \ngive those who guard our frontiers the tools they need to ensure the \nsafety of the citizens of the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our \ntime.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nCraig be listed as a cosponsor of our amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada. This \nis a team effort. I appreciate so much his working with me on this. Our \nborder Senators have been trying to increase border patrol for years.\n  When I first came to Congress, we doubled our Border Patrol agents \nfrom 3,000 to 6,000. We were a country that was porous, both on the \nborders of Canada and Mexico. But, clearly, we have had more and more \ninflux of illegal aliens that have become a burden in many parts of our \ncountry, and now we have a security threat from people who do not live \non our borders but are using our borders as a conduit to come into our \ncountry. The examples that Senator Ensign and I have just mentioned, \nwhere we are finding Muslim prayer rugs and instructions in Arabic on \nhow to cross the border of the Rio Grande River, are just wake-up calls \nthat we cannot avoid. So we are, hopefully, going to have the support \nof Congress to add a full 2,000 Border Patrol agents.\n  But as important as it is to catch these people, we also need to be \nable to detain them. Today, many times, because we have no detention \nfacilities, we will say to the people: You must promise to come back in \n60 days for your hearing on illegally entering this country.\n  Well, guess how many come back. Ten percent come back for their \nhearing. What happened to the other 90 percent? We are finding them in \nplaces such as Vermont, New York, and Detroit, MI. That is what \nhappened to them.\n  Mr. President, it would be irresponsible not to take this threat \nseriously. We need these Border Patrol agents. We need the detention \nfacilities. We need to keep these people incarcerated to find out why \nthey are trying to enter our country illegally. Every country has the \nright as a sovereign nation to protect their borders. It is our \nresponsibility to do it.\n  I hope my colleagues will help us pass this amendment and do the \nright thing for homeland security. This is a priority, and it must be a \npriority accepted in this budget.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 219\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next amendment is the amendment of the \nSenator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I send my amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mrs. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 219.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To establish a reserve fund in the event that legislation is \npassed to provide a 50 percent tax credit to employers that continue to \npay the salaries of Guard and Reserve employees who have been called to \n                              active duty)\n\n       On page 40, after line 8 insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DEFICIT NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR PATRIOTIC EMPLOYERS \n                   OF NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND RESERVISTS.\n\n       In the Senate, if a bill or joint resolution, or if an \n     amendment is offered thereto, or if a conference report is \n     submitted thereon, that provides a 50 percent tax credit to \n     employers for compensation paid to employees who are on \n     active duty status as members of the Guard or Reserve in \n     order to make up the difference between the employee's \n     civilian pay and military pay and/or for compensation paid to \n     a worker hired to replace an active duty Guard or Reserve \n     employee, the chairman of the Committee on the Budget shall \n     adjust the revenue aggregates and other appropriate \n     aggregates, levels, and limits in this resolution to reflect \n     such legislation, to the extent that such legislation would \n     not increase the deficit for fiscal year 2006 and for the \n     period of fiscal years 2006 through 2010.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor to lay down an \namendment to provide a place in this budget for the men and women who \nare placing their lives on the line for us.\n  A couple of months ago, before we went on our break in December and \nJanuary, I had the great privilege, actually, of holding this body in a \nfilibuster for 3 days. It was not something\n\n[[Page S2830]]\n\nthat was planned, but it was something that evolved after I found out \nthat the last huge FSC-ETI bill that we passed in the Senate managed to \nfind tax relief, tax cuts, special tax considerations for seemingly \neveryone in America except for the men and women in uniform fighting \nfor us.\n  I know people listening tonight will really not believe what I am \nsaying is true. But they can go to Web sites on this budget to look at \nthe record, or talk to their Guard and National Reserve to see that \nwhat I am saying is actually true.\n  We have passed trillions and trillions of dollars in tax cuts since \n2001. It would be one thing if we were taking money out of the budget \nto do that, but we are actually borrowing money to give tax cuts. We \nare not just taking money that is just sitting there sort of waiting \nfor us to decide how to use it and then giving it to tax cuts based on \nsome reason about who would need it the most. We are borrowing money, \ncharging it to our children and our grandchildren, and then giving tax \ncuts to people who arguably do not need it.\n  Many Democrats have come to the Senate floor and tried to make that \ncase over and over again, and I hope that some of this is getting \nthrough.\n  But whether they are a Democrat, Republican, or Independent, or \nwhether they were for the war in Iraq; whether they think the troops \nshould stay there or come home; or whether they believe there were \nweapons of mass destruction and we went in for the right reasons or \nthere were not and we went in for the wrong reasons, I think \nuniversally in America people believe, no matter what their political \npersuasion, that if we are going to continue to give tax cuts the first \npeople who should get them are the people who are fighting to protect \nus.\n  But in this budget, on page 21, proposed by the President of the \nUnited States, in small print, which I am sorry cannot be picked up by \nthe camera, it says:\n\n       The Committee-reported resolution assumes on-budget \n     revenues are reduced by $70.2 billion over five years.\n\n  The resolution instructs the Senate Finance Committee to basically \ngive out $70 billion in taxes. So if this budget passes the way it is \nnow, $70 billion is going to have to be given out in taxes, in addition \nto the $2 trillion we have already passed--these numbers are just mind-\nboggling; it is impossible for me to describe how much money that is. \nBut this President is intent basically on emptying the Treasury for tax \ncuts. So I have argued that is not what we should do.\n  I believe we should balance the budget. I was one of 50 Senators \ntoday who voted on the only amendment that actually would have gotten \nus there, which was the pay-go amendment. We lost by one vote. So I am \nnot going to make that argument tonight again.\n  I believe that if we are going to give $70 billion in tax cuts, which \nis what this budget instructs us to do, please, Mr. President, could we \nplease give a tax cut to the men and women in uniform? They are the \nones who have left their homes in Louisiana, North Dakota, Tennessee, \nall over the country, and gone to the front lines to fight for us.\n  The sad thing about this is that 40 percent of those men and women \nwho go from the Guard and Reserve take a pay cut to fight for us. It is \ninconceivable to me that this administration, or anybody in the Senate, \nwould stand here tonight and argue for a budget that gives $70 billion \nin additional tax cuts to people who may or may not need them and yet \nat the same time ask our soldiers to go to the front line and take a \npay cut.\n  When we come to the floor and go to the Finance Committee and beg and \nplead on their behalf, could they give them a few pennies, could they \ngive them a few dollars, we are told over and over again, I am sorry, \nwe cannot afford it.\n  The last ``military tax relief'' the Congress passed was a $1.2 \nbillion bill. I wish I could show how tiny that is. I mean, $1.2 \nbillion is a lot of money, but relative to what we are giving out to \neverybody else in tax cuts, it is so small. When we did that bill, I \nwent to them and said: Look, can we do better? Our men and women need \nthis tax break. Their employers are trying to keep their paychecks \nwhole. If we give a tax cut to their employers who are voluntarily \ncontinuing to pay their active duty Guard and Reserve employees' \nsalaries, perhaps they could at least keep their paycheck. We are not \ntalking about extra money; we are just talking about letting them get \ntheir paycheck that they got when they were firemen, policemen, an \narchitect, a doctor, or a lawyer. Let them keep that paycheck.\n  This is not even really for the soldiers, because these guys and gals \nare making the sacrifice. This is to keep their wives, their spouses, \nand their children in their homes, in their automobiles, getting them \nto the doctor.\n  For some reason--I do not know why--this Senate, particularly the \nRepublican leadership, refuses to give a tax credit to the Guard and \nReserve. So the last time a bill came through, I asked: Could you \nplease attach this amendment to it?\n  Sorry, Senator Landrieu, we cannot afford it. We cannot possibly give \nthe Guard and Reserve a tax cut. Do you not understand, we do not have \nany money.\n  I do not know what they are talking about, because this budget is \ngoing to give another $70 billion in tax cuts. So please do not even \nargue with me on the point. I am not going to listen. There is $70 \nbillion given away in this budget again, and I am going to ask for the \n$1.2 billion out of $70 billion--pennies, pennies--for the Guard and \nReserve.\n  Let me tell you how this affects Guard and Reserve families. This is \na letter from Kansas, the State of Senators Brownback and Roberts:\n\n       After 9/11 [my husband] was activated . . . His pay was \n     significantly decreased, his health care was in jeopardy, and \n     I was pregnant. Here was my family, making so many sacrifices \n     for our country and our country wasn't taking care of us at \n     all. How could this be happening?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has consumed her \ntime.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Continuing:\n\n       Luckily, our country may not have been taking care of us \n     under the circumstances, but [my husband's company] was. \n     [They] sent us a check to make up the difference in pay for \n     my husband's entire activation. They deserve to be recognized \n     as a great supporter of our military by receiving this tax \n     credit.\n\n  This tax credit would go to businesses that are doing the patriotic \nthing, helping the Guard and Reserve on the front line, keeping them \nand their families out of bankruptcy, not having to mortgage their \nhouse, not having to give up the car while they are fighting for us. \nThis tax credit is going to benefit the thousands of Guard and Reserve \nin Louisiana and thousands of Guard and Reserve in our country. It is \nunconscionable that the Senate Finance Committee, or this budget, would \ncontemplate yet more tax cuts for everybody in America and leave out \nthe men and women in uniform.\n  What is worse about it is every picture we are in is taken with men \nand women in uniform, with that flag flying, but when it comes to \nputting them in the budget--we can put them in our campaign pictures, \nall right, but we cannot put them in the budget.\n  That is what my amendment does. We are going to vote on it tomorrow. \nIt does not add one penny. It just says to the Finance Committee, go \nahead and give away $70 billion again, but the first $1.2 billion is \ngoing to be given to the men and women in uniform. They deserve it. \nShame on us if we do not put them in.\n  So we are not going to vote on this tonight, but for the Guard and \nReserve in my State, for the Guard and Reserve in New Hampshire, for \nthe Guard and Reserve in South Carolina, North Dakota, and South \nDakota, I hope we will get 100 percent of the Senators to vote on this. \nIf anybody wants to debate it, I will stay here all night and debate it \nas long as anybody wants, but I think my time has been limited.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request to get \nan order for some more proposed amendments. Tomorrow morning, we are \ngoing to convene at 9. Beginning at 9, we have four Members of the \nSenate who are going to be recognized. We are going to return to the \nSmith Medicaid amendment for 60 minutes, then we\n\n[[Page S2831]]\n\nwill go to the Sarbanes CDBG amendment for 15 minutes, then to the \nColeman CDBG amendment for 15 minutes, then Senator Cochran will be \nrecognized for 10 minutes. After that, there are a series of \nindividuals whose amendment time we are confirming but not necessarily \nthe order in which those amendments will come. Those individuals are \nSenator Kennedy on education for 15 minutes; Senators Baucus and \nConrad, agriculture, for 30 minutes; Senator Biden, COPS Program, for \n15 minutes; Senator Feinstein, the SCAAP Program, for 15 minutes; \nSenator Byrd, the Highway Program, for 15 minutes; Senator Snowe, the \nSBA domestic program, for 15 minutes; Senator Clinton, Prevention First \nProgram, for 15 minutes; Senator Lautenberg, the debt limit amendment, \nfor 10 minutes; Senator Conrad and I will reserve 15 minutes each, for \na total of 30 minutes between us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I now yield back the remainder of my time \non this resolution, after the expiration of tonight's debate and after \nthe expiration of the agreement which was just reached.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will retain all of my time.\n  That was a joke. It would be a real interesting day tomorrow, \nwouldn't it?\n  I just think we should make clear that at the end of this evening we \nwill be yielding back on both sides all of our time with the exception \nof the time we have laid out in this agreement. Is that correct?\n  Mr. GREGG. Can we do it right now?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. We both yield back all of our time, as proposed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. So ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I could briefly describe to my colleagues the \nnegotiation we have had this evening? I know there will be colleagues \nwho will come tomorrow who will be disappointed. Senator Gregg and I \napologize to them in advance. Here is the circumstance that we \nconfront. We have over 70 amendments still pending, not counting the \n20-some amendments we have in the queue. If we just do the math, that \nis 90 amendments. We can do three amendments an hour. That would be 30 \nhours of steady voting. If we start at 1 o'clock tomorrow and we have \nto go 30 hours, do the math.\n  What Senator Gregg and I have tried to do is to at least begin the \nprocess at 1 o'clock tomorrow afternoon or thereabouts. Again, for \ncolleagues who are disappointed, I apologize. I know Senator Gregg \nfeels the same way. We would like to have every colleague get all of \nthe time they desire. It is just not possible and reach conclusion.\n  One other thing I should say to my colleagues, for those who think, \ncouldn't we just go over into Friday morning? We have a number of \ncolleagues who, because of funerals, because of health conditions, \ncannot be here Friday morning. That means if we do not finish tomorrow \nnight, we are going to be here Friday night. I do not think anybody who \nhas been through this process doesn't understand if we are here Friday \nnight we are going to be here Saturday.\n  To colleagues who are disappointed, I am sorry, but we have done our \nlevel best to give people some amount of time to offer their \namendments. I think we have done it in as fair and as equitable a way \nas is possible.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I do not wish to take time off of Senator \nSalazar's time, but I want to affirm what the Senator from North Dakota \nhas said. I also want to thank the ranking member of the Senate \ncommittee and the Democratic leader and, of course, the Republican \nleader for working very hard to bring about this understanding as to \nhow we are going to proceed on the budget. I think it is the fairest \nway to proceed, and it does allow the Members to get many of the core \nissues up and debated. That has been the key here, to make sure the \nhigh-visibility issues and the issues that are critical get up and get \ndebated, in the context of the fact that we know these vote-athons take \na huge amount of time.\n  Right now, if we start voting on the present number of amendments we \nhave pending, we will have to vote for 30 straight hours. Obviously, we \nhope that will not happen, but that is a distinct possibility, that a \nlarge percentage of that time will have to be consumed in votes. So we \nneed to get started fairly early tomorrow. That is the purpose of this \nagreement, so that we can get out of here very late, probably, or very \nearly Friday morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 215\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 215, which I \nfiled earlier this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Salazar] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 215.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide additional funding for rural education, rural \n           health access, and rural health outreach programs)\n\n       On page 9, line 15, decrease the amount by $65,000,000.\n       On page 9, line 16, decrease the amount by $14,000,000.\n       On page 9, line 20, decrease the amount by $36,000,000.\n       On page 9, line 24, decrease the amount by $12,000,000.\n       On page 10, line 3, decrease the amount by $3,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 16, increase the amount by $29,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 17, increase the amount by $1,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 21, increase the amount by $17,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 25, increase the amount by $9,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 4, increase the amount by $2,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 16, increase the amount by $36,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 17, increase the amount by $13,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 21, increase the amount by $19,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 25, increase the amount by $3,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 4, increase the amount by $1,000,000.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise tonight at this late date to talk \nabout forgotten America, the rural parts of our United States, and to \naddress the issues of education and health care in rural America.\n  Let me say I want to extend my appreciation and thanks to Senator \nConrad and Senator Collins for their work on these issues in the past. \nI look forward to having their support as we move forward with these \namendments.\n  My amendment will increase funding for the Rural Education \nAchievement Program, a program that came about through bipartisan \nefforts that recognize that our rural schools need our help. REAP \nprovides supplemental funding for rural school districts which face \nsignificant challenges.\n  Let me just say that as we look at the issue of education in rural \ncommunities and we look at the issue of health care in rural \ncommunities, we have to understand that there is a part of the United \nStates of America that has been forgotten, frankly, under both \nRepublican and Democratic administrations. Across the country, some \n3,000 counties continue to wither on the vine, where the people who \nlive in those counties, who are mostly agriculturally dependent, do not \nhave the infrastructure or the capacity to address the real needs that \nare affecting them every day. Those include the issues of education and \nthe issues of health care.\n  I come from what is one of the poorest counties in America, the \nCounty of Conejos. That county has been the poorest county in the \nUnited States for a number of different years, so I know firsthand the \nkinds of challenges that are faced by communities like those \ncommunities in Conejos County. Across rural America, no matter where \nyou go, no matter what State you are in, you are going to find these \nkinds of counties.\n  The two areas we address here with the amendment are education and \nhealth care. First of all, with respect to rural education, a few facts \nabout our rural school districts. Our school districts in rural America \naccount for about one-half of the school districts in our Nation. Rural \nschool districts tend to be the poorest in the Nation. They average \nless than 40 percent of the per pupil spending in our urban school \ndistricts. Rural school districts have less\n\n[[Page S2832]]\n\naccess to technology, computers, and the Internet than their urban \ncounterparts and, thus, are at risk of being left behind in our global \neconomy.\n  Rural school districts tend to have higher dropout rates than their \nurban counterparts. Rural schoolteachers tend to make an average of 15 \npercent less than urban schoolteachers. Despite decreased pay, rural \nschoolteachers teach more subjects than their urban counterparts, and \nrural school districts face significant problems with teacher retention \nand face serious problems in meeting the Federal Government's \ndefinition of ``highly qualified'' under the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  Those of us who have traveled throughout this country, who have been \nin many of these rural school districts, know that educational \nopportunity being brought about for the students in rural schools is \nvery different from that in urban schools. We know that in rural \nschools they do not have the teachers or the kinds of facilities--the \ncomputer technology, the swimming pools, the other parts of the \nphysical facilities--that you find in the wealthier urban settings. So \nthis amendment is a simple statement about the investment needed to \nhelp us have the kind of educational opportunity for the children of \nAmerica who live in the rural parts of our country that have become the \nforgotten America.\n  My amendment also addresses the issue of rural health care, restoring \nfunding for the Rural Health Outreach Program, and increases funding \nfor the State Offices of Rural Health Program. These are two programs \nthat are helping us address the health care issues that are faced in \nrural America. These programs enable the communities to partner with \nuniversities, with private practitioners, with hospitals and medical \nproviders to make sure we address rural health care in the way that it \nis lacking in rural communities.\n  Let me say a word about the circumstance relating to rural health \ncare. In Colorado, in many of my counties, there is only one nurse \npractitioner for the entire county. On the western part of our State, \nin Grand Junction, CO, veterans wait up to 5 months in order to see a \ndoctor.\n  In Colorado, 756,000 of our citizens are uninsured, and a good \nmajority of them live in rural areas. When they get sick, they either \ncannot afford to see a doctor or there is a shortage of physicians for \nthem to see. Rural Coloradians tend to have more health care problems \nso that the lack of health care is life threatening.\n  We know health care access in our rural communities is in crisis. A \nfew facts bear this out. Forty-five million Americans have no health \ninsurance at all, but 10.2 million of those 45 million Americans live \nin rural America; 10.2 million of those 45 million Americans live in \nrural America.\n  Americans living in rural communities face some of the greatest \nchallenges in obtaining and keeping health insurance.\n  There are many communities across my State--and I am sure across \nAmerica--where families in rural communities simply cannot get health \ninsurance, and when they get health insurance they have to pay anywhere \nfrom $1,000 to $2,000 a month just to keep that health insurance.\n  Rural residents are more likely to be covered by Medicaid than their \nurban counterparts. Residents in rural communities have less access to \nmedical services because there is such a critical shortage of doctors \nin rural communities across our country.\n  My amendment will restore some of that funding so that our \ncommunities in forgotten America can continue to develop innovative \nprograms to increase access to healthcare.\n  Let me conclude by saying this is a simple step to help us put the \nspotlight on the problems that are faced by rural America today. This \nis not a Republican or a Democratic issue. This is an issue where \nDemocrats and Republicans should stand up and say that we value \neducation in our rural communities and in our rural schools, that we \nunderstand the major problems of healthcare that are faced in our rural \ncommunities, and that we will stand up to make sure that we are \naddressing those issues of healthcare in rural America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Conrad be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, can you advise us of the time remaining on \nthis amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 37 seconds in favor of the amendment, \n7\\1/2\\ in opposition.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask my colleague if I could have 1 minute of his time \non this amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. You can have all of it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is very kind. I will take just a minute.\n  I thank Senator Salazar for offering this amendment. This amendment \nis important to rural States such as mine. This amendment makes a real \ndifference in States such as North Dakota and Colorado in rural \neducation and in funding for rural healthcare outreach.\n  Senator Salazar has proposed an offset to take some of the very \nsignificant increase in international affairs and redirect it to rural \nAmerica. Rural America is hurting in many parts of this Nation.\n  Right at the heart of the need for revitalization is education and \nhealthcare. Those are two of the areas that have been targeted by \nSenator Salazar's amendment.\n  This is a very modest amount of money, but it sends a big signal. I \nhope my colleagues can find it possible to support this amendment.\n  I thank Senator Salazar for his leadership.\n  At this moment, I would like to call up Senator Dorgan's amendment \nNo. 210 so that it is formally noticed and in the queue. We don't need \nto say any more about it. It will be part of the voting sequence \ntomorrow, and Senator Dorgan will have a chance to describe his \namendment. Somebody will have a chance to say something on the other \nside.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe Senator Lieberman will be next. I \nthink he is probably on his way. We are running a little ahead of \nschedule.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 210\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, apparently Senator Dorgan's amendment No. \n210 was not reported so we ask to call it up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], for Mr. Dorgan, \n     for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n     Kennedy, and Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 210.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To repeal the tax subsidy for certain domestic companies \n which move manufacturing operations and American jobs offshore and to \nuse the resulting revenues to reduce Federal deficits and debt by $3.2 \n                         billion over 5 years)\n\n       On page 3, line 10, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 11, increase the amount by $600,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 12, increase the amount by $700,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by $700,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 14, increase the amount by $700,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 19, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 20, increase the amount by $600,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 21, increase the amount by $700,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 1, increase the amount by $700,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 2, increase the amount by $700,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 24, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 25, increase the amount by $600,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 1, increase the amount by $700,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 2, increase the amount by $700,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 3, increase the amount by $700,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, decrease the amount by $500,000,000.\n\n[[Page S2833]]\n\n       On page 5, line 8, decrease the amount by $1,100,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 9, decrease the amount by $1,800,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, decrease the amount by $2,500,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, decrease the amount by $3,200,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 15, decrease the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 16, decrease the amount by $1,100,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 17, decrease the amount by $1,800,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 18, decrease the amount by $2,500,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 19, decrease the amount by $3,200,000,000.\n       On page 30, line 16, decrease the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 30, line 17, decrease the amount by $3,200,000,000.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Lieberman, and myself, I send an amendment to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for Mr. Lieberman, \n     for himself and Ms. Collins, proposes an amendment numbered \n     220.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To protect the American people from terrorist attacks by \nrestoring $565 million in cuts to vital first responder programs in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, including the State Homeland Security \n Grant program, by providing $150 million for port security grants and \n by providing $140 million to allow for 1000 new border patrol agents)\n\n       On page 16 line 15, increase the amount by $715,000,000.\n       On page 16 line 16, increase the amount by $102,000,000.\n       On page 16 line 20, increase the amount by $254,000,000.\n       On page 16 line 24, increase the amount by $220,000,000.\n       On page 17 line 3, increase the amount by $139,000,000.\n       On page 23 line 16, increase the amount by $140,000,000.\n       On page 23 line 17, increase the amount by $112,000,000.\n       On page 23 line 21, increase the amount by $14,000,000.\n       On page 23 line 25, increase the amount by $14,000,000.\n       On page 26 line 14, decrease the amount by $855,000,000.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend and \ncolleague from Connecticut in offering an amendment to restore funding \nfor the Department of Homeland Security's first responder programs to \nincrease security at our country's borders and to better secure our \nNation's seaports.\n  The administration's budget, unfortunately, would impose severe \nreductions in grant funding for our first responders, those who are on \nthe front lines in the war on terrorism.\n  Our amendment restores funding by adding a total of $855 million for \nHomeland Security funding. This includes $565 million for State \nHomeland Security programs that support our first responders, $150 \nmillion for port security grants, and $140 million to hire 1,000 \nadditional Border Patrol agents.\n  Our amendment does not provide excessive funding. In fact, it is \nmodest in scope. It would simply restore funding to last year's levels \nfor Homeland Security grant programs such as State Homeland Security \ngrants, the Fire Grant Program, and the Law Enforcement Terrorism \nPrevention Program.\n  The amendment will ensure at least the same amount of funding for our \nNation's ports as last year, and it takes a modest first step toward \nincreasing the number of border patrol agents as authorized by the \nCollins-Lieberman Intelligence Reform Act. I note that bill authorized \nthe hiring of 2,000 additional Border Patrol agents. Our amendment \nauthorizes the hiring of only 1,000 additional agents. I note that \nother Senators this evening, including the soon to be Presiding \nOfficer, have also expressed the support for increasing the number of \nBorder Patrol agents.\n  This amendment is also offset by reductions in the allowances \naccount, so it will not increase the deficit.\n  It is a responsible amendment. As we set priorities through this \nbudget resolution, we are faced with many worthy and competing needs \nand programs. But surely along with national defense improving the \nsecurity of our homeland must be a priority, and that means providing \nadequate assistance to those who are on the front lines: Our \nfirefighters, police officers, emergency medical personnel, State and \nlocal law enforcement, and emergency managers.\n  Former Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge perhaps put it best \nwhen he said that Homeland Security starts with hometown security. \nImproving our preparedness is an investment that we must make to \nstrengthen our ability to prevent, detect, and respond if required to \nterrorist attacks. After all, if the worst happens and we are subject \nto another attack from terrorists, our citizens are not going to dial \nthe Washington, DC area code. They are going to pick up their phones \nand dial 9-1-1.\n  We should always remember who is first on the scene when disaster \nstrikes. We have an obligation to help our first responders be \nprepared--as well prepared as we can be--because that strengthens the \npreparedness of our Nation.\n  Again, this is a modest amendment. There have been other proposals to \nincrease Homeland Security grant funding by billions of dollars.\n  I recognize we have to strike a balance, that we are operating in an \nenvironment of severe budget constraints. That is why Senator Lieberman \nand I have joined forces to propose what truly is a modest amendment, \nto simply restore funding to last year's levels.\n  I think it is the least we can do. I do expect the Senator from \nConnecticut to be here shortly. I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that under the \nprior agreement which was entered into by myself and Senator Conrad the \ntime be used in its usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 220\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am honored to rise to speak on behalf \nof the amendment my distinguished colleague and friend Senator Collins \nof Maine has offered to this budget resolution. This amendment will \nmake sure adequate funding is provided for key programs at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  I am very grateful to Senator Collins, who is the chair of the newly \nnamed Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. I am \nprivileged to serve as the ranking Democrat on that committee. I am \nvery glad to join with Senator Collins in offering this amendment \nbecause it continues the statement that when it comes to security, \nwhether in the world through the Armed Services Committee or here at \nhome through the Homeland Security Committee, we ought to act in a \nbipartisan, nonpartisan fashion.\n  This is genuinely a bipartisan amendment. This amendment and the \nincreases it provides would be paid for by reducing administrative \nexpenses and would not increase the deficit. It would\n\n[[Page S2834]]\n\nprovide an additional $855 million that we believe is vitally needed to \nprepare our first responders, to secure our ports, and to strengthen \nour borders.\n  Our intelligence and security experts tell us the threat of terrorist \nattack here at home is one we are going to have to live with for some \ntime to come. The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Porter \nGoss, recently said ``it may only be a matter of time'' before \nterrorists strike again within the United States with weapons of mass \ndestruction. And new intelligence informs us that the Jordanian \nterrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, now affiliated with Osama bin Laden, \nleading a group of terrorists in Iraq, may have conferred with bin \nLaden about attacks within the United States at nonobvious targets \nspread throughout this country of ours.\n  The fact is, we remain vulnerable. We are safer, as the 9/11 \nCommission said in its report last year, than we were on 9/11, but we \nare still not yet fully safe.\n  In a recent letter to the Senate Budget Committee, looking at what I \ntook to be the needs of our country with regard to homeland security, I \nrecommended an additional $8.4 billion in homeland security spending \ngovernmentwide, with $4.2 billion going to first responders.\n  In the current context, that is a large number, but I truly believe \nevery dollar would have been well spent and would have improved and \nincreased our sense of security from terrorism here at home.\n  The fact is, we have the best military in the world, in the history \nof the world, as we have seen in Afghanistan and Iraq in recent years. \nOne of the reasons we do, in addition to the extraordinary commitment, \nskill, and bravery of our personnel, is we have been willing to invest \nmoney to provide that first-rate defense.\n  The same is true here at home. We will not become secure on the \ncheap. I understand that the $8.4 billion I proposed in my letter to \nthe Budget Committee is not going to find majority support here on the \nSenate floor. But surely we can agree not to go backwards. Although the \nadministration has recommended increases, some of them targeted to \nhomeland security programs, in its fiscal year 2006 budget, those \nincreases are very modest and very few. And, unfortunately, the \nproposed budget would actually cut key Department of Homeland Security \nfirst responder programs by 32 percent.\n  It has been said before, but it cannot be said often enough, that our \nfirst responders are on the front lines of the war on terror here at \nhome. In fact, they are more than our first responders. They can be \nhundreds of thousands of additional first preventers. We must give them \nwhat they need to do their jobs effectively for us. That means dollars \nto help train and equip State and local police, firefighters, and \nemergency medical technicians to be first responders, preventers, and \nto help detect or disrupt terrorist activity before an attack, and \ndollars to ensure that should an attack occur, these men and women who \nserve us will have the training and the equipment they need to respond, \nto save lives, to localize the damage.\n  State and localities across our country are using a lot of their own \nmoney and taking a lot of initiative on their own to prepare to defend \nagainst terrorist attack. But they cannot do it alone, nor should they \nhave to. Therefore, the amendment Senator Collins and I are proposing \nthis evening would provide $565 million to restore the administration's \nproposed cuts to Homeland Security Department first responder programs, \nto get us back to where we have been.\n  That would include State homeland security grants, firefighter \ngrants, and emergency management planning grants. Maintaining these \nprograms at their current levels is the least we can do given the \nenormous demands on our first responders in our municipalities and \nStates.\n  Mr. President, the Council on Foreign Relations Task Force, headed by \nour former colleague, Senator Warren Rudman, as an example of one \nstandard of expenditures possibly necessary here, called for nearly \n$100 billion over 5 years just to prepare first responders. A recent \nsurvey by the National Governors Association found that communications \ninteroperability is the top homeland security priority for many States. \nThat is as it says. How can we make sure that in a moment of crisis \nthose first responders from different agencies and different \njurisdictions can, in fact, communicate with one another? Only a few \nStates have achieved that interoperability because it is so expensive.\n  Just last week, New York's Center for Catastrophe Preparedness and \nResponse reported that emergency medical services personnel generally \nlack not only proper equipment but also proper training.\n  Without more support, our first responders simply will not be able to \nprovide the help we need if terror strikes.\n  Second, in our amendment, Senator Collins and I also provide for $150 \nmillion in dedicated funding for port security. The budget resolution \nprovides none--no funds--in this area. It is hard to overstate the \nimportance of our ports to our economy and transportation network. \nNinety-five percent of all our trade flows through our ports, and a \npotential terrorist attack at one of them would cause economic havoc \nfor our country. In fact, the U.S. Coast Guard has estimated it will \ncost more than $7 billion to effectively secure America's ports.\n  Unfortunately, this budget does not guarantee any spending for port \nsecurity. Rather, it combines a large array of homeland security \nneeds--including port security--into a catch-all fund for \ninfrastructure protection. This fund is too small to cover all \ninfrastructure protection needs. Therefore, the amendment that Senator \nCollins and I introduce tonight would guarantee that port security gets \nat least the fiscal year 2005 level of $150 million.\n  Finally, border security. The 9/11 Commission bill passed by Congress \nand signed by the President at the end of last year authorized 2,000 \nnew Border Patrol agents for this year. The President's budget funds \nonly 210 new agents. These new hires, as I see them, would basically \nreplace agents who were moved from the southern border to beef up \nstaffing at the northern border.\n  Our amendment would provide $140 million for border security. That \nwould allow the Department of Homeland Security to hire 1,000 new \nagents in the coming fiscal year, which I am confident--and Senator \nCollins is, too--would be enough to make a noticeable difference in our \nborder defenses.\n  Mr. President, bottom line: This is a modest proposal. In large part, \nit is a status quo proposal, keeping us at least where we have been and \nnot moving backward. The experts have told us that we need to invest \nbillions more than we are. We are still learning of new vulnerabilities \nall the time. We cannot afford to retreat in our efforts, when we know \nthere is still a great distance to go before our first responders are \nwell prepared and other gaps at our borders and ports are closed.\n  That is the intention of this bipartisan amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it. I thank the Chair and I thank Senator Collins \nfor her leadership once again in proposing this amendment. I am proud \nto stand with her on this, as I have on so many other matters.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the time situation on this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time agreement on this amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thought we had a half hour from 9 o'clock to 9:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That was not formally locked in.\n  Mr. GREGG. Assuming we had a half hour, how much time would be \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There would be 12 minutes left.\n  Mr. GREGG. So I would have 12 minutes, theoretically?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, 12 minutes is left in the total half \nhour. The Senator would control that entire 12 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I notice that the Senator from Louisiana has an amendment. \nI think the Senators offering the amendment have completed their \nstatements.\n  Ms. COLLINS. We are ready to rebut anything that might be said in \nopposition. But if there were no one speaking in opposition, I would be \nhappy to conclude my remarks.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator. I will give her the opportunity to \nrebut briefly. I will speak briefly in opposition, so that we can move \nto the Senator from Louisiana.\n\n[[Page S2835]]\n\n  Mr. President, this amendment is well-intentioned. Obviously, first \nresponders and the homeland security issues are major issues for us as \na nation. We have done a significant amount in this area and, of \ncourse, there is a supplemental bouncing around the hallways that has a \nsignificant amount of increase for a number of homeland security \ninitiatives.\n  Earlier this evening, we did an amendment offered by the Senator in \nthe chair and the Senator from Texas, which would add 2,000 border \nagents. This adds 1,000 border agents. I am not sure when we stop \nadding border agents tonight. I am thinking maybe there should be a \nbudget point of order that you can only add up to, say, 10,000 or \n20,000 border agents in any one given evening.\n  But as a practical matter, it seems to me that we are getting a \nlittle carried away with the border agent additions--even in the \ncontext of making political statements.\n  The amendment itself takes the money out of the 920 fund. I think it \nis important that people understand that the 920 fund--when you \nauthorize funds out of the 920 fund, you are saying essentially there \nwill be an across-the-board cut in all other accounts of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  This amendment, which has approximately $800 million in it--or \nsomething like that--would mean that since it is a discretionary \nnumber, half of that would be assessed against the Department of \nDefense, which would mean you would be cutting DOD by $100 million, \neducation by around $20 million, health care by about $140 million, \n$150 million. You would be cutting environmental protection by probably \n$100 million--and so on and so on because it is an across-the-board \ncut. It has to come from these other accounts on the discretionary side \nof the ledger. In fact, the education cut would be bigger, much bigger.\n  Obviously, we have to make choices, and this amendment has decided \nthat homeland security and adding another 1,000 agents on top of the \n2,000 already proposed is a priority. But I think it is important that \npeople understand that this is not a situation where the money grows on \ntrees. It comes from taxpayers, and we are trying to limit the amount \nof money that taxpayers have to spend. Therefore, choices have to be \nmade.\n  This amendment essentially requires that other accounts of the \nFederal Government, which have some priority also, such as defense, \neducation, health care, and environmental protection, will be reduced \nwere this amendment to actually be carried to its natural fruition, \nwhich I hope it will not be. That being the case, I will reserve my \ntime and, hopefully, we can move on to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Does the Senator from Maine wish to comment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if I could just make a couple of comments \nin response to the Senator from New Hampshire. I will be very quick \nbecause I know the Senator from Louisiana has been waiting.\n  It will be up to the Appropriations Committee to decide how to \nallocate the cuts that we are proposing in the allowances account. It \nwould not necessarily cut across the board equally. In fact, almost \ncertainly it would not, because the Appropriations Committee will set \npriorities.\n  The second point that I want to make has to do with the number of \nborder agents proposed in our amendment. I think that it demonstrates \nhow modest the amendment is that the Senator from Connecticut and I \nhave offered. After all, even though our legislation, the intelligence \nreform bill, authorized 2,000 additional Border Patrol agents, because \nwe recognized the constraints of the budget we have proposed only going \nhalfway toward that goal, and that is why we chose to authorize just \n1,000 additional border agents. It is in recognition of the budget \nconstraints under which we are operating.\n  So I think the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee \nactually helps make the point of how reasonable our approach is, that \nwe chose to go for a more modest number than the previous amendment \nthat was debated this evening.\n  Furthermore, I point out that that amendment, to the best of my \nknowledge, was not accepted this evening. It is still a pending \namendment.\n  So this is about setting priorities, and surely we can provide \nfunding just equal to last year's--we are not even proposing an \ninflation increase--to ensure that we continue to strengthen the \npreparedness of this Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 223\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I call up amendment No. 223 which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk which report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 223.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that Congress should \n       provide dedicated funding for port security enhancements)\n\n       On page 63, strike line 24, after the second period insert \n     the following: ``In dealing with homeland security assistance \n     grants that relate to port security, Congress should (1) \n     allocate port security grants under a separate, dedicated \n     program intended specifically for port security enhancements, \n     rather than as part of a combined program for many different \n     infrastructure programs that could lead to reduced funding \n     for port security, (2) devise a method to enable the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security to both distribute port \n     security grants to the Nation's port facilities more quickly \n     and efficiently and give ports the financial resources needed \n     to comply with congressional mandates, and (3) allocate \n     sufficient funding for port security to enable port \n     authorities to comply with mandated security improvements, \n     ensure the protection of our Nation's maritime \n     transportation, commerce system, and cruise passengers, \n     strive to achieve funds consistent with the needs estimated \n     by the United States Coast Guard, and recognize the unique \n     threats for which port authorities must prepare.''.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this amendment addresses the very \nimportant issue of port security which was spoken about a few minutes \nago by another Senator. I am very concerned that the President's budget \nsubmission does not fully advance port security because it would merge \nthe present support security grant program with other homeland security \ninfrastructure programs. This amendment would address this issue.\n  Ports are vital to our Nation and our economy. There are 361 public \nports in the U.S. handling over 95 percent of our overseas trade. That \naccounts for 2 billion tons, $800 billion of domestic and international \nfreight annually. Ports and their maritime industry partners currently \nmake up 27 percent of the GDP, and within the next 15 years many \npredict the amount of cargo that U.S. ports will handle will double. At \nthat rate, our port facilities would account for as much as one-third \nof our GDP.\n  Of course, ports do not only handle imports and exports but also 7 \nmillion cruise ship passengers and 113 million passengers on ferries \nevery year. Ports play a vitally important role in the war on terror. \nMany of our ports are vital to the deployment of our troops, and all of \nour ports are needed for sustainment cargo. The ports themselves supply \n4 million jobs.\n  In my home State of Louisiana they are particularly important. They \nare a vital part of our way of life and our economy. We have 5 of the \n15 busiest single ports in the Nation. As a Nation, 50 percent of our \nagricultural products go through our ports.\n  For all of these reasons, ports are an enormous target for the bad \nguys, for the terrorists. Therefore, we have been focusing, with good \nreason, on port security.\n  The problem is, the President's current budget submission would merge \na current and very important port security grant program into other \ninfrastructure programs. I think that would lose tremendous focus in \nthe effort to beef up our port security and get the job done at our \nNation's ports. My amendment would address that by doing several \nthings.\n  First and most importantly, it would state the sense of the Senate \nthat port security grants should not be combined with those other \ninfrastructure programs. Again, we would lose focus by merging port \nsecurity with all of those other programs.\n  Secondly, my amendment would say that Congress should determine a\n\n[[Page S2836]]\n\nmethod to enable the Department of Homeland Security to more \nefficiently and more quickly deliver port security grants to our \nNation's ports.\n  Third, the amendment states that Congress should state funding levels \nthat would strive to get the full job done as estimated by the experts, \nthe U.S. Coast Guard. The Coast Guard says that at least $7 billion is \nneeded to make enhancements to our ports, although some experts say \nthat might be as high as $16 billion.\n  So I encourage all Senators to support this amendment and help ensure \nthat this important port security grant program is not merged and \nsubsumed into a more general program.\n  I reserve any remaining time which I have, which I would like to use \nto talk about another amendment in a minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes remaining.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 224\n\n  Mr. VITTER. At this point I call up amendment No. 224, at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 224.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To restore funding for Corps of Engineers environmental \n   programs to fiscal year 2005 levels, and to offset that increase \n           through reductions in general Government spending)\n\n       On page 12, line 15, increase the amount by $130,000,000.\n       On page 12, line 16, increase the amount by $91,000,000.\n       On page 12, line 19, increase the amount by $130,000,000.\n       On page 12, line 20, increase the amount by $130,000,000.\n       On page 12, line 23, increase the amount by $130,000,000.\n       On page 12, line 24, increase the amount by $130,000,000.\n       On page 13, line 2, increase the amount by $130,000,000.\n       On page 13, line 3, increase the amount by $130,000,000.\n       On page 13, line 6, increase the amount by $130,000,000.\n       On page 13, line 7, increase the amount by $130,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 16, decrease the amount by $130,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 17, decrease the amount by $97,500,000.\n       On page 24, line 20, decrease the amount by $130,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 21, decrease the amount by $130,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 24, decrease the amount by $130,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 25, decrease the amount by $130,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 3, decrease the amount by $130,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 4, decrease the amount by $130,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 7, decrease the amount by $130,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 8, decrease the amount by $130,000,000.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this separate amendment numbered 224 is \nanother vitally important part of the budget, which is the budget for \nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This amendment would increase funding \nof the Corps of Engineers to nearly last year's levels. Unfortunately, \nthe President has proposed a significant, $130 billion cut from last \nyear's levels. This would simply stay steady from last year's levels, \nusing full offsets so that it would not change the overall top-line \nnumber of the budget.\n  The Corps of Engineers' mission is vitally important to the country \nin two areas in particular--first, for a lot of environmental purposes. \nThis certainly affects Louisiana. In Louisiana, this Corps funding is \ncritically important as we literally fight for our life in the fight \nagainst coastal erosion.\n  As noted by the President himself, over the past 75 years more than 1 \nmillion acres of Louisiana coastal plain have been lost into the Gulf \nof Mexico. Another third of a million could be lost by 2050.\n  This is such a crisis that we lose a football field of land, which is \na fair amount of land, every 38 minutes. That clock does not stop. It \nis 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year.\n  This, of course, is just related to Louisiana. There are other \nvitally important environmental projects that the Corps is focused on \noutside of Louisiana, such as the Florida Everglades, upper \nMississippi, and many other important projects.\n  The second area for which the Corps is vitally important is water \nprojects that build and maintain waterways around the country. That \ngoes directly to the maritime sector of our economy and our national \neconomy and economic growth. The Corps builds and maintains and \noperates 8,000 water projects across the country. Every year it dredges \n900 harbors, operates 275 locks and dams, 75 hydropower facilities, and \nit manages 4,300 recreation areas. All of this is very important to our \ncountry, our way of life and our economy. An enormous part of the \neconomy is maintained by that important work of the Corps.\n  That is why I believe cutting the Corps' budget in real dollar \namounts, by $130 million, is not the way to go. It would hurt our \neconomy. It would hurt economic growth. So my amendment would simply \npropose to restore the Corps of Engineers' funding to last year's \nlevel--no more, what was actually appropriated last year.\n  It is important to note that my amendment contains a full offset and \nthat would be a decrease in funding from the General Government \naccount. This would be a 0.7 percent reduction in that account, an \naccount which has been increased 8 percent, double the rate of \ninflation from last year.\n  I think this is the right thing to do. I urge all my fellow Senators \nto support this amendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 197, As Modified\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I will be sending an amendment to the desk \nand will ask for its immediate consideration. But while a final \nmodification is being made, I will speak on the amendment. Once its \nbeen modified, I will ask to call up for consideration.\n  The amendment I am offering to the budget resolution this evening \nwould provide additional funding for the Aeronautics Program at NASA. \nThere has been much talk over the last 3 days about how Congress's \nbudget is a representation of our Nation's priorities. If that is the \ncase, I believe the priorities in this budget proposal are far out of \nplace regarding our Nation's commitment to aeronautics research and \ndevelopment.\n  Aeronautics is a very vital and important science to our country. It \nprovides vital innovations and breakthroughs in military and commercial \naviation. Our Nation, from the beginning of flight, from the Wright \nbrothers until very recently, has been unrivaled in military aviation \npower because of the research and development we have undertaken in the \nfield of aeronautics.\n  My colleague from Virginia, Senator John Warner, and Senator DeWine \nof Ohio are joining me in offering this amendment, which will restore \nvitally needed funds for the NASA Aeronautics Program.\n  The administration's 2006 budget proposes to cut over $700 million \nout of NASA's aeronautics budget over the next 5 years--$700 million \nover the next 5 years. That will reduce the effective levels of NASA's \naeronautics investment to about half of the level that it is today. \nToday's level is about half the level that the funding, adjusted for \ninflation, was just a decade ago. So a decade ago there was an amount, \nthat has been cut in half, and this proposal is to cut it in half \nagain, which, in effect, means we have a quarter of the budget in \nresearch and development in aeronautics that we had just 10 years ago.\n\n  In fact, the fiscal year 2006 budget calls for eliminating NASA's \nentire Vehicle Systems Program, the very initiative that over the last \n5 decades has provided major technology advances that have been used on \nevery major civilian and military aircraft over that period of time. \nThe Vehicle Systems Program is a vitally important aspect of NASA, \naeronautics, and our country.\n  I am a competitive person. I think this country needs to be a leader \nin innovation and technology, whether that is nanotechnology, which is \na key technology for the future in a variety of areas from life \nsciences to medical sciences to energy to microelectronics.\n  Another key area for our country's competitiveness and our security \nin the future is aeronautics. The share of the United States of global \ncommercial aviation sales has been declining for\n\n[[Page S2837]]\n\nthe better part of the last three decades, dropping from 90 percent of \nmarket share in 1940 to just over 45 percent last year. In fact, last \nyear was the first time the United States was not first in sales of \ncommercial aircraft.\n  Despite this decline in market share, U.S. commercial aviation is one \nof the few areas of U.S. manufacturing where we actually have a \npositive balance of trade. The administration's proposal is \nshortsighted, and the kind of ``penny wise, pound foolish'' idea that \nwill hinder the United States's economic growth and eliminate any \nchance that our commercial aviation industry will be able to regain \nmarket share against our global competitors.\n  Make no mistake, the European Airbus consortium has a specific, \ntargeted, and funded effort to achieve overwhelming dominance of the \ncommercial aviation market by the year 2020.\n  My amendment sends a message. The message is that as this year's \nbudget process plays out, this Senator and my colleagues as well as \ncolleagues from many parts of our country are going to fight the \nproposed unwise, harmful cuts to aeronautics research and development. \nI do not think Americans like losing in aeronautics. Our goal is not \nonly to stop these cuts but also to build a national consensus towards \ninvesting even more in aeronautics at NASA.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have additional information \nprinted in the Record on why aeronautics research is important to our \nNation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     The Importance of Aeronautics\n\n       1. Aeronautics is important to the safety of the nation's \n     flying public because:\n       Air traffic will nearly double in the next decade and will \n     triple in 20 years.\n       If you calculate out today's accident rate to the number of \n     flights we will have 20 years from now, we will have a major \n     accident once per week, an unacceptable rate.\n       Our interstate highway and railroad systems, which are \n     already less safe than flying, are also already exceeding \n     capacity and require a huge investment in infrastructure to \n     meet anticipated demand.\n       2. Aeronautics is important to our national defense \n     because:\n       Every military aircraft design the U.S. military currently \n     flies incorporates advanced technologies that were developed \n     at NASA Research Centers.\n       NASA engineers have developed military innovations such as \n     shaping for stealth; multi-axis thrust vectoring exhaust \n     nozzles integrated with aircraft flight-control systems; fly-\n     by-wire flight control technologies; high-strength and high-\n     stiffness fiber composite structures; and tilt-wing \n     rotorcraft technology.\n       Losing experienced NASA aeronautics engineers and \n     discouraging young engineers from entering this field only \n     harms our national expertise in cutting edge aviation \n     systems.\n       3. Aeronautics is important to our economy because:\n       The U.S. aerospace and aviation industry employed 2 million \n     workers in 2001. These workers earn incomes that are 35% \n     higher that the average income in the U.S.\n       The U.S. is losing serious market share in aviation to \n     Europe; U.S. market share has dropped from 70 to 50 percent \n     in just a decade. The Europeans' ``Aeronautics Vision for \n     2020'' plans include them gaining irreversible dominance in \n     civil aviation manufacturing.\n       Many aerospace and aviation industry segments have lost \n     jobs since 1996, and the manufacturing sector of this \n     industry has lost 67,000 jobs since 1998 alone.\n       The aviation industry has the largest positive balance of \n     trade of all U.S. industries ($33 billion in 1999).\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, this amendment would provide a relatively \nmodest increase to the NASA program that has been proposed to be \ndrastically cut in this budget. The Vehicle Systems Program conducts \nresearch on the feasibility of hypersonic flight. Hypersonic fight is \nspeed beyond Mach 5, and also research on the development of zero \nemissions aircraft. The National Institute of Aeronautics is expected \nto release a report finding the need for increased aeronautics \ninvestment and specifically on greater focus on NASA's vehicle systems \nprograms.\n  The amendment I will be offering would meet these recommendations \nover the next 5 years.\n  As I stated, the increases are relatively modest. For fiscal 2006, \nthe amendment calls for an additional $207 million for the Vehicle \nSystems Program. This additional funding would be offset by reduction \nin funding for administrative services across all accounts.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the importance of aeronautics \nresearch, not only for the jobs and the commercial importance for our \ncountry but also for our continued national security. Aeronautics is \nimportant, because if you look at the R and the advancements that \nwill be coming in aeronautics compared to what is going on with our \nEuropean competitors, our aeronautics engineers are generally older. If \nwe are going to have the next generation of young people involved in \naeronautics engineering, we need to have this commitment to R\n  Moreover, it is essential that our men and women in the Armed Forces \nhave the best aircraft. We currently have air superiority. The reason \nthat we have it is because of the R over the past 5 decades. For this \ncountry to continue to protect the freedom that we enjoy here on the \nfloor of the Senate and in this Congress we must be able to project our \npower into areas where precision, stealth, and speed are required. To \ncontinue being able to do that, aeronautics R is absolutely \nessential.\n  I request that my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 197, As Modified\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk with a \nmodification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n  The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Allen], for himself, Mr. Warner, and \nMr. DeWine, proposes an amendment numbered 197, as modified.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase, with an offset, by $1,582,700,000 over fiscal \n  years 2006 through 2010 funding for Transportation (budget function \n 400) with the amount of the increase intended to be allocated to the \n     Vehicle Systems account of the National Aeronautics and Space \n    Administration for subsonic and hypersonic aeronautics research)\n\n       On page 15, line 15, increase the amount by $207,700,000.\n       On page 15, line 16, increase the amount by $207,700,000.\n       On page 15, line 19, increase the amount by $313,200,000.\n       On page 15, line 20, increase the amount by $313,200,000.\n       On page 15, line 23, increase the amount by $321,900,000.\n       On page 15, line 24, increase the amount by $321,900,000.\n       On page 16, line 2, increase the amount by $355,100,000.\n       On page 16, line 3, increase the amount by $355,100,000.\n       On page 16, line 6, increase the amount by $384,800,000.\n       On page 16, line 7, increase the amount by $384,800,000.\n       On page 26, line 14, decrease the amount by $207,700,000.\n       On page 26, line 15, decrease the amount by $207,700,000.\n       On page 26, line 17, decrease the amount by $313,200,000.\n       On page 26, line 18, decrease the amount by $313,200,000.\n       On page 26, line 20, decrease the amount by $321,900,000.\n       On page 26, line 21, decrease the amount by $321,900,000.\n       On page 26, line 23, decrease the amount by $355,100,000.\n       On page 26, line 24, decrease the amount by $355,100,000.\n       On page 21, line 1, decrease the amount by $384,800,000.\n       On page 21, line 2, decrease the amount by $384,800,000.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     Agriculture Mandatory Spending\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the budget \nresolution and its impact on Agriculture Committee mandatory spending \nprograms. Would the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee \nengage in a colloquy with me on this subject?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would be pleased to enter into such a colloquy.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. As I understand it, the budget resolution before us \ntoday assumes a total reduction in Agriculture Committee mandatory \nspending programs of $5.4 billion over the\n\n[[Page S2838]]\n\nfive-year period covering fiscal years 2006 through 2010. I further \nunderstand that $2.8 billion of this total is to be achieved by the \nAgriculture Committee by changing laws governing mandatory spending \nprograms within its jurisdiction through the budget reconciliation \nprocess. Assuming the Agriculture Committee complies with its \nreconciliation instruction, this leaves an additional $2.6 billion in \nassumed, but un-reconciled, mandatory spending reductions in \nAgriculture Committee programs. My understanding is that the additional \n$2.6 billion in assumed reductions will not impact such programs if the \nAgriculture Committee chooses not to achieve them. Is my understanding \ncorrect?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, your understanding is correct. If the Agriculture \nCommittee complies with its reconciliation instruction, the budget \nresolution contains no budget enforcement mechanism to achieve the \nadditional $2.6 billion in assumed mandatory spending reductions.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I would like to explore this a little further because \nit is an important point. It is possible that subsequent to the \ncompletion of the budget reconciliation process, the Agriculture \nCommittee may wish to move legislation that affects programs within its \njurisdiction. My understanding is that no budget points of order will \nlie against such an Agriculture Committee bill as long as it is \nspending neutral. Is my understanding correct?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, you are correct.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. This clarification is helpful. Unfortunately, there is \na lot of confusion on this point. Yesterday, all Senators were sent a \nletter that among other things suggested that the budget resolution's \nassumed additional, but un-reconciled, reductions in Agriculture \nCommittee mandatory spending would generally allow a budget point of \norder to be raised against Agriculture Committee bills subsequent to \nthe completion of the budget reconciliation process. Have you had an \nopportunity to read this letter?\n  Mr. GREGG. I have and the letter is very definitely incorrect on this \npoint.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. While I would prefer to not alter any programs under \nthe Agriculture Committee's jurisdiction this year to achieve mandatory \nspending reductions, our committee has been willing in the past to \ncontribute its fair share to help restrain mandatory spending in \nprevious efforts to reduce the budget deficit. I believe our committee \nwill be willing to do that again this year. In my view, a $2.8 billion \nreduction over five years in Agriculture Committee mandatory programs \nis a reasonable contribution given the President's proposal to reduce \noverall mandatory spending by $61.6 billion. Unfortunately, the House \nbudget resolution instructs the House Agriculture Committee to achieve \n$5.3 billion in mandatory spending reductions. I strongly request that \nyou keep the Agriculture Committee's reconciliation instruction in the \nfinal budget resolution conference report from rising above the \nSenate's $2.8 billion figure during conference with the House.\n  I thank the Chairman.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will do my best to maintain the Senate position in \nconference with the House.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the Senate is once again working late \nhours to enact a budget resolution totaling more than $2 trillion and \nsetting major policy guidelines through the reconciliation process. So \nbegins our annual budget process.\n  From now until September 30, Congress will conduct dozens of hearings \nand hold countless meetings, while Members of both Houses deliver \ninnumerable speeches and spend long hours of debate over every subtle \nnuance of the Federal budget process.\n  Over the next 8 months, Congress will consider a budget resolution, a \nbudget reconciliation package, and as many as 13 separate \nappropriations bills--the latter only if we do not combine those \nappropriations bills into one massive spending bill, as has been the \npractice in recent years.\n  By the time Congress adjourns--hopefully in early October but more \nlikely in mid November--a majority of votes taken in the Senate will \nrelate to the budget process.\n  Indeed, as my colleague, the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici, has pointed out, 73 percent of the \nSenate's votes in 1996 were budget related, 65 percent in 1997, and 51 \npercent in 1998. It is no wonder each year it is quite common for the \nsame subject to be voted upon three or four times during the course of \nthe entire budget process. It is a heck of a way to run a railroad, but \nwhat is really unbelievable is this whole process is repeated each \nyear.\n  I say enough is enough. It is time to bring rationality to our \nNation's budget process.\n  It is a fact that Congress spends too large a portion of its time \ndebating and voting on items related to the Federal budget. Meanwhile, \nmost other congressional functions are not given proper attention. CBO \nreports that last year Congress appropriated over $170 billion for 167 \nprograms whose authorizations had expired. This is not the fault of the \nappropriators. No one expects them to not fund veterans health care or \nother critical programs due to an expired authorization. It is the \nfault of a process that simply does not leave us enough time to \nadequately review and reauthorize important Government programs.\n  We need to reestablish our priorities so we may effectively do the \nwork of the people, make sure that the Federal Government is running at \npeak efficiency and deliver value, which is quality service for the \nleast amount of money.\n  I believe we have an excellent opportunity to do that this year.\n  One of the first bills I cosponsored when I became a Senator was a \nmeasure introduced by Senator Pete Domenici that would establish a 2-\nyear budget--just like we have in about 20 States, including the State \nof Ohio. I believe enactment of this bill would have provided an \nimportant tool in the efficient use of Federal funds while \nstrengthening Congress's proper oversight role. Unfortunately, we were \nunable to pass that legislation and the issue has lain idle over the \npast several years. Now is the time to take it up again.\n  Because Congress produces annual budgets, Congress does not spend \nnearly as much time as it should on oversight of the various Federal \ndepartments and agencies due to the time and energy consumed by the \nbudget resolution, budget reconciliation, and appropriations process.\n  Not only is this a problem for Congress, but each executive branch \nagency and department must spend a significant amount of its time on \neach annual budget cycle.\n  Again, as my colleague, Senator Domenici pointed out in 2000, the \nexecutive branch spends 1 year putting together a Federal budget, 1 \nyear explaining that Federal budget before Congress, and 1 year \nimplementing the budget eventually passed by Congress.\n  Even the most diligent Cabinet Secretary cannot keep track of all the \noversight he or she is supposed to accomplish if they are trapped in \nthis endless budget cycle.\n  A biennial budget will help Congress and the executive branch avoid \nthis lengthy process. Since each particular Congress lasts only 2 \nyears, a biennial budget would allow us to consider a 2-year funding \nproposal during 1 year, while reserving the second year for Government \noversight.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management \nand Restructuring in the Governmental Affairs Committee, I have noted \nthat even though the General Accounting Office conducts numerous \nreports documenting Government inefficiencies that need to be \ncorrected, most GAO reports sit on the shelf because there is no time \nto conduct detailed hearings.\n  When oversight hearings are held, nearly everyone in the executive \nbranch knows--from career bureaucrats to Cabinet Secretaries--that they \nneed only weather the immediate storm when they are asked to come to \nthe Hill to testify.\n  That is because once they answer the criticisms that have been \nleveled in these GAO reports, and explain how they are going to improve \nthe situation, it is over; the worst has passed. Rarely do they have to \nworry about followup hearings to make sure they have implemented the \nproper remedies because they know Congress just will not have the time \nto conduct future hearings.\n  A 2 year budget cycle gives Congress time to do that legislative \noversight and makes it harder for agencies to avoid giving answers.\n\n[[Page S2839]]\n\n  Two-year budgeting also gives Congress and agencies time to plan for \nthe future instead of always reacting to the past. Federal agencies are \nrequired to have 5-year strategic plans but they need longer term \nbudgets to match their funding to their planning.\n  For my colleagues who are tired of the seemingly endless budget and \nappropriations cycles and are frustrated at the inability to devote \nenough time to the oversight duties of their committees, I urge them to \njoin in cosponsoring this legislation. I also urge my House colleagues \nto review the merits of the biennial budget process and act upon \nlegislation as expeditiously as possible for the good of America.\n  The point I am making is this. It is time for this Congress to adopt \na 2-year budget cycle instead of the one we have had for too many \nyears. It will help us do a better job in terms of budgeting; it will \nallow Congress and the agencies time to plan more effectively and \ncertainly get us to do the oversight that is so badly needed by this \nCongress.\n  I sincerely wish we were about to vote on a biennial budgeting bill \ninstead of merely a sense-of-the-Senate-resolution. Nevertheless, we \ncan at least send a message to our colleagues telling them the Senate \ndoes not intend to let this issue simply fade away. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote yes on this resolution. I ask that the text of my \namendment No. 175 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that Congress should enact \n             a biennial budget for the Federal Government)\n\n       On page 65, after line 25, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. SENSE OF THE SENATE SUPPORTING BIENNIAL BUDGETING.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should enact a \n     biennial budget for the Federal Government.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, the process of developing a budget each \nyear provides an opportunity to take stock of our priorities as a \nnation.\n  The President outlines his priorities through his budget, but it is \nthe Congress, with its control of the purse strings, that is ultimately \ncharged with the responsibility of fashioning and enacting legislation.\n  Regrettably, the priorities reflected in this budget resolution--\nwhich mirror those in the administration's budget proposal--are wrong \nfor America and certainly wrong for the people of New Jersey.\n  In New Jersey, we are particularly sensitive to the choices made by \nthis administration and its allies in Congress, since we provide the \ngreatest contribution of taxes paid relative to what we get back from \nthe Federal Government. Our return on the Federal dollar has fallen \nfrom 70 cents to a meager 57 cents under the Bush administration. This \nbudget will only further increase the strain on New Jersey's citizens, \nespecially our most vulnerable: our children, our disabled, and our \nseniors.\n  According to the resolution before us, this administration and this \ncongressional leadership's priorities include underfunding No Child \nLeft Behind by an astounding $12 billion next year, which means that \n53,152 students in New Jersey will not be served by the title I program \nand 32,822 fewer kids in New Jersey will have a safe place to go after \nschool. I am disappointed that this body on Monday rejected an \nopportunity to restore some of this funding.\n  According to this resolution, Republican leadership's priorities \ninclude cutting $15 billion from the Medicaid Program over the next 5 \nyears. If these cuts take effect, New Jersey would lose $90 million a \nyear in Federal Medicaid funding.\n  I asked my State to tell me what they would do if they lost this \nfunding. They told me there are two options: The State will either have \nto eliminate health insurance for more than 20,000 low-income children \nand pregnant women who are considered ``optional'' beneficiaries \nbecause they earn just above 133 percent of the poverty level, which is \n$20,000 for a family of four; or, the State could eliminate \n``optional'' services, including dental care, hearing aid services, \npsychological services, and medical daycare for individuals with \nAlzheimer's and dementia.\n  The Republican leadership's priorities include cutting Amtrak's \nentire operating subsidy. I doubt the 82,000 commuters who ride New \nJersey Transit trains every day would agree with this policy choice, \nsince their trains operate along Amtrak's Northeast corridor rail. \nNeither, I know, would the literally millions who rely on Amtrak to \ntravel interstate.\n  Let's not forget cuts for our veterans and first responders and \nweakened investment in community development. The list goes on and on.\n  All in all, under President Bush's budget, my home State of New \nJersey stands to lose nearly $300 million next year, adjusted for \ninflation, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and \nthat is before you even estimate his implied cuts to Medicaid. If \nCongress fails to act, cuts under our budget could be of a similar \nmagnitude.\n  These cuts do not come as part of some shared sacrifice driven by \ntough fiscal times, as some would have us believe. Most of these \nprogram cuts are only a drop in the bucket compared to the cost of \nPresident Bush's tax cuts for the most fortunate.\n  In all, the Bush administration has reduced Federal revenues to their \nlowest level as a share of the economy since the 1950s. As a \nconsequence, we no longer have the resources to deal with the Nation's \npriorities--that is why they want to cut funding for veterans and \neducation and health care and community development.\n  Next year, people with incomes greater than $1 million will receive \n$32 billion from President Bush's tax breaks. Compare this $32 billion \ncost to the $220 million that the President has proposed cutting from \nthe Low Income Heating Assistance Program, which helps low-income \nfamilies and seniors pay their heating and cooling bills. We would \nliterally be throwing people out in the cold--405,000 of them, to be \nprecise, or more than 7,000 in New Jersey--to pay for less than 1 \npercent of President Bush's tax breaks for millionaires.\n  This choice simply does not reflect our Nation's fundamental values. \nI don't think it reflects the values of even those benefiting most from \nit. Nor does it address the real needs of working families in New \nJersey and across America.\n  That reality includes rising health care costs that are driving \nfamilies into bankruptcy like never before and preventing businesses \nfrom creating jobs. It includes growing wage disparity and a labor \nmarket that's stayed weaker for longer coming out of a recession than \nany other time on record.\n  According to the Tax Policy Center of the Urban Institute and the \nBrookings Institution, more than 70 percent of the benefits of the \nPresident's tax breaks enacted in 2001 and 2003 go to the 20 percent of \ntaxpayers with the highest incomes. More than 25 percent of the taxcut \nbenefits go to the top 1 percent.\n  I believe that America stays strong by investing in its people and \nits communities, not by abandoning them.\n  Let's remember the context. Since President Bush took office, the \nFederal budget deficit has deteriorated every year. This year, we are \nexpected to be $427 billion in the hole.\n  In light of this record, President Bush and his Congressional allies' \nrecent claims of fiscal responsibility simply are not credible. This \nbudget makes those claims even less credible by achieving much of its \npurported ``cost savings'' by passing the buck to State and local \ngovernments.\n  Lowering the numbers here in Washington is not the same thing as \nfiscal discipline if this is simply an exercise in shifting cost \nburdens to states and communities. That is hardly a plus for the \nAmerican people and certainly not for New Jersey.\n  Our States are already stretched too thin. In New Jersey, we have a \nbudget shortfall of $4-$5 billion and annual property tax increases of \n7 percent. Much of the reality for States in budget and tax policy has \nbeen the result of cost burdens and unfunded mandates passed down from \nthis administration and its allies in Congress.\n  We have heard claims from the other side that their tax cuts for the \nmost fortunate are somehow responsible for providing a boost to our \neconomy. But as any serious minded economist not on the Republican \npayroll will tell you, the real story of our modest growth has\n\n[[Page S2840]]\n\nbeen the longest sustained monetary expansion on record by the Federal \nReserve.\n  Claims that the tax cuts are responsible for significant economic \ngrowth are reminiscent of a rooster taking credit for the Sun coming \nup.\n  The more noticeable result of the tax cuts has been an explosion in \nour Nation's debt, starting with the $1.8 trillion cost over 10 years \nof making the cuts permanent. If we continue along the path set by this \nadministration, by 2015, each family's share of the national debt will \nbe $73,563. This is simply unacceptable.\n  As we develop this year's budget, I hope we take a long, hard look at \nthe priorities our Nation has followed under this president. Because, \nin my view, those priorities need major changes.\n  As I said earlier, it is the job of the President to reflect his \npriorities, but it is the role of Congress to reflect the priorities of \nAmerica, of our families, and of our workers.\n  I hope we will not fail them.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as I listen to the arguments coming from \nthe other side this week, I think it is important that we clear up a \nfew misconceptions. A couple of common themes are being emphasized with \nwhich I fundamentally disagree.\n  First of all, it is being alleged that the Federal Government is \n``cutting'' spending. In fact, we are not ``cutting'' anything. Defense \nspending under this budget would rise by 4.3 percent over last year. \nOther discretionary spending would also rise.\n  Mandatory spending will similarly increase--in some cases \nsubstantially. Medicare, for example, is slated to rise by 12.7 \npercent. So to say we are ``decreasing'' funding is just not true. The \nsavings to which we refer result from slowing projected increases in \nspending. We should not assume that just because we go from one year to \nthe next we should automatically be increasing all of our current \nobligations.\n  Secondly, it is alleged that we are ``cutting'' programs. In fact, \nwhat we are talking about here are overall budget numbers. Nothing \nabout this resolution allocates specific dollars to specific programs. \nWhile it is true that the President's budget has made recommendations \nto cease Federal funding of certain programs, allocation of the final \nbudget number is the job of the appropriators. In addition, the \nmajority of the programs about which I have heard complaint are areas \nproperly left to State authority and are not within the powers \nenumerated to the Federal Government. For example, of course education \nis a priority. But specifics of education and available programs are \nnot within the purview of the Federal Government. They are properly \nleft to the States. That said, under this President and this Congress, \noverall investment in elementary and secondary education exceeds $500 \nbillion annually, surpassing spending on national defense and exceeding \nper-pupil education spending of every other country except Switzerland.\n  Finally, we are hearing a lot of rhetoric about ``tax cuts for the \nrich.'' I would first point out that many of these ``rich'' are small \nbusiness owners who are trying to make capital investments and meet \npayroll. Secondly, we must all remember that money belongs first to \nthose who earn it, and taxes are the share an individual's earnings \nthat is paid to support the Government. The money isn't ours first. It \nis theirs. Limiting Government to its essential purposes and allowing \npeople to keep more of their own money is something we all should \nstrive to accomplish. The burden of government has grown entirely too \nlarge and way beyond what our Founders intended.\n  These same people who rail about deficit increases ``resulting from \ntax cuts for the rich'' are not advocating fiscal restraint on the \nspending side. To the contrary, they consistently argue for bigger and \nbigger increases in Federal spending and more and more entitlement \nprograms funded by the Federal Government. During last year's budget \ndebate, many of these same Senators voted for $400 billion in \nadditional spending.\n  If we are to be serious about reducing the deficit, we cannot \ncontinue to spend at the current pace. Our largest entitlement \nprograms--Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security--are already in deep \nfinancial trouble going forward into the near future. At some point, we \nhave to hold the line.\n  Mr. ENZI. I want to begin by complimenting Chairman Gregg, Senator \nConrad, and our leadership for bringing the budget resolution to the \nfloor. Last week the Budget Committee reported out the resolution on a \nparty line vote, after a full day of debating and voting on amendments. \nI am encouraged by the pace at which we are moving forward. It was only \n5 weeks ago that President Bush sent his proposal to the Hill for \nCongress to review.\n  Last year we passed a budget out of the committee and on the Senate \nfloor but were unable to reach an agreement on a Conference Report. \nThat was unfortunate for a lot of reasons. The Budget Resolution sets a \nblueprint that Congress is supposed to follow for the year. It \nestablishes spending guidelines, and procedural hurdles for the floor \nwhen we fail to live by these guidelines. Chairman Gregg and Senator \nConrad have worked tirelessly to get us where we are today. I commend \nthem for that, and hope that this pace will continue so we can have a \nbudget resolution conference report voted on quickly.\n  The budget process forces Congress to contemplate our legislative and \nspending priorities each year. However, I'd like to remind everybody \nwe're not debating appropriations today. My colleagues from the other \nside of the aisle will try to make this budget debate about proposed \ncuts to individual programs and pet projects, but we're not cutting any \nindividual programs today. Let me say that again, we're not cutting any \nindividual programs today. We are not making the decisions this week as \nto which individual programs will be funded. We are setting overall \nfunding levels that will hold our colleagues' spending in check down \nthe road.\n  However, despite this fact, we are going to hear amendment after \namendment that proposes to increase funding for one program or another \nby increasing taxes.\n  For example, an amendment that proposes to increase funding under \nfunction 750 for COPS grants by eliminating tax relief for working \nAmericans does not guarantee that funding will actually find its way \ninto those grant accounts. That decision will be made by the \nappropriators and the Senate during the debate on appropriations. That \nmeans much of the rhetoric we will hear throughout the debate is \npolitical, not practical. Right now, we can only decide the amount of \nmoney, not where it will end up.\n  Setting the overall funding level for fiscal year 2006 is especially \nchallenging, because I think most of us agree that deficit reduction \nmust be a top priority. When I read the administration's budget request \nthey presented in February, I saw that President Bush proposed the \nfirst budget since Ronald Reagan that cut non-security discretionary \nspending.\n  I have a long track record in support of deficit reduction, and I am \ncommitted to helping President Bush and Chairman Gregg achieve this \ngoal. As we know from marking up the resolution last week, the \ncommittee-reported resolution contains instructions that would require \nauthorizing committees to reduce mandatory spending. Many of these cuts \nwill come from programs that I oversee in my role as chairman of the \nHELP Committee.\n  I am committed to reviewing and strengthening programs under HELP's \njurisdiction to ensure they are cost effective, not duplicative, and \nthat accountability is required. Because Federal dollars are limited, \nwe need to focus our resources on opportunities where programs will \nmake a difference, and where results can be measured.\n  One main priority for the committee this year is reauthorization of \nthe Higher Education Act. The committee-reported resolution and the \nPresident's budget both propose spending cuts, while also making room \nfor new initiatives. Critics of the President may claim that we are \nunreasonably cutting education spending. However, in addition to \nrequired savings, the resolution also contains a $5 billion reserve \nfund for new initiatives. My colleagues who have worked on education \npolicy understand that there are reforms to lending programs we can \nwork toward that shouldn't be contentious. I want to work with all of \nmy colleagues, particularly those on the other side of the\n\n[[Page S2841]]\n\naisle, to craft a bipartisan reauthorization bill that enhances access \nto higher education for poor and middle class families. Higher ed \nreauthorization should be a bipartisan bill, like it has been \nhistorically.\n\n  The resolution also proposes deficit reduction from savings \nassociated with changes to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. \nRight now the PBGC has a deficit of $23 billion. The Committee-reported \nResolution incorporates a $5.3 billion reduction of that deficit over 5 \nyears. Only a small part of this can be accomplished through \nreconciliation. The HELP Committee will collaborate with the Finance \nCommittee to reach this goal in the context of comprehensive pension \nreform. Chairman Grassley and I are committed to restoring the \nfinancial stability of the defined benefit system. The solvency of the \nPBGC is a critical component of these reforms.\n  I am pleased the resolution again identifies tax relief as a top \npriority this year. The resolution includes reconciliation instructions \nthat will allow $70 billion of tax cuts through the reconciliation \nprocess. I hope this will enable the Finance Committee and our \nleadership to keep in place the tax relief that has produced 21 \nconsecutive months of job creation and produced more than 3 million new \njobs. These progrowth tax policies have jumpstarted American business, \nand yielded continued increases in technology, infrastructure and \nequipment investments. We need to keep the trend going. The committee-\nreported resolution allows the Finance Committee to extend key \nprovisions like the reduction in tax rates on capital gains and \ndividends, the increase in expensing for small business under Section \n179 and the ability of individuals in states without income taxes to \ndeduct their local and state sales tax from their Federal income tax \nliability. I want to thank Chairman Grassley for his leadership at the \nFinance Committee these past 4 years.\n  The resolution also demonstrates a commitment to energy development \nin Wyoming and in the entire United States. It is the first step \ntowards developing a comprehensive energy policy in the 109th Congress. \nThe energy reserve fund and the reconciliation instructions for an \nenergy tax incentives package will lay the footwork for a policy that \nwill help our Nation meet its energy needs in a fiscally responsible \nmanner. Specifically, I would like to reinforce my support for \nrecognizing the importance of developing lean coal technologies, \nsomething that is vital for the economy of Wyoming. I look forward to \nworking so that these technologies receive the funding necessary to \nbecome viable.\n  I again want to thank Chairman Gregg and his staff for their hard \nwork on this resolution. They have all worked tirelessly, through many \nweekends, to get us here today. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are now at the end of the day. It has \nbeen a long day, especially for staff. We appreciate their effort and \ntheir courtesy.\n  I note that there are now pending approximately 25 amendments to this \nresolution. There are still approximately 70 or so amendments that we \nhave been told may be offered. Tomorrow, when we begin voting, which \nwill occur, it appears, around 1:20, we have to vote those 25 \namendments, and that in and of itself would take 8 hours. If any \npercentage of the ones that are still pending have to be voted, you can \npresume a significant additional amount of time. So we could be here \nquite late tomorrow night, and our colleagues should be aware of that \nas they move into tomorrow.\n  It also should be noted that almost all the amendments that have been \noffered today--there have been one or two exceptions, or maybe three or \nfour exceptions--have essentially attempted to increase spending. Some \nhave offset that spending increase with reductions in accounts which \nactually exist. A couple of the amendments, such as one of the \namendments on Border Patrol, takes the money that it spends on Border \nPatrol and moves it over from other accounts in international affairs. \nMost of the amendments spend additional funds by raising taxes or by \ndoing what is known as the 920 account, which amounts to an across-the-\nboard cut, for all intents and purposes, of other accounts within the \nGovernment.\n  It is going to be interesting to see when we have completed this \nbudget process whether there really is a willingness to fiscal \ndiscipline within the Congress, especially within the Senate which is \ncontrolled by a party that alleges itself to be fiscally disciplined. \nWe are going to determine that sometime very late tomorrow night or \nearly Friday morning. But clearly the issue is in question.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/16/senate-section/article/S2841-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2841-S2842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  TRIBUTE TO THE REVEREND DENVIS RUSH\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nlifelong Kentuckian who dedicated his life to serving others, the \nReverend Denvis Rush. Known to many simply as ``Preacher,'' the \nReverend Rush was a Kentucky icon who passed away earlier this year at \nthe age of 85 from complications of liver cancer.\n  The Reverend Rush began preaching at the age of 18. His 66-year \ncareer spanned eight different churches in Eastern Kentucky and allowed \nhim to embark on mission trips to Indonesia, Africa, South America, and \nKorea. He touched thousands of lives by officiating at numerous \nbaptisms, weddings, and funerals. Despite his illness, he continued to \npreach and stood before his congregation for a final time the Sunday \nbefore he passed away.\n  In addition to his ministerial duties, the Reverend Rush was a \nlongtime chairman of the Oneida Baptist Institute's school board and \nserved on the executive board of the Kentucky Baptist Convention. He \nwas also active in other community organizations where he and his wife \nof 63 years, Juanita, would donate their time and energy to help \nimprove the quality of life of those around them. The Reverend Rush is \nsurvived by his wife; a daughter, Joyce Rush Woods; four sisters; a \nbrother; four grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.\n  The Reverend Rush was a very modest man who, when asked to reflect on \nhis lifetime of achievement, said, ``I haven't done it. The Lord's done \nit, through a little old nobody.'' But the thousands of people he \ntouched all certainly thought he was somebody, somebody special. Mr. \nPresident, today I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing our \nsympathy to the family and friends of the late Rev. Denvis Rush by \nhonoring and recognizing all of the contributions he made to \ncommunities in Kentucky and around the world. He will be missed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unaminous consent to print in the Record an \narticle from The Lexington Herald-Leader, ``Denvis Rush, minister, \ndies,'' about the Reverend Rush's life.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Lexington Herald Leader, Feb. 9, 2005]\n\n``Denvis Rush, Minister, Dies; Had Conducted Revivals on 4 Continents''\n\n                         (By Jennifer Hewlett)\n\n       The Rev. Denvis Rush held revivals on four continents. He \n     officiated at thousands of funerals and weddings in Laurel \n     and Clay counties and other Eastern Kentucky counties. For \n     decades he preached several times a week at Kentucky \n     churches.\n       When he found out that he had liver cancer in November, he \n     declined to undergo chemotherapy because he knew it would sap \n     his energy. He wanted to use every bit he had left to preach \n     the word of God, friends said.\n       The Rev. Rush, a Baptist minister for more than 66 years, \n     died Monday at Marymount Hospital in London. He was 85 and \n     lived in London. In addition to his family, he leaves behind \n     thousands of friends whose lives he deeply touched.\n       ``There were times in his life when he had more influence \n     on the people of Clay County than any elected official would \n     have, and that's saying a whole lot,'' said the Rev. Thermon \n     Taylor, pastor emeritus of Liberty Baptist Church in London \n     and a longtime friend.\n       ``He did so many things for the people in Clay County and \n     Jackson and Perry and Leslie. . . His influence is extremely \n     wide,'' Taylor said.\n\n\n                            preaching at 18\n\n       The Rev. Rush, a Laurel County native, began preaching at \n     age 18 and pastored his first church, Laurel River Baptist \n     Church in London, soon afterward. He was pastor of Providence \n     Baptist Church near London at his death.\n       Before moving to Providence about 14 years ago, he pastored \n     Horse Creek Baptist Church in Clay County for 37 years. \n     During\n\n[[Page S2842]]\n\n     several of those years, the Rev. Rush pastored Lily Grove \n     Baptist Church, an African-American church in Clay County, at \n     the same time.\n       ``There was no color barrier with him. He was color \n     blind,'' Taylor said. ``He helped them build a new church. He \n     did a lot of the work himself with his two hands. . . . They \n     loved him and he did them.''\n       At one time, the Rev. Rush was a member of the executive \n     board of the Kentucky Baptist Convention.\n       ``Whenever decisions were to be made within our \n     association, one of the questions always asked was 'What does \n     Brother Rush think about it?' '' said Roy Faulkner, director \n     of missions for the Laurel River Baptist Association.\n       ``He's an icon in Kentucky among Baptists.''\n       For decades, Rev. Rush was Oneida Baptist Institute's \n     biggest cheerleader, said Kay Underwood, administrative \n     coordinator at the school and wife of the school's president, \n     W.F. Underwood.\n       For several years, the Rev. Rush, who had been a longtime \n     chairman of the school's board, hauled groceries donated by \n     an area wholesale grocer to the Clay County school for the \n     students, faculty and staff members. He bought a truck just \n     for that purpose.\n       ``He has really been a wonderful ambassador for Oneida,'' \n     Kay Underwood said. ``One of our buildings is named after him \n     and his wife, Juanita.''\n       The minister, Underwood said, wasn't a wealthy man who \n     could give a lot of money to the school, which has more than \n     300 students in grades six through 12, but he was a major \n     influence on others who could.\n       ``One of the tender things to me . . . he had a heart for \n     children. He loved anything a child did. . . . This was a man \n     who was a preacher, a man of God who was busy, busy, busy, \n     but he was never too busy for a little child. I think that's \n     why he had such a heart for Oneida,'' she said.\n       For the past five years, the Rev. Rush was the mission's \n     teacher and coordinator at Laurel Lake Baptist Camp outside \n     Corbin.\n       When he was at the camp, ``it was sort of like the Pied \n     Piper, with kids following him all over the campus,'' \n     Faulkner said.\n\n\n                        clear creek scholarships\n\n       There is a scholarship at Clear Creek Bible College in Bell \n     County named for the Rev. Rush, who studied there. Money for \n     the scholarship was contributed by people whose lives he \n     touched.\n       The Rev. Rush influenced many young preachers, Taylor said.\n\n\n                          worldwide revivalist\n\n       Over the years, the Rev. Rush held revivals not only in \n     North America, but in Africa, Asia and South America.\n       Taylor recalled one mission trip to Brazil that the Rev. \n     Rush took. While there, he gave witness to an elderly man on \n     his front porch. A teenage girl inside the house told the \n     Rev. Rush through an interpreter that she needed his help \n     when he finished with the old man.\n       ``She said, ``I'm 16 years old and I've got AIDS and I'm \n     dying.' He taught her how to become a Christian,'' Taylor \n     said.\n       ``He had more understanding. He knew how to talk to \n     people,'' Taylor said.\n       ``His heart was in missions. . . . He told me just a week \n     or so ago that if he had one thing he could do again was he'd \n     like to go back and preach in Kenya one more time,'' Faulkner \n     said.\n       The Rev. Rush preached for the last time Sunday. He \n     preached twice that day. He was to have preached at a funeral \n     today, having agreed to do so less than a couple of hours \n     before he died. After he found out he didn't have long to \n     live, he held a revival and officiated at several funerals \n     and weddings.\n       The Rev. Rush is survived by his wife, Juanita Rudder Rush; \n     a daughter, Joyce Rush Woods of Manchester; four sisters; a \n     brother; four grandchildren and seven great grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/16/senate-section/article/S2842-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    Private First Class Landon Giles\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President. I rise today to honor the life of Landon \nS. Giles. Private First Class Giles was a passionate and free-spirited \nyoung man who lived his life with an admirable sense of adventure and \ncourage. He was also a brave soldier who proudly and honorably served \nhis Nation in uniform. In doing so, he gave his life while improving \nthe lives of those he saw as less fortunate while helping to bring \nfreedom and hope to a land that has known only oppression and fear. The \nway he lived his life is a testament to the kind of person he was. The \nState of Arkansas and our Nation will mourn his loss but will remain \nforever grateful of the service he rendered on behalf of us all.\n  PFC Giles was born and raised in the southwestern Arkansas town of \nArkadelphia. From an early age, his sense of adventure and his \nathleticism would contribute to the way he spent his childhood. If he \nwasn't playing golf, football or baseball, he was most likely hiking or \non a hunting trip with friends and family. Above all, PFC Giles loved \nto travel, where he could experience foreign cultures, see new places \nand meet new people. His father's job required an extensive amount of \ntravel overseas and it allowed him the opportunity to do just that.\n  Through travels with his father, PFC Giles had the opportunity to see \nmuch of the world. When he was just 12, he became a certified scuba \ndiver while diving at Sipadan, an island off the coast of Malaysia. \nAdditionally, he would go on to experience memorable journeys such as \nclimbing volcanoes in the South Pacific, deep-sea fishing off the coast \nof Australia, surfing in Hawaii, and riding an elephant through parts \nof Thailand. It was a rare privilege of which he took full advantage. \nIt was an adventure that required courage and imagination and he loved \nevery minute of it. Such was his life.\n  Wherever that life took him, his friendly personality and outgoing \nnature provided him with a natural gift for making friends quickly and \neasily. At the same time, his work ethic, dedication, and discipline \nearned him the respect of his teachers and coaches. Throughout his time \nat Arkadelphia High School, PFC Giles would call upon these traits when \nhe spoke of entering the military. Shortly before his graduation, he \njoined the United States Army through their delayed-entry program. \nSince he had not yet reached the age of 18, he asked his mother, Kim, \nto fill out the necessary paperwork. Although she disapproved of his \ndecision, she also saw how determined and passionate he felt about it \nand ultimately complied.\n  A month after his graduation last May, PFC Giles entered the Army as \nan indirect fire infantryman, assigned to the Army's 3rd Infantry based \nin Fort Stewart, GA. The day he was deployed to the Middle East for \nOperation Iraqi Freedom, his sister, Jennifer, told him she didn't want \nhim to go to war. In a gesture befitting of who he was, he replied \nsimply ``it's better I go and not come home than someone with a wife \nand children.'' In Iraq, his courage was surpassed only by his \nselflessness. He often spoke of his heart-felt belief that the Iraqis \nwere being treated unjustly and had no one to fight for their rights. \nHe became a champion of this cause and while proudly serving his \ncountry, was also proud to help the people of Iraq in their fight for \nfreedom. Tragically, after serving in Iraq for only a few weeks, he was \nkilled when an improvised explosive device detonated near his patrol on \nFebruary 26.\n  Back in the community he called home, countless friends and \nneighbors, as well as strangers who simply wanted to pay their \nrespects, lined the procession to his burial service. Many held small \nAmerican flags in their hands, others simply held their hands over \ntheir heart. The community's outpouring of grief was tempered only by \nits outpouring of appreciation. Their fallen hero had returned home and \nit was readily apparent that his sacrifice would not soon be forgotten.\n  Landon Giles was an inspiration, not only because of the way he lived \nhis life, but because of who he was. He was a loving son, brother, and \nfriend, and he was also a hero. Although his time with us was way too \nshort, his legacy will forever live on in the example he set and the \nmany lives he touched. In the words of his mother Kim, ``I want him to \nbe remembered as a strong, brave, compassionate person who put his life \non the line to defend our country and help those less fortunate than \nus.''\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to all those who knew and loved this \nspecial young man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/16/senate-section/article/S2842-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2842-S2843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CO-SPONSORSHIP CHANGE S. 379\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr President, today I rise to ask for a clarification \nin the Congressional Record from yesterday, dated March 15, 2004. The \nRecord mistakenly reported that I was to be added as a cosponsor of S. \n379, the Firearm Manufacturers Protection Act. Apparently, my name was \ntyped into the Record instead of that of Senator Mitch McConnell who \nhad requested to be added as a cosponsor of that bill. I wanted the \nRecord to reflect that I never requested to be added to the bill. As I \nhope my record reflects, I have been a strong opponent of the gun \nimmunity bill because it puts one industry's bottomline ahead of the \nfamilies\n\n[[Page S2843]]\n\nand victims of gun violence. I opposed this bill and will continue to \noppose it because it slams closed the courthouse door to those seeking \njustice for victims of gun violence, such as the victims of the \nhorrific sniper who terrorized the citizens of DC, Maryland, and \nVirginia just a short time ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/16/senate-section/article/S2843-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. REED.

Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute to \nColonel Pete Bunce of the United States Air Force. Over the past few \nyears, he has earned my personal thanks many times over for a job well \ndone.\n  Many of us in the Senate know Colonel Bunce, who for the last 3 years \nhas served as liaison to the both the Budget and Appropriations \nCommittees. He has been a strong advocate for the Air Force and has \nworked tirelessly to improve communications between the Air Force and \nthe Senate.\n  Colonel Bunce has been a good friend to the State of North Dakota and \nto this Senator. He has provided important assistance to me in \norganizing many meetings with the top leadership of the Air Force and \nthe Department of Defense. Community leaders from the three North \nDakota communities with the closest ties to the Air Force--Fargo, Grand \nForks, and Minot--have all been able to join me for high-level Pentagon \nvisits thanks to his help. He and his staff have also always been \ntremendously helpful in the Budget Committee's deliberations on \nnational defense spending.\n  His professional advice helped me better understand the costs and \nsacrifices made by our military personnel during this war. I know many \nof my colleagues feel the same way. His personal testimony as the \nparent of a troop in harm's way was even more valuable. Pete's son, \nJustin, came home wounded from Iraq. Just as he was recovering from \nthat injury, he was in a serious car accident. I want Pete to know that \nhe, Justin, and the entire Bunce family are in my thoughts and prayers.\n  While I have relied on Colonel Bunce's military advice, I have valued \nhis friendship even more. Pete, as you enter into a well deserved \nretirement, please know that you go with the best wishes of this \nSenator and all of us in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/16/senate-section/article/S2843-3", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  Last February, a 37-year-old gay man was brutally murdered because of \nhis sexual orientation. The attacker allegedly poured gasoline over the \nvictim and set him on fire while he slept. The police are investigating \nthe incident as a hate crime.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/16/senate-section/article/S2843-4", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CELEBRATING IDAHO HEROES\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to recognize Ms. Tina Taysom and Mr. \nGreg Cannell of American Falls, ID, for their heroic actions in saving \nthe life of a rural mail carrier who skidded off a winding mountain \nroad and into a nearby river in Idaho.\n  On December 1, 2003, Ron Meadville, a rural mail carrier, was \nreturning from his 110-mile route along the remote North Fork road \nnorthwest of Salmon, ID. Friends Tina Taysom and Greg Cannell were \ntraveling ahead of Meadville on the same road. They pulled over to look \nat some deer, and Meadville passed them. When they pulled back on the \nroad and rounded a bend, they couldn't see the mail truck but saw a set \nof skid marks that veered off the road, toward the near-frozen river. \nMeadville had hit a patch of ice that sent his truck hurtling over the \n25-foot embankment to land upside down in the Salmon River, in more \nthan 5 feet of 33-degree water.\n  Greg Cannell and Tina Taysom acted immediately. They stopped their \ntruck, jumped out, slid down the steep embankment, and plunged into the \nriver. After several strenuous attempts, they were able to pull open \nthe truck door, grab Meadville's hand, and pull him out through an \nopening between the seat and the doorjamb. By this time, Meadville was \nexperiencing hypothermia. Taysom and Cannell pulled Meadville up the \nembankment to their vehicle. Meadville managed to tell them he lived \nabout a mile away, and they took him to his home, where they helped \nMeadville's wife care for him. They refused any care for themselves \nuntil they knew Meadville was safe.\n  Greg Cannell and Tina Taysom put themselves in harm's way to save a \nstranger. They refuse to be called heroes, but they are truly heroes to \nRon Meadville and his family. Without their courageous actions, Ron \nMeadville would not be alive today. Their actions truly were heroic, \nand it is a pleasure for me to honor them and share their story.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/16/senate-section/article/S2843-5", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2843-S2844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n CONGRATULATIONS TO THE KENTUCKY NEW ERA/ROTARY REGIONAL MIDDLE SCHOOL \n                     ACADEMIC ALL-STAR TEAM PROGRAM\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President. I rise today to recognize Fair \nHousing Month and the efforts of Housing Opportunities of Northern \nDelaware, HOND. On April 4, 2005, HOND will hold their 22nd Annual \nProclamation Signing Ceremony. Their theme for this year will be \n``Diversifying our neighborhoods with quality by building relationships \nthrough culture and lifestyles.''\n  In April 2005, the nation will observe the 37th anniversary of the \npassage of the Fair Housing Act, the groundbreaking legislation that \naffirmed in this country the right of every citizen to obtain the \nhousing of their choice without being limited by race, color, religion, \nnational origin, sex, disability or familial status.\n  Housing Opportunities of Northern Delaware, Inc. is a non-profit \norganization promoting fair and equal housing opportunities in the sale \nand rental of housing in Delaware. HOND also provides housing programs \nwhich support the mission of equal access to housing and provides \ninformation about the law and housing programs available to Delaware \nresidents. HOND is governed by a board of directors composed of a \ncross-section of business and community representatives.\n  HOND is unique in that they were created primarily to provide fair \nhousing law education to Delaware residents. Their mission is to \neradicate housing discrimination through education, advocacy, and \nenforcement of local and national laws, and to promote fair and equal \naccess to housing in rental, sales, homeowner insurance, and mortgages \nwherever one may choose to live.\n  It is well known that fair housing opens doors of opportunity. To \ncommunicate this belief, HOND focuses its activities around six \nfunctions. The first is education. HOND provides current information \nabout housing and fair housing practices to existing community groups \nand counseling agencies. A variety of workshops, seminars and \nliterature are developed for consumers, community groups, housing \nprofessionals and private business persons.\n  The second is compliance. HOND works with and encourages realtors, \nbankers, apartment managers, landlords and others to comply with fair \nhousing regulations. HOND also works closely with government agencies \nincluding FDIC, HUD, State Human Relations Office and Commission, the \nCity of Wilmington and New Castle County.\n  Direct assistance is the third function. HOND provides assistance and \ncounseling to individuals who believe they are victims of unfair \nhousing practices. HOND works with community groups and counseling \nagencies that are interested in fair housing.\n  The fourth function is advocacy. HOND monitors legislation of local, \nState, and national levels and serves as an advocate for fair housing.\n  Research is the fifth function. HOND develops and conducts research \nprojects to eliminate inequitable housing practices. Consumers, \ncommunity groups, and public and private housing organizations \nparticipate in these research projects.\n  Finally, there are special projects. HOND works with community \ngroups, agencies, and others who have projects in mind to promote fair \nhousing.\n  I rise today to thank Housing Opportunities of Northern Delaware, \nInc. for all that they do in Delaware to better the lives of our \nresidents. Their focus on serving our community is laudable, and I look \nforward watching their continued success and the impact it has on the \npeople of Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/16/senate-section/article/S2844-3", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2844-S2845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS NATIONAL HOME FOR CHILDREN\n\n Mr. LEVIN.

Located in Eaton Rapids, MI, the VFW \nHome for Children has spent the past 80 years caring for the children \nand families of our Nation's veterans. The National Home's uniquely \ndesigned facility provides housing, food, health care, education, \ntraining, and counseling for the orphaned children and single-parent \nfamilies in their care. With 70 buildings, 36 individual family homes, \na community center, a guest lodge, and a chapel, the National Home is \nwell-equipped to serve VFW-connected children from around the country.\n  The VFW National Home for Children provides two distinct programs for \nits residents: the Residential Program and the Single Parent Family \nProgram. Children without a parent or guardian are placed in the \nResidential Program and live with professional childcare workers until \nthey graduate from high school or are reunited with a family member. \nSingle parent families are placed in a 3-year program that helps the \nparent or guardian develop the skills necessary to become self-\nsufficient. Both programs strive to ensure that the children maintain \nas normal a living arrangement as possible. Therefore, the community is \nstructured as a typical American neighborhood and is fully integrated \ninto the surrounding community. Children attend public school, live in \nbrick homes instead of dormitories, and are encouraged to participate \nin community-wide events. Most importantly, both of these programs \nprovide the children involved with what they need the most--a normal \nchildhood.\n  The VFW National Home for Children is the only organization of its \nkind in the United States. Their innumerable services have touched the \nlives of thousands of children and families. Whether it is an orphaned \nchild who has lived at the National Home since infancy, or a struggling \nfamily that needs help getting on their feet, virtually everyone\n\n[[Page S2845]]\n\nleaves the National Home stronger and in a better position than when \nthey arrived.\n  I know my Senate colleagues join me in offering our congratulations \nand sincere appreciation to the VFW National Home for Children. We \napplaud and admire the valuable work of the dedicated donors, staff, \nand volunteers. We commend the VFW National Home for Children as they \ncontinue to improve the lives of these families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/16/senate-section/article/S2845-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:13 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following resolution:\n\n       H.

A bill to authorize the extension of unconditional and \npermanent nondiscriminatory treatment (permanent normal trade relations \ntreatment) to the products of Ukraine, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a bill that I \nhave introduced authorizing the extension of permanent normal trade \nrelations treatment. Ukraine is still subject to the provisions of the \nJackson-Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of 1974, which sanctions \nnations for failure to comply with freedom of emigration requirements. \nOur bill would repeal permanently the application of Jackson-Vanik to \nUkraine.\n  In the post Cold War era, Ukraine has demonstrated a commitment to \nmeet these requirements, and in addition, has expressed a strong desire \nto abide by free market principles and good governance. Last November, \nI served as President Bush's personal representative to the runoff \nelection between Prime Minister Yanukovich and Victor Yushchenko. \nDuring that visit, I promoted free and fair election procedures that \nwould strengthen worldwide respect for the legitimacy of the winning \ncandidate. Unfortunately, that was not possible. The Government of \nUkraine allowed, or aided and abetted, wholesale fraud and abuse that \nchanged the results of the election. It is clear that Prime Minister \nYanukovich did not win the election.\n  In response, the people of Ukraine rallied in the streets and \ndemanded justice. After tremendous international pressure and \nmediation, Ukraine repeated the runoff election on December 26. A newly \nnamed Central Election Commission and a new set of election laws led to \na much improved process. International monitors concluded that the \nprocess was generally free and fair. This past weekend Victor \nYushchenko was inaugurated as President of Ukraine.\n  Extraordinary events have occurred in Ukraine over the last three \nmonths.\n\n[[Page S2848]]\n\nA free press has revolted against government intimidation and \nreasserted itself. An emerging middle class has found its political \nfooting. A new generation has embraced democracy and openness. A \nsociety has rebelled against the illegal activities of its government. \nIt is in our interest to recognize and protect these advances in \nUkraine.\n  The United States has a long record of cooperation with Ukraine \nthrough the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction. Ukraine inherited \nthe third largest nuclear arsenal in the world with the fall of the \nSoviet Union. Through the Nunn-Lugar Program the United States has \nassisted Ukraine in eliminating this deadly arsenal and joining the \nNonproliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear state.\n  One of the areas where we can deepen U.S.-Ukrainian relations is \nbilateral trade. Our trade relations between the U.S. and Ukraine are \ncurrently governed by a bilateral trade agreement signed in 1992. There \nare other economic agreements in place seeking to further facilitate \neconomic cooperation between the U.S. and Ukraine, including a \nbilateral investment treaty which was signed in 1996, and a taxation \ntreaty signed in 2000. In addition, Ukraine commenced negotiations to \nbecome a member of the World Trade Organization in 1993, further \ndemonstrating its commitment to adhere to free market principles and \nfair trade. In light of its adherence to freedom of emigration \nrequirements, democratic principles, compliance with threat reduction \nand several agreements on economic cooperation, the products of Ukraine \nshould not be subject to the sanctions of Jackson-Vanik.\n  There are areas in which Ukraine needs to continue to improve. These \ninclude market access, protection of intellectual property and \nreduction of tariffs. The U.S. must remain committed to assisting \nUkraine in pursuing market economic reforms. The permanent waiver of \nJackson Yanik and establishment of permanent normal trade relations \nwill be the foundation on which further progress in a burgeoning \neconomic partnership can be made.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nimportant legislation. It is essential that we act promptly to bolster \nthis burgeoning democracy and promote stability and in this region.I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 632\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that Ukraine--\n       (1) allows its citizens the right and opportunity to \n     emigrate, free of any heavy tax on emigration or on the visas \n     or other documents required for emigration and free of any \n     tax, levy, fine, fee, or other charge on any citizens as a \n     consequence of the desire of such citizens to emigrate to \n     the country of their choice;\n       (2) has received normal trade relations treatment since \n     concluding a bilateral trade agreement with the United States \n     that entered into force on June 23, 1992, which remains in \n     force and provides the United States with important rights;\n       (3) has been found to be in full compliance with the \n     freedom of emigration requirements under title IV of the \n     Trade Act of 1974 since 1997;\n       (4) has committed itself to ensuring freedom of religion \n     and preventing intolerance;\n       (5) has committed itself to continuing its efforts to \n     return religious property to religious organizations in \n     accordance with existing law;\n       (6) has taken significant steps demonstrating its \n     intentions to build a friendly and cooperative relationship \n     with the United States including participating in \n     peacekeeping efforts in Europe; and\n       (7) has made progress toward meeting international \n     commitments and standards in the most recent Presidential \n     runoff elections, including in the implementation of \n     Ukraine's new elections laws.\n\n     SEC. 2. TERMINATION OF APPLICATION OF TITLE IV OF THE TRADE \n                   ACT OF 1974 TO UKRAINE.\n\n        (a) Presidential Determinations and Extension of \n     Unconditional and Permanent Nondiscriminatory Treatment.--\n     Notwithstanding any provision of title IV of the Trade Act of \n     1974 (19 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.), the President may--\n       (1) determine that such title should no longer apply to \n     Ukraine; and\n       (2) after making a determination under paragraph (1) with \n     respect to Ukraine, proclaim the extension of unconditional \n     and permanent nondiscriminatory treatment (permanent normal \n     trade relations treatment) to the products of that country.\n       (b) Termination of Application of Title IV.--On and after \n     the effective date of the extension under subsection (a)(2) \n     of nondiscriminatory treatment to the products of Ukraine, \n     chapter 1 of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 shall cease to \n     apply to that country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON:\n  S. 633. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins \nin commemoration of veterans who became disabled for life while serving \nin the Armed Forces of the United States; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the American \nVeterans Disabled for Life Commemorative Coin Act of 2005.\n  This bill will authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to mint a \ncommemorative coin (500,000) honoring the millions of veterans of the \nUnited States Armed Forces who were disabled while serving our country. \nRevenues from the surcharge on the coin would go to the Disabled \nVeterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation to help cover the costs of building \nthe American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial in Washington, DC. The \nmint date is scheduled for January 1, 2010.\n  In its own distinctive way, the American Veterans Disabled for Life \nMemorial will also allow the American people to show their appreciation \nto those who died defending freedom by honoring the disabled veterans \nwho still live among us. It is not only appropriate, but necessary, to \nrecognize the special sacrifices that disabled veterans have made to \nthis country. It has been said that ``poor is the Nation which has no \nheroes. Poorer still is the Nation which has them, but forgets.'' The \ncreation of this memorial will ensure that we, as a Nation, do not \nforget those who have been forever changed in service to our country.\n  The three-acre site for the Memorial is located on Washington Avenue \nat 2nd Street, SW., across from the U.S. Botanic Gardens, and in full \nview of the U.S. Capitol building. Federal legislation for the \nMemorial, Public Law 106-348, was signed into law by President Bill \nClinton on October 24, 2000. Sponsors included Senator John McCain, \nSenator Max Cleland, Congressman Sam Johnson, and Congressman Jack \nMurtha. The National Capital Planning Commission unanimously approved \nthe Capitol Hill location on October 10, 2001.\n  We have an obligation to assure that the men and women who each day \nendure the costs of freedom are never forgotten. The American Veterans \nDisabled for Life Commemorative Coin Act of 2005 will honor these \nveterans and help fund the American Veterans Disabled for Life \nMemorial.\n  The Disabled Veterans LIFE Memorial Foundation was co-founded in 1996 \nby the Lois Pope Life Foundation and the Disabled American Veterans. \nLois Pope, one of America's leading philanthropists, is the founder and \nPresident of the Lois Pope Leaders in Furthering Education Foundation. \nIn addition to supporting veterans programs, this organization provides \nawards for medical research, scholarships, and summer camp programs. \nFormed in 1920, the Disabled American Veterans is a nonprofit \norganization representing America's disabled veterans, their families, \nand survivors.\n  The drive to build the Memorial, which is scheduled for completion \nwithin the next several years, is well under way, but has a long way to \ngo. Prominent national figures including Retired Army General H. Norman \nSchwarzkopf, Poet Laureate Dr. Maya Angelou, and New York Giants star \ndefensive end Michael Strahan are lending their support to this effort. \nI ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in supporting America's \ndisabled veterans with this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAMBLISS:\n  S. 634. A bill to amend the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export \nEnhancement Act of 2000 to clarify allowable payment terms for sales of \nagricultural commodities and products to Cuba; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation \nto reverse the unilateral change by the Department of Treasury's Office \nof\n\n[[Page S2849]]\n\nForeign Assets Control (OFAC) that threatens future sales of U.S. \nagricultural products to Cuba.\n  Four years ago, Congress passed the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export \nEnhancement Act (TSREEA), allowing sales of food and medicine to Cuba \nfor the first time in nearly four decades. The Act did not signal an \nend to the embargo or efforts to do so but merely exempted food and \nmedicine from unilateral sanctions that harm local populations.\n  Cuba first purchased U.S. agricultural products under the new \nauthorities in December 2001. Since that time, Cuba has contracted to \npurchase approximately $1.25 billion worth of U.S. agricultural goods. \nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. agriculture, fish \nand forest product exports to Cuba in fiscal year 2004 totaled $402 \nmillion, up 115 percent from a year earlier. The leading export items \nlast year were rice, $65 million, poultry meat, $62 million, wheat, $57 \nmillion, corn, $51 million, and soybeans, $38 million, from more than \n40 States in this country. Although U.S. agricultural trade with Cuba \nexperienced tremendous growth in the past four years, the future is now \nin doubt.\n  Late last year, OFAC and the State Department started considering \nactions to further tighten trade requirements on Cuba. At issue is the \nterm ``cash in advance'' and the sale of licensed agricultural \nproducts. On February 22, 2005, after repeated urgings by Members of \nCongress to the contrary, OFAC amended the Cuban Assets Control \nRegulations to clarify the term whereby goods cannot leave the U.S. \nport at which they are loaded until payment is received by the seller \nor the seller's agent. The interpretation by OFAC runs counter to \ngeneral trade practices and will likely shut down U.S. agricultural \nexports to Cuba.\n  Currently, U.S. exporters require payment before turning over title \nand control of the goods. The exporters routinely ship U.S. goods to \nCuba where they remain under the custody of the seller until such time \nas the seller certifies full payment. Only then are the goods released \nto Cuba. At no time is credit extended in any form to Cuba. This \nstandard method of doing business has been in practice since sales to \nCuba began.\n  TSREEA was meant to expand access for agricultural producers to the \nCuban market. By taking into consideration the unique nature of \nagriculture trade with Cuba, my legislation intends to overturn OFAC's \nnew definition of ``cash in advance''. We should not be making it \nharder to export agricultural products when the United States is \nexperiencing a massive trade deficit. I am committed to helping expand \nopportunities at home and abroad for our nation's farmers and ranchers. \nI look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate on this \nimportant issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Conrad, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 635. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the benefits under the medicare program for beneficiaries with \nkidney disease, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Kidney Care \nQuality Act, which Senator Santorum and I introduce today. With all of \nthe attention now being paid to improving the quality of health care \nAmericans receive, we believe it is important for Congress to reaffirm \nour commitment to patients with kidney failure.\n  As part of this commitment, Congress should ensure that these \npatients receive high quality care and should take steps to improve the \nMedicare End Stage Renal Disease, ESRD, program. This bill would do \njust that. First, it establishes a quality demonstration project to \nreward high quality dialysis providers. It also establishes education \nprograms to assist patients with kidney disease to learn important \nself-management skills that will help them manage their disease more \neffectively and improve their quality of life. The bill also seeks to \nhelp individuals before they develop irreversible kidney failure by \nteaching individuals about the factors that lead to chronic kidney \ndisease, the precursor to kidney failure, and how to prevent it, treat \nit, and, most importantly, avoid it.\n  Additionally, we recognize that some patients who currently receive \ndialysis in dialysis facilities and hospitals could benefit by \nreceiving the treatments in their homes. Even though home dialysis can \nimprove patients' quality of life by allowing them to remain employed \nand to participate in other activities that promote well-being, only a \nsmall number of patients select the home dialysis option. According to \nthe U.S. Renal Data System, less than one percent of all ESRD patients \nrelied on home dialysis in 2001. The bill we are introducing today \nwould require the Department of Health and Human Services to identify \nbarriers patients face in choosing home dialysis benefits and take \nsteps toward eliminating them.\n  Improving the ESRD program payment system is also a critical \ncomponent of promoting high quality care for patients with kidney \nfailure. Medicare established the first prospective payment system, \nPPS, in the ESRD program in the early 1980s. Since that time, we have \nlearned a great deal about how the PPS methodology works. Yet, the ESRD \nprogram remains the only Medicare PPS that does not receive an annual \nupdate. As a result, dialysis facilities have difficulty hiring \nqualified health care professionals because they simply cannot match \nthe salaries offered by hospitals and other providers that do receive \nan annual update. For 2005, MedPAC has calculated a projected margin on \ndialysis services of -0.03 percent when combining the composite rate \nand injectible drugs. Without a fair reimbursement rate, providers face \nsignificant hurdles in attracting high quality health care \nprofessionals. Our bill addresses this ongoing problem to ensure that \nproviders receive fair payment for the services they provide.\n  Congress must reaffirm its commitment to Americans with kidney \nfailure by improving the program through new educational programs, \nquality initiatives, and payment reform. The Kidney Care Quality Act is \na comprehensive bill that moves the program in that direction. I urge \nmy colleagues to join with me in supporting this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 636. A bill to direct the Inspector General of the Department of \nJustice to submit semi-annual reports regarding settlements relating to \nfalse claims and fraud against the Federal Government; to the Committee \non Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am re-introducing a bill \ndirecting the Inspector General of the Department of Justice to submit \nsemi-annual reports regarding settlements relating to false claims and \nfraud against the United States.\n  The False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. Sec. 3729 et seq., is the \ngovernment's single most effective program for recouping money \nimproperly obtained from the United States by false claims and fraud. \nInitially passed during the Civil War at President Abraham Lincoln's \nrequest to suppress fraud against the Union Army, the FCA was \nmodernized and updated in 1986. Since President Ronald Reagan signed \nthe 1986 amendments into law, settlements and judgments in FCA cases \nhave exceeded $13 billion. No other anti-fraud program of the Federal \nGovernment can match this result.\n  Despite the significance of these results, the Congress does not have \na way to evaluate the performance of the FCA program. While the \nprogram, which is overseen by the Civil Division of the Department of \nJustice, appears to be doing well, it is not known at this time how the \nprogram is performing as compared to its potential. What percentage of \nthe various frauds perpetrated against the United States is recouped in \nFalse Claims Act cases? How effectively does DoJ capture the multiple \ndamages and penalties provided for by the act? How quickly does DoJ \nmove FCA cases? How effectively does DoJ use the tools provided to it \nby the FCA, such as civil investigative demands? How effectively does \nDoJ use relators and how well does it reward them?\n  The purpose of this bill is to answer these questions. The bill \nrequires DoJ to submit certain information that will allow Congress to \nevaluate the Department's performance in managing FCA cases. Thus, \nunder this bill the Department of Justice will be required to describe \nits settlements of FCA cases. The report to Congress shall include a\n\n[[Page S2850]]\n\ndescription of the estimated damages suffered by the United States, the \namount recouped, the multiplier used to calculate the settlement \namount, the criminal fines collected and whether the defendants were \nheld liable in previous cases. The report will also inform Congress as \nto whether the defendants have been required to enter into corporate \nintegrity agreements.\n  In addition, in order to understand how the program is working, the \nDepartment of Justice will be required to inform Congress as to whether \ncivil investigative demands were issued. The Department will also be \nrequired to provide certain information about the conduct of qui tam \ncases initiated by whistleblowers. For example, Congress will receive \ninformation about the length of time cases are under seal, whether \nwhistleblowers (technically termed ``relators'') sought a fairness \nhearing regarding a settlement and what share of the settlement they \nreceived. The Congress would also receive information about whether the \nagency that suffered from the fraud involved participated in the \nsettlement.\n  In regard to cases involving Medicaid Fraud, the report will provide \nCongress with the details of how much money was returned to each state \nparticipating in the settlement. In a time when many states are \nstruggling with their Medicaid budgets, the Congress needs to know how \neffectively DoJ is in suppressing Medicaid fraud and returning money to \nthe states.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 636\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to extend the authorization for the ferry boat \ndiscretionary program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will greatly enhance Federal participation in financing and \nimproving our Nation's ferry transportation system.\n  Today I again introduce the Ferry Transportation Enhancement Act, or \nFerry-TEA. I am proud to have Senators Collins, Boxer, Cantwell, \nClinton, Corzine, Feinstein, Kennedy, Schumer, Snowe, and Stevens as \noriginal cosponsors. This bill will provide significantly more \nresources to State governments, public ferry systems, and public \nentities responsible for developing facilities for ferries.\n  Specifically, the bill would: provide $150 million a year for the \nFederal Highway Administration's Ferry Boat Discretionary Program. This \nis approximately four times the $38 million a year that is currently \nbeing provided under this program; add ``ferry maintenance facilities'' \nto the list of allowable use of funds under this program; add \n``ferries'' to the Clean Fuels Program; establish a Ferry Joint Program \nOffice to coordinate federal programs affecting ferry boat and ferry \nfacility construction, maintenance, and operations and to promote ferry \nservice as a component of the nation's transportation system; establish \nan information database on ferry systems, routes, vessels, passengers \nand vehicles carried; and establish an institute for ferries to conduct \nR, conduct training programs, encourage collaborative efforts to \npromote ferry service, and preserve historical information. This will \nparallel institutes that now exist for highways, transit, and rail.\n  Currently, the Federal investment in ferries is only one-tenth of one \npercent of the total Surface Transportation Program. There is virtually \nno coordination at the federal level to encourage and promote ferries \nas there are for other modes of transportation.\n  We need better coordinated ferry services because it's the sole means \nof surface transportation in many areas of the country, including, \nHawaii, Alaska and my home State of Washington.\n  Ferries are also the preferred, and the only feasible, method of \ncommuting from home to work in places like Washington State, New York/\nNew Jersey, North Carolina, Hawaii and Alaska.\n  Finally, in many States like my home State of Washington they are an \nimportant part of the tourism industry and represent a part of our \ncultural identity.\n  The symbol of ferries moving people and vehicles on the waterways of \nthe Puget Sound is as much a part of our cultural identity as \ncomputers, coffee, commercial aircraft and the Washington Apple.\n  Ferry use is growing.\n  In Washington State our ferry system--the Nation's largest--\ntransports approximately 26 million passengers each year and carries 11 \nmillion vehicles. This is more passengers in my one state than Amtrak \ntransports on a yearly basis nationwide.\n  Other systems that serve New York/New Jersey, North Carolina, San \nFrancisco, and Alaska also have significant numbers of passengers using \nthe ferries.\n  The Nation's six largest ferry systems recently carried 73 million \npeople and 13 million vehicles in just one year.\n\n[[Page S2851]]\n\n  The growth projection for ferry use is very high. For these larger \nsystems, it is projected that by 2009 there will be a 14-percent \nincrease in passengers and a 17-percent increase in vehicles being \ncarried by ferries compared to 2002.\n  In San Francisco, that projection is a 46-percent increase.\n  It is clear that many people are using ferries and more will be using \nthem in the future.\n  This is all with very little help from the Federal Government.\n  Our investment in ferries pails in comparison to the federal \ninvestments in highways and other forms of mass transit.\n  Our bill would provide the needed funding for these growing systems \nfor new ferry boat construction, for ferry facilities and terminals, \nand for maintenance facilities.\n  The bill also would make ferries eligible under the Clean Fuels \nProgram.\n  Like busses, ferries are a form of mass transit that is \nenvironmentally cleaner than mass use of cars and trucks. Making them \neligible for the Clean Fuels Program will encourage boat makers to \ndesign cleaner and more efficient vessels in the future. This will make \nferry travel an even more environmentally friendly means of \ntransportation than it already is today.\n  During the 108th Congress, I, with the help of several of my \ncolleagues, was able to attach an amendment to the surface \ntransportation reauthorization bill--SAFETEA. That amendment would have \nincreased the funding for the Ferry Boat Discretionary Program from $38 \nmillion per year to $120 million per year and make other changes.\n  I thank Chairman Inhofe, Chairman Bond, and Senators Jeffords and \nReid for working with us to include that important amendment.\n  As we again move to the Senate consideration of the reauthorization \nbill in the near future, I look forward to working with my cosponsors \nand the leaders of the Committee, which now includes Senator Baucus, to \nsee all the elements of Ferry-TEA is included in the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 638\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to reduce the \nage for receipt of military retired pay for nonregular service from 60 \nyears of age to 55 years of age; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nlowering the retirement age for National Guard and Reserves from 60 to \n55. This legislation, which I introduced last year, is an extremely \nmodest step toward treating our reservists fairly and in accordance \nwith the enormous sacrifices they are making. This bipartisan \nlegislation is co-sponsored by Senators Cochran, Lautenberg, Lincoln, \nLeahy, Reid, Kerry, Johnson, Ben Nelson and Dayton.\n  This bill merely brings the retirement age for reservists down to the \nFederal civil servant retirement age, as was intended when the \nreservist retirement age was set fifty years ago. Our reservists are \nmaking enormous sacrifices, risking their lives in combat zones, and, \nin far too many instances, dying for their country. At the very least, \nthey should have the same benefits as Federal civil servants.\n  But, there are other, bigger reasons for giving our reservists more \nequitable benefits. America has never placed greater demands on its \nreservists than it does now. Since September 11, 2001, more than \n412,000 Guard and Reserve members have been called up, including 6,800 \nNew Jersey National Guard members and 2,240 New Jersey Reservists. Many \nof them have been sent for yearlong combat tours in Iraq or \nAfghanistan.\n  We have entered a new era in which our reservists are no longer \n``weekend warriors.'' They are accepting the lengthy deployments and \ncombat roles previously reserved to regular active duty forces. Well \nover forty percent of the troops currently serving in Iraq are members \nof the National Guard and Reserves. It is time that their benefits more \nclosely reflect those granted to active duty servicemembers. Lowering \nthe retirement age for reservists to 55, when active duty \nservicemembers receive retirement benefits after 20 years, regardless \nof age, is a modest step toward fairness and equity.\n  At a time when reservist recruitment is falling short, an improvement \nin benefits will help fill critical gaps. According to recent reports, \nthe Army Guard missed its recruiting goal by 12 percent in the last \nfiscal year. For the first four months of fiscal 2005, recruitment is \n24 percent behind. Just a few weeks ago, on February 24, Lt. Gen. Roger \nSchultz, director of the Army Guard, was quoted in the Dallas Morning \nNews saying ``No doubt, if we kept up this pace for extended periods, \nour force would come apart.'' And, as the Baltimore Sun reported, the \nhead of the Army Reserve, Lt. Gen. James Helmly, told the Army Chief of \nStaff that his arm of the service was in danger of becoming a ``broken \nforce'' under the current operations tempo.\n  By providing our reservists with the benefits they deserve, we can \nhelp reverse this course. We will also be sending a powerful message: \nthat we value your service and recognize the incredible sacrifices you \nare making. And we will truly be honoring our heroes.\n  This bill has broad support and has been endorsed by key members of \nthe Military Coalition, including the Reserve Officers Association, \nVeterans of Foreign Wars, the Military Officers Association of America, \nthe Air Force Sergeants Association, the Air Force Association, the \nRetired Enlisted Association, the Fleet Reserve Association, the Naval \nReserve Association, and the National Guard Association.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 639\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REDUCTION IN AGE FOR RECEIPT OF MILITARY RETIRED \n                   PAY FOR NONREGULAR SERVICE.\n\n       (a) Reduction in Age.--Section 12731(a)(1) of title 10, \n     United States Code, is amended by striking ``at least 60 \n     years of age'' and inserting ``at least 55 years of age''.\n       (b) Application to Existing Provisions of Law or Policy.--\n     With respect to any provision of law, or of any policy, \n     regulation, or directive of the executive branch, that refers \n     to a member or former member of the uniformed services as \n     being eligible for, or entitled to, retired pay under chapter \n     1223 of title 10, United States Code, but for the fact that \n     the member or former member is under 60 years of age, such \n     provision shall be carried out with respect to that member or \n     former member by substituting for the reference to being 60 \n     years of age a reference to the age in effect for \n     qualification for such retired pay under section 12731(a) of \n     title 10, United States Code, as amended by subsection (a).\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect on the first day of the first month \n     beginning on or after the date of the enactment of this Act \n     and shall apply to retired pay payable for that month and \n     subsequent months.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Frist, and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 641. A bill to award a congressional gold medal to Michael Ellis \nDeBakey, M.D.; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \nlifetime achievements of Dr. Michael Ellis DeBakey, a public servant \nand world-renowned cardiologist, by offering legislation to award him \nthe Congressional Gold Medal.\n  Throughout his life Dr. DeBakey has made numerous advances in the \nfield of medicine. When he was only 23 years of age and still attending \nmedical school, Dr. DeBakey developed a roller pump for blood \ntransfusions--the precursor and major component of the heart-lung \nmachine used in the first open-heart operation. This device later led \nto national recognition for his expertise in vascular disease. His \nservice to our country did not stop there.\n  Dr. DeBakey put his practice on hold and volunteered for military \nservice during World War II with the Surgeon General's staff. During \nthis time, he received the rank of Colonel and Chief of Surgical \nConsultants Division.\n  As a result of his military and medical experience, Dr. DeBakey made \nnumerous recommendations to improve the military's medical procedures. \nHis efforts led to the development of mobile army surgical hospitals, \nbetter known as MASH units, which earned him the Legion of Merit in \n1945.\n  After WWII, Dr. DeBakey continued his hard work by proposing national \nand specialized medical centers for those soldiers who were wounded or \nneeded follow-up treatment. This recommendation evolved into the \nVeterans Affairs Medical Center System and the establishment of the \ncommission on Veterans Medical Problems of the National Research \nCouncil.\n  In 1948, Dr. DeBakey joined the Baylor University College of \nMedicine, where he started its first surgical residency program and was \nlater elected the first President of Baylor College of Medicine.\n  Adding to his list of accomplishments Dr. DeBakey performed the first \nsuccessful procedure to treat patients with anyeurysms. In 1964, Dr. \nDeBakey performed the first successful coronary bypass surgery, opening \nthe doors for surgeons to perform preventative procedures to save the \nlives of many people with heart disease. He was also the first to \nsuccessfully use a partial artificial heart. Later that same year, \nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Dr. DeBakey as Chairman of the \nPresident's Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer and Stroke, which led \nto the creation of Regional Medical Programs. These programs coordinate \nmedical schools, research institutions and hospitals to enhance \nresearch and training.\n  Dr. DeBakey continued to amaze the medical world when he pioneered \nthe field of telemedicine by performing the first open-heart surgery \ntransmitted over satellite and then supervised the first successful \nmulti-organ transplant, where a heart, both kidneys and a lung were \ntransplanted from a single donor into four separate recipients.\n\n  These accomplishments have led to national recognition. Dr. DeBakey \nhas received both the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction \nfrom President Johnson and the National Medal of Science from President \nRonald Reagan.\n  Recently, Dr. DeBakey worked with NASA engineers to develop the \nDeBakey Ventricular Assist Device, which may eliminate the need for \nsome patients to receive heart transplants.\n\n[[Page S2853]]\n\n  I stand here today to acknowledge Dr. DeBakey's invaluable work and \nsignificant contribution to medicine by offering a bill to award him \nthe Congressional Gold Medal. His efforts and innovative surgical \ntechniques have since saved the lives of thousands, if not millions, of \npeople. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in recognizing the \nprofound impact this man has had on medical advances, the delivery of \nmedicine and how we care for our Veterans. Although, Dr. DeBakey is not \na native of Texas, he has made Texas proud. He has guided the Baylor \nCollege of Medicine and the city of Houston into becoming a world \nleader in medical advancement. On behalf of all Texans, I thank Dr. \nDeBakey for his lifetime of commitment and service not only to the \nmedical community but to the world. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 641\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Michael Ellis DeBakey, M.D., was born on September 7, \n     1908 in Lake Charles, Louisiana, to Shaker and Raheeja \n     DeBakey.\n       (2) Dr. DeBakey, at the age of 23 and still a medical \n     student, reported a major invention, a roller pump for blood \n     transfusions, which later became a major component of the \n     heart-lung machine used in the first successful open-heart \n     operation.\n       (3) Even though Dr. DeBakey had already achieved a national \n     reputation as an authority on vascular disease and had a \n     promising career as a surgeon and teacher, he volunteered for \n     military service during World War II, joining the Surgeon \n     General's staff and rising to the rank of Colonel and Chief \n     of the Surgical Consultants Division.\n       (4) As a result of this first-hand knowledge of military \n     service, Dr. DeBakey made numerous recommendations for the \n     proper staged management of war wounds, which led to the \n     development of mobile army surgical hospitals or MASH units, \n     and earned Dr. DeBakey the Legion of Merit in 1945.\n       (5) After the war, Dr. DeBakey proposed the systematic \n     medical follow-up of veterans and recommended the creation of \n     specialized medical centers in different areas of the United \n     States to treat wounded military personnel returning from \n     war, and from this recommendation evolved the Veterans \n     Affairs Medical Center System and the establishment of the \n     Commission on Veterans Medical Problems of the National \n     Research Council.\n       (6) In 1948, Dr. DeBakey joined the Baylor University \n     College of Medicine, where he developed the first surgical \n     residency program in the City of Houston, and today, guided \n     by Dr. DeBakey's vision, the College is one of the most \n     respected health science centers in the Nation.\n       (7) In 1953, Dr. DeBakey performed the first successful \n     procedures to treat patients who suffered aneurysms leading \n     to severe strokes, and he later developed a series of \n     innovative surgical techniques for the treatment of aneurysms \n     enabling thousands of lives to be saved in the years ahead.\n       (8) In 1964, Dr. DeBakey triggered the most explosive era \n     in modern cardiac surgery, when he performed the first \n     successful coronary bypass, once again paving the way for \n     surgeons world-wide to offer hope to thousands of patients \n     who might otherwise succumb to heart disease.\n       (9) Two years later, Dr. DeBakey made medical history \n     again, when he was the first to successfully use a partial \n     artificial heart to solve the problems of a patient who could \n     not be weaned from a heart-lung machine following open-heart \n     surgery.\n       (10) In 1968, Dr. DeBakey supervised the first successful \n     multi-organ transplant, in which a heart, both kidneys, and \n     lung were transplanted from a single donor into 4 separate \n     recipients.\n       (11) In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Dr. \n     DeBakey to the position of Chairman of the President's \n     Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer and Stroke, leading to \n     the creation of Regional Medical Programs established ``to \n     encourage and assist in the establishment of regional \n     cooperative arrangements among medical schools, research \n     institutions, and hospitals, for research and training''.\n       (12) In the mid-1960's, Dr. DeBakey pioneered the field of \n     telemedicine with the first demonstration of open-heart \n     surgery to be transmitted overseas by satellite.\n       (13) In 1969, Dr. DeBakey was elected the first President \n     of Baylor College of Medicine.\n       (14) In 1969, President Lyndon B. Johnson bestowed on Dr. \n     DeBakey the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction, \n     and in 1985, President Ronald Reagan conferred on him the \n     National Medal of Science.\n       (15) Working with NASA engineers, he refined existing \n     technology to create the DeBakey Ventricular Assist Device, \n     one-tenth the size of current versions, which may eliminate \n     the need for heart transplantation in some patients.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate \n     shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on \n     behalf of the Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate \n     design, to Michael Ellis DeBakey, M.D., in recognition of his \n     many outstanding contributions to the Nation.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a \n     gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions \n     to be determined by the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n       The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of \n     the gold medal struck pursuant to section 2 under such \n     regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, at a price \n     sufficient to cover the cost thereof, including labor, \n     materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses, and \n     the cost of the gold medal.\n\n     SEC. 4.

AUTHORITY TO USE FUND AMOUNTS; PROCEEDS OF SALE.\n\n       (a) Authority To Use Fund Amounts.--There is authorized to \n     be charged against the United States Mint Public Enterprise \n     Fund such amounts as may be necessary to pay for the costs of \n     the medals struck pursuant to this Act.\n       (b) Proceeds of Sale.--Amounts received from the sale of \n     duplicate bronze medals authorized under section 3 shall be \n     deposited into the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Talent, Mr. Enzi, \n        Mr. Ensign, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Craig, Mr. Allen, Mr. Burns, Mr. \n        Chambliss, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Smith, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Graham, Mr. \n        Cornyn, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Brownback, \n        Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, and Mr. Nelson of Florida):\n  S. 642. A bill to support certain national youth organizations, \nincluding the Boy Scouts of America, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that my Senate \ncolleagues and I will be introducing the ``Support Our Scouts Act of \n2005'' today.\n  This legislation will ensure that the Defense Department can and will \ncontinue to provide the Scouts the type of support it has provided in \nthe past, such as at Jamborees and on bases. This bill also ensures \nScouts have equal access to public facilities, forums, and programs \nthat are open to a variety of other youth or community organizations.\n  Why am I introducing this legislation? Since the Supreme Court \ndecided Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, Boy Scouts of America's \nrelationship with government at all levels has been the target of \nmultiple lawsuits.\n  The Federal Government is defending a lawsuit brought by the ACLU \naimed at severing ties between Boy Scouts and the Department of Defense \nand the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The effect of \nthese attempts at exclusion at the Federal, State, and local levels are \nfar-reaching and has had a discernible ``chilling'' effect on \ngovernment support for our Scouts.\n  This is the greatest legal challenge facing Boy Scouts today. Boy \nScouts of America, like other non-profit youth organizations, depend, \non its ability to use public facilities and participate in these \nprograms and forums. The Support Our Scouts Act of 2005 addresses these \nissues by removing any doubt that Federal agencies may welcome Scouts \nto hold meetings and go camping on Federal property.\n  The Boy Scouts of America is a congressionally chartered \norganization. Pentagon support for Scouts is authorized in U.S. law. It \nserves a patriotic, charitable, and educational purpose. Since 1910, \nBoy Scout membership has totaled more than 110 million young Americans.\n  Today, more than 3.2 million youths and 1.2 million adults are \nmembers of the Boy Scouts and are dedicated to fulfilling the Boy \nScouts' mission. That number includes more than 40\n\n[[Page S2854]]\n\nmembers of the United States Senate and more than 150 members of the \nHouse of Representatives who have been involved in Scouting. I was a \nBoy Scout, and all three of my sons were as well. This unique American \ninstitution is committed to preparing our youth for the future by \ninstilling in them values such as honesty, integrity, and character.\n  Through exposure to the outdoors, hard work, and the virtues of civic \nduty, the Boy Scouts have developed millions of Americans into superb \ncitizens and future leaders.\n  The Support Our Scouts Act ratifies our longstanding commitment to \nthis valued civic organization. It clarifies that no Federal law, \nincluding any rule, regulation, directive, instruction, or order, shall \nbe construed to limit any Federal agency from providing any form of \nsupport to the Boy Scouts of America or the Girl Scouts of the United \nStates of America or any organization chartered by the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica or the Girl Scouts of the United States of America.\n  Activities supported include holding meetings, jamborees, camporees, \nor other scouting activities on Federal property, or hosting or \nsponsoring any official event of such organization. The Scouts Act is \nalso being introduced by a bipartisan group of Members in the House. I \nbelieve this bill will receive broad, bipartisan support in both \nchambers of Congress and that we will pass it this year. It is common \nsense legislation that all fair and reasonable people can support. I \nencourage Scout supporters--indeed, all Americans--to contact their \nSenators and Representatives and ask them to support the ``Support Our \nScouts Act of 2005.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 642\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Support our Scouts Act of \n     2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SUPPORT FOR YOUTH ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section--\n       (1) the term ``Federal agency'' means each department, \n     agency, instrumentality, or other entity of the United States \n     Government; and\n       (2) the term ``youth organization'' means any organization \n     described under part B of subtitle II of title 36, United \n     States Code, that is intended to serve individuals under the \n     age of 21 years.\n       (b) In General.--\n       (1) Support for youth organizations.--No Federal law \n     (including any rule, regulation, directive, instruction, or \n     order) shall be construed to limit any Federal agency from \n     providing any form of support for a youth organization \n     (including the Boy Scouts of America or any group officially \n     affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America) that would result \n     in that Federal agency providing less support to that youth \n     organization (or any similar organization chartered under the \n     chapter of title 36, United States Code, relating to that \n     youth organization) than was provided during each of the \n     preceding 4 fiscal years.\n       (2) Types of support.--Support described under paragraph \n     (1) shall include--\n       (A) holding meetings, camping events, or other activities \n     on Federal property; and\n       (B) hosting any official event of such organization.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish new special immigrant categories, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, many innocent human beings are forced \nfrom their homes and separated from their families because of war and \ncivil strife. We are seeing it right now in Darfur, Sudan where over 2 \nmillion have been displaced from their homes due to the conflict and \nongoing genocide. It is frightening to think that some of those people \nare still susceptible to persecution just for being a woman or a child. \nI have heard stories that the refugees and internally displaced persons \n(IDPs) are still not safe from being persecuted by their attackers. \nToday, I am pleased to introduce legislation that will save the lives \nof some of the world's most vulnerable populations.\n  The Widows and Orphans Act of 2005, similar to the one I introduced \nlast Congress, will benefit women and children fleeing war and civil \nstrife, who are often vulnerable and in grave danger. They may not be \nfleeing political persecution--something that would allow them to apply \nfor refugee status--but they may nevertheless be subjected to violence \nor exploitation. When a culture does not recognize female heads of \nhouseholds, when a young child loses his or her family structure, or \nwhen a woman's home community will not allow her to return at the end \nof hostilities, abuse and exploitation often follow.\n  For example, a widow fleeing an armed conflict risks being raped, \nbeing sold into sexual slavery or becoming a victim of violence. In \nanother example, a child who loses his or her parents when fleeing a \nconflict is in grave danger of sexual exploitation and forced \nservitude. The child could even be forced into service as a child \nsoldier, as we have seen happen to scores of children in Northern \nUganda. Even within a refugee camp--a place that might otherwise be \nthought of as safe--women and children face forced prostitution and \ninvoluntary servitude.\n  U.S. and international law does not currently provide refugee \nprotection for age and sex-based violence. The Widows and Orphans Act \nof 2005 is much-needed legislation which would fill this void by \nadmitting as special immigrants children and females at risk of harm. \nUnder this bill, government officials, the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and appropriate non-governmental \norganizations will be able to identify vulnerable women and children \nfor consideration as special immigrants who then can gain permanent \nresidence in the United States.\n  This legislation will allow officials in the field--those monitoring \narmed conflict and civil strife and those in refugee camps--to identify \nwomen and children who face harm because of their sex or age and refer \nthem for consideration as special immigrants. The bill will essentially \nspeed up the acceptance process by allowing officials with first-hand \nknowledge of cases to step in and identify those in dire need. With \nreliable security measures, it will also help eliminate fraud and abuse \nfrom those who wish to do us harm.\n  For widows and orphans, abuse and exploitation are immediate dangers. \nThis legislation provides officials at the grass-roots level the \nability to prevent further harm from coming upon those who have already \nfaced terrible situations.\n  More than 80 percent of the world's displaced people are women and \nchildren, and thousands of them are waiting patiently for the OK to \nenter our country. While they wait, they are often victimized; some \neven die waiting. We must not stand by as they are left to die.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \n        Reed, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Dodd, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 645. A bill to reinstate the Public Safety and Recreational \nFirearms Use Protection Act; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a common sense \nbill that will protect American citizens and law enforcement officers. \nThe Assault Weapons Ban and Law Enforcement Protection Act is designed \nto restore and strengthen the ban on assault weapons that expired on \nSeptember 13, 2004.\n\n[[Page S2855]]\n\n  The Government Accountability Office recently reported that 47 people \non the terrorist watch list legally purchased firearms in this country \nlast year. I personally believe that a person on the terrorist watch \nlist, who isn't allowed to board a commercial airliner, should not be \nable to purchase any weapon. But they especially shouldn't be able to \nbuy assault weapons, which possess unique, military-bred, anti-\npersonnel design characteristics. These features, taken together, make \nit easy for a shooter to simply point a weapon--as opposed to taking \ncareful aim--and quickly spray a wide area with a lethal hail of \nbullets.\n  These features make assault weapons especially attractive to \nterrorists and criminals, and virtually useless to hunters or sport \nshooters.\n  Before the previous ban on assault weapons expired last November, \nsome attempted to justify that expiration by saying that it wasn't \nworking as intended.\n  That is true. Some gun manufacturers were exploiting loopholes in the \nlaw by selling kits that made it possible to modify legal firearms into \nassault-style weapons, or by changing a few features of a weapon so it \nwould slip through the legal definition of an assault rifle. The proper \nresponse to these abuses was not to let the ban expire, however. \nInstead, we should have fixed the ban so it really kept assault-style \nweapons out of the hands of criminals and terrorists. This bill will do \nthat.\n  It improves and simplifies the definition of assault weapons; expands \nthe scope of the ban to include conversion parts kits that can be \npurchased through the mail and used to build an assault weapon; \nregulates the transfer of grandfathered assault weapons; clarifies \ndefinitions of assault weapon characteristics; and enhances tracing of \nassault weapons.\n  Keeping assault weapons out of the hands of terrorists and criminals \nis simply a matter of common sense. Innocent lives are at stake--\nincluding the lives of law enforcement officers who are our last line \nof defense against terrorists who would attack our communities. Make no \nmistake--military-style assault weapons are a threat to cops on the \nstreet.\n  An analysis of FBI data found that one in five law enforcement \nofficers slain in the line of duty between January 1, 1998, and \nDecember 31, 2001, were killed with assault weapons. How many of those \nofficers would be alive today if criminals hadn't been able to get \ntheir hands on assault weapons?\n  Hundreds of organizations are on record in support of a ban on \nassault weapons, including the Anti-Defamation League, Brady Campaign \nto Prevent Gun Violence united with the Million Mom March, Consumer \nFederation of America, National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, \nNational League of Cities, and Voices for America's Children. I urge \nall of my colleagues to support this common-sense measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 645\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 10. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States which requires (except during time of \nwar and subject to suspension by Congress) that the total amount of \nmoney expended by the United States during any fiscal year not exceed \nthe amount of certain revenue received by the United States during such \nfiscal year and not exceed 20 per centum of the gross national product \nof the United States during the previous calendar year; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, as we continue to debate the Federal \nGovernment's fiscal year 2006 budget, I can think of no better time to \ndiscuss the need for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. \nIt is for that reason that I stand before you today--to\n\n[[Page S2857]]\n\nintroduce a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  This is the same amendment that I have introduced every Congress \nsince the 97th Congress. Throughout my tenure in Congress, during good \neconomic times and bad, I have devoted much time and attention to this \nidea because I believe that one of the most important things the \nFederal Government can do to enhance the lives of all Americans and \nfuture generations is to balance the Federal budget.\n  Our Founding Fathers, wise men indeed, had great concerns regarding \nthe capability of those in government to operate within budgetary \nconstraints. Alexander Hamilton once wrote that: ``. . . there is a \ngeneral propensity in those who govern, founded in the constitution of \nman, to shift the burden from the present to a future day.'' Thomas \nJefferson commented on the moral significance of this ``shifting of the \nburden from the present to the future.'' He said: ``the question \nwhether one generation has the right to bind another by the deficit it \nimposes is a question of such consequence as to place it among the \nfundamental principles of government. We should consider ourselves \nunauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts and morally bound to \npay them ourselves.''\n  I completely agree with these sentiments. History has shown that \nHamilton was correct. Those who govern have, in fact, saddled future \ngenerations with the responsibility of paying for their debts. Over the \npast 30 years, annual deficits have become routine and the Federal \nGovernment has built up massive debt. Furthermore, Jefferson's \nassessment of the significance of this is also correct: \nintergenerational debt shifting is morally wrong.\n  Over the years, we have witnessed countless ``budget summits'' and \n``bipartisan budget deals,'' and we have heard, time and again, the \npromises of ``deficit reduction.'' But despite all of these charades, \nthe Federal budget remains severely out of balance today. The truth is, \nit will never be balanced as long as the President and the Congress are \nallowed to shortchange the welfare of future generations to pay for \ncurrent consumption. This is evidenced by the fact that I stood in this \nsame place, introducing this same legislation during both the 106th and \nthe 107th Congresses while the Federal budget was actually in balance. \nBut alas, I stand here today with an enormous Federal deficit and a \nballooning Federal debt.\n  A balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is the only certain \nmechanism to break the cycle of deficit spending and ensure that the \nGovernment does not continue to saddle our children and grandchildren \nwith the current generation's debts. A permanently balanced budget \nwould have a considerable impact in the everyday lives of the American \npeople. A balanced budget would dramatically lower interest rates \nthereby saving money for anyone with a home mortgage, a student loan, a \ncar loan, credit card debt, or any other interest rate sensitive \npayment responsibility. Simply by balancing its books, the Federal \nGovernment would put real money into the hands of hard working people. \nMoreover, if the governments demand for capital is reduced, more money \nwould be available for private sector use, which in turn, would \ngenerate substantial economic growth and create thousands of new jobs.\n  More money in the pockets of Americans and more job creation by the \neconomy can become a reality with a simple step--a balanced budget \namendment. On the other hand, without a balanced budget amendment, the \nGovernment will continue to waste the taxpayers' money on unnecessary \ninterest payments. In fiscal year 2004, the Federal Government spent \nmore than $321 billion just to pay the interest on the national debt. \nThat is more than the amount spent on all education, job training, and \ncrime programs combined.\n  We might as well be taking these hard-earned tax dollars and pouring \nthem down the drain. I believe that this money could be better spent on \nimproving education, developing new medical technologies, finding a \ncure for cancer, or even returning it to the people who earned it in \nthe first place. But instead, about 15 percent of the Federal budget is \nbeing wasted on interest payments because advocates of big government \ncontinue to block all efforts to balance the budget.\n  A balanced budget amendment to the Constitution can be the solution \nto this perpetual problem. A balanced budget amendment will put us on a \npath to paying off our national debt, which is currently almost $8 \ntrillion. This amendment will help ensure that taxpayers' money will no \nlonger be wasted on interest payments.\n  Opponents of a balanced budget amendment treat it as if it is \nsomething extraordinary. They are right, a balanced Federal budget \nwould be extraordinary. And I believe that adopting an amendment that \nwould require the Federal Government to do what every American already \nhas to do--balance their checkbook--is exactly what this country needs \nto prove that Washington is serious about accomplishing this \nextraordinary feat. A balanced budget amendment is simply a promise to \nthe American people that the Government will spend their hard-earned \ntax dollars responsibly. I think that we owe our constituents and \nfuture generations of Americans that much.\n  We do not need any more budget deals or false promises from \nWashington to reduce the deficit. What we need is a hammer to force \nCongress and the President to agree on a balanced budget, not just this \nyear, but forever. A constitutional amendment to balance the Federal \nbudget is the only hammer forceful enough to make that happen.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \namending the Constitution to permit direct popular elections for the \nPresidency and Vice Presidency of the United States.\n  I am mindful of the fact that altering the text of one of our \ncountry's most sacred documents requires careful thought, study and \ndebate. But for me the status quo raises too many problems and \nquestions.\n  The Electoral College is an archaic system. It may have been suitable \nduring the founding years of the Republic. But it is hardly appropriate \nfor the 21st century modern democracy that we have become.\n\n[[Page S2858]]\n\n  Fundamental fairness dictates that we have a single, nationwide count \nof popular votes. Hopefully my proposal represents the starting point \nfor how best to structure a system to accomplish that.\n  My approach is simple: the President is elected through a direct \npopular vote of the American people. Every American's vote counts the \nsame, whether they live in Florida, Maine, California, or Nebraska. All \nthe complexities of the current electoral college system are swept \naway. With my legislation the winner of the presidency is the \nindividual who tallies the most votes cast in the election.\n  For those who believe the Electoral College is a reasonable basis for \nelecting the President, consider the following: would a foreign country \ntoday, creating a new democratic election system from scratch, rely on \nthe U.S. Electoral College as a model? Not likely.\n  Let me begin by offering a few facts and observations about the \ncurrent system: the Electoral College allows a candidate to lose 39 \nStates in a general election but still win the Presidency; the \nElectoral College allows a candidate to lose a general election, by 10 \nmillion popular votes or more, yet still be elected President; in a \nrecent presidential election a candidate received nearly 20 million \npopular votes, roughly 19 percent of all votes cast, but that \ntranslated into 0 electoral votes; the Electoral College allows an \nelector to refuse to represent the majority of popular votes cast for a \npresidential candidate in his State's election--he can arbitrarily \nswitch sides and throw his lot in with an alternative candidate, which \nhas happened nine times since 1820; when a presidential election \nproduces a 269 to 269 tie in electoral votes between candidates, the \nPresident is chosen through a ``contingent'' election conducted by the \nHouse of Representatives with each state's delegation casting a single \nvote--which unfairly grants equal status to California, whose \npopulation is 35.5 million, and Wyoming, whose population is 500,000; \nmaking matters worse, when such a ``contingent election'' occurs, House \nmembers are not bound to support the candidate who won the popular vote \nin the State they collectively represent--they are free to vote as they \nsee fit; the two ``constant'' or ``senatorial'' electors automatically \nassigned to each State give less populous states a disproportionate \nadvantage in the Electoral College vote count compared to States with \nmore sizable populations; the winner-take-all concept for awarding a \nState's electoral votes disenfranchises all voters in a State who \nsupported a losing candidate in that State; and finally, the Electoral \nCollege undermines national campaigns by causing presidential \ncandidates to focus on a handful of contested States and ignore the \nconcerns of tens of millions of Americans living in other States.\n  The political and substantive utility of this system, full of \npitfalls and loopholes, is very hard to discern. Voter apathy is a \nfunction of a system signaling to people that their vote does not \ncount, and the Electoral College manages that in spades.\n  Now, I don't take this effort on lightly, because we have amended the \nConstitution a mere twenty-seven times since the founding of the \nnation. But as a matter of practical necessity, fairness and common \nsense, we need to consider the inherent inequities involved with the \nElectoral College.\n  My hope is that we can treat this in a bipartisan and nonparochial \nmanner that benefits the whole of the country. I appreciate that states \nand regions are affected differently, California among them, but my \nmotivations derive from improving the American federalist system in a \nway that eliminates undue consequences.\n  I have not been solicited by any particular interest group, \nconstituency, or voting bloc to amend the Constitution. At bottom, I \nbelieve this is a matter of serious import. Good public policy demands \nthat we give this subject sustained attention and I intend to do that \nthrough the Senate hearing process.\n  There was a time, of course, when the Electoral College adequately \nrepresented the voting needs of the country. In the 1780s there were no \nformal political parties as such, no experience with conducting \nnational campaigns for office, and no lack of mistrust among States \nlarge and small about protecting their interests.\n  The Founding Fathers understood: first, the social, economic and \npolitical disconnectedness that existed among the States; second, the \nfederalist system of governance was only beginning to take root; third, \nthe dearth of news and communications networks across the country made \nnational campaigning difficult; and fourth, the likelihood that a local \n``favorite son'' or regional candidate would prevail in a national \npresidential election.\n  This combination of factors justified an indirect election of the \nPresident through a College of Electors.\n  Inimical reasons existed for going this route as well. Had the \nFramers of the Constitution adopted the one man, one vote system, \nNorthern States that permitted blacks to vote in popular national \nelections could have exercised greater influence in electing the \nPresident than southern states. And States that independently extended \nrights of suffrage to women also could have gained an advantage.\n  The 15th Amendment in 1870 extending voting rights to Black men and \nmany years later women gaining those same rights laid these issues to \nrest. With the obstacles of racism and sexism now gone as reasons \njustifying the creation, of the Electoral College, the puzzlement over \nwhy we haven't updated the presidential election system only continues.\n  Regardless, as a means to reconcile the interests of State \ngovernments and the Federal government, of northern and southern \nstates, of majority and minority interests groups, and to let all these \nvoices be heard come election time, the Electoral College was \nconsidered a just compromise. Its basic form was adopted during the \nConstitutional Convention of 1787.\n  Political events occurred soon thereafter, though, prompting passage \nof the 12th Amendment and the first major changes in the Electoral \nCollege system. The presidential election of 1800, between Thomas \nJefferson and Aaron Burr, ended in a tie of electoral votes, causing \nthe House of Representatives to break the deadlock through a \n``contingent election''. A messy political imbroglio ensued. It was \nonly after many rounds of negotiations that Jefferson won the \nPresidency.\n  Importantly, the 12th Amendment to the Constitution passed in 1804 to \nstreamline the process of contingent elections. I would observe that \npassage of the 12th Amendment confirmed that the Electoral College \nsystem was, and remains, appropriately subject to change.\n  Legislators in 1804 did not delay in amending the Constitution for \nreasons of fairness and practicality, and nor should we in 2004 fail to \naddress the imperfect design that thwarts the will of the American \npublic.\n  Even with the 12th Amendment in place, the Electoral College managed \nto turn logic on its head in presidential elections throughout the 19th \ncentury. Minority presidents, so-called for winning the electoral vote \nbut losing the popular vote, were elected three times--John Quincy \nAdams in 1824, Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876, and Benjamin Harrison in \n1888.\n\n  And in 2000 the same problem re-surfaced, the fourth time in our \nNation's short history, with Vice President Al Gore edging George Bush \nby 537,895 popular votes, but losing the electoral college by a mere 5 \nvotes.\n  The Nation can be thankful, frankly, that we have only had disputed \nelections in just these four instances. A shift of a few thousand votes \nfrom one candidate to another in past presidential elections could have \nordained similar disarray. Some noteworthy examples include: despite \nlosing the popular vote by the sizable margin of 1.7 million votes, \nGerald Ford in 1976 needed only 5,559 more votes in Ohio and 3,687 in \nHawaii to reach the magical number of 270 electoral votes and he would \nhave been returned to the White House.\n  And had California, Illinois and Ohio posited 29,000 more votes in \nThomas Dewey's column, he lost the over popular vote by a wide margin, \n2.1 million, in 1948, the face of history may have been changed forever \nwith Harry Truman never returning to the White House.\n  And most recently, a shift of a mere 68,000 votes in Ohio from \nPresident George Bush's column to John Kerry would have allowed the \nDemocrat to\n\n[[Page S2859]]\n\nwin the electoral vote count, 271 to 267, and the Presidency, even \nthough Bush enjoyed a sizable 3.5 million margin in popular votes cast.\n  According to some estimates, we have had no fewer than 22 near \nmisses, all of which could have ended up as contentious as the 2000 \ncontest. We are tempting fate by ignoring this problem: sooner or later \na dramatic incongruity will occur between an electoral vote winner \ncontrasted against a different popular vote winner whose margin of \nvictory runs into the millions.\n  Electoral College anomalies don't end with disparities between the \nelectoral and popular vote winners. The phenomenon of the ``Faithless \nElector'' reflects a further structural defect in the Electoral College \nSystem.\n  History shows that electors have not been faithful to the \npresidential and vice presidential tickets winning the most votes in \ntheir respective states. They may initially pledge to the winning \ncandidate, but enjoy individual discretion to change their vote when \nelectoral votes are formally counted.\n  Contemporary examples are as follows: in 1968, Dr. Lloyd Bailey, a \nNorth Carolina elector initially pledged to Republican Richard Nixon, \nswitched his vote to George Wallace of the American Independent Party; \nin 1972, Roger MacBride, a Virginia elector for Richard Nixon switched \nhis vote to John Hospers of the Libertarian Party; in 1976, Mike \nPadden, a Washington elector for Gerald Ford voted for Ronald Reagan; \nin 1988, Margarat Leach, a West Virginia elector for Michael Dukakis, \nvoted instead for Lloyd Bentsen, an unusual decision to exchange the \npositions of the Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates; and in \n2000, Barbara Lett-Simmons, a District of Columbia elector for Democrat \nAlbert Gore Jr., cast a blank ballot.\n  These arbitrary decisions did not affect the outcome in each of those \npresidential election years. But they all flouted the electoral will of \nthe people.\n  The fact that such capricious switching is permitted, irrespective of \nthe outcomes of the popular vote results in the states in question, is \ncause for great concern. What might happen if electors break their \npledges to a particular candidate en masse? Is that possible and \nlegally enforceable? The answer appears to be yes.\n  In this vein, it does not require a stretch of the imagination to \nenvision three or more candidates splitting the electoral tally of \nvotes such that none received the requisite majority of 270 to win the \nWhite House.\n  In that situation, what prevents one of the candidates directing his \nelectors to another candidate, before the formal meeting of the \nElectors to count and certify the electoral votes occurs in the month \nfollowing the November election, to allow him to gain the necessary \nmajority of 270 in exchange for policy concessions or worse, a massive \ncash payment? Would that kind of corrupt transaction be allowed? What \nelement of the current Electoral College system prevents such an \nunfortunate outcome?\n  This may not be likely, given our strong two party system, but it is \npossible. Yet we tolerate the risk of it happening, year after year, \nbecause we assume it will never occur. Someday we may regret our \nindecision to fix what we know is wrong with the Electoral College \nsystem.\n  Twenty-five years ago in the 96th Congress, a majority of the Senate \nvoted 51 to 48 to support abolishing the Electoral College and replace \nit with direct popular elections. That legislation, S.J. Res. 26, fell \nshort of the necessary two-thirds required for a constitutional \namendment, but I am encouraged that more than half the body supported \nthe concept.\n  A few years before that, the House voted overwhelmingly in the 91st \nCongress, by a vote of 338 to 70, for the direct popular election of \nthe President. Alas, the effort fell short in the Senate.\n  I am prepared to press the case for this idea, on a bipartisan basis, \nthrough extensive committee deliberations and onto the Senate floor. \nThe time has come for the Senate to reconsider the essential building \nblocks of our democracy.\n  Some might claim that offering a constitutional amendment is a \npolitical gambit to overcome my own State's weak position in the \nElectoral College voting system. It is a fact that smaller States, such \nas South Dakota, Wyoming, and others, maintain disproportionate \ninfluence in the process compared to California.\n  I would respond to that as follows: my approach does equate the vote \nof a Californian, Rhode Islander and South Dakotan as being equal. But \nit also means that millions of votes cast for Republican candidates in \nfuture presidential races in my home state will have meaning and value. \nTheir votes will count for something.\n  In the 2000 race, George Bush received over 4.5 million votes in \nCalifornia. That should have counted for something--but it did not. All \n54 of California's electoral votes went to Vice President Al Gore.\n  Given the domination of Democratic presidential candidates in \nCalifornia in the modern era, it is clear that my party would not \nbenefit from a direct popular election in California.\n  But for me, this is about principle over politics. It is the right \nthing to do, even if it gives renewed life to Republican presidential \ncandidates in my home State.\n  As it stands now, California is not a place where Republican and \nDemocratic presidential candidates genuinely compete for votes. They \ncome to California to fill their campaign coffers but take a pass with \nreal voters. That needs to change--for California, yes, but also for \nNew York, Texas, for Utah and for so many other States in the country.\n  I have tried to understand the counterarguments to a nationwide \npopular vote. They reflect a desire to empower both regional and rural \ninterests, and deny major population centers from having excessive \npower. I appreciate the notion that we don't want clusters of cities \nand particular regions where the greatest numbers of Americans reside, \nNew York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, to dominate the electoral \nlandscape.\n  At the same time, a presidential candidate's priorities, record and \nvision for the country will determine how far he goes in the nominating \nand general election process. Stitching together a cross section of \nAmerican voters, who represent different economic and social \nbackgrounds, professions, parts of the country, religious faiths, and \nso much more holds the key to attaining a winning plurality or majority \nof votes in presidential races.\n  I would contend that it is up to the candidates to appeal to the \nbroadest group of Americans but to level the playing field in doing so. \nIn that process each American's vote, regardless of where that person \nlives in the country, should be counted equally.\n  Right now, that is just not the case. Our system is not undemocratic, \nbut it is imperfect, and we have the power to do something about it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Electoral College \nAbolition Resolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE CRIME VICTIMS FUND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:--\n       (1) The Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (``VOCA'') was enacted \n     to provide Federal financial support for services to victims \n     of all types of crime, primarily through grants to state \n     crime victim compensation and victim assistance programs.\n       (2) VOCA created the Crime Victims Fund (``the Fund'') as a \n     separate account into which are deposited monies collected \n     from persons convicted of Federal criminal offenses, \n     including criminal fines, forfeitures and special \n     assessments. There are no general taxpayer generated revenues \n     deposited into the Fund.\n       (3) Each fiscal year, the Fund is used to support--\n       (A) Children's Justice Act grants to States to improve the \n     investigation and prosecution of child abuse cases;\n       (B) victim witness coordinators in United States Attorney's \n     Offices;\n       (C) victim assistance specialists in Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation field offices;\n       (D) discretionary grants by the Office for Victims of Crime \n     to provide training and technical assistance and services to \n     victims of Federal crimes;\n       (E) formula grants to States to supplement State crime \n     victim compensation programs, which reimburse more than \n     150,000 violent crime victims annually for out-of-pocket \n     expenses, including medical expenses, mental health \n     counseling, lost wages, loss of support and funeral costs;\n       (F) formula grants to States for financial assistance to \n     upwards of 4,400 programs providing direct victim assistance \n     services to\n\n[[Page S2869]]\n\n     nearly 4,000,000 victims of all types of crimes annually, \n     with priority for programs serving victims of domestic \n     violence, sexual assault and child abuse, and previously \n     underserved victims of violent crime; and\n       (G) the Antiterrorism Emergency Reserve, to assist victims \n     of domestic and international terrorism.\n       (4) Just 4 months ago, a strong bipartisan, bicameral \n     majority in Congress affirmed its support for the Crime \n     Victims Fund and increased its commitment to crime victims in \n     the Justice for All Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-405), which \n     establishes Federal crime victims rights and authorized 2 new \n     VOCA-funded victim programs.\n       (5) Before fiscal year 2000, all amounts deposited into the \n     Crime Victims Fund in each fiscal year were made available \n     for authorized programs in the subsequent fiscal year.\n       (6) Beginning in fiscal year 2000, Congress responded to \n     large fluctuations of deposits into the Fund by delaying \n     obligations from the Fund above certain amount, as follows:\n       (A) For fiscal year 2000, $500,000,000.\n       (B) For fiscal year 2001, $537,500,000.\n       (C) For fiscal year 2002, $550,000,000.\n       (D) For fiscal year 2003, $600,000,000.\n       (E) For fiscal year 2004, $625,000,000.\n       (F) For fiscal year 2005, $625,000,000.\n       (7) In the conference report on an omnibus spending bill \n     for fiscal year 2000 (Public Law 106-113), Congress explained \n     that the reason for delaying annual Fund obligations was ``to \n     protect against wide fluctuations in receipts into the Fund, \n     and to ensure that a stable level of funding will remain \n     available for these programs in future years''.\n       (8) VOCA mandates that ``. . . all sums deposited in the \n     Fund in any fiscal year that are not made available for \n     obligation by Congress in the subsequent fiscal year shall \n     remain in the Fund for obligation in future fiscal years, \n     without fiscal year limitation''.\n       (9) For fiscal year 2006, the President is recommending \n     ``rescission'' of $1,267,000,000 from amounts in the Fund.\n       (10) The rescission proposed by the President would result \n     in no funds being available to support crime victim services \n     at the start of fiscal year 2007. Further, such rescission \n     would make the Fund vulnerable to fluctuations in receipts \n     into the Fund, and would not ensure that a stable level of \n     funding will remain available for vital programs in future \n     years.\n       (11) Retention of all amounts deposited into the Fund for \n     the immediate and future use of crime victim services as \n     authorized by VOCA is supported by many major national victim \n     service organizations, including--\n       (A) Justice Solutions, NPO;\n       (B) National Organization for Victim Assistance;\n       (C) National Alliance to End Sexual Violence;\n       (D) National Children's Alliance;\n       (E) National Association of VOCA Assistance Administrators;\n       (F) National Association of Crime Victim Compensation \n     Boards;\n       (G) Mothers Against Drunk Driving;\n       (H) National Center for Victims of Crime;\n       (I) National Organization for Parents of Murdered Children;\n       (J) National Coalition Against Domestic Violence;\n       (K) Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape; and\n       (L) National Network to End Domestic Violence.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the funding levels in this resolution assume that all \n     amounts that have been and will be deposited into the Crime \n     Victims Fund, including amounts deposited in fiscal year 2006 \n     and thereafter, shall remain in the Fund for use as \n     authorized under the Victims of Crime Act of 1984.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 204.

Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. \nSarbanes, and Mr. Kennedy) submitted an amendment intended to be \nproposed by him to the concurrent resolution S. Con. Res. 18, setting \nforth the congressional budget for the United States Government for \nfiscal year 2006 and including the appropriate budgetary levels for \nfiscal years 2005 and 2007 through 2010; which was ordered to lie on \nthe table; as follows:\n\n       On page 65, after line 25, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE TO MAKE MORE EFFICIENT AND \n                   EQUITABLE, FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE APPROPRIATIONS \n                   AND REVENUE DECISIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Federal programs and policies directly influence local \n     growth patterns through the location of Federal facilities, \n     spending on public infrastructure, tax incentives, and \n     Federal regulations.\n       (2) A majority of Americans favor walkable neighborhoods, \n     shorter commutes, and open space protection, which are land \n     development patterns favored by smart growth.\n       (3) Federal programs and policies should support local \n     development choices that improve communities through the \n     revitalization of town centers, transit and pedestrian-\n     oriented development, increased access to retail and public \n     services, open space and parklands, and a greater mix of \n     housing, commercial, and retail uses.\n       (4) Federal incentives should encourage enhanced community \n     quality of life, fiscally sound reinvestment in existing \n     infrastructure, a balanced transportation system, and safe, \n     decent, affordable places for people to live.\n       (5) Investing in existing infrastructure is a fiscally \n     responsible use of resources. When not properly planned, \n     local development decisions may actually burden the Federal \n     budget by requiring the construction of new water, sewer, and \n     transportation infrastructure in low-density areas, rather \n     than funding the maintenance of existing infrastructure. \n     Poorly planned development also often results in increased \n     commuting times, traffic congestion, impaired air quality, \n     loss of open space and environmentally sensitive areas, \n     public health problems, lack of affordable housing, and poor \n     accessibility to critical services such as schools and \n     hospitals.\n       (6) Improving and investing in communities through good \n     planning and sustainable community development has positive \n     effects, reflected, for example, in fiscal cost savings, \n     lower energy consumption, and healthier environments. In \n     addition, businesses are increasingly locating to areas that \n     offer parks and open spaces, provide walkable mixed-use \n     communities, and include a variety of housing options.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in this resolution assume that in \n     making appropriations and revenue decisions, the Senate \n     should--\n       (1) support Federal policies that encourage growth patterns \n     that make efficient and equitable use of available housing, \n     transportation, and infrastructure resources, including such \n     policies as brownfields development programs, farmland \n     protection programs, the retention of the Community \n     Development Block Grant Program (CDBG), and Federal facility \n     decisions, such as those made by the General Services \n     Administration that consider the benefits of utilizing \n     existing infrastructure; and\n       (2) address the unintended consequences of urban and \n     suburban sprawl resulting from specific Federal programs and \n     policies through the allocation of budgetary authority to \n     provide incentives for sustainable growth.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 223. Mr. VITTER proposed an amendment to the concurrent resolution \nS. Con. Res. 18, setting forth the congressional budget for the United \nStates Government for fiscal year 2006 and including the appropriate \nbudgetary levels for fiscal years 2005 and 2007 through 2010; as \nfollows:\n\n       On page 63, strike line 24, after the second period insert \n     the following: ``In dealing with homeland security assistance \n     grants that relate to port security, Congress should (1) \n     allocate port security grants under a separate, dedicated \n     program intended specifically for port security enhancements, \n     rather than as part of a combined program for many different \n     infrastructure programs that could lead to reduced funding \n     for port security, (2) devise a method to enable the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security to both distribute port \n     security grants to the Nation's port facilities more quickly \n     and efficiently and give ports the financial resources needed \n     to comply with congressional mandates, and (3) allocate \n     sufficient funding for port security to enable port \n     authorities to comply with mandated security improvements, \n     ensure the protection of our Nation's maritime \n     transportation, commerce system, and cruise passengers, \n     strive to achieve funds consistent with the needs estimated \n     by the United States Coast Guard, and recognize the unique \n     threats for which port authorities must prepare.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 224.

It is \nanticipated that we will begin voting on the remaining amendments \naround 1:20 or 1:30 tomorrow afternoon, and we will keep Senators \nposted as to the timing of this vote-arama. We are working through the \nlist of filed and offered amendments so we can minimize the number of \nvotes we will need to have during tomorrow's session. But Senators \nshould be expected to stay on the floor throughout the afternoon and \ninto the evening. These will be 10-minute votes, and Senators should \nplan their schedules around being on the floor in order not to miss any \nof these crucial votes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/16/senate-section/article/S2874-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
