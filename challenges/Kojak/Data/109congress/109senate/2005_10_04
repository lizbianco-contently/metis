Again, we have not voted on \nvery many Fridays over the last 8 months, but we will be voting on \nFriday this week.\n  We are also trying to reach consent agreements for consideration of \nthe pensions bill which the Democrat leader and I were just talking \nabout, a very important bill, and we are in the final stages of \npreparation of that bill. Once that is available, we will do our best \nas leadership to bring that to the Senate in a timely fashion.

Mr. President, Saturday night, on the Indonesian island of \nBali, suicide bombers attacked 3 crowded cafes, killing 25 people and \nwounding many more. People from 22 nations\n\n[[Page S10914]]\n\nperished in those deadly blasts. Indonesian officials are on the hunt \nfor the masterminds of this and the October 12, 2002, attacks.\n  America stands ready to assist in whatever way we possibly can. Our \nhearts go out to the families of the people of Indonesia who, once \nagain, have suffered at the hands of deranged killers. We know all too \nwell the pain and anguish caused by the terrorist enemies.\n  Today, the Senate intends to pass a resolution expressing our deep \nsympathies and condolences. I will come back to the Chamber later today \nto pass that resolution with unanimous consent. We stand shoulder to \nshoulder with the Indonesian people as they bring justice to the \nkillers.\n  We are at war with a barbarous and implacable foe. The killers strike \nin the name of Islam, but their religion is not to be found in the \npages of the Koran. Their religion is found in their corrupted and \nblackened hearts and in their twisted and hateful minds.\n  Indonesia, a Muslim country, has been the target of multiple attacks. \nThe killers seek power, squalid and absolute. Their war is on the \ncivilized world.\n  Istanbul, Turkey, 2003: 56 people killed, more than 450 people \ninjured.\n  Madrid, Spain, 2004: 190 people killed, 1,500 injured.\n  Beslan, Russia, September that year: 344 people killed, 186 of them \nschoolchildren.\n  London, UK, July 7, this summer: 52 people killed, 700 injured.\n  The attacks continue on the Iraqi people and the people of \nAfghanistan. The United States calls on the international community to \nrenew and strengthen our efforts to defeat the killers by dismantling \ntheir network and exposing the nihilism and perversion of their aims. \nWe urge the international community to increase the global effort to \nadvance freedom, liberty, and prosperity, and to root out the social \ninjustice that feeds the violence.\n  These are daunting challenges, to be sure. But just as surely, we \nhave no other choice. The gauntlet was thrown for America on September \n11. The enemy offers death. We must offer hope. We must shine the light \nof freedom wherever they live, wherever they hide, a light so dazzling \nthat not even their shadow remains.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, I rise to commend the President on his \nselection of Harriet Miers to be associate justice of the Supreme \nCourt. I have had the pleasure of knowing both Ms. Miers and the \nPresident for a number of years, from our days in Texas in State \nGovernment in particular. In Texas, President Bush had the reputation \nof being a uniter. Literally, we had divided government, with Democrats \ncontrolling the House and the Senate. He worked on a daily basis with \nLt. Gov. Bob Bullock and Speaker Pete Laney, who were of the other \nparty. When he came to Washington, he hoped he would find a Bob Bullock \nor a Pete Laney on the other side of the aisle so he could continue in \nthat tradition, doing what he believed was best for the people who had \nsent him here--all the people. Unfortunately, we know that Washington's \npolitical environment is way too partisan and even poisonous.\n  The President has chosen wisely with this nominee. He has chosen a \nnominee who should, and I believe will, unite us.\n  I am proud to say that Harriet Miers is a fellow Texan. She was born \nand raised in Dallas and attended Southern Methodist University, where \nshe received her bachelor's degree in mathematics and her law degree. \nThat is kind of an unusual combination for lawyers. Most lawyers eschew \nmathematics, but she nevertheless has a bachelor's degree in \nmathematics. Following law school, she clerked for a Federal judge and \nthen joined one of the finest law firms in our State, where she \npracticed for a number of years before she came to the attention of a \nGovernor who would then become our current President.\n  As proud as I am to say that Harriet is a fellow Texan, I am even \nmore proud to say she is a friend. I have known her for about 15 years. \nI have come to know her as a fine and decent human being, someone who \nhas dedicated her life to serving others, from the clients in her law \nfirm to the people of Texas, and now to offering herself to serve all \nof us in this great country.\n  It is especially fitting that Harriet Miers be nominated to the seat \nbeing vacated by another trailblazer, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. \nJustice O'Connor was the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court of \nthe United States. But Harriet has blazed a few trails of her own. She \nwas the first woman hired by her law firm. She was the first woman to \nserve as the president or comanaging partner of that firm. She was the \nfirst woman to serve as the president of the Dallas Bar Association, \nand then she was later selected to be the first woman to serve as \npresident of the State Bar of Texas, which is the association \nencompassing all members of the legal profession in Texas.\n  As these accomplishments make clear, she has had a long and \ndistinguished professional career. Her dedication to her clients, to \nher community, and to the rule of law has made her a leader in my \nState.\n  Her accomplishments do not end at the border of Texas. Over the last \n25 years, she has worked at the highest levels of our national \nGovernment in the White House, including serving as the President's \nclosest legal adviser. Moreover, before she came to Washington, she was \nknown and respected nationally for her legal skills and her advocacy \nfor legal services being provided and available to all Americans. She \nwas very active in the American Bar Association, and she is well known \nby lawyers throughout the country. We will hear increasingly more and \nmore of them come forward to speak, without regard to partisan \naffiliation or other considerations.\n  This long and distinguished career has made Harriet well qualified to \nserve as an associate justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. I am not \nalone. She has received praise from Senators on both sides of the \naisle, including the Democratic leader, the senior Senator from Nevada. \nShe has also received praise from this side of the aisle, from our \nmajority leader, as well as the senior Senator from Kentucky, our \ndeputy majority leader. She is without question a consensus nominee.\n  I know that makes some people nervous in a body where we have become \nso accustomed to locking horns and fighting over so many things, some \nof which are important. There are contests on principle, but sometimes \nthere are those who would pick a fight to keep that partisanship and \nbitterness going. The President has chosen well by choosing a consensus \nnominee. It is not surprising because this President has engaged in an \nunprecedented act of consultation on the two nominations to the Supreme \nCourt: First, now-Chief Justice John Roberts and now soon-to-be \nAssociate Justice Harriet Miers.\n  One thing you will not find in Harriet's long and distinguished \ncareer is service as a judge. I want to talk about that because some \nhave said that that is actually a weakness. I suggest that it is not a \nbad thing, nor is it unprecedented. Forty-one of the one hundred and \nnine Justices who have served on the U.S. Supreme Court had no previous \njudicial experience. These 41 included some of our Nation's most \ninfluential and best-known justices--William Rehnquist, Lewis Powell, \nByron White, Robert Jackson, Felix Frankfurter, Lewis Brandeis, Joseph \nStory, and John Marshall. Indeed, a little bit of diversity of \nbackground and experience is important to have on the Supreme Court. \nThe Supreme Court is full of Justices who have served either as\n\n[[Page S10915]]\n\nacademics or as court of appeals justice judges before they have been \nnominated to the Supreme Court bench. Certainly, while they are a \ndistinguished body of jurists, what the Court is actually missing is \nsomeone who has had practical legal experience, someone who will \nunderstand the real-world consequences of the Court's decisions for the \nAmerican people.\n\n  I have been one who has been concerned about the fact that the \nSupreme Court sometimes seems out of touch with America. When you have \nthe Supreme Court decide that the Ten Commandments is legal in Austin \nbut illegal in Kentucky and you have 10 different opinions for 9 \nJustices to explain it, clearly there is something amiss. Harriet Miers \nwill provide a strong dose of common sense and reconnect the Court with \nthe American people in an important way.\n  It is also important to have someone who has actually been elected to \noffice, as Harriet Miers has been. She has been elected to city council \nin Dallas, perhaps not high national office but nevertheless an \nimportant one. Once Justice O'Connor leaves the Court, there will be no \none left on the Court, but for this nominee, who has ever held elected \noffice. There is already no one there who has ever served at the \nhighest levels of the executive branch of Government. If it were not \nfor newly confirmed Chief Justice John Roberts, none of the Justices \nwould have been actively engaged in law practice in the past 35 years. \nEven the Chief Justice himself was primarily focused on appeals. A \nJustice Harriet Miers fills these gaps.\n  She was elected city councilwoman in Dallas. She served at the \nhighest levels of this administration, now as White House counsel, and \nshe has spent her entire professional career representing clients in \ncourtrooms across the State of Texas and even across the Nation.\n  I am not the only one who believes practical, real-world experience \nis important for a nominee. The senior Senator from Nevada, the \nDemocratic leader, yesterday said that he thought this was actually a \nplus, not a minus. The senior Senator from New York echoed this view, \nstating that the fact she hasn't been a judge before is actually a \npositive, not a negative. I think those sentiments are much as I have \nexplained. Certainly, they can speak for themselves.\n  I know there are many Americans who are unfamiliar with Harriet \nMiers. This is understandable. She has been working outside of the \nlimelight her entire career, always serving others. I have been \nfortunate enough to know her for about the last 15 years. I have a good \nfeel for who she is as a person and as a highly competent practitioner. \nI know that she believes, as I do, that judges should not legislate \nfrom the bench. I know she believes, as I do, that judges are not some \nsort of elite, appointed to impose their will on the rest of us. \nRather, I know she understands that unelected judges who serve in a \ndemocracy have a necessarily limited but important role--to apply the \nlaw as it was written.\n  Harriet aptly described this judicial philosophy yesterday when she \nsaid:\n\n       It is the responsibility of every generation to be true to \n     the founders' vision of the proper role of the courts in our \n     society. If confirmed, I recognize that I will have a \n     tremendous responsibility to keep our judicial system strong \n     and to help ensure that the courts meet their obligations to \n     strictly apply the laws and the Constitution.\n\n  I am confident, when the American people get to know Harriet Miers, \nas I have had the pleasure, they will be as supportive as I am today of \nthis nomination. I believe the President has chosen wisely. Now it is \nup to us in the Senate to go forward with the confirmation process. \nThat is not to say that her confirmation is preordained by any means \nbut that we now have the obligation to undertake this confirmation \nprocess in a civil and dignified and respectful manner.\n  I would say the Senate did itself proud in the way it handled the \nconfirmation of Chief Justice John G. Roberts. We have not always, in \nrecent memory, done ourselves proud in the judicial confirmation \nprocess, and I am speaking specifically of the filibusters that were \npreviously unprecedented. But hopefully this is a new day and we have \nlearned from those lessons of the past, and we will continue in the \ntradition that I think we have now reestablished with John G. Roberts.\n  I think we can even do better this time around. For example, the last \ntime around, some of my colleagues insisted that Chief Justice Roberts \nanswer questions about issues and cases that were likely to come before \nthe Court. Indeed, some of my colleagues stated they voted against his \nconfirmation precisely because he refused to precommit on some of the \nhot-button issues of the day. As I said, I hope we can do even better \nthis time.\n  My colleagues know that, as was Chief Justice Roberts, Harriet Miers \nis ethically forbidden from pledging to rule a certain way on these \nissues or any issues that are likely to come before the Supreme Court. \nIt is simply unfair to her, and I think it is a threat to judicial \nindependence to insist that any nominee pledge a certain performance \nwhen confirmed in judicial office. I think it is unfair to her to ask \nher a question that my colleagues know she simply cannot ethically \nanswer.\n  Every nominee who has come before the Senate has followed these \nethical rules and resisted making promises to politicians during the \nconfirmation process. This tradition has come to be known as the \nGinsburg standard, named for Justice Ginsburg nominated in 1993 by \nPresident Clinton. Justice Ginsburg was so steadfast and articulate in \ndefending the right of judicial nominees declining to prejudge cases on \nissues that might come before them once they get on the bench that we \nhave come to call this the Ginsburg standard.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle expressed \ndispleasure with the Ginsburg standard during the confirmation process \nfor Chief Justice Roberts. The one person who did not express \ndispleasure was Justice Ginsburg. Indeed, in remarks just last week to \nstudents at Wake Forest University, Justice Ginsburg reaffirmed the \nJustice Ginsburg standard, and she affirmed Chief Justice Roberts' \nrefusal to answer questions about issues that will likely come before \nthe Court.\n  She said:\n\n       Judge Roberts was unquestionably right. My rule was I will \n     not answer a question that attempts to project how I will \n     rule in a case that might come before the court. . . . A \n     judge on a collegial court should never forecast how he or \n     she would vote on particular issues. . . .\n\n  Nor, I might interject, should we want a judge who would be willing \nto trade a confirmation vote for a pledge of performance in office. It \nwould threaten judicial independence, it would violate the rules of \nethics, and I think it would be fundamentally unfair to people who look \nto the Supreme Court as the last bastion of justice in America today.\n  My hope is that Justice Ginsburg's endorsement of Chief Justice \nRoberts' confirmation conduct will persuade my Democratic colleagues to \nchange their minds on how we ought to treat judicial nominees, \nincluding Harriet Miers. We should not treat this nominee or any \nnominee unfairly and demand that they inappropriately make commitments \non how they will rule on hot-button issues of the day, no matter how \ncurious we are.\n  I must confess I am as curious as the next person, but I recognize \nthere is a higher duty than merely satisfying my curiosity, or anyone \nelse's for that matter: judicial independence, judicial ethics, and the \nimportance of not prejudging cases so that there will not only be the \nreality of justice being disseminated on a fair and equal basis, there \nwill be the perception that judges have not prejudged issues or cases.\n  This is an important nomination for our country. The nomination of \nany person to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States is a \ncelebration of our Constitution and of our Nation's commitment to the \nrule of law, perhaps our most important export.\n  It is all the more important today because this is the nomination of \nonly the third woman to serve on our Nation's highest Court. I look \nforward to a dignified, civil, and respectful confirmation process in \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I come to the Chamber today to discuss amendments to \npromote our success in Iraq as quickly as possible, consistent with \naccomplishing our mission there, to hold those in charge for \nimplementing our strategy in Iraq accountable for its success, and to \ndo right by those bearing the burden of that conflict on our behalf, \nour brave military personnel and their loving families.\n  These amendments are designed to increase the number of armored \nvehicles for our troops in the field and to promote and to protect \ntheir families financially at home but, even more important, to provide \na clear picture of what we are doing in Iraq and a way to measure our \nprogress there so that we can bring our troops home with their mission \naccomplished.\n  Last week, Generals Casey and Abizaid came to Congress to inform us \nthat the administration had finally heeded bipartisan calls from this \nbody to develop a plan for success, a plan that goes way beyond merely \nasking the American people to stay the course.\n  During their testimony before the Armed Services Committee and in \nprivate briefings for Senators, the generals talked about the plan and \nhow it was developed jointly with Iraqi leadership. Essentially, if the \nplan is to be successful, it will lead to a reduction of American \nforces starting next year.\n  In a discussion with Senator McCain, General Casey had the following \nto say:\n\n       Senator McCain: Are you planning on troop withdrawals for \n     next year?\n       General Casey: I just said that, Senator. Yes. This is a \n     bipartisan goal that we all support. Creating a stable Iraq \n     and bringing American men and women home safely as soon as \n     possible consistent with success is something that we all \n     embrace.\n\n  The generals also said that they had developed specific guidelines to \nallow them to measure the success of this plan. I am pleased that a \nplan has been developed and measurements created to gauge its success, \nalthough belatedly so. But I also know that having a plan is not nearly \nenough. It is the effective implementation of a strategy that will \ndetermine our ultimate success and establishing benchmarks that allow \nus to determine the progress that is being made. Regrettably, we have \nhad far more of the development of a strategy and far less of the \naccountability for implementing the strategy so far in the Iraqi \nconflict. The time for changing that has come.\n\n  Successful execution of any plan includes two things that have been \nlacking so far--accountability and candor. My amendment brings both of \nthese elements into the administration's war effort.\n  The amendment requires the Pentagon and the CIA to report to Congress \nand to the American people once a month on the progress they are making \nwith regard to their own strategy and how it is faring on the \nmeasurements they have outlined to determine our success. It is their \nstrategy, their benchmarks. If they are not being met, the \nadministration should explain to the American people why. If no \nadequate explanation exists, those responsible must be held \naccountable. That is the way you run any business or any State, and \nthat is the least we can expect when waging war.\n  These benchmarks are crucial to gauging our progress and are vital to \nachieving our success. They were included in an unclassified document \nprovided to the Congress this last week, the title of which is \n``Transitional Readiness Assessment.'' It provides seven different \nmeasurements to determine how we are doing in Iraq: first, overall \nreadiness; second, the number of Iraqi personnel; third, their command \nand control capability; fourth, the level and effectiveness of their \ntraining; fifth, the sustainment and logistics of those Iraqi units; \nsixth, the level of their equipment; and seventh, the quality of their \nleadership.\n  It is vitally important that we share our progress or lack thereof in \nmeeting these objectives with the American people. The American people \nare paying for this conflict with their money and their blood. They \ndeserve to know how we are doing.\n  One of the challenges of any military effort is to build and maintain \npublic support. To date, the administration has provided rosy \nassessments that conflict so clearly with the reports from Iraq and the \nimages on television. It is no surprise that the public's patience is \ngrowing thin.\n  The American people can withstand adversity. What they won't stand \nfor--and rightfully so--is being kept in the dark or being misled. That \nis why it is so critical that we provide the American people with an \naccurate assessment of our current situation, to plan for our success \nand let our people know and let them evaluate the progress we are \nachieving toward making that success.\n  I hope this amendment can be a bipartisan one. It seeks to achieve \nthe twin goals of accountability and candor that I have heard embraced \nby our colleagues from both sides of the aisle.\n  In addition to this amendment, I have also introduced an amendment to \nprovide our troops fighting in Iraq with the equipment they need in the \nfield and the support their families deserve at home.\n  The Army has chronically underestimated--nine consecutive times, in \nfact--the need for up-armored vehicles in the Iraqi theater. Nine \nconsecutive times they have gotten it wrong. They no longer deserve the \nbenefit of the doubt. Regrettably, Walter Reed Hospital and our other \nmilitary hospitals in this Nation are filled with too many of the young \nmen and women who have paid the consequence for these errors. We must \ndo everything humanly possible to make sure no further errors take \nplace.\n  My armor amendment will provide enough funding to rebuild the Army \nstocks of up-armored HMMWVs as well as the armored vehicles used for \ncargo and troop transportation. With it, the military's depleted stock \nof armored vehicles will be made whole, ensuring that all of our troops \nhave the protection they need while serving in both Iraq and \nAfghanistan--no more pleas to end hillbilly armor. One of the lessons \nlearned in Iraq, along with the tragic Hurricane Katrina, is that when \nlives are at stake, it is incumbent upon us to err on the side of doing \nmore rather than less. Let us get it right this time.\n  For the families of our loved ones serving in harm's way, we must \nensure that no one faces financial hardship because of their service \noverseas. Yet there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the \nfinancial rights of service men and women are being abused or ignored. \nThat must stop.\n  Guard members who are called to active duty often face what I call a \npatriot penalty--a pay cut representing the difference between their \ncivilian and Active-Duty pay. As a result, many families struggle to \nmeet their mortgage payments or pay their heating\n\n[[Page S10917]]\n\nbills. My amendment would eliminate this patriot penalty and ensure \nthat no one takes a pay cut for serving their country.\n  Some families struggling with bills have even faced eviction or \nforeclosure despite laws already on the books designed to protect them. \nFinancial institutions say they are not aware of these special \nprotections, but ignorance is no excuse. My amendment would enable the \nregulators who oversee our financial institutions to put a stop to this \nodious practice. Financial institutions must learn the law, and they \nmust follow it. My amendment will force the administration to educate \nour troops about their rights and punish those who wrongfully take away \nour troops' homes.\n  When we send troops into battle, we are asking them and their \nfamilies to be willing to make the ultimate sacrifice. They are giving \nus everything. Giving them a realistic plan for success, along with the \nequipment they will need in the field to accomplish that success and \nthe support their families deserve at home, is the least we can do for \nthem. We owe it to them to do it right. That is what these amendments, \nwhen taken together, will accomplish.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues for their patience.\n  I call up the amendments numbered 1993, 1940, 1998, and 1933.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would require unanimous consent to take up \nthose amendments en bloc.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call the \namendments up en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we would \nlike to first examine those amendments.\n  Mr. BAYH. By all means.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator object?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I should notify the Senator from Indiana \nthat these are amendments offered to the Armed Services Committee \namendment, and we do not intend to support any amendments to the \namendment until we can determine if there is going to be a time \nagreement on the basic underlying amendment. The full Armed Services \nCommittee bill contains some 80 amendments already and has some 240 \nother amendments pending.\n  I object, and I hope the Senator will confer with us on procedures so \nwe might be able to work this out.\n  The amendment is subject to rule XVI. I do not believe we should take \nthe time of the Senate to agree to the amendments on which we are going \nto raise a point of order under XVI unless there is a time agreement on \nthe overall amendment offered by the Armed Services Committee.\n  We will object to any amendments to this amendment, and we will \nfurther, at the appropriate time, raise this point of order under rule \nXVI to the amendment offered by the Senator from Virginia, the chairman \nof the Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I would be pleased to work with my \ncolleagues to clarify the substance of the amendments and to work on \nthe issues regarding any of them.\n  I have been advised to call up my amendment No. 1933, which is an \nappropriations amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator from Indiana would confer \nwith us, I find that one of the amendments he has offered is not an \namendment to the Armed Services Committee amendment but is, in fact, an \namendment to the bill itself. We will be happy to discuss that with the \nSenator. I again urge him not to pursue this at this time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1933\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Bayh] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1933.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with to give us an opportunity to discuss the \nsubstance of the amendment and time consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase by $360,800,000 amounts appropriated by title IX \n for Other Procurement, Army, for the procurement of armored Tactical \n   Wheeled Vehicles for units deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan or to \n   reconstitute Army Prepositioned Stocks-5 and the Joint Readiness \nTraining Center at Fort Polk, Louisiana, and to increase by $5,000,000 \n amounts appropriated by title IX for Research, Development, Test and \n     Evaluation, Defense-Wide, for industrial preparedness for the \n      implementation of a ballistics engineering research center)\n\n       On page 238, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n       Sec. 9014.(a)(1) The amount appropriated by this title \n     under the heading ``Other Procurement, Army'' is hereby \n     increased by $360,800,000.\n       (2) Of the amount appropriated by this title under the \n     heading ``Other Procurement, Army'', as increased by \n     paragraph (1)--\n       (A) $360,800,000 may be made available for the procurement \n     of armored Tactical Wheeled Vehicles for units deployed in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan; or\n       (B) if the Secretary of the Army determines that such \n     amount is not needed for the procurement of armored Tactical \n     Wheeled Vehicles for units deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan--\n       (i) up to $247,100,000 may be available for the procurement \n     of armored Tactical Wheeled Vehicles to reconstitute Army \n     Prepositioned Stocks-5, including the procurement of armored \n     Light Tactical Vehicles (LTVs), armored Medium Tactical \n     Vehicles (MTVs), and armored Heavy Tactical Vehicles (HTVs) \n     for purposes of equipping one heavy brigade, one infantry \n     brigade, and two infantry battalions; and\n       (ii) up to $113,700,000 may be available for the \n     procurement of armored Tactical Wheeled Vehicles for the \n     Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, Louisiana, \n     including the procurement of armored Light Tactical Vehicles, \n     armored Medium Tactical Vehicles, and armored Heavy Tactical \n     Vehicles for purposes of equipping one infantry brigade \n     combat team in order to permit such vehicles to be used for \n     the training and preparation of troops, prior to deployment, \n     on the use of such vehicles.\n       (b)(1)(A) The amount appropriated by this title under the \n     heading ``Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, \n     Defense-Wide'' is hereby increased by $5,000,000.\n       (B) Of the amount appropriated by this title under the \n     heading ``Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, \n     Defense-Wide'', as increased by subparagraph (A), $5,000,000 \n     may be available for the establishment of the ballistics \n     engineering research center under paragraph (2).\n       (2)(A) The Secretary of Defense shall create a \n     collaborative ballistics engineering research center at two \n     major research institutions.\n       (B) The purpose of the research center established under \n     subparagraph (A) shall be to advance knowledge and \n     application of ballistics materials and procedures to improve \n     the safety of land-based military vehicles, particularly from \n     hidden improvised explosive devices, including through the \n     training of engineers, scientists, and military personnel in \n     ballistics materials and their use.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I inform the Senator from Indiana that we \nwould oppose this amendment in any event because the bill already \ncontains an additional $390 million, $30 million more than is already \nproposed by this amendment, for armored tactical wheeled vehicles.\n  This bill before us now has $240 million for the up-armored HMMWVs or \nthe armored light tactical vehicles and has $150 million for the \narmored tactical wheeled vehicles. The Senator's amendment is \nduplicative of the amendment we have already accepted to the bill, and \nwe cannot add that much more money to the Senator's amendment which is \nbefore us, No. 1933.\n  I urge the Senator to take a look at the Record and withdraw the \namendment because there we are adding too much to that one section and \nwe could not accept this amendment. It would earmark funding for \ntactical wheeled vehicles if armory funds are not needed for units \ndeployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. We do not think we should earmark \ncritical force protection equipment funds. Some of this work is done in \none place, some in another.\n  I indicated that we already have added $30 million more than the \nSenator proposes to add to the bill. We\n\n[[Page S10918]]\n\nagree with the Senator in terms of the need, and that is why we have \nalready added money, as I mentioned before.\n  I hope the Senator will look at what we have already done.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I would be delighted to discuss this matter \nwith the Senator.\n  The heart of my concern is that there has been a consistent pattern \nof underestimating our need, and the depletion of the stockpile means \nif they yet again underestimated the need, it would not be available \nfor quick deployment in the theater, which would leave our troops short \nagain. That is the basis of my concern. We would be delighted to \ndiscuss it with the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would be happy to do that.\n  During the past recess the first part of September, along with \nSenator Warner and Senator Kerry, I went to Iraq. We saw the vehicles \nthere being up-armored, and we saw, as a matter of fact, some of the \ntrucks that are being up- armored. We have, as I have indicated, since \nthat time increased the amount of money that is available.\n  Further, we are asking the Army for a detailed list of equipment \nrequirements that are needed. The Army submitted a $6 billion list of \nrequirements, and the funding sought with this amendment was not \nincluded in the list. We have already reprogrammed more money which far \nexceeds the Army's validated requirements. We did that before the end \nof September. I believe this amendment is unnecessary.\n  Further, it would be subject to a point of order, I am informed, \nunder section 402 of the budget resolution that allows $350 billion for \ncontingency operations spending for the year 2006. Title IX of this \nbill uses that entire $350 billion. Any funding in excess of that \namount for the contingency operations would score and subsequently \nwould add appropriations to title IX which would be subject to a point \nof order under section 302(f), far exceeding the committee's 302(b) \nallocation.\n  I urge the Senator to again confer with us because we have allocated \nmoney twice in this area since the trip we took to Iraq. I think we \nhave provided more money than is necessary, as a matter of fact.\n  Mr. BAYH. I say to my friend and colleague, I look forward to \nconferring with him. It is neither his intentions nor his actions which \nI question; both his intentions and actions have been quite \ncommendable. It is the advice of the Army which has consistently proven \nto be wrong, which we are relying on, that I question. That is the \nnature of the discussion I look forward to having.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What is the status of the amendments at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment numbered 1933 is pending.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1978\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1978, which is at \nthe desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the pending \namendment is set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Biden, Mr. Graham, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. DeWine, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1978.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to pay salaries and expenses and \n other costs associated with reimbursing the Government of Uzbekistan \n for services rendered to the United States at Karshi-Khanabad airbase \n                             in Uzbekistan)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available in this Act may be obligated or expended during \n     fiscal year 2006 for paying salaries and expenses or other \n     costs associated with reimbursing or otherwise financially \n     compensating the Government of Uzbekistan for services \n     rendered to the United States at Karshi-Khanabad airbase in \n     Uzbekistan.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is a pretty simple one. It \nwould prohibit for 1 year the transfer of millions of dollars in cash \nto the Government of Uzbekistan; I believe $22 or $23 million.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Biden, Graham, Leahy, and \nDeWine, who have cosponsored the amendment. The Pentagon notified the \nCongress this summer that it intends to pay $23 million in ``coalition \nsupport funds'' to Uzbekistan, designed to cover past costs associated \nwith the use of the K2 base there. If you have seen this base in the \nnews lately, it is because it is the location from which the Government \nof Uzbekistan recently evicted all U.S. personnel. Uzbekistan was at \none point a partner in the war on terror. It is no longer. And turning \nover ``coalition support funds,'' at this point, debases the meaning of \nthe term ``coalition.''\n  The amendment I am proposing would prohibit this payment for 1 year \nat which point the Congress can decide whether to renew the prohibition \nor make the payment.\n  America keeps its promises to our coalition partners, but we also \nexpect our partners to keep their promises to us. We are not in the \nbusiness of paying dictatorial, repressive, brutal governments.\n  Let me review a few of the more egregious examples of Uzbekistan's \nrelationship with us and their abuse of human rights. In May, the \nGovernment launched a brutal crackdown in the city of Andijan after \nprotestors stormed a prison and local government headquarters. Eye \nwitnesses estimated the dead at somewhere between 500 and 1,000 and \nsaid that the vast majority were unarmed men, women, and children \nprotesting the Government's corruption, lack of opportunity, and \ncontinued oppression. In addition to those killed, many others were \nwounded, and at least 500 fled across the border into Kyrgyzstan.\n  The Government has rejected all calls for an independent \ninternational inquiry into the massacre. The entire European Union has \ndemanded an investigation into the massacre. Tashkent has put the \nofficial death toll at just 187 and blamed a foreign conspiracy for the \nprotest. It even placed blame on the United States for the events \nsaying that rebels received money from the U.S. Embassy in Tashkent.\n  The Uzbek Government launched a campaign of anti-American propaganda \nafter its massacre, staging rallies to denounce the United States and \naccusing the United States of fomenting Islamic extremism in the guise \nof promoting democracy.\n  President Karimov--and I use the term ``president'' loosely--\nPresident Karimov suggested that the United States was behind both the \nevents in Andijan and the ``colored revolutions'' in other countries.\n  I remind my colleagues that Uzbekistan agreed to host U.S. forces on \nits soil to support continuing coalition combat efforts in Afghanistan. \nOur troops in Afghanistan are still fighting the Taliban. Insurgents \nhave killed hundreds of people, including dozens of Americans, in the \nlast few months. Yet with this going on and with our mission clearly \nunfinished, in July Uzbekistan ordered the United States to leave the \ncountry.\n  Just last week, the Washington Post ran an article entitled ``Uzbeks \nStop Working With U.S. Against Terrorism,'' which describes how \nTashkent has decided to abridge its 2002 agreement with President Bush \nand terminate its counterterrorism cooperation with America. One \nsentence in this article bears particular notice: ``The Bush \nadministration,'' the article reads, ``has concluded that Karimov fears \ndemocracy more than terrorism, officials said.''\n  This is the same country that Pentagon officials were describing \nquite recently as a ``very valuable partner and ally in the global war \non terror.'' But Uzbekistan is not a valuable partner and ally; it is \npart of the problem. This week, the European Union announced that it \nwill impose sanctions\n\n[[Page S10919]]\n\nagainst the Uzbek Government for its refusal to accept an international \ninquiry into the Andijan massacre. This is the kind of response we \nshould be considering to these outrageous actions, not the best way to \ntransfer $23 million in funds from the U.S. Treasury.\n  The Pentagon wants to pay Tashkent on the principle that America pays \nits bills for services rendered. I support that principle, but so, too, \ndo I support America standing up for itself in the world and spending \ntaxpayers' money wisely, avoiding the misimpression that we overlook \nmassacres, and avoiding cash transfers to the treasury of a dictator \njust months after he permanently evicts American soldiers from his \ncountry.\n  I intend to have printed in the Record the assessment of every human \nrights organization in the world of this brutal, oppressive \ndictatorship. This is a person who just orchestrated a massacre of \nsomewhere, estimates are, around 1,000 of its citizens. This is a \ngovernment that is illegitimate in that Karimov keeps himself in power \nthrough edict. This is a corrupt government in that there is continued \nrepression and oppression of human rights.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that if the Government of Uzbekistan allowed \na full-scale investigation by the European Union and the results are \nknown, then maybe at that time it would be appropriate to give them \nthis money.\n  Also, let's keep in mind what this brutal and oppressive dictator \nwill do with $23 million of American money. His prisons are full. There \nis no free press. There is no freedom of movement. It is an oppressive, \nrepressive regime of the old Stalinist style.\n  I am not saying the United States should not pay its bills. What I am \nsaying is that we should demand at least an investigation of what \nhappened in Andijan some months ago when hundreds, if not a thousand, \nof its citizens innocently gathered to protest the policies of their \ngovernment: they were fired on and killed in the most wanton fashion.\n  The Washington Post article reads:\n\n       The government of President Islam Karimov, one of the most \n     authoritarian to emerge from the collapse of the Soviet \n     Union, has made a broader strategic decision to move away \n     from the 2002 agreement made with President Bush after the \n     Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and is cooling relations with Europe \n     as well. . . .\n       The move follows tough criticism from Washington--\n\n  I might say not the Pentagon--\n\n     and the European Union over Uzbekistan's crackdown on \n     protests in May in the Andijan province, where human rights \n     and opposition groups say hundreds died. Uzbekistan has \n     charged that terrorists initiated the violence.\n       As tensions deepen, Karimov is shifting his strategic \n     alliance toward Russia and China. . . . In July, Tashkent \n     banned U.S. troops and warplanes from what is known as the \n     [K2 airbase] which was used for counterterrorism, military \n     and humanitarian missions.\n\n  The European Union is not renowned to take the lead on some issues. I \nam proud that the European Union imposed sanctions on Uzbekistan today \nseeking to punish, according to the New York Times, October 3, 2005:\n\n     . . . seeking to punish the Central Asian nation for its \n     refusal to allow an international investigation into the \n     bloody crackdown of an uprising in May in the northeastern \n     city of Andijon.\n       The sanctions against Uzbekistan impose an embargo on \n     exports of arms and equipment that might be used for internal \n     repression and suspend meetings between the European Union \n     and Uzbekistan that were aimed at accelerating the former \n     Soviet state's rapprochement with the West. They will also \n     forbid the travel of Uzbek officials directly involved [in] \n     the crackdown to the 25 European Union states.\n       Survivors and independent organizations claim--\n\n  This is survivors, their actual statements--\n\n       and independent organizations claim that hundreds of people \n     were killed, almost all of them unarmed. Uzbekistan, an \n     autocratic state that had been an ally with the Bush \n     administration's counter-terrorism efforts, has argued that \n     the crackdown was a necessary counter-terrorism operation, \n     and said only 187 people, principally Islamic terrorists, \n     were killed. It has stubbornly resisted calls for an open \n     investigation of its crackdown of the uprising.\n       As criticism over the violence mounted in the spring and \n     summer, Uzbekistan sharply shifted its foreign policy, \n     aligning itself more closely with Russia and China and \n     trimming its relations with the West.

Chivers)\n\n       Moscow.--European Union nations imposed sanctions on \n     Uzbekistan today, seeking to punish the Central Asian nation \n     for its refusal to allow an international investigation into \n     the bloody crackdown of an uprising in May in the \n     northeastern city of Andijon.\n       The sanctions against Uzbekistan impose an embargo on \n     exports of arms and equipment that might be used for internal \n     repression and suspend meetings between the European Union \n     and Uzbekistan that were aimed at accelerating the former \n     Soviet state's rapprochement with the West. They will also \n     forbid the travel of Uzbek officials directly involved in the \n     crackdown to the 25 European Union states.\n       The decision followed months of diplomatic tension between \n     much of the West and Uzbekistan after a prison break and \n     anti-government demonstration on May 13. The demonstration, \n     which survivors said included several thousand people, was \n     scattered by gunfire from Uzbek troops and armored vehicles.\n       Survivors and independent organizations claim that hundreds \n     of people were killed, almost all of them unarmed. \n     Uzbekistan, an autocratic state that had been an ally with \n     the Bush administration's counterterrorism efforts, has \n     argued that the crackdown was a necessary counter-terrorism \n     operation, and said only 187 people, principally Islamic \n     terrorists, were killed. It has stubbornly resisted calls for \n     an open investigation of its crackdown of the uprising.\n       As criticism over the violence mounted in the spring and \n     summer, Uzbekistan sharply shifted its foreign policy, \n     aligning itself more closely with Russia and China and \n     trimming its relations with the West. In July, it ordered the \n     United States to leave an airbase that it has been using \n     since 2001, an eviction now scheduled for early next year. \n     Last month, Uzbekistan hosted a small joint military exercise \n     with Russian troops, signaling its new allegiances.\n       Meeting in Luxembourg, the foreign ministers of European \n     Union states approved the sanctions for an initial period of \n     one year, allowing for a review in 2006 of Uzbekistan's \n     willingness to ``adhere to the principles of respect for \n     human rights, rule of law and fundamental freedoms.''\n       The trade ban covers weapons and ammunition, as well as \n     dozens of items that could be used in crackdowns and police \n     work, including helmets and certain types of body armor, \n     vehicles equipped with armor, leg irons, shackles, tear gas, \n     water cannons, riot shields, fingerprint equipment, search \n     lights, equipment for intercepting or jamming communications \n     and night vision goggles.\n       The sanctions also suspended scheduled meetings under the \n     so-called Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, the \n     blueprint that since 1999 has helped develop the European \n     Union's political relations with Uzbekistan and guide \n     economic relations in trade, transport, customs, postal \n     services, telecommunications and other areas.\n       Human Rights Watch, the New York-based organization, which \n     has investigated the crackdown and repression in the months \n     since, hailed that move, saying it was the first of its kind \n     in the European Union's history.\n       But although the sanctions mark a clear rebuke of the \n     Central Asian state, they have a limited ability to undermine \n     Uzbekistan's military or police capabilities.\n       While Uzbekistan has often accepted Western security aid, \n     its military, intelligence and police forces are \n     overwhelmingly equipped with Soviet-era military hardware, \n     which continues to be manufactured and sold by Russia, China \n     and other states outside of the European Union.\n       Moreover, Russia has made clear it will not honor the \n     embargo, which may create fresh trade opportunities for its \n     arms industry, a sector that has rebounded in recent years \n     under prodding from President Vladimir V. Putin.\n       ``There are no restrictions on weapons supplies to \n     Uzbekistan,'' Russia's defense minister, Sergei Ivanov, said \n     last week in anticipation of the embargo, according to the\n\n[[Page S10920]]\n\n     Interfax news agency. ``We will continue to develop further \n     relations with Uzbekistan.''\n       The potential effects of the travel restrictions to Western \n     Europe are also uncertain.\n       The Uzbek president, Islam A. Karimov, and the nation's \n     interior minister, Col. Gen. Zakirdzhon Almatov, were in \n     Andijon during the uprising, and survivors have accused them \n     of ordering and directing the violence against the crowd.\n       But the European Union has not yet drawn up a public list \n     of officials it suspects of involvement in the violence, so \n     it was not immediately clear which officials might face the \n     travel restrictions. A European Union spokesman said the list \n     will be compiled now that the sanctions have been approved.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 30, 2005]\n\n            Uzbeks Stop Working With U.S. Against Terrorism\n\n                           (By Robin Wright)\n\n       After cutting off U.S. access to a key military base, \n     Uzbekistan has also quietly terminated cooperation with \n     Washington on counterterrorism, a move that could affect both \n     countries' ability to deal with al Qaeda and its allies in \n     Central Asia and neighboring Afghanistan, U.S. officials \n     said.\n       The government of President Islam Karimov, one of the most \n     authoritarian to emerge from the collapse of the Soviet \n     Union, has made a broader strategic decision to move away \n     from the 2002 agreement made with President Bush after the \n     Sept. 11,2001, attacks and is cooling relations with Europe \n     as well, the officials said.\n       The move follows tough criticism from Washington and the \n     European Union over Uzbekistan's crackdown on protests in May \n     in Andijan province, where human rights and opposition groups \n     say hundreds died. Uzbekistan has charged that terrorists \n     initiated the violence.\n       As tensions deepen, Karimov is shifting his strategic \n     alliance toward Russia and China, the officials said. In \n     July, Tashkent banned U.S. troops and warplanes from the \n     Karshi-Khanabad air base, which was used for \n     counterterrorism, military and humanitarian missions.\n       Because of the internal Uzbek crackdown, the European Union \n     laid the groundwork yesterday for a vote expected on Monday \n     to impose new sanctions on Uzbekistan for failing to allow an \n     independent international inquiry of the Andijan incidents. \n     The measures include an embargo on arms and any equipment \n     that could be used for internal repression, and visa \n     restrictions for any Uzbek official linked to the violence, \n     European diplomats said.\n       Senior officials from the State Department, the Pentagon \n     and the National Security Council held three hours of talks \n     with Karimov on Tuesday to express US. concern about Uzbek \n     human rights violations and the deterioration in relations \n     between the two countries.\n       ``We do want to cooperate, but it has to be across the \n     board, not just on counterterrorism and security but also to \n     support democratic and market reforms,'' Assistant Secretary \n     of State Daniel Fried said yesterday in a telephone interview \n     from Kazakhstan. He called the recent Uzbek decision to cut \n     back on counterterrorism cooperation ``very disappointing. ``\n       A spokesman from the Uzbek Embassy in Washington said his \n     nation is still cooperating with the United States but would \n     not comment further.\n       The E.U. has been pressuring Washington to impose similar \n     sanctions, but the Bush administration wants to give Karimov \n     one last chance to renew cooperation. ``The United States is \n     going to look very closely at whether Karimov responds to our \n     message, and, if not, we will draw conclusions,'' Fried said. \n     ``We're not talking about six months. My purpose was not to \n     drag out the process.''\n       The Bush administration has concluded that Karimov fears \n     democracy more than terrorism, officials said. The biggest \n     threat to his government is the Islamic Movement of \n     Uzbekistan, which a State Department report says has been \n     involved in attacks on U.S. forces in Afghanistan and has \n     plotted attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Central \n     Asia. Aligned with al Qaeda, it seeks to overthrow Karimov \n     and create an Islamic government, the report says.\n       The Uzbek issue is gaining more attention on Capitol Hill. \n     Reps. William D. Delahunt (D-Mass.) and Lloyd Doggett (D-\n     Tex.) held a news conference yesterday to urge the White \n     House to end all Pentagon payments to Tashkent and to go to \n     the United Nations to bring the Uzbek leader to justice.\n       Karimov ``inflicts immeasurable pain and misery on his own \n     people and then evicts us from a strategic military \n     facility--and the Pentagon's idea of a penalty is the gift of \n     millions of U.S. tax dollars,'' Delahunt said. The Pentagon \n     recently agreed to pay $23 million for past use of the K-2 \n     air base.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From Defense News, Sept. 28, 2005]\n\n                U.S. To Leave Uzbek Air Base: Official)\n\n                       (By Agence France-Presse)\n\n       The U.S. military will vacate a military air base it had \n     been using in Uzbekistan without further discussion, as \n     demanded by the Uzbek authorities, a senior U.S. official \n     confirmed on Sept. 27. ``We intend to leave the base without \n     further discussion,'' Dan Fried, assistant secretary of state \n     for European and Eurasian affairs, told reporters after \n     meeting here with Uzbek President Islam Karimov.\n       Fried also confirmed Washington would pay Uzbekistan 23 \n     million dollars for the past use of Karshi-Khanabad air base, \n     also known as K-2, despite objections by members of the U.S. \n     Congress. Uzbekistan in July gave the U.S. military six \n     months to end operations at K-2, effectively severing a \n     partnership that sprang up in 2001 on the eve of the U.S. \n     military campaign to oust the Taliban in Afghanistan.\n       Uzbek lawmakers ratified the eviction notice last month. \n     The base was a crucial staging area for U.S. forces operating \n     in northern Afghanistan, and after the war became a hub for \n     flights carrying supplies for U.S. and NATO forces in the \n     country.\n       The eviction notice came after Washington called for an \n     international investigation into last May's crackdown in the \n     eastern city of Andijan that the government said left 187 \n     people dead but which human rights groups said amounted to a \n     massacre of civilians. Fried admitted to differences with \n     Karimov during his meeting with the Uzbek leader.\n       ``We did not agree on all issues and made it clear we \n     support civil society and NGOs around the world just like \n     foreign NGOs can operate in the U.S.,'' he said. Several \n     international non-governmental organizations accuse the Uzbek \n     authorities of having killed hundreds of unarmed civilians in \n     Andijan. Fried said his visit came after a difficult period \n     in U.S.-Uzbek relations, ``which included human rights issues \n     and Andijan events. ``\n       He said his message to Uzbek officials was to determine a \n     basis on which U.S.-Uzbek relations and cooperation could \n     move ahead, provided such notions as democracy, human rights \n     and political reforms were taken into account. He also denied \n     allegations by one of 15 alleged Islamist insurgents on trial \n     over the Andijan bloodshed that the U.S. embassy had provided \n     funding to his group.\n       ``The assertions about helping Islamic insurgents are \n     ludicrous and no credible,'' he said. Fried was scheduled to \n     meet representatives of Uzbek civil society groups on \n     Wednesday, and was later due to visit Kazakhstan and \n     Kyrgyzstan for talks on bilateral and regional issues, \n     including the fight against terrorism, officials said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From Reuters Foundation, Sept. 30, 2005]\n\n                     Central Asia: Weekly News Wrap\n\n                             (Source: IRIN)\n\n       Ankara.--The trial of 15 men accused of plotting to \n     overthrow the Uzbek government in the eastern city of Andijan \n     entered its second week in the Uzbek capital, Tashkent.\n       Upwards of 1,000 civilians may have been killed in Andijan \n     on 13 May, according to some rights groups, when security \n     forces opened fire on protesters demonstrating against the \n     government of Uzbek President Islam Karimov, who has ruled \n     Central Asia's most populous state since the collapse of the \n     former Soviet Union in 1991.\n       Despite international pressure, Tashkent has rejected all \n     requests for an independent international inquiry, placing \n     the official death toll at 187.\n       The 15 men have pleaded guilty to trying to overthrow the \n     Uzbek government and create an Islamic state in a violent \n     uprising that prosecutors maintain was stoked by Western \n     media. More than 100 people face charges that include murder, \n     fomenting mass arrest and an attempted coup.\n       On Monday, three defendants testified they had trained at \n     military camps in neighbouring Kyrgyzstan, further backing \n     Tashkent's claim of a conspiracy that included foreign \n     fighters and funding, one AFP report said.\n       ``We were given money by the U.S. embassy to achieve our \n     goals,'' Tavakkalbek Hojiyev, one of the alleged insurgents, \n     reportedly told the court.\n       But human rights groups, who have repeatedly called for \n     international pressure, maintain the well orchestrated trial \n     was merely a concerted effort to bury the truth.\n       On Thursday, the European Union (EU) answered those calls \n     by announcing it would impose ``smart sanctions'' on Tashkent \n     following its refusal to allow for an international inquiry.\n       The decision, to be approved by EU foreign ministers on \n     Monday, marks a hardening stance by the international \n     community against Tashkent, Britain's Telegraph newspaper \n     reported. Criticism of the Uzbek authorities from Washington \n     has already led to the U.S. being ordered to remove its \n     airbase at Karshi-Khanabad, in the southeast, the report \n     added.\n       Once a staunch ally in America's wars against terror, \n     relations between the two countries have soured over Andijan. \n     On Monday, the U.S. vowed not to trade democratic principle \n     for continued use of the base, the AFP reported.\n       EU diplomats reportedly said the sanctions would include \n     redirecting EU funds from the Uzbek government to grassroots \n     organisations, banning senior Uzbek government figures from \n     visiting European countries and halting the sale of weapons.\n       Moving to Tajikistan, Tajik President Emomali Rahmonov on \n     Tuesday told a conference on coordinating donor aid to \n     protect the Tajik-Afghan border that the situation with \n     regard to drug proliferation was in hand.\n       Despite a lack of military equipment, Tajik border guards \n     had proved they could protect their 1,206 km border on their \n     own, following the departure of Russian troops in the area in \n     June, the president claimed.

According to an embassy \n     statement, the funding would provide infrastructure \n     improvements, border outpost development, transportation and \n     other necessary equipment for the guards.\n       The funding is part of the U.S. Department of State's \n     Bureau of Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs continuing \n     support for Tajikistan's border guards, the Tajik Drug \n     Control Agency and the Ministry of Interior. Since December \n     2004, Washington has provided or is in the process of \n     providing over $16 million worth of assistance to the former \n     Soviet republic's law enforcement agencies.\n       Staying in Tajikistan, Tajik authorities on Tuesday \n     confirmed the arrest of a Russian citizen who allegedly \n     belonged to the outlawed Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan \n     (IMU), the AP said.\n       Blamed for a series of armed incursions into Uzbekistan in \n     1999-2001, as well as other attacks, the IMU has been \n     designated by the U.S. State Department as a terrorist \n     organisation, the report added.\n       Kyrgyzstan's parliament on Tuesday turned down six of 16 \n     candidates proposed by President Kurmanbek Bakiyev to form a \n     new cabinet, including his close ally Roza Otunbayeva, who \n     was nominated to head the foreign ministry.\n       According to the AP, many lawmakers, many of whom were \n     holdovers from the era of Bakiyev's ousted predecessor, Askar \n     Akayev, also rejected the appointment of Bakiyev's nominees \n     for the cabinet's chief of staff as well as culture, labour \n     and transport ministers and the head of the migration \n     service.\n       On 1 September, parliament approved Felix Kulov as prime \n     minister.

Dwelling on the so \n     called conspiracy, defendants could not say how much the \n     Americans had invested in the coup d'etat and concentrated on \n     its details instead. According to defendant Husanzhon \n     Turabekov, one Kelly (a citizen of the United States) was in \n     contact with the Akramians. She drove a red Jeep and was \n     always accompanied by human rights activists and journalists. \n     Matlyuba Azamatova of Uzbekistan, BBC reporter in the \n     Ferghana Valley, was usually with the American. Turabekov \n     said that Azamatova and experts on human rights had become \n     the main agitators and instigators. ``When the Andizhan \n     khokimijat was overrun, they made speeches in the square all \n     day long, condemning the powers-that-be and urging rebels to \n     hold on. They said that help was coming.''\n       Pleading guilty and demanding capital punishment for \n     themselves at the very first meeting of the Supreme Court, \n     the defendants became prosecutors. They go on confessing and \n     exposing the anti-Uzbek conspiracy of Washington, \n     International terrorism, journalists, and human rights \n     activists. The defendants maintain that they are treated \n     properly in prison and that they are\n\n[[Page S10922]]\n\n     shocked by how outrageously media outlets and human rights \n     activists spread lies about the Uzbek regime. The \n     prosecution, Deputy Prosecutor General Anvar Nabiyev, had \n     appraised the media in a similar manner when the trial was \n     just beginning. Nabiyev called journalists ``jackals'' and \n     ``carrion eaters''. The deputy prosecutor general put on the \n     list of enemies of Uzbekistan IWPR Tashkent Division Director \n     Galima Bukharbayeva, Ferghana. Ru correspondent Aleksei \n     Volosevich, RL correspondent Andrei Babitsky, and Amazatova. \n     According to Nabiyev, they had depicted terrorists as freedom \n     fighters and promoters of democracy. BBC got the worst of it. \n     Nabiyev announced that its correspondents had ``shamelessly \n     spread prejudiced lies on what was happening on the orders \n     from certain external forces.''\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me tell you what the Uzbek Government \ndid. They arrested some people. Here is what happened. This is Reuters:\n\n       Uzbekistan: Defendants in Andijon Trial Reiterate Guilt, \n     Blame Others. The defendants allegedly behind the May \n     uprising in the eastern Uzbek town of Andijon are confessing \n     to the charges and saying foreign countries initiated the \n     revolt.\n       One of the defendants, Tavakkalbek Hojiyev, said yesterday \n     that the U.S. Embassy in Tashkent financially supported the \n     uprising.\n\n  Mr. President, here is the old Stalinist trial where they beat the \ndefendant into submission, have him confess, and then blame the U.S. \nEmbassy in Tashkent, and we are going to give them 23 million bucks?\n  As I said:\n\n     . . . that the U.S. Embassy in Tashkent financially supported \n     the uprising. He did not provide any evidence but said he was \n     informed about the fact by another man . . . whom the Uzbek \n     government has accused of helping instigate the violence.\n       ``He told me that the U.S. Embassy has allocated the money \n     [for the uprising,]'' Hojiyev said. ``And if our action in \n     Andijon would not succeed we had to leave for Kyrgystan. He \n     said that this was \n     the plan. . . .\n       Parpiev was among the protesters who seized the regional \n     administration building in Andijon on 13 May. He escaped when \n     Uzbek forces fired on protesters. . . .\n\n  It goes on and on. It is the age-old Stalinist tactic: Take somebody, \ntorture them, and force them to confess. And they are blaming the \nUnited States of America.\n  This is the Karimov Government that we are going to give $23 million \nand that is now alleging that the United States of America not only was \nresponsible for this uprising in Andijon, but the ``colored \nrevolutions'' all over the world--Lebanon, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, \nUkraine.\n\n       Former hostages and other witnesses testified Wednesday in \n     the trial of 15 alleged participants in a May uprising that \n     was brutally suppressed by Uzbek government troops. . . \n     .Former hostage Rakhimjon Kurbonov, a van driver, said he was \n     shot in the back and leg when rebels used him as a human \n     shield. He also said he had been beaten up by relatives of \n     some of the 23 religious businessmen. . . .\n\n  On and on and on.\n\n       Yesterday, the U.S. Department of State denounced the \n     accusations that the U.S. Embassy in Uzbekistan had allegedly \n     orchestrated and financed the May revolt in Andijon. \n     Defendants standing trial for participation in the revolt \n     announced the conspiracy against the Uzbek authorities had \n     been arranged by the Americans, journalists, and human rights \n     activists.\n\n  This is an echo of the days of the Cold War, Mr. President. This is \nwhen the Stalinists were in charge.\n  Finally:\n\n       Upwards of 1,000 civilians may have been killed in Andijon \n     on 13 May, according to some human rights groups, when \n     security forces opened fire on protesters demonstrating \n     against the government of President Islam Karimov, who has \n     ruled Central Asia's most populous state since the collapse \n     of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n       Despite international pressure, Tashkent has rejected all \n     requests for an independent international inquiry, placing \n     the official death toll at 187.\n       The 15 men--\n\n  Guess what--\n\n     have pleaded guilty . . .\n\n  Is that a surprise that the defendants have all pleaded guilty, \ncondemning themselves to life sentences or death?\n\n       The 15 men have pleaded guilty to trying to overthrow the \n     Uzbek Government and create an Islamic state in a violent \n     uprising that prosecutors maintain was stoked by Western \n     media. More than 100 people face charges that include murder, \n     fomenting mass arrest and an attempted coup.\n\n  Mr. President, I will curtail my remarks and just say to my friend \nfrom Alaska--I know he has a very busy agenda--if I were able to \nauthorize on an appropriations bill--which I am not--I would say at the \ncompletion of a thorough investigation of the massacre of Andijon. I \ncannot do that because this is an appropriations bill, so the amendment \nbasically says no money shall be spent in 2006.\n  My whole purpose in this is to have the investigation by an \ninternational organization, find out who is guilty, and recognize we \nare dealing with a very brutal, repressive, old-time Stalinist regime.\n  I thank the chairman for his courtesy.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. At a time to be determined by the distinguished chairman.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There appears to be a sufficient \nsecond.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from Arizona. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that there be 4 minutes equally divided on this \namendment before the vote when it does occur.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I say to the Senator, I will be pleased to work with the \nSenator from Arizona to amend this so even though it might be \nlegislation, it urge, at least, an investigation that the Senator has \nmentioned. Perhaps we can work it out before the time for the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator's amendment No. 1978 not be subject to a second-degree \namendment, but would be subject to an amendment by the Senator from \nArizona should he wish to amend the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Harriet Miers\n\n  Mr. REID. Yesterday, President Bush announced that he will nominate \nWhite House Counsel Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court. I congratulate \nMs. Miers on this high honor, and I pledge that Senate Democrats will \nwork in good faith to ensure a dignified and thorough confirmation \nprocess. It is now well known that I suggested to the President that \nHarriet Miers would be worthy of the President's consideration. The \nPresident has chosen her as a replacement for retiring Supreme Court \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor. I am grateful that the President took \naccount of my views.\n  Over the coming days and weeks, we will learn more about Harriet \nMiers. The Judiciary Committee will hold comprehensive hearings. I do \nnot intend to make up my mind about whether to support or oppose \nconfirmation of this nominee until after the committee hearings, and I \nhope everyone in the Senate will follow that. I think the hearings that \nwere held previously in the Roberts nomination were dignified. I \nthought that Senator Specter and Leahy did a remarkably good job. I am \nconfident that they will do it in this matter, also.\n  The reason that we must proceed in the manner that we did in the \nRoberts hearing is that the Supreme Court is the final guardian of the \nrights and liberties of all Americans. With so much at stake, we should \nnot rush to judgment about this or any other nominee.\n\n[[Page S10923]]\n\nBut even at this early stage of the confirmation process, I will say \nthat I am impressed by what I know about Harriet Miers. She overcame \ndifficult family circumstances to become the managing partner of a \nsuccessful 400-lawyer Dallas law firm. That is a big law firm. She was \nthe first woman president of the Dallas Bar Association and then the \nfirst woman President of the Texas State bar association.\n  In those roles, she advocated the importance of racial and gender \ndiversity in the legal profession and was a strong supporter of legal \nservices for the poor. Ms. Miers has not been a judge, but I regard \nthat as a strength of her nomination, not a weakness. In my view, the \nSupreme Court would benefit from the addition of a Justice who has real \nexperience as a practicing lawyer. A nominee with relevant nonjudicial \nexperience would bring a different and a useful perspective to the \nCourt. The nomination of Harriet Miers bears similarity to the \nnomination of Lewis Powell. At the time he was nominated by President \nNixon in 1971, Powell had never been a judge. He had been a pillar of \nthe Richmond, VA, bar just as Ms. Miers was a pillar of the Dallas, TX, \nbar. And he served as President of the American Bar Association just as \nMs. Miers served as President of the Dallas and Texas bar associations.\n  Mr. President, I have been told that about 45 percent of all Justices \nwho served on the Supreme Court have had no judicial experience before \nthey were chosen by a President. I think that speaks volumes about the \nneed to diversify the Supreme Court.\n  I had lunch at the Supreme Court 6 weeks ago or thereabouts--I do not \nrecall exactly when--and at the little table at which I was seated were \nthree Supreme Court Justices. I will not mention their names, other \nthan to say one was a woman and two were men. So it had to either be \nJustice Ginsburg or Sandra Day O'Connor, one of them. And they were \nvery clear in saying that they agreed that there should be strong \nconsideration given to someone who had not been a judge. I have been \ntold that Byron White, who was selected by President Kennedy, had no \njudicial experience. He had a qualification I am not sure we are going \nto find in many lawyers out there, but he was an All-American football \nplayer. If you look at the qualifications of appellate judges, I think \nthat is important, but remember these people sit in their offices \nusually alone writing opinions. Three of my sons have clerked for \nFederal judges. Those jobs are very lonely and very confining. They \ndon't see much of the real world, in my opinion. So I would welcome a \nreturn to the days when distinguished practicing lawyers and bar \nleaders are recognized as suitable candidates for high judicial office.\n  In recent years, Supreme Court Justices have been chosen exclusively \nfrom the ranks of Federal courts of appeal. The judges on the courts of \nappeal are often very smart, well credentialed, but the life of a \nFederal appeals judge, as I have indicated, is insular and isolated. \nThey know the law in an abstract way but don't appreciate the impact of \nthe law on the lives of real people.\n  I asked Harriet Miers in one of the first conversations I had with \nher, ``Have you ever tried a case?'' She was a trial lawyer. That is \nwhat she did. She is a little different kind of trial lawyer than I \nwas. She was a corporate lawyer and tried cases involving corporate \nproblems. But she stated to me in a conversation that I had with her \nthat she did divorce work.\n  I believe that is so important, that in the future we try to make our \nPresidents aware that the Supreme Court does not have to have all \nappellate judges to go into their ranks. Federal judges are often wise, \nbut there is a different kind of wisdom that comes from the day-to-day \npractice of law where they talk to clients, where they pick juries, \nwhere they argue cases to a jury, and where they talk to clients about \nfees they are going to charge. They participate in the community doing \nwork for the poor.\n  In any event, there is certainly room for both kinds of judicial \nnominees on the Supreme Court--those with judicial experience and those \nwithout judicial experience. I hope in the years to come that we look \nfavorably upon both--not just someone with appellate experience.\n  One thing we certainly need on the Supreme Court is independent \nthinking. Ms. Miers has been George Bush's lawyer for more than a \ndecade. He is her friend. I have no problem at all with her being his \nfriend. I think that speaks well of both of them--that they have \nconfidence in each other, so to speak. But she needs to demonstrate to \nthe Senate that she will put those close ties aside when necessary and \nstand in judgment of a President who has elevated her to this Court.\n  In the press conference today, just a few hours ago, President Bush \nsaid, ``Harriet Miers knows the kind of judge I am looking for.'' But \nif she is confirmed, I say Ms. Miers must become the kind of judge the \nAmerican people are looking for--a judge committed to fundamental \nrights and freedom.\n  I look forward to the Judiciary Committee's process which will help \nthe American people learn more about this nominee and help the Senate \ndetermine whether she deserves a lifetime seat on the historic Supreme \nCourt. But I remind the Senate that the nomination of Harriet Miers \nwill not reach the floor for some time, and we are going to cooperate \nfully, as I have indicated, as we did with Judge Roberts. The Democrats \nwant the process to move forward expeditiously but fairly.\n  After we get back from the week-long recess that will start this \nFriday, we will have 5 weeks. We have a lot of things to do during that \n5-week period. We have many pressing pieces of legislation that need to \nbe dealt with in this period of time.\n  After the failures of Katrina--I should not say the failures of \nKatrina, Katrina did pretty well on its own as a storm, but what \nhappened afterward was failure. And I must say that we now have a \nstring of scandals hovering over the Capitol. It is more important than \never that we get to work on all the many things we have to do. The \nAmerican people are tired of business as usual in Washington and want \nus to come together to get things done. They want a change. They want \nreform. They want a new direction. And that is what Democrats will be \nlooking for in the months ahead.\n  We believe it is time for all of us to unite because America can do \nbetter.\n  Together, we can reform the culture of corruption and cronyism that \nis spreading throughout the Nation's Capitol, a culture that led to \nMichael Brown at FEMA and the failure of Katrina and the Republican \nscandals we are now reading about.\n  Together, we can come together to help working families who are being \npinched at the gas pump. In the short term we can investigate price \ngouging, and in the long run we can move our country closer to energy \nindependence by the year 2020.\n  Together, we can meet our obligation to keep America strong and \nsecure. We can make a real commitment to finding out what went wrong \nduring Katrina and fixing it. And we can pass the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill to protect our fighting men and women in uniform \nrepresenting our great country. We can insist that the President \nprovide our troops with a clear strategy and paths for success in Iraq. \nYesterday I spoke to a marine major who spent 8 months in Iraq in \ncombat. The cities he worked to clear of terrorists and insurgents are \nnot clear anymore.\n  In addition to that--a clear path for success in Iraq that the \nPresident must give us because certainly the mission has not been \naccomplished--we also have to confront the health care crisis--and it \nis a crisis. We have to confront it by bringing down costs and helping \nover 40 million uninsured Americans get the care they need.\n\n  Together, we can show the American people that we understand our \nbudget priorities must change following the worst natural disaster in \nour Nation's history and that we understand it is not time to cut \nMedicaid, a program that was set up years ago to protect the poorest of \nthe poor with their medical problems.\n  We can't cut education. Why would we do that? So the administration \ncan spend more on tax breaks for multi- interests and \nmultimillionaires? In calling for spending cuts, the President talked \nlike a fiscal conservative, but in his 5 years in office, he has spent \nlike a fiscal wreck. While our deficits were mounting, he had no \nproblem spending trillions of dollars on tax breaks for\n\n[[Page S10924]]\n\nthe few. But now, in the wake of this disaster, when the Federal \nGovernment begins to help rebuild the lives of Americans who have lost \neverything, he says he is interested in fiscal discipline. Yet whose \nbenefits would he cut?\n  Just weeks after the economic and social divide in our country had \nbeen ripped open for all to see, he is proposing deep cuts in the \ncrucial services that help American families get ahead. Around the gulf \ncoast, some of America's most neediest families suffered the most. Why? \nSimply because they were poor. Now, while continuing to push for tax \nbreaks for special interests, financed with more debt, the President \nwants Katrina's survivors and other vulnerable Americans to pay for \nreconstruction also. America can do better. We must do better. And \nDemocrats are committed to leading the way.\n  There is another area where we will not give up the fight--helping \nKatrina victims. Today, the President made a point of mentioning how he \nwants to pay for ``rebuilding the gulf,'' but let us not forget that we \nstill have to do the work that I call rebuilding lives.\n  This morning, the President was also asked about relief efforts and \nwhether families are getting what they need. He said things are going \n``pretty good.'' But anyone who has seen the news would question that \nis the case.\n  On Sunday, newspapers all over the country had different titles. But \nthe Washington Post ran an article titled, ``Housing Promises Made to \nEvacuees Have Fallen Short.'' That is an understatement. This article \ntalks about tens of thousands of evacuees still living in hotel rooms, \nif they are lucky, and facing the possibility of eviction in less than \n2 weeks. That is not pretty good.\n  Another story over the weekend explained that FEMA is stopping its \ncash assistance program for hurricane survivors. When that happens, \nmany victims will have only unemployment insurance to turn to, if they \nare lucky. Those who didn't have a job when Katrina hit won't be \neligible for unemployment, and those who are eligible will find their \nbenefits grossly inadequate.\n  Is this just a term I am using, ``grossly inadequate''? Let us look \nat it. For example, a formerly self-employed person in Mississippi can \nexpect to receive $86 a week to meet his or her family's needs. That is \nnot ``pretty good.'' If you lost your home, your job, and all your \npossessions, would you be feeling ``pretty good'' about $86 a week? I \ndon't think so. America can do better than that.\n  For weeks, Democrats have been trying to get victims the relief they \nneed. Unfortunately, too many of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have not shared our sense of urgency.\n  Days after the storm, Democrats proposed a plan for comprehensive \nemergency relief. It was introduced as S. 1637, the Katrina Emergency \nRelief Act of 2005. This legislative package was designed to get \nfamilies assistance in four areas: housing, health care, education, and \nfinancial relief. Here it is more than a month later while Senators \nGrassley and Baucus, a Democrat and a Republican, chairman and ranking \nmember of our Finance Committee, have been working hard. This \nRepublican Senate has made virtually no progress. In fact, most of the \nSenate's time has been taken up by legislation that has little or no \nhelp for the victims. Last spring, Republicans in Congress and the \nPresident moved mountains in the middle of the night to intervene in \none Florida family's tragedy. But today, when thousands of displaced \nfamilies are struggling to survive, Republicans are sitting on their \nhands.\n  America can do better. We can start tomorrow by finally addressing \nthe needs of Katrina's victims in a comprehensive manner.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Harriet Miers\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I rise to commend President Bush \nfor his choice of Harriet Miers to be the Nation's next Associate \nJustice of the Supreme Court. Ms. Miers has an exemplary record of \nservice to our country. She will bring to the Court a lifetime of \nexperience in various levels of government and at the highest levels of \nthe legal profession. She is a woman of tremendous ability and very \nsound judgment.\n  Ms. Miers received her bachelor's degree and law degree from Southern \nMethodist University in her native Texas. Upon graduation, she clerked \nfor District Judge Joe Estes in the early 1970s. Ms. Miers has a \ndistinguished career as one of the foremost lawyers in this country. \nShe served has a role model for women lawyers everywhere. After \nclerking with Judge Estes for 2 years, Harriet was the first woman ever \nhired at the renowned Dallas law firm of Locke Purnell Rain Harrell in \n1972. By 1978, she had made partner. And 24 years after first entering \nthe firm's doors, her colleagues elected her to be the first female \npresident. She was the first woman to lead a Texas firm of that size \nand stature. That is a remarkable rise and a testament to her ability \nto lead and, for that matter, to inspire others.\n  Further evidence of her administrative skill came when her firm \nmerged with another firm to become the larger Locke Liddell & Sapp, \nLLP, and Ms. Miers became the comanaging partner, overseeing 400 \nlawyers. As an accomplished trial litigator, Ms. Miers has skillfully \nrepresented clients as varied as Microsoft, Walt Disney, and SunGuard \nData Systems. Her peers have recognized her many talents, as the \nNational Law Journal has repeatedly honored her as one of the top \nlawyers in our country.\n  Complex corporate litigation is a notoriously challenging practice \narea. Ms. Miers' ability to master a wide range of substantive legal \nissues has served her well time and time again, both in government and \nin the private sector.\n  In 1985, Harriet Miers became the first woman president of the Dallas \nBar Association, and in 1992, she became the first woman president of \nthe State Bar of Texas. She has played a large role in the American Bar \nAssociation, serving in various leadership positions in that \norganization, including as chair of the board of editors of the \nprestigious ABA Bar Journal.\n  Ms. Miers has great experience in government, as well as at the \nlocal, State, and Federal levels. In 1989, she was elected to the \nDallas city council. From 1995 to 2000, she volunteered to serve as \nchairwoman of the Texas Lottery Commission, while fulfilling her time-\nconsuming duties as a leader in a prestigious law firm. She was a \npowerful force for the fair and honest administration of the State \nlottery which had previously suffered from scandal. In an editorial, \nthe Dallas Morning News commended her for her meritorious service and \nfor her integrity.\n  Ms. Miers has great experience in the Federal Government, as we all \nknow, serving as assistant to the President and staff secretary, Deputy \nChief of Staff to the President, and in her current role as Counsel to \nthe President, where I and others have had a good deal of dealings with \nher over the last few months. She succeeded Attorney General Gonzales \nas White House Counsel. All of my dealings with her have been of the \nhighest order. I really couldn't compliment her more, both for her \npersonality and for her legal skills. My interaction with her could not \nhave gone better in every respect.\n  In these duties, she has grappled with the challenging issues that \nface not only the White House but our entire country these days. She is \nan accomplished lawyer who has won the respect of Republicans and \nDemocrats alike. She understands the role of a judge is not to \nlegislate from the bench but to interpret the law. She will bring to \nthe Supreme Court her broad experiences in the worlds of government and \nthe law. She is well qualified to join our Nation's highest court and \nthe President, after unprecedented consultation with the great majority \nof us in the Senate, has made an outstanding nomination. She will make \na fine addition\n\n[[Page S10925]]\n\nto the Supreme Court, and I look forward to her confirmation.\n  Now that we have a nominee, it is the Senate's responsibility to \nprovide advice and consent in a fair, dignified, and responsible \nmanner. We did that on the Roberts nomination. I fully expect the \nSenate to conduct itself in the same way on the Miers nomination.\n  In doing so, we should follow three basic principles: We should treat \nHarriet Miers respectfully. We should have a fair process, and we \nshould complete our process with an up-or-down vote in a timely manner.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I also ask the pending amendment be laid \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1943\n\n  Mr. REED. I ask to call up amendment No. 1943.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1943.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To transfer certain amounts from the supplemental \nauthorizations of appropriations for Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Global \n   War on Terrorism to amounts for Operation and Maintenance, Army, \n  Operation and Maintenance, Marine Corps, Operation and Maintenance, \nDefense-wide activities, and Military Personnel in order to provide for \n  increased personnel strengths for the Army and the Marine Corps for \n                           fiscal year 2006)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.

I also ask unanimous consent to add Senator Hagel as a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise to offer an amendment which would \nmove funding for the end-strength increases included in this bill from \nemergency funding to regular funding, thereby increasing the top lines \nof the Army and Marine Corps budgets.\n  Let me first begin by commending Chairman Stevens and Senator Inouye \nfor including the end-strength numbers, the increase in this \nlegislation. There are no more dedicated individuals committed to the \nwelfare and the efficiency of our military forces than Senator Stevens \nand Senator Inouye, and they have raised the end-strength numbers of \nthe Army by 40,000, and they have raised the end-strength numbers of \nthe Marine Corps by 3,000, and this was over the request included in \nthe President's budget.\n  I think it is patently clear that additional personnel are necessary, \nand I am pleased to see that this is the conclusion of the \nAppropriations Committee. But simply raising the end-strength number, \nin my view, is not enough. I believe we also have to pay for these \ntroops in a very straightforward fashion--not through emergency \nsupplementals but through the regular budget process. If we do not \nstart doing this now, I believe the Army and the Marine Corps will \nbegin to pay a far greater price in the future as supplemental funding \nmay diminish, but still the needs for an increased end strength \npersist.\n  There is an obvious need for increased end strength. On January 24, \n2004, Army Chief of Staff General Schoomaker announced he had received \nemergency authority to temporarily increase the size of the Army by \n30,000 soldiers for the following 4 years. At that time the leaders of \nthe Department of Defense were working on a couple of assumptions.\n  First, they were working with a plan formulated in the fall of 2003 \nthat calculated the numbers of forces in Iraq in mid-2005 to be \napproximately 40,000 troops. Remember, at that time the Pentagon was \npredicting our force levels in Iraq would be 40,000 troops. In the fall \nof 2005, at this moment, we have approximately 139,000 Army troops in \nIraq, together with 25,000 marines--far above the predicted level of \ntroops necessary, in the Pentagon's view 2 years ago, to conduct these \noperations.\n  Now this number of about 130,000 troops, Army troops and significant \nMarine Corps forces, has been steady or even higher from the period of \nMarch 2003, the time of the invasion, to today.\n  In addition, General Schoomaker recently told the Associated Press he \nis planning for over 100,000 troops to remain in Iraq through fiscal \nyear 2009.\n  I think this is very prudent and I commend General Schoomaker for \ndoing that which I think is necessary, of publicly stating that we at \nleast have to assume for planning purposes a commitment of that number.\n  This initial assumption of 40,000 troops in place in Iraq by 2005 is \nclearly inadequate. It has been overtaken by events. Again I think this \nargues for not a temporary increase in troops but a permanent increase \nin end strength and regular funding.\n  The second point I make is that in addition to our obligations in \nIraq, which require significant forces--and to have the forces in Iraq, \nwe have to have many more forces in the Army and Marine Corps training \nand getting ready to go and recover--in addition to that, Secretary \nRumsfeld was ambitiously moving forward on a transformation of the Army \nto increase the number of brigades from 33 to 48 and replace 10,000 \nmilitary slots with civilian slots, significantly reducing the number \nof soldiers in support positions. This is a very difficult and in some \ncases dynamic experience. We have an army at war and an army in \ntransformation simultaneously, but the Army is doing a magnificent job \nin both cases.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld argued that this transformation would initially \ncause a spike requiring again a temporary increase of 30,000 soldiers, \nbut then within 4 years his projection was that spike would be \neliminated. However, under the Army's own analysis and even if all \nanticipated efficiencies are widely successful, if we get the \ntransformation of military positions and civilian positions, we are \nable to form these brigades to perform as they were expected to \nperform, and all these efficiencies are squeezed out of this \ntransformation, the Army has suggested we will not be back down to pre-\n911 end strength of 482,400 until fiscal year 2011, 6 years from now.\n  Now that is not right. You have two demands, our commitment in Iraq \nand our transformation process, that drive up end strength numbers, not \nin the short term but actually over many years, and we know this right \nnow.\n  Third, the Pentagon could not have anticipated in some cases their \ninvolvement in natural disasters such as\n\n[[Page S10926]]\n\nHurricane Katrina which is creating demand for forces, particularly \nNational Guard forces. As we understand, the National Guard is the \nfirst responders. They have in some respects a dual capacity. They \nserve the Governors of States, as the State militia, as a State force, \nand then they have a Federal role. So these demands on military forces \nright now, including individual units, including demands in the \nplanning process, are a third issue that is increasing end strength \nnumbers and, I would argue, also argue strongly for regularly paying \nfor these forces.\n  Now even before General Schoomaker made his announcement in 2004 of \nan increase temporarily in end strength, Senator Hagel and I were \narguing that we needed more troops and we needed them for a \nconsiderable length of time. I think, as I have tried to suggest, this \nneed is even more obvious today than several years ago when Senator \nHagel and I first took the floor. Yet surprisingly the President's \nfiscal year 2006 budget request did not ask for any additional troops \nin terms of end strength. They were operating on this emergency \nmechanism but, as I said initially, I am delighted and pleased to see \nthat the Appropriations Committee, under the leadership of Senator \nStevens and Senator Inouye, has recognized the need to formally \nincrease end strength. What I am asking is that this formal increase of \n40,000 Army troops and 3,000 marines be also complemented by including \ntheir funding in the regular baseline of these forces and not through \nan emergency supplemental.\n  This issue of funding is the purpose of my amendment. An end-strength \nincrease of 40,000 soldiers and 3,000 marines will cost approximately \n$3.9 billion for 1 year of paid training, housing, and equipment. This \nbill funds the cost through supplemental funding, a mechanism which the \nDepartment of Defense agrees with. They have always been supportive of \nthis, but I would argue again the assumptions that they have \narticulated of a temporary spike, do not consider, I think, fully the \ndemands of transformation, and the other external demands of supporting \nforeign deployments and domestic operations such as Hurricane Katrina.\n  This funding mechanism is not the best because there are several \nproblems with this approach. The first problem is that supplemental \nfunding is supposed to be reserved for unforeseen or emergency events. \nThe Army and marines have required more troops than their authorized \nend strengths for the past 2 years and it is likely this trend will \ncontinue for at least 4 more years. That should not be a surprise to \nanyone. These soldiers and marines are clearly not an unforeseen \nhappenstance today. So I would argue it should be included in the \nregular budget and not through emergency supplemental funding.\n  The second problem is that to continue with supplemental funding \ncreates a potentially unhealthy pattern. We pass supplemental funding \nmany times. This funding runs out quickly before the end of the year--\nusually in about 9 months--and we are presented with a second \nsupplemental bill. But these extra soldiers and marines will be in the \nfield, we know, beyond 9 months; in fact, as I have suggested, probably \nfor several years in terms of their total end strength.\n  But the Department of Defense is caught up in this cycle of asking \nfor supplementals, running out of money and asking for another \nsupplemental.\n  Again, I think with respect to this issue of predictable increases in \nend strength of several years, we can avoid that through regular \nfunding.\n  Another problem with supplementals is the growing concern and \nuneasiness of the American public with respect to funding some of our \noperations.\n  Congress, to date, has appropriated $218 billion for the war in Iraq.\n  That does not go unnoticed by the American people.\n  All of this funding has been through supplementals--in effect, \ndeficit spending.\n  The Congressional Budget Office points out that we will run a deficit \nin 2005 of about $331 billion--again, a fact not escaping the American \npublic.\n  This deficit number does not include the significant costs associated \nwith Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita.\n  In an AP poll conducted 2 weeks ago, 42 percent of those polled \nstated that they preferred to pay for this hurricane relief by cutting \nspending in Iraq.\n  That is potentially an ominous note with respect to the priority that \nthe American people are suggesting in this poll.\n  Only 14 percent, by the way, were willing to continue to add to the \nFederal debt to pay for our operations overseas and our operations in \nthe gulf coast with respect to recovery from Katrina and Rita.\n  My concern is that the time we can come up and automatically fill all \nthe needs of our military forces in Iraq through supplementals may be \ndrawing to a close. It will be increasingly more difficult to move \nthese supplemental bills to fully pay for our forces as the American \npublic begins to be more and more concerned with both the deficit and \nthe unexpected increasing costs of contingencies and the cost of our \noperations overseas.\n  I believe, if this happens, there is a real potential for both the \nArmy and Marine Corps to be caught short having troops in the field \nwhich they must pay, equip, train, support, and also their families at \nhome, but yet being squeezed because supplemental funding will not be \nsufficient. That will require them to look within their own budget to \ncut programs, to cut training, to cut modernization, which is very \ncritical not only to their present posture but also to their future \nposture as the world's most formidable land force.\n  If these supplementals can't resolve the personnel costs of \nadditional troops, the Army will have to look for $3.5 billion within \ntheir budget, and the Marine Corps would have to look at $400 million.\n  These are significant numbers for these services.\n  This could put excruciating pressure upon our military forces that \nare already under excruciating pressure, and we can see that reflected \nin many different dimensions.\n  Recently, we read about the recruiting shortfall. I believe Secretary \nHarvey of the Army announced today that they are going to increase the \ncategory of enlistees they would accept that do not meet the previous \nstandards that were being used or increase the lower category of \nenlistees.\n  That is a reflection of the difficulty we have to man the force, at \nleast at the recruitment level. Retention is good. But once again, if \nthis pattern of operations persists for several years, and we see \nsoldiers who have served with magnificent valor and dedication to the \ncountry faced with a third or fourth deployment into Iraq or into \nAfghanistan, those pressures will build.\n  I believe very strongly that not only should we follow the lead in \nthe Appropriations Committee by formally increasing the end strength, \nbut that we should begin to think seriously about and in fact begin to \npay for these forces through the regular account.\n  My amendment moves the appropriate amount of money from the Army and \nMarine Corps personnel and operations and maintenance accounts included \nin the bridge supplemental, and moves them to the Army and Marine Corps \npersonnel and operations and maintenance accounts in the underlying \nbill. The funding move will, I hope, ensure several things. First, it \nwill be much more honest about how we are paying for our operations \noverseas with respect to the Army and Marines Corps. Secondly, it will \nenable us to better ensure that these funds will be available if, in \nfact, it becomes more difficult in terms of both the fiscal climate and \nthe overall opinion climate in the country to send up on a regular \nbasis very substantial supplemental appropriations bills for our \nconsideration.\n  I think we should do it today. I urge my colleagues to support this \nmeasure. I thank my colleague, Senator Hagel, for joining me in this \neffort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is a difficult situation.\n  I have great respect for the Senator from Rhode Island. We know his \nbackground as a graduate of West Point and his role on the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  Our subcommittee doesn't disagree with the intent of the Senator's \namendment. It is our feeling that right now it would cause much \ndisruption because of the way we have handled these funds since the \nbeginning of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars and the war on terror.\n\n[[Page S10927]]\n\n  Senator Reed's amendment would move funding for additional Army and \nMarine Corps end strength from the emergency portion of this bill to \nthe regular portion of the bill, and it would not have a corresponding \noffset.\n  Over the years we have been involved, we have, for both the Army and \nthe Marine Corps, requested temporary increases in their end strength \nto fight the war on terrorism, which to me includes both Afghanistan \nand Iraq. But we have done so because of the argument from the \nDepartment that these increases should be provided from supplemental \nemergency funding rather than regular appropriations because regular \nappropriations tend to invade the money that is necessary to maintain \nthe regular forces and the total confirmation of the Department. If we \nforce the DOD to pay these war-related bills out of regular \nappropriations, the net result, unless there are some changes, would be \nto punish the Army and Marine Corps because it would have to be offset \nfrom other moneys. Only moneys in the bill of this large amount and of \nthis magnitude would be from the acquisition programs, and that right \nnow would be very disruptive.\n  We can't take the money from O because that is where the regular \nend strength is. I am sure that we can't offset on the one hand and add \non the other. It would just balance out. So we feel this money should \ncome from the reserve fund.\n  That was the recommendation to us from the Armed Services Committee \nin the bill last year. Again, this year, the bill contains emergency \nfunding for the global war on terrorism.\n  Our current bill is consistent with the budget resolution for 2006, \nwhich Congress approved, and provides $50 billion in emergency spending \nto cover these costs involved in the wars we are carrying out today.\n  The additional soldiers and marines that are needed to fight in Iraq \nand Afghanistan should be in our bill and are paid from those \nsupplemental emergency funds. We have a bill that is very tightly put \ntogether, very carefully done.\n  We realigned $3.9 billion to pay for war-related military end \nstrength and associated operations and maintenance, and if we have to \ntake that out of the bill itself, as I said, it is the acquisition \nprograms that would be affected immediately.\n  That would be a major reduction.\n  We would have to take it from Navy shipbuilding accounts or from the \nArmy's future combat system or the Air Force fighter aircraft or the \nspace satellite programs. Just a few of those major programs, and it \nwould take almost $4 billion from those programs in the bill.\n  As much as we agree with the Senator, and we have provided the funds, \nthe Senator from Rhode Island and I aren't disagreeing over the funds \nor over the end strength. It is really how to pay for them at this \ntime. This is something we have argued since the beginning of these \nengagements that we have been involved in.\n  I remind the Senate that I made those arguments in connection with \nPresident Clinton's move in Bosnia and Kosovo.\n  But that is the way Presidents have done it. They want us to pay for \nthese funds out on an emergency basis. And, in some instances, past \nadministrations have borrowed money from the current fiscal year and \nforced us to have a supplemental later in the fiscal year. Under this \nPresident, we have had supplementals at the beginning of the fiscal \nyear, and that is where we are today.\n  We have $50 billion in this bill to pay for these costs.\n  I urge the Senator not to pursue this amendment. We are not in \ndisagreement over principle. We both support the end strength. It is a \nquestion of how to pay for it, and the bill now before us pays for that \nadditional end strength out of the supplemental reserve account.\n  I urge him to continue to support that basis. As I said, the Armed \nServices Committee ended up supporting it once again this year. We hope \nwe will find a way to come to an end of that process and not have to \nuse emergency moneys to pay for end strength. It is a temporary \nincrease in end strength; it is not a permanent increase. Therefore, it \nshould be paid for out of the contingency funds that are set aside on \nthis bill on an emergency basis.\n  I again want to say how much we appreciate the Senator's interest in \nthe manpower situation--manpower requirements of the services. We look \nforward to working with him on that.\n  I hope he will not pursue this amendment.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I have immense respect for the chairman. I \nappreciate the difficulty of the job in trying to balance all these \nconflicting requests for funds. He has done a tremendous job with this \nappropriations bill. Certainly, I will consider his advice with respect \nto the position of the legislation. I would like to consider it a \nlittle further. But I appreciate the difficulty that the committee has \nin trying to meet all these amendments.\n  I say, finally, that what I am trying to do now is avoid a situation \nnext year or the following year, as the chairman very well pointed out, \nwhere supplementals are not sufficient and the Army and Marine Corps \nhave to look to their acquisition programs, cut combat systems, they \nhave to look to other issues, quality of life for families, since these \ndo keep these forces in uniform.\n  There is no disagreement, as the chairman pointed out, with respect \nto the need of these troops. There is no disagreement with respect to \nthe fact that they will be on our books, if you will, for several years \ninto the future.\n  I am pleased that the chairman and Senator Inouye formally increased \nthe end strength, as Senator Warner and Senator Levin have done in the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  He is very right. The argument is how we pay for it. Do we pay for it \nthrough the emergency, or do we pay for them through the regular \naccounts?\n  I argue that a day of reckoning is coming where, if we don't face up \nto this by including it in the regular accounts, we will be dipping \ninto acquisition and into other necessary programs of both the Army and \nMarine Corps.\n  But again, I will take the Senator's good advice very closely to \nmind, and I appreciate the fact that we agree on so much.\n  We are trying to figure out what is most appropriate--not just for \nthe near term but in the long term--way to pay for these forces.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. DeWine are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DeWINE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, yesterday, in anticipation of the \nunanimous consent agreement, the Senator from Virginia, joined by the \nSenator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, the managers and chairman and ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee, filed an amendment, which \namendment is the entire authorization bill prepared by the Committee on \nArmed Services and reported out favorably earlier this year. It was the \nsubject of floor debate for some time. Some 30 amendments were added.\n  I also filed a second amendment, which represented 80 amendments \nwhich had been reconciled by the Senator from Michigan and myself and \nplaced into the amendment to constitute a managers' amendment.\n  In other words, we agree as managers that they should be accepted \nsubject to a unanimous consent agreement, which is the conventional way \nof handling a managers' amendment.\n  I now have with me today a third amendment, which represents another\n\n[[Page S10928]]\n\n16 amendments that the Senator from Michigan and I have agreed upon \nshould be eventually added to our bill.\n  My first inquiry to the Chair is: Is it appropriate, at this time, \ngiven the unanimous consent that was agreed to this morning, to send to \nthe desk and ask be filed a third amendment representing another \nmanagers' amendment for 16 reconciled amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A third second-degree amendment may be filed.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then I do so at this time, and I ask it be assigned a \nnumber.\n  Mr. President, I have had the opportunity to consult with the \ndistinguished manager and the ranking member. I have advised him of \nsteps that I would like to take at this time.\n  I now ask that amendment No. 1955, which is the authorization bill, \nbe called up for the purpose of sending to the desk a modification to \nthat amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1955\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1955.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Monday, October 3, 2005, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I now send to the desk a modification to \nthat amendment and ask that it be so modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1955), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1.

Mr. President, my understanding is that amendment 1955, \nas modified, is available to be brought up for consideration.\n  I now ask that the amendment be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask for its consideration.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the amendment \nthat the Senator from Virginia, chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, has offered is still the authorization bill from the Armed \nServices Committee, as modified.\n  May I inquire of the Senator, is that correct?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, that bill offered to this appropriations \nbill is a massive authorization bill offered as an amendment and, as \nsuch, it amounts to legislation on an appropriations bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am having some difficulty--because of \nthe conversations taking place elsewhere in the Chamber--following the \ndistinguished manager's remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as modified, this is still the \nauthorization bill being offered to an appropriations bill. It amounts \nto legislation on an appropriations bill--a substantial authorization, \nI might add. I feel it is a violation of rule XVI. Therefore, as \nchairman of this subcommittee, I make a point of order that this \namendment offered by the Senator from Virginia is subject to the \nprovisions of rule XVI, and I make that point of order very plainly. I \nask that it be ruled to be authorization on an appropriations bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time, I insert the defense of \ngermaneness, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this moment, there is not a sufficient \nsecond.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, pending before the Senate is a nondebatable \nquestion as to whether the pending Warner amendment is germane. I now \nask consent that this question be temporarily set aside to recur \nWednesday evening at 7:30.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I do not \nintend to object, but I wish to advise the Members of the Senate the \nRecord will reflect tomorrow the colloquy and actions taken by the \ndistinguished managers and myself which gave rise to this amendment.\n  The Parliamentarian ruled with regard to my amendment as follows: We, \nthe Parliamentarians, have advised that there is sufficient----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator permit me to interrupt? The \nParliamentarian has not ruled. The Parliamentarian has stated and \nadvised that you have the defense of germaneness.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is right. I said the \nParliamentarians have advised--that is as I have read it, in the \nParliamentarian's handwriting--there is sufficient language in the \nHouse bill to permit Senator Warner to assert the defense of \ngermaneness with respect to his amendment numbered 1955.\n  I did just that. I have acted consistently, having been working with \nthe Parliamentarian through much of the day as to how to develop this \nprocedure. I followed the rules as I understood them and advised the \nParliamentarian.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion, having been presented \nunder rule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on H.R. 2863: the \n     Department of Defense appropriations bill.\n         Bill Frist, Ted Stevens, Daniel Inouye, Mel Martinez, \n           Mitch McConnell, Bob Bennett, George Allen, Chuck \n           Hagel, Tom Coburn, Richard Burr, Lisa Murkowski, John \n           Thune, Lamar Alexander, Richard Shelby, Jon Kyl, Jeff \n           Sessions, Saxby Chambliss.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the unanimous consent request was to \ntemporarily set aside the pending Warner amendment, the determination \nof whether it is germane, until 7:30 tomorrow evening. What that means, \npractically speaking, now that we have filed cloture as well, is we \nwill continue on the Department of Defense appropriations bill; \namendments, as they are brought to the Senate, will be debated and \nconsidered over the course of tomorrow, throughout the day; that the \nfirst vote that will be taken--we are not going to be voting until \ntomorrow evening--is on the issue of the germaneness of the Warner \namendment. There are likely to be--in fact, there will be--other votes \nstacked after that depending on what comes forward tomorrow. We have \ntwo other amendments pending as well.\n\n  The cloture motion has been filed. That cloture vote would be on--\ntoday is Tuesday, then comes Wednesday--Thursday morning, which will \nallow us to complete the Department of Defense appropriations bill this \nweek, as we have said all along.\n  One of the reasons we filed cloture tonight is to allow the full \nSenate to decide how best to proceed and to move forward so the \npreferences of Senators can be heard, listened to, and we can bring to \nclosure this particular bill.\n  Mr. President, I will simply turn to my distinguished colleague from \nVirginia to allow him to make any statement, but that is the \nunderstanding we have had among both the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Department of Defense appropriations bill, the leadership on both \nsides, and the chairman of the authorizing amendment that has been \noffered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished leader. I thank \nhim for working with me continuously on this matter in every way to try \nto get our bill up because the distinguished majority leader, as well \nas the Democratic leader and Senator Levin and others, thinks it is \nimperative, with this Nation at war, this bill be addressed in a timely \nmanner by the Senate and hopefully passed. It contains so many \nprovisions which are essential to the men and women of the Armed \nForces.\n  I have continuously fought that battle and will continue to do so. I \nparticipated in the drafting of this UC in a manner that enables the \nSenate to continue its work tomorrow, although I could have objected \nthroughout. I would not object to allowing the Senate to continue its \nbusiness and the Appropriations Committee to work the bill as sent.\n  I also believe, as you have advised me, you will continue to work, as \nwill the Democratic leader, to seek a UC by which the Defense \nauthorization bill can be brought up as a freestanding measure, at a \ntime agreed upon by the two leaders, with a certain description of \nprovisions that enable us to bring it up and how that further work on \nthe bill will be conducted and in what\n\n[[Page S10968]]\n\ntimeframe. That is important to the two leaders. Hopefully, we can \nachieve that tomorrow. If we do, then I would take the appropriate \nparliamentary steps to remove from the appropriations bill these \nmatters.\n  So I thank the two leaders and reiterate the essential nature of \nbringing this bill forward. I feel very strongly about it. And I thank \nmy colleague from Alaska with whom I worked today. I am not \nsuggesting--anyway, we worked it out, followed the rules, and that is \nit. I thank the leadership.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           NOTICES OF INTENT\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in accordance with rule V of the Standing \nRules of the Senate, I hereby give notice in writing that it is my \nintention to move to suspend paragraph 4 of rule XVI for the purpose of \nproposing to the bill, H.R. 2863, the Department of Defense \nAppropriations Bill, the following amendment: Amendment no. 1999.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mrs. LINCOLN.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Army SP \nAllen Nolan, from Marietta, OH, who was severely injured in Balad, \nIraq, while serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He died from his \ninjuries on September 30, 2004, at the Brook Army Medical Center in \nHouston, Texas. He was 38 years old.\n  Throughout Allen's life, he touched countless people. His family and \nclose friends describe his loyalty and devotion to his family, his \ncommunity, his church, and his country. Allen's strong religious faith \nwas central to him. As Pastor Ray Witmer III, of Faith Bible Church in \nWilliamstown, OH, where Allen and his family were members, said this \nabout Allen:\n\n       The phrase that keeps coming to mind--words that Allen \n     actually had said many times--is that he is a father, \n     husband, son, soldier, and foremost, a Christian.\n\n  Allen Nolan was all of those things--and more. Robin Nolan described \nher brother-in-law as a ``strong family man who enjoyed hunting and \nfishing.'' She said that ``he was always willing to help out. When my \nhusband was ill last winter, he was such a big help. He was a very, \nvery good brother and father.''\n  Allen Nolan graduated from Warren High School and received an \nassociate degree in business from Washington County Technical College. \nLater, he attended The Ohio State University and Ohio Valley College, \nwhere he earned a bachelor's degree in organizational management. He \neventually went on to work for Broughton Foods in Marietta and Century \n21 Realty.\n  Allen loved his family more than anything else in the world. He and \nhis devoted wife, Gail, were the proud parents of five children--Roman, \nKennan, Euanna, Bobby, and Frankie. Allen was a terrific father--\ncaring, committed, and supportive of his young family. He protected \nGail and his children as a husband and father--and also as a soldier.\n  Allen loved his country and felt a duty to protect it and make it a \nbetter place for his family. He served in the Army Reserves for seven \nyears as a member of the 660th Transportation Company based out of \nZanesville, Ohio. As one of the more experienced members of his unit, \nAllen took it upon himself to mentor the younger soldiers.\n  Dan Johnson, a close friend in his unit, described Allen as a \n``completely selfless individual. He would drop anything to help \nsomeone. He talked about his family all the time. I feel very lucky \nthat I had the chance to know him and to work with him.'' Johnson \nfurther emphasized, ``What I remember most about Allen is that he \nalways had a `can do' attitude. I never heard him complain or gripe \nabout anything. We got to be close friends.''\n  SP Robert Lovell, who served with Allen since 1997, also cherished \ntheir friendship, saying the following:\n\n       Allen was always the first to volunteer. He was deeply \n     committed to his religion. What I miss most about Allen is \n     that he was always there if you needed help or counsel. Allen \n     was one of my best friends and has been since we first met.\n\n  BG Michael W. Beasley, commanding general of the 88th Regional \nReadiness Command, RRC, said that ``Allen was a wonderful soldier. He \nfrequently volunteered for the most complex and difficult missions. He \nwas also an excellent mentor and trainer of the younger soldiers.'' \nOther men in his company described how he would lead them in prayer \nbefore going out on a mission. They talked about how much comfort that \ngave them.\n  Not surprisingly, though just three months away from retiring from \nthe Reserves when his unit was deployed to Iraq in February 2004, Allen \ndid not hesitate to fulfill his duty. He and Gail both considered the \nwar in Iraq an integral part of the war on terror. Allen believed he \nhad a mission to carry out and was ready and willing to do whatever was \nnecessary--whatever was needed.\n  Allen had been in Iraq 9 months, when he was scheduled to return home \nfor 2 weeks on September 20, 2004. However, he was injured on September \n18 when the fuel truck that he was driving north of Baghdad was struck \nby an improvised explosive device and came under a missile attack and a \nsmall arms fire. Allen was first evacuated to the 31st combat support \nhospital in Baghdad and then to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in \nGermany. A burn team later transported him to Brook Army Medical Center \nin Texas, where he died on September 30, following a second surgery.\n  Thankfully, Allen was able to spend his last days and hours \nsurrounded by loved ones. Gail and their oldest son, Roman, were able \nto be with him at the hospital. Gail's close friend, Karmen Lockhart, \nsaid that ``we knew so many people praying for Allen, but God didn't \nanswer our prayers the way we wanted. But, I believe he answered \nAllen's prayers, not to take other soldiers, but to take him. I believe \nhe gave his life so others could be saved.''\n  Pastor Witmer was also able to be with the Nolans at the Army \nhospital in Texas. Pastor Witmer said that ``Allen was sure of his \neternity.'' His unshakable faith is what allowed him to give so \ngenerously of himself and make that ultimate sacrifice.\n  Young children often have a way of putting even the most tragic of \nevents into perspective for us. After learning of his father's death, \nAllen and Gail's son Kennan, who was nine years old at the time, said \nthis about his father: ``The Lord must have needed him more than I \ndid.'' In those simple, selfless words, this little boy is saying so \nmuch. His father would be very proud.\n  Appropriately, Allen was remembered in a beautiful funeral service \nheld at the Faith Bible Church, the center of his spiritual life. \nNearly 500 people attended the service. Allen received five medals \nposthumously: The Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, the Meritorious \nService Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, and the Good Conduct Medal. \nHis medals were presented to Gail at his funeral, which included full \nmilitary honors.\n  When I think about the life of Army SP Allen Nolan, I am reminded of \nsomething tennis great, Arthur Ashe, once said about what it means to \nbe a hero. He said that ``true heroism is remarkably sober--very \nundramatic. It is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost, \nbut the urge to serve others at whatever cost.'' That's Allen Nolan. He \nwas a noble man willing to serve others--his family, his fellow \nsoldiers, his country--at whatever cost. And for that, we will never \nforget him.\n  I know that Allen's family and friends will forever cherish the \nmemory of their son, brother, husband, and father, whose love knew no \nbounds. They all remain in our thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                     Army Corporal Kevin W. Prince\n\n  Mr. President, this afternoon I also wish to honor and to remember a \nfellow Ohioan and a brave soldier. Army CPL Kevin W. Prince, of Plain \nCity, OH, was killed on April 23, 2005, when a homemade bomb detonated \nunder his Humvee. Corporal Prince was on patrol in Iskandariyah, Iraq. \nAt the time of his death, He was 22 years old.\n\n[[Page S10969]]\n\n  Kevin was born on July 13, 1982, in Canton, OH, to loving parents, \nRonald and Susan Prince. When he was 2 years old, his family moved to \nPlain City, where he grew up. As a youth, Kevin worked part time in his \nparent's restaurant, the ``Main Street Bagel and Deli, and attended \nAlder High School, where he played soccer and ran cross country. \nPrincipal Phil Harris remembers Kevin as a decent young man, who was \nhonest and caring. He was always standing up for the underdogs--the \nkids who were being picked on or bullied. He made sure they were okay--\nthat they were protected.\n  Inside and outside of school, Kevin lived life to the fullest. He \nenjoyed reading, watching movies, running, and playing video games. \nKevin also enjoyed playing soccer, something he had done since the age \nof 5. His grandfather tells a story about one of Kevin's earliest \nmatches. Kevin had the ball and was running down the field--but in the \nwrong direction. Kevin's grandfather shouted at him to turn around, \nwhich he did, but only long enough to shout ``Be quiet, Grampa!'' He \nkept on running down the field--the wrong way. Evidently, Kevin had a \nbit of stubborn streak.\n  After graduating from high school, Kevin decided to join the \nmilitary. He planned to attend college when his term of service ended. \nHis father, a Navy veteran, tried his best to convince Kevin to become \na fellow sailor, but Kevin refused. He wanted to be a soldier, and so, \nin 2001, he enlisted in the Army.\n  Kevin went through boot camp at Fort Benning, GA, where he finished \nin October 2002. By January 2003, he was sent to Fort Irwin, CA, where \nhe joined the Army's 2nd Division, 11th Armored Cavalry, Echo Troop. At \nFort Irwin, Kevin trained other soldiers in the extreme conditions of \nthe Mojave Desert to prepare them for the heat and dust of Iraq's \ndeserts.\n  On January 9, 2005, Kevin's unit was deployed to Iraq, where they \npatrolled the area south of Baghdad. Months after Kevin arrived in \nIraq, he began April 23 like any other day. He called home and spoke to \nhis parents. He chatted with his sister and brother over the Internet. \nOnly a few hours later, a roadside bomb detonated under his vehicle. In \nthat tragic moment, the Prince family lost their youngest son, and the \nUnited States lost a very courageous soldier.\n  CPL Kevin Prince was more than just a good soldier. He was a good \ncitizen. He was a good friend. Chris Holehouse, a close friend of \nKevin's, spoke of his honesty, selflessness, and integrity:\n\n       His handshake was his word. If he found $2,000 in a wallet, \n     he'd give it back. He was not like anybody else. He wasn't \n     apathetic to what was going on. He wasn't lazy, and he wasn't \n     selfish; he was dependable. He reminded me of those books \n     about Camelot. He reminded me of one of those guys.\n\n  Just as he had in high school, Kevin fought bullying wherever he \nfound it, even at Fort Irwin. After Kevin's death, a friend from Fort \nIrwin wrote a brief memorial for the guy who looked out for him and \nbecame his friend:\n\n       My name is Specialist Nathan Stern. I met Kevin when I \n     first arrived at Fort Irwin. Being a brand new [Private] \n     mechanic, I naturally got a hard time from a lot of the \n     infantry guys. Kevin didn't [give me a hard time]. He helped \n     me out a lot. We became friends over time and hung out \n     outside of work every now and then. Kevin was a rare person \n     to find, and I will miss him.\n\n  Kevin joined the Army to help make the world a better place. And in \nso many ways, he did just that. Those who knew Kevin all say he hated \nbullies. In high school, he stood up for his schoolmates. In the Army, \nhe stood up for all of us. He fought for the blessings we sometimes \ntake for granted and the principles and ideals on which our Nation was \nfounded. He fought for it all, and he gave us his all.\n  Today, we honor Kevin Prince. We will remember him always.\n  My wife, Fran, and I continue to keep Kevin's many friends and \nfamily--especially his parents, Ronald and Susan; his sister Kelly; and \nhis brother Jason--in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                         ARMY 1LT AARON SEESAN\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to honor a fellow Ohioan and brave \nsoldier. Army First Lieutenant Aaron Seesan of Massillon, OH, was \ngravely injured on May 21, 2005, when his vehicle struck a roadside \nbomb near Mosul, Iraq. Having survived the immediate blast, he was \ntransported to a hospital in Germany, where he passed away a short time \nlater. Aaron was 24 years old.\n  Aaron's dedication and sacrifice knew no bounds. As he lay mortally \nwounded in the moments following the explosion, he thought not of \nhimself, but of his fellow soldiers around him. Instead of calling out \nfor help, he ordered his troops to tend to other injured soldiers. \nThose who witnessed First Lieutenant Seesan's incredible act of bravery \nremember his words: ``Take charge Sergeant Arnold, and take care of the \nothers.'' This last act of selflessness defined Aaron's character, his \nheroism, his courage.\n  Aaron attended Massillon Washington High School where he was a member \nof the National Honor Society, earned several scholarships, and became \na delegate to Buckeye Boys State. He played on the offensive line for \nthe Tigers football team, and threw the shot put in track. He also \nparticipated in the drama program, Academic Challenge, and the speech \nteam. Aaron was, indeed, a very accomplished young man.\n  After high school, he enrolled in the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. \nAt the Academy, Aaron was a member of the rifle team and served on the \nschool's honor board, which he chaired his senior year. In 2003, the \nday he graduated with a degree in marine systems engineering, Aaron was \ncommissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army.\n  Once in the Army, Aaron volunteered to go to Iraq. He didn't have to \ngo. He wanted to go. He joined the 73rd Engineering Company, 1st \nBrigade, 24th Regiment--a unit that had sustained numerous casualties. \nAaron explained to his father that most other soldiers of his rank have \nfamilies, and that he--as a single man--should go in their place. Aaron \nwent to Iraq so that someone he would never meet could stay home with \nhis or her family. That is just how Aaron saw the world. To him, this \nwas simply the right thing to do.\n  The other members of the 73rd sometimes joked about Aaron's maritime \nbackground. They tell a story about how during live fire exercises, \nAaron once yelled ``man overboard,'' instead of ``man down'' after a \nmock casualty fell. Though they liked to joke and kid around, his \nfellow soldiers never questioned Aaron's resolve or his dedication to \nhis service.\n  Not surprisingly, while in Iraq, Aaron took on one of the riskiest \njobs. As a combat engineer, or sapper, he patrolled the most dangerous \nroads in and around Mosul. While most soldiers did their best to avoid \nroadside bombs, Aaron Seesan looked for them. He was part of a Stryker \nbrigade that searched for improvised explosive devices along roadways. \nAt a memorial service, LTC Eric Kurilla, commanding officer of the 24th \nregiment, spoke of the inherent risks involved with what Aaron was \ndoing:\n\n       A Stryker IED Sweep, by its very name, implies great danger \n     and risk. You are traveling the most heavily mined and bombed \n     roads in Iraq, not trying to avoid the mines and bombs, but \n     actually trying to find them. Why? So that others can travel \n     safely without fear of attack.\n\n  Without ever giving it a second thought, Aaron went out and did his \njob to protect others. As SGT John Pavlick, also of the 73rd, said, \n``[Aaron] fully knew he was walking into a mess. That says a lot about \nhim.'' Indeed, it does.\n  On May 22, 2005, our country lost a brave soldier and Aaron's family \nlost a loving son and brother. Just hours before he went on his last \nlate night explosives sweep, Aaron waited in line until nearly midnight \nto make a phone call home to his family. One last time, Aaron teased \nhis two sisters and spoke with his parents. His last words to his \nmother were simply, ``I love you.''\n  Upon his death, Aaron posthumously received the Purple Heart, Bronze \nStar, and Army Commendation Medal. His father, Tom, knows that Aaron \ndied fulfilling a dream. He knows that Aaron wanted more than anything \nto protect his community and country as a soldier. As he said, \n``[Aaron] always was interested in the military from a small boy. This \nwas always something that he wanted to do. He died doing something he \nwanted to do.''\n  Tom Heitger, Aaron's good friend since kindergarten, echoed that \nsentiment, saying this about Aaron's sacrifice:\n\n\n[[Page S10970]]\n\n\n       The military was all he ever wanted; it was his dream. He \n     was a very hard working man. It has been both an honor and a \n     privilege to call this man my friend, and I'm very proud of \n     him, He made the ultimate sacrifice.\n\n  As I conclude my remarks, I would like to share the heartfelt words \nof one of Aaron's fellow soldiers, PVT BriAnne Ackerson. In an email \nmessage posted to an Internet tribute in Aaron's honor, she wrote the \nfollowing to Aaron's family:\n\n       Aaron Seesan was an amazing officer. I knew him well. As I \n     served near him in Iraq and became a good friend of his in \n     Kuwait, I realized the potential he had to become such a \n     wonderful officer. He cared so much for so many. He was \n     always asking questions, always wanting to know more. He \n     always smiled and did his job to the tee. Aaron will be \n     missed terribly by so many. . . . I hope this letter brings \n     you blessings. I really miss your son. . . . He meant a lot \n     to me. God Bless all of you.\n\n  Aaron Seesan joined the Army to protect his country. He volunteered \nto go to Iraq to protect families he never met. And, he de-mined roads \nin Iraq to protect the men and women serving alongside him. He never \nstopped giving, even during the last moments of his life.\n  Our Nation has lost a truly courageous and selfless young man. May \nhis memory endure and inspire greatness in others.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Kevin's mom and dad and his \nsisters and brother in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                      Army SSG Richard Morgan, Jr.\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to pay tribute to a fellow Ohioan and \ndedicated soldier who lost his life while serving in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. I honor and remember the life of Army SSG Richard Morgan, Jr.\n  When I think about the dedication of all our men and women in \nuniform, I am reminded of something President Ronald Reagan once said \nabout our obligation to protect freedom. He said this:\n\n       For with the privilege of living in . . . America . . . \n     there is a destiny and a duty, a call to preserve and hold in \n     sacred trust mankind's age-old aspirations of peace and \n     freedom and a better life for generations to come.\n\n  Richard Morgan, Jr., answered the call to preserve freedom. He fought \nfor peace. And, he made the world a better place for future \ngenerations.\n  Rik--as Richard was known to family and friends--was born in Dayton, \nOH, on December 20, 1965. He attended St. Clairsville High School, \nwhere he was one of the original members of the St. Clairsville Singers \nand played on the Red Devil football team. After graduation in 1984, \nRik briefly worked at Conway Central Express in Uhrichsville, OH, \nbefore joining the Army, something his friends say he always wanted to \ndo.\n  Rik loved Army life. He was a dedicated and dependable soldier. He \nparticipated in Operation Just Cause in Panama from 1989 to 1990, and \nserved in the Middle East during Operation Desert Storm. While he was \ncertainly proud to serve and to protect and defend freedom, Rik would \nundoubtedly say that one of the best things that came about from his \ntime in the Army wasn't so much about his service, but about meeting \nthe love of his life, Diana.\n  Diana and Rik met while he was serving in Germany almost 20 years \nago. They fell deeply in love. Friends say they were meant for each \nother. Rik and Diana eventually married and had two wonderful children, \nRichard and Kimberly, whom they raised in Maynard, OH.\n  Rik and his family were living in Maynard when the war in Iraq began. \nHaving spent a few years out of the full time service as a retired \nReservist, he did not want to sit on the sidelines. Rik re-enlisted in \nthe Army, and with the same excitement he had when he first enlisted so \nmany years before.\n  Rik's sister, Bonita Girty, said this about Rik's re-enlistment:\n\n       He just loved what he did. He wanted to go back. . . . I \n     don't think anyone could stop him from going. . . . He just \n     liked fighting for his country.\n\n  Rik's friends agreed. They said he ``loved his country and wanted \nnothing more than to serve and protect it.'' He was assigned to the \n660th Transportation Company of the U.S. Army Reserves, based in Cadiz, \nOH. He started serving in Iraq in December 2003. Though thousands of \nmiles separated him from his beloved family, Rik kept several Internet \nconnections open to stay in touch. His sister Bonita said that her \nbrother never indicated feelings of nervousness and made sure never to \ndiscuss the secret nature of his missions. Rik believed in the war and \nwas devoted to his mission.\n  Rik and his family had the opportunity to spend time together for 2 \nweeks in August 2004, when he was on leave. It was time they all \ncherished. Rik and his wife celebrated their 16th wedding anniversary, \nas well as Diana's birthday before he went back to Iraq. ``He was happy \nto be home,'' his sister recalled. ``He was happy to be here with his \nfamily.''\n  Tragically, that was be the last time Rik would see them. On October \n5, 2004, Rik was killed when his military vehicle hit a landmine in \nLatfiyah, Iraq. He was 38 years of age at the time of his death.\n  Rik Morgan forever will be remembered as a loving father, devoted \nhusband, attentive son, and caring brother. He touched countless lives.\n  Rik was given full military honors at the service held in his honor \nand the Purple Heart and Bronze Star were presented to his family. \nHundreds gathered to pay their respects to Rik, including members of \nthe St. Clairsville football team and Rik's coach from so many years \nago, Mickey Blatnik.\n  I had the privilege of meeting several members of Rik's family, and I \nwant to thank them for sharing their memories with me. It was easy to \nsee how proud they are of Rik and how supportive they are of each \nother. As Rik's sister Bonita said, ``He's a hero. He was proud to \nfight for his country.''\n  In closing, I would like to share an email message that was posted on \nan Internet tribute to Rik. It is a simple message from Mrs. Arthur's \n4th Grade Class in Nelsonville, OH. It reads as follows:\n\n       My class and I want to thank you Richard for helping to \n     keep us all safe. Please know that you will not be forgotten.\n\n  Indeed, Army SSG Richard Morgan will not be forgotten, for he \nanswered the call President Reagan talked about to preserve peace and \nfreedom. As that email message attests, he was, in fact, making ``a \nbetter life for generations to come.''\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Richard's family and friends in \nour thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                        Army SGT Kurt Schamberg\n\n  Mr. President, this afternoon I also wish to honor a fellow Ohioan \nand brave soldier, Army Sergeant Kurt Schamberg, from Orwell. SGT \nSchamberg died in Baghdad on May 19, 2005, when a roadside bomb \ndetonated alongside his Humvee. He was 26 years of age at the time.\n  Kurt Schamberg held nothing back from his service to our country. At \nthe time of his death, Kurt was almost done with his second tour of \nduty in Iraq. He already had been injured by shrapnel from another \nroadside bombing, but, as soon as he could leave the hospital, Kurt was \nback on patrol with his unit. Over and over, he gave of himself to \nprotect others. Sergeant Schamberg was the embodiment of endurance and \ndedication, demonstrating time and time again that he was a model U.S. \nsoldier.\n  Kurt was born on July 16, 1978, in Warren, OH. He grew up in Orwell, \nwhere he graduated from Grand Valley High School in 1997. Kurt was an \nenergetic and creative young man. He enjoyed sports--especially \nwatching the Pittsburgh Steelers--discussing politics, painting, and \namateur film-making. Though he loved to talk about politics and current \nevents, when the need presented itself, Kurt did more than just \n``talk'' about the issues of the day with his friends. He acted. He \nwent out into the world to make a difference. After the attacks of 9/\n11, Kurt Schamberg decided to enlist in the Army and defend our country \nfrom the front lines.\n  Kurt completed his training at Fort Benning, GA, and was then \nassigned to the 10th Mountain Division out of Fort Drum, NY, where he \nserved as an automatic rifleman. His unit fought in the early stages of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom before returning home in March 2004. They again \ndeployed again to Iraq in January 2005.\n  Kurt Schamberg was a man of great conviction, who fought for what he \nbelieved in, for what he felt was just and what he felt was right. Kurt \njoined the\n\n[[Page S10971]]\n\nwar on terrorism and fought to bring freedom to the Iraqi people \nbecause he wanted to make the world a stronger, safer, better place for \nall of us. According to Kurt's mother, Pamela Lindsay:\n\n       [Kurt] among all my children was the peace lover. He was \n     always finding a solution to a conflict. He would always \n     fight the good fight, through talking and joking. If we could \n     fight wars without loss of life and limb . . . Kurt would \n     have lived. But . . . he knew that was not possible at this \n     time.\n\n  Sergeant Schamberg loved his family. And, he loved the U.S. Army. He \nhelped a new generation of soldiers learn how to protect themselves and \nprotect our country. In an email message posted on an Internet tribute \nfollowing Kurt's death, SPC Richard Ellsworth, who was stationed at \nFort Campbell, KY, at the time, wrote the following:\n\n       [Kurt], I wanted to tell you that your job as an NCO in the \n     Army is not over yet. You still have to take care of your \n     troops! I will be heading to Iraq for the second time very \n     shortly and I will need an outstanding NCO to look up to. I \n     couldn't think of a better soldier than you. You will be \n     missed, but never forgotten. Remember the soldiers' creed and \n     the warrior ethos--and lead your soldiers to victory.\n\n  Kurt Schamberg was an accomplished and well-respected soldier. He was \nalso an energetic, loving, good-humored young man, who endeared himself \nto all. Kurt's cousin Katie Schamberg remembers this about him: ``He \nwas talented. He was funny. He was just everything. He loved life and \nwas proud of what he was doing. . . .''\n  Kurt lived life to its fullest, whether he was fighting in a war or \nwatching his beloved Steelers play football or creating his artwork or \nhaving a lively debate about politics. Everything he did, he did it \nwith passion and zeal and with a love for life.\n  I would like to close my remarks with something that Kurt's friend \nTiffany from Cleveland wrote in his honor:\n\n       Kurt was a wonderful, charismatic and brave individual. He \n     had the remarkable talent of making people laugh. I will \n     always remember him for this. I am immensely saddened by the \n     loss, as is everyone who was privileged enough to know him in \n     this life. Kurt was loved by many and [was] a true friend. My \n     sympathy goes out to Lance and Kurt's family. Farewell Kurt. \n     You will surely be missed.\n\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Kurt's family in our thoughts and \nprayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/04/senate-section/article/S10971-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TERRORIST ATTACKS IN INDONESIA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to condemn \nthe terrorist attacks in Bali this past weekend that murdered over 20 \npeople and injured scores of others. I ask my colleagues to keep the \ninnocent victims of the attacks--and their families and friends--in our \nthoughts and prayers.\n  The indiscriminate murder of men, women, and children in Bali by \nsuicide bombers underscores the viciousness of ideological extremists. \nYoung men and women wooed to the dark side of religious fanaticism \nshould not be fooled that paradise follows their suicide. At the end of \nthe day, there is only death and destruction.\n  During these turbulent times, the people of Indonesia should know \nthat they do not stand alone. As we share common principles of freedom \nand human rights, the world's democracies stand with you. I encourage \nPresident Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to let America and other nations \nknow how best we can help in the aftermath of the attacks--and what \nassistance we can provide to counter terrorism in Indonesia. In the war \nagainst terrorism, your struggle is our struggle.\n  I close by saying that like the Bali bombings in October 2002, the \nripple from this weekend's attacks are felt on the shores of all free \nnations. Indonesia does not stand alone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/04/senate-section/article/S10971-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE LIFE OF PAMELA WHITE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last summer, I came to the Senate floor to \nsay a few words about the untimely death of a great wilderness advocate \nand friend named Sally Kabisch. I spoke then of how one person can and \ndoes make a difference.\n  It is with a heavy heart that I return today to honor another great \nNevadan who died too young and in tragic fashion.\n  Pam White hailed from Wyoming, she spent time in California, but \nsettled in Ely--in eastern Nevada--and became a great Nevadan. Just \nlast Thursday, Pam joined me and Senator Ensign for breakfast here in \nthe Capitol. She had traveled to advocate for wilderness in White Pine \nCounty, the place she called home.\n  Pam's enthusiasm and conviction were infectious. She worked doggedly \nto build support for wilderness in rural Nevada. She served on local \ncommittees and advisory groups because she cared about the management \nand protection of our public lands. She deserves credit for \ndepoliticizing the wilderness debate in eastern Nevada. She also \ndeserves credit for supporting economic development in her adopted home \ntown of Ely.\n  What I also appreciated about Pam was that she knew the importance of \nadoption. She adopted Nevada as her State, Ely as her home, and a young \nboy named Connor as her son.\n  Connor White has been dealt some tough cards in his life. His birth \nparents had serious drug problems and he ended up in foster care. Pam \nWhite became his advocate, his protector, and his mother. It takes a \nspecial person to care for a special needs child. Pam was a special \nperson who cared. It takes an angel to adopt a special needs child.\n  The day after I saw Pam last week, she died in a single car crash \nbetween Ely and Elko. Pam was and is an angel. As Pam's parents, \nfriends, family, and community rally to remember her life, Connor's \nfuture will be their focus. Pam would have wanted it to be so because \nshe knew that affecting the lives of children is the best difference we \ncan make.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/04/senate-section/article/S10971-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10971-S10972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO COMMANDER KEVIN S. BRENNAN, USN\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay tribute to \nan outstanding Naval Officer, Commander Kevin Brennan, who has served \nso admirably and faithfully as a liaison to our Appropriations \nCommittee on Defense. I want to recognize his superb service to our \nNation and the Navy as he leaves our Nation's Capital to take command \nof an operational aviation squadron.\n  On behalf of my colleagues on the Defense Appropriations \nsubcommittee, I want to take this opportunity to thank him for his \ndedicated and faithful service in pursuing the best for our men and \nwomen of the Navy.\n  As the Navy's primary appropriations matters liaison for aviation and \nweapons matters, Kevin has been an invaluable asset for the Secretary \nof the Navy and the Chief of Naval Operations, as well as a wealth of \nknowledge for my personal staff over the past 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  In addition to providing timely and accurate information on budget \nmatters and emerging war fighting requirements, CDR Brennan has \npersonally escorted my staff and the subcommittee professional staff on \nnumerous trips to review military operations and confirm the health and \nwelfare of our troops, on the front lines as well as when they return \nhome from action. He provided keen insight on matters of national \nsecurity and naval aviation's current readiness status, and the direct \nrelationship between the two. His perspective on the needs of the \nNation with respect to our sea service has provided me with the clarity \nand detail I needed to make important decisions regarding \nappropriations for the Department of Defense in pursuing the Nation's \nglobal war on terrorism.\n  In addition to the respect for the work Commander Brennan did in \nrepresenting the Navy, I would like to thank him for his congenial \ndemeanor and great sense of humor that he shared with all of us. It is \nhis same sense of purpose and professionalism that I am confident will \nenable him to be a tremendous role model for those who serve under his \ncommand.\n  It is my honor to recognize Commander Brennan for his distinguished \nservice to our Nation. My wife Lynda and I have the highest respect for \nthose who serve in uniform, and I appreciate and honor all the men and \nwomen who have served in the defense of freedom. Recalling our national \nanthem, to our veterans and Armed Forces, I say, we would not be ``the \nland of the free'' if we were not also `` the home of the brave.''\n\n[[Page S10972]]\n\n  In closing, I ask my fellow colleagues to join me in expressing our \ndeep appreciation for the numerous contributions Commander Brennan has \nmade on behalf of our Navy. We wish Kevin, his lovely wife Pamela and \ntheir four children continued success and the traditional naval wish of \n``Fair winds and following seas'' as he closes out his service to the \nCongress and continues toward the pinnacle of Naval service, command at \nsea!

Mr. President, today I join several of my colleagues in \nsupport of S. 1496, the Electronic Duck Stamp Act of 2005.\n  The Federal Duck Stamp Program has become one of the most popular and \nsuccessful conservation programs ever initiated. Enacted in 1934, the \nDuck Stamp Act requires every waterfowl hunter to purchase a duck stamp \nin order to legally hunt migratory waterfowl. Through the purchase of \nthe Federal duck stamp, sportsmen from across the country have \ncontributed billions of dollars annually to the economy. Nearly $2 \nbillion of this revenue has been used for wildlife conservation.\n  Times have changed and I believe it is time to modernize the way \nsportsmen buy duck stamps. The Electronic Duck Stamp Act will change \nthe way Montana sportsmen and hunters across the country purchase their \nduck stamp. This concept follows on the heels of other programs used by \nsportsmen to purchase their hunting licenses, permits, and conservation \nstamps through means of the Internet. The 24-hour access to purchase \nthese stamps will be especially useful in Montana and other States with \nrural communities. The e-duck stamp will be more cost effective and \nhunters will be able to forego a trip to town before heading to the \nfield.\n  The Electronic Duck Stamp Act requires the Secretary of the Interior \nconduct a 3-year pilot program under which, hopefully, Montana and 14 \nother States may issue the electronic stamps. The price for the stamp \nwill remain unchanged at $15. Stamps may be purchased over the phone or \nInternet giving sportsmen additional flexibility. Purchasers will \nreceive immediate access to a verification number which will allow them \nto legally hunt waterfowl. This number will then eventually be replaced \nby an actual paper stamp.\n  This will be a very popular program and will benefit many American \nmen and women who enjoy hunting waterfowl. I look forward to working \nwith my Senate colleagues to pass this piece of legislation for not \nonly my State of Montana but other States as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/04/senate-section/article/S10972-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ENTITLED ``CONTINUED PRODUCTION OF THE NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVES \n                     BEYOND APRIL 5, 2006''--PM 25\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with section 7422(c)(2) of title 10, United States Code, I \nam informing you of my decision to extend the period of production of \nthe Naval Petroleum Reserves for a period of 3 years from April 5, \n2006, the expiration date of the currently authorized period of \nproduction.\n  Attached is a copy of the report prepared by my Administration \ninvestigating the necessity of continued production of the reserves \nconsistent with section 7422(c)(2)(B) of title 10.

A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nprescribe the binding oath or affirmation of renunciation and \nallegiance required to be naturalized as a citizen of the United \nStates, to encourage and support the efforts of prospective citizens of \nthe United States to become citizens, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Senator Cornyn and I are introducing \nlegislation to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act. The \nlegislation would be called the Strengthening American Citizenship Act.\n  Over the next several weeks, this body will be engaged in a debate \nabout immigration reform. It is an essential debate which we must have \nin order to honor our commitment to the rule of law. I believe that \nreal immigration reform must encompass three important steps.\n  First, we must secure our borders. Senators Cornyn, Kyl, McCain, and \nKennedy have introduced differing legislation with that goal in mind.\n  Second, we need to create a legal status for foreign workers and \nforeign students who come here. Cornyn-Kyl and McCain-Kennedy also \naddress the question of workers. Later this month, I intend to \nintroduce legislation to ensure that our immigration system creates an \nappropriate legal status for and welcomes the more than 550,000 foreign \nstudents who study at our universities and who, incidentally, \ncontribute to our high standard of living by doing so.\n  But there is a third step to any real immigration reform. After we \nsecure our borders, after we create a legal status for foreigners who \nwork here and study here, the third indispensable step is to help \nprospective citizens become Americans. That is why today I am \nintroducing the Strengthening American Citizenship Act. I am pleased to \nbe joined by Senator Cornyn in this effort.\n  The Strengthening American Citizenship Act helps legal immigrants who \nare prospective American citizens to learn our common language, our \nhistory, and our way of Government in the following ways: First, \nproviding $500 grants for English courses; next, allowing prospective \ncitizens who become fluent in English, not just basic in English, but \nfluent in English, to apply for citizenship 1 year early; next, \nproviding for grants to organizations to provide courses in American \nhistory and civics; authorizing the creation of a new foundation to \nassist in those efforts; codifying the oath of allegiance to which new \ncitizens swear when they are naturalized; asking the Department of \nHomeland Security to carry out a strategy to highlight the moving \nceremonies in which immigrants become American citizens; and finally, \nestablishing an award to recognize the contributions of new citizens to \nour great Nation.\n  This bill is about fulfilling the promise of our national motto that \nis written right above you, Mr. President, on the Senate wall: ``E \nPluribus Unum,'' one from many. It is in the most visible place in the \nSenate Chamber. As a nation of immigrants, that motto--from many, one--\nis very important to us. While our unique history makes us a diverse \nnation, we are still one American Nation. How do we do that? How do we \nas Americans take all of the magnificent diversity that is the United \nStates and mold it into a single nation? We can be one nation because \nwe are united by principles expressed in our founding documents, such \nas liberty, democracy, and the rule of law, and not by our multiple \nancestries. We are united by our common language, English, and by our \nhistory of constantly struggling to reach the high ideals that we have \nset for ourselves as a nation.\n  Part of that American history is welcoming new immigrants to join our \nNation. We are unique in the world in our attitude toward welcoming \nothers. America is different because under our Constitution becoming an \nAmerican can have nothing to do with ancestry. That is because America \nis an idea, not a race. An American can technically become a citizen of \nJapan, in rare cases, but would never be considered Japanese. But if a \nJapanese person wants to become a citizen of the United States, he or \nshe must become an American.\n\n  Recently, I was privileged to witness as 99 immigrants from 46 \ndifferent countries became Americans. It was on a Constitution Day \nceremony. I have attended naturalization ceremonies in Nashville and \nacross my State many times in the past. It is a moving experience that \nI recommend to all of my colleagues.\n  This naturalization ceremony a few weeks ago was a special one held \nat the Jefferson Memorial. The same ceremonies are held in courthouses \nacross the country. I watched those 99 new\n\n[[Page S10975]]\n\nAmericans swear an oath of allegiance to this country. It is a powerful \noath where they renounce allegiance to their former country and swear \nallegiance to ours and to the Constitution. It is the oath we will \nfinally enshrine in law in this bill.\n  That oath is a part of our history. It dates back to the founding of \nour Nation almost 230 years ago. Those 99 new Americans who took that \noath at the Jefferson Memorial a few weeks ago were basically taking \nthe same oath George Washington gave to his soldiers in revolutionary \ntimes.\n  On May 12, 1778, as brave Americans were fighting for our freedom, \nGeorge Washington himself, and his general officers, signed a very \nsimilar oath as they were camped at Valley Forge. Let me read a part of \nWashington's oath. This is a copy of the oath Washington took. The \nArchivist of the United States brought it to me. There is Washington's \nown signature. We can imagine the circumstances and imagine the times. \nIt was in the early stages of the Revolutionary War. Things were not \ngoing very well. These soldiers were camped at Valley Forge and this \nwas the oath Washington himself took and that he gave to his officers \nand required them to sign.\n\n       I, George Washington, Commander in chief of the Armies of \n     the United States of America, do acknowledge the United \n     States of America, to be Free, Independent and Sovereign \n     States, and declare that the people thereof owe no allegiance \n     or obedience to George the Third, King of Great Britain; and \n     I renounce, refuse and abjure any allegiance or obedience to \n     him; and I do swear that I will to the utmost of my power, \n     support, maintain and defend the United States...\n\n  That is how George Washington and his officers swore allegiance to \nour country, and it has set the standard for American citizens from \nthat time forward. Every American should learn about that standard.\n  Since I was elected to this body in 2002, I have been working to \nensure that American children learn American history and civics. With \nthe help of Democratic leader Senator Reid and many other Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle, we passed legislation in December of 2003 to \nestablish residential academies for teachers and congressional \nacademies for students of American history and civics. Some are \nresidential academies to help teachers and outstanding students learn \nmore about these important subjects so they can pass it on to their \nstudents and classmates.\n  This year, I hope to pass a bill with Senator Kennedy to provide for \nimproved testing of American history so we can determine where history \nis being taught well and where it is being taught poorly so \nimprovements can be made. We also know that when testing is focused on \na specific subject, States and school districts are more likely to step \nup to the challenge and improve performance. So we are beginning to \nmake progress in reaching out to our children so that they understand \nwhat this country is all about.\n  There is another group of Americans we must also reach: New \nAmericans. Last week, there was a report in Florida of a 27-year-old \nGuatemalan man who posed as an 18-year-old so he could attend public \nhigh school and learn English there. So we know immigrants are eager to \nlearn our common language. That is why I, with Senator Cornyn, am \nintroducing this bill to help legal immigrants who are prospective \nAmerican citizens to learn our common language, our history, and our \nway of governing.\n  The Strengthening American Citizenship Act will, No. 1, provide \neducation grants up to $500 for English courses to immigrants who \ndeclare intent to become American citizens. They might use these grants \nto take a class from a local nonprofit organization or a community \ncollege. It would also allow citizenship applicants who speak fluent \nEnglish to meet the residency requirement after 4 years of living in \nthe United States, rather than 5.\n  Secondly, our legislation would help prospective citizens learn more \nabout the American way of life. It would do it in these two ways: One, \nestablishing a foundation to support the activities of the Office of \nCitizenship, which is within the Department of Homeland Security, so \nthat organizations that want to support and cooperate in efforts to \nreach out to prospective citizens can do so.\n  Second, it would provide for grants to organizations to provide \nclasses in American history and civics. While new citizens are required \nto demonstrate a knowledge of American history and government in a \ntest, helping them access a history or civics class will allow many to \ngain a richer understanding of our country and, by doing so, to feel \nmore at home in the United States.\n  The third major area this legislation covers would be to codify this \noath of allegiance which began with George Washington's oath at Valley \nForge. The oath today is written only in Federal regulations, not in \nthe law. This would give the oath the same standing as the Pledge of \nAllegiance and the national anthem.\n  Finally, we should celebrate our new citizens. Our legislation would \ninstruct the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop and implement a \nstrategy to raise public awareness of naturalization ceremonies. These \nceremonies, which happen virtually every day in the United States, \nembody what it means to become an American. Every U.S. citizen, not \njust those from foreign countries, ought to see one. It is my hope that \nmore of these ceremonies will be held in prominent locations and \ntelevised on C-SPAN.\n  We also would establish an award for citizens who have been \nnaturalized within the last ten years and have made an outstanding \ncontribution to the American nation. Our new citizens are often our \nbest citizens, and this bill would give the President this \nresponsibility so that we can recognize how new Americans play a \ncritical role in the progress of our country.\n  We are a nation of immigrants. Almost all of us can trace our \nancestry to some part of the globe quite far from here. Over the coming \nweeks this body will debate how to reform our immigration system. I \nbelieve comprehensive reform must include three things: No. 1, securing \nour borders; No. 2, creating a legal status for foreign workers and \nforeign students whom we welcome here; and, No. 3, helping prospective \ncitizens become Americans.\n  The Strengthening American Citizenship Act fulfills that third \nobjective. Comprehensive immigration reform must include efforts to \nhelp new Americans become a part of our national family.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 1816. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe manufacturing deduction provided by the American Jobs Creation Act \nof 2004 with respect to income attributable to domestic production \nactivities in Puerto Rico; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nbring equity and fairness to the manufacturing and production \nactivities in Puerto Rico. Earlier this Congress, my colleague from the \nHouse of Representatives, Delegate Luis Fortuno, introduced H.R. 2181 \nto extend section 199 to manufacturing and production activities in \nPuerto Rico.\n  In the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, we enacted section 199 \nthat provides a deduction for income attributable to certain \nmanufacturing activities. However, section 199 currently applies only \nto manufacturing and production activities in the U.S., and does not \nextend to Puerto Rico. This bill merely places the manufacturing and \nproduction activities in Puerto Rico on even footing with those \nconducted within the United States. It contains the additional \nsafeguard of assuring that the extension of this deduction is only \navailable where the income of the company is subject to immediate U.S. \ntax.\n  I have worked with my colleague in the House as he has perfected this \nlanguage to narrowly meet the needs of his constituents, and I am \npleased to be able to help him move this legislation forward in the \nSenate. I urge my colleagues to support this provision and bring \nfairness to the treatment of these important and vital economic \nactivities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeMINT:\n  S. 1817. A bill to suspend the Davis-Bacon Wage rate requirements for \nFederal contracts in areas declared national disasters; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, today I introduce the Cleanup and \nReconstruction Enhancement Act, CARE Act, legislation that would free \nthose trying to\n\n[[Page S10976]]\n\nrebuild after emergencies from burdensome regulations imposed by the \nDavis-Bacon Act.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Disaster \nPrevention and Prediction, I traveled to the gulf coast to see the \ndestruction caused by Hurricane Katrina. My heart went out to the \nvictims and their families, and my hope was to see the infrastructure \nthere restored as quickly as possible to avoid further destruction and \nloss of life. Unfortunately, Federal law places barriers on our efforts \nto respond to Hurricane Katrina quickly and efficiently.\n  The Inspector General at the U.S. Department of Labor concluded in a \nMay 2004 report that 84 percent of Davis-Bacon wage determination \nsurveys take more than a year and a half to complete, forcing emergency \nprojects to use outdated wage determinations and to suffer needless \ndelays. The Davis-Bacon Act also prohibits the use of entry-level \nworkers classified as ``helpers'' on federally funded projects, and \nartificially raises construction costs by up to 33 percent. \nFurthermore, the Davis-Bacon Act discourages many small businesses from \nbidding on public projects, because contractors who are unfamiliar with \nthe complex set of laws and regulations often choose not to participate \nin reconstruction efforts or end up being cited or sued for naively \nviolating laws.\n  For these reasons, Davis-Bacon regulations were suspended by \nExecutive Order 11 days after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast. \nKnowing what we know now, it is unconscionable for us to force victims \nof future disasters to suffer through any waiting period before we \nremove barriers to reconstruction. The CARE Act would automatically \ntrigger a year-long suspension of Davis-Bacon Act rules in all future \ndisaster sites that receive an emergency declaration from the \nPresident.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1817\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Cleanup and Reconstruction \n     Enhancement Act'' or ``CARE Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SUSPENSION OF DAVIS-BACON WAGE REQUIREMENTS IN \n                   NATIONAL DISASTER AREAS.\n\n       Section 3147 of title 40, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following: ``In any area that the \n     President determines to be a major disaster under section \n     102(2) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \n     Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5122(2)), the provisions \n     of this subchapter shall not apply for a period of 1 year \n     from the date on which the President makes such \n     determination.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/04/senate-section/article/S10976-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10976]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 264--EXPRESSING SYMPATHY FOR THE PEOPLE OF INDONESIA \nIN THE AFTERMATH OF THE DEADLY TERRORIST ATTACKS IN BALI ON OCTOBER 1, \n                                  2005\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. \nMartinez) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe manufacturing deduction provided by the American Jobs Creation Act \nof 2004 with respect to income attributable to domestic production \nactivities in any possession of the United States, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the manufacturing deduction provided by the \nAmerican Jobs Creation Act of 2004 does not include income from goods \nproduced in any possession of the United States. Today along with \nSenators Clinton and Schumer, I am introducing legislation which would \nallow the manufacturing deduction to include income attributable to \ndomestic production in possessions of the United States. This \nlegislation would make the manufacturing deduction available only for \nthe possession income of U.S. residents.\n  During the Senate Finance markup of the manufacturing deduction, I \noffered an amendment that would extend this deduction to income from \ngoods produced in the possessions of the United States. The amendment \nwas agreed to by the Finance Committee, but unfortunately the provision \nwas not included in the conference agreement. I do not know why the \nRepublican chaired conference committee removed this provision so \nimportant to the people of Puerto Rico and elsewhere.\n  Most United States businesses that operate in the possessions use the \npossessions tax credit or the Puerto Rican economic activities credits. \nIn 1996, Congress passed the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 \nwhich included a provision that phased-out the tax credits and \ncompletely repeals them beginning in 2006.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today would help the businesses \nthat are no longer able to benefit from these credits. More \nimportantly, this legislation provides an equitable solution. There is \nno reason why companies operating in the possessions should not receive \nthe same manufacturing deduction as companies operating in the mainland \nUnited States, Alaska, or Hawaii.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/04/senate-section/article/S10977-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10977]]\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1995.

Congress finds the following:\n       (1) An imminent emergency is confronting millions of low-\n     income individuals in the United States who are unable to \n     afford the cost of rising energy prices.\n       (2) Prior to the devastation caused by Hurricanes Katrina \n     and Rita in the Gulf Coast region of the United States, \n     individuals in the United States were facing record prices \n     for oil, natural gas, and propane. Hurricane Katrina damaged \n     platforms and ports and curtailed production at refineries in \n     the Gulf of Mexico, the source of almost \\1/3\\ of United \n     States oil output, further raising energy prices.\n       (3) The Short Term Energy Outlook report of the Energy \n     Information Administration of the Department of Energy states \n     that the ranges for expected heating fuel expenditure \n     increases for the winter heating season of 2005-2006 are--\n       (A) 69 percent to 77 percent for natural gas in the \n     Midwest;\n       (B) 17 percent to 18 percent for electricity in the South;\n       (C) 29 percent to 33 percent for heating oil in the \n     Northeast; and\n       (D) 39 percent to 43 percent for propane in the Midwest.\n       (4) According to the National Energy Assistance Directors \n     Association, heating costs for the average family using \n     heating oil are projected to hit $1,666 for the 2005-2006 \n     winter heating season. Those costs would represent an \n     increase of $403 over those costs for the 2004-2005 winter \n     heating season, and an increase of $714 over those costs for \n     the 2003-2004 winter heating season. For families using \n     natural gas, prices are projected to hit $1,568 for the 2005-\n     2006 winter heating season, representing an increase of $611 \n     over those costs for the 2004-2005 winter heating season, and \n     an increase of $643 over those costs for the 2003-2004 winter \n     heating season. States need additional funding immediately to \n     help low-income families and seniors to ensure that they can \n     afford to heat their homes.\n       (5) The Mortgage Bankers Association expects that steep \n     energy costs could increase the number of missed mortgage \n     payments and lost homes beginning later this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2034.

Women with disabilities are more likely to \n     be the victims of abuse and violence than women without \n     disabilities because of their increased physical, economic, \n     social, or psychological dependence on others.\n       [(9) Many women with disabilities also fail to report the \n     abuse, since they are dependent on their abusers and fear \n     being abandoned or institutionalized.\n       [(10) Of the 598 battered women's programs surveyed--\n       [(A) only 35 percent of these programs offered disability \n     awareness training for their staff; and\n       [(B) only 16 percent dedicated a staff member to provide \n     services to women with disabilities.\n       [(11) Problems of domestic violence are exacerbated for \n     immigrants when spouses control the immigration status of \n     their family members, and abusers use threats of refusal to \n     file immigration papers and threats to deport spouses and \n     children as powerful tools to prevent battered immigrant \n     women from seeking help, trapping battered immigrant women in \n     violent homes because of fear of deportation.\n       [(12) Battered immigrant women who attempt to flee abusive \n     relationships may not have access to bilingual shelters or \n     bilingual professionals, and face restrictions on public or \n     financial assistance. They may also lack assistance of a \n     certified interpreter in court, when reporting complaints to \n     the police or a 9-1-1 operator, or even in acquiring \n     information about their rights and the legal system.\n       [(13) More than 500 men and women call the National \n     Domestic Violence Hotline every day to get immediate, \n     informed, and confidential assistance to help deal with \n     family violence.\n       [(14) The National Domestic Violence Hotline service is \n     available, toll-free, 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, with \n     bilingual staff, access to translators in 150 languages, and \n     a TTY line for the hearing-impaired.\n       [(15) With access to over 5,000 shelters and service \n     providers across the United States, Puerto Rico, and the \n     United States Virgin Islands, the National Domestic Violence \n     Hotline provides crisis intervention and immediately connects \n     callers with sources of help in their local community.\n       [(16) Approximately 60 percent of the callers indicate that \n     calling the Hotline is their first attempt to address a \n     domestic violence situation and that they have not called the \n     police or any other support services.\n       [(17) Between 2000 and 2003, there was a 27 percent \n     increase in call volume at the National Domestic Violence \n     Hotline.\n       [(18) Improving technology infrastructure at the National \n     Domestic Violence Hotline and training advocates, volunteers, \n     and other staff on upgraded technology will drastically \n     increase the Hotline's ability to answer more calls quickly \n     and effectively.\n\n     [SEC. 202.

FINDINGS.\n\n       [Congress makes the following findings:\n       [(1) The health-related costs of intimate partner violence \n     in the United States exceed $5,800,000,000 annually.\n       [(2) Thirty-seven percent of all women who sought care in \n     hospital emergency rooms for violence-related injuries were \n     injured by a current or former spouse, boyfriend, or \n     girlfriend.\n       [(3) In addition to injuries sustained during violent \n     episodes, physical and psychological abuse is linked to a \n     number of adverse physical and mental health effects. Women \n     who have been abused are much more likely to suffer from \n     chronic pain, diabetes, depression, unintended pregnancies, \n     substance abuse and sexually transmitted infections, \n     including HIV/AIDS.\n       [(4) Health plans spend an average of $1,775 more a year on \n     abused women than on general enrollees.\n       [(5) Each year about 324,000 pregnant women in the United \n     States are battered by the men in their lives. This battering \n     leads to complications of pregnancy, including low weight \n     gain, anemia, infections, and first and second trimester \n     bleeding.\n       [(6) Pregnant and recently pregnant women are more likely \n     to be victims of homicide than to die of any other pregnancy-\n     related cause, and evidence exists that a significant \n     proportion of all female homicide victims are killed by their \n     intimate partners.\n       [(7) Children who witness domestic violence are more likely \n     to exhibit behavioral\n\n[[Page S11013]]\n\n     and physical health problems including depression, anxiety, \n     and violence towards peers. They are also more likely to \n     attempt suicide, abuse drugs and alcohol, run away from home, \n     engage in teenage prostitution, and commit sexual assault \n     crimes.\n       [(8) Recent research suggests that women experiencing \n     domestic violence significantly increase their safety-\n     promoting behaviors over the short- and long-term when health \n     care providers screen for, identify, and provide followup \n     care and information to address the violence.\n       [(9) Currently, only about 10 percent of primary care \n     physicians routinely screen for intimate partner abuse during \n     new patient visits and 9 percent routinely screen for \n     intimate partner abuse during periodic checkups.\n       [(10) Recent clinical studies have proven the effectiveness \n     of a 2-minute screening for early detection of abuse of \n     pregnant women. Additional longitudinal studies have tested a \n     10-minute intervention that was proven highly effective in \n     increasing the safety of pregnant abused women. Comparable \n     research does not yet exist to support the effectiveness of \n     screening men.\n       [(11) Seventy to 81 percent of the patients studied \n     reported that they would like their healthcare providers to \n     ask them privately about intimate partner violence.\n\n     [SEC. 502.

Among cities surveyed, 44 percent identified \n     domestic violence as a primary cause of homelessness.\n       [``(2) 92 percent of homeless women have experienced severe \n     physical or sexual abuse at some point in their lives. Of all \n     homeless women and children, 60 percent had been abused by \n     age 12, and 63 percent have been victims of intimate partner \n     violence as adults.\n       [``(3) Women and families across the country are being \n     discriminated against, denied access to, and even evicted \n     from public and subsidized housing because of their status as \n     victims of domestic violence.\n       [``(4) A recent survey of legal service providers around \n     the country found that these providers have responded to \n     almost 150 documented eviction cases in the last year alone \n     where the tenant was evicted because of the domestic violence \n     crimes committed against her. In addition, nearly 100 clients \n     were denied housing because of their status as victims of \n     domestic violence.\n       [``(5) Women who leave their abusers frequently lack \n     adequate emergency shelter options. The lack of adequate \n     emergency options for victims presents a serious threat to \n     their safety and the safety of their children. Requests for \n     emergency shelter by homeless women with children increased \n     by 78 percent of United States cities surveyed in 2004. In \n     the same year, 32 percent of the requests for shelter by \n     homeless families went unmet due to the lack of available \n     emergency shelter beds.\n       [``(6) The average stay at an emergency shelter is 60 days, \n     while the average length of time it takes a homeless family \n     to secure housing is 6 to 10 months.\n       [``(7) Victims of domestic violence often return to abusive \n     partners because they cannot find long-term housing.\n       [``(8) There are not enough Federal housing rent vouchers \n     available to accommodate the number of people in need of \n     long-term housing. Some people remain on the waiting list for \n     Federal housing rent vouchers for years, while some lists are \n     closed.\n       [``(9) Transitional housing resources and services provide \n     an essential continuum between emergency shelter provision \n     and independent living. A majority of women in transitional \n     housing programs stated that had these programs not existed, \n     they would have likely gone back to abusive partners.\n       [``(10) Because abusers frequently manipulate finances in \n     an effort to control their partners, victims often lack \n     steady income, credit history, landlord references, and a \n     current address, all of which are necessary to obtain long-\n     term permanent housing.\n       [``(11) Victims of domestic violence in rural areas face \n     additional barriers, challenges, and unique circumstances, \n     such as geographical isolation, poverty, lack of public \n     transportation systems, shortages of health care providers, \n     under-insurance or lack of health insurance, difficulty \n     ensuring confidentiality in small communities, and decreased \n     access to many resources (such as advanced education, job \n     opportunities, and adequate childcare).\n       [``(12) Congress and the Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development have recognized in recent years that families \n     experiencing domestic violence have unique needs that should \n     be addressed by those administering the Federal housing \n     programs.\n\n     [``SEC. 41402.

FINDINGS.\n\n       [``Congress makes the following findings:\n       [``(1) Violence against women is a leading cause of \n     physical injury to women. Such violence has a devastating \n     impact on women's physical and emotional health, financial \n     security, and ability to maintain their jobs, and thus \n     impacts interstate commerce.\n       [``(2) Studies indicate that one of the best predictors of \n     whether a victim of such violence will be able to stay away \n     from her abuser is her degree of economic independence. \n     However, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, \n     and stalking (referred to in this subtitle as `domestic or \n     sexual violence') often negatively impact victims' ability to \n     maintain employment.\n       [``(3) The Bureau of National Affairs has estimated that \n     domestic violence costs United States employers between \n     $3,000,000,000 and $5,000,000,000 annually in lost time and \n     productivity. Other reports have estimated that domestic \n     violence costs United States employers between $5,800,000,000 \n     and $13,000,000,000 annually.\n       [``(4) Ninety-four percent of corporate security and safety \n     directors at companies nationwide rank domestic violence as a \n     high security concern.\n       [``(5) Abusers frequently seek to exert financial control \n     over their partners by actively interfering with the ability \n     of their partners to work, including preventing their \n     partners from going to work, harassing their partners at \n     work, limiting the access of their partners to cash or \n     transportation, and sabotaging the child care arrangements of \n     their partners.\n       [``(6) Studies indicate that between 35 and 56 percent of \n     employed battered women surveyed were harassed at work by \n     their abusers.\n       [``(7) Victims of domestic violence also frequently miss \n     work due to injuries, court proceedings, and safety concerns \n     requiring legal protections.

The lack of anonymity and \n     accessible support services can limit opportunities for \n     justice for victims.\n       (6) Domestic elder abuse is primarily family abuse. The \n     National Elder Abuse Incidence Study found that the \n     perpetrator was a family member in 90 percent of cases.\n       (7) Barriers for older victims leaving abusive \n     relationships include--\n       (A) the inability to support themselves;\n       (B) poor health that increases their dependence on the \n     abuser;\n       (C) fear of being placed in a nursing home; and\n       (D) ineffective responses by domestic abuse programs and \n     law enforcement.\n       (8) Disabled women comprise another vulnerable population \n     with unmet needs. Women with disabilities are more likely to \n     be the victims of abuse and violence than women without \n     disabilities because of their increased physical, economic, \n     social, or psychological dependence on others.\n       (9) Many women with disabilities also fail to report the \n     abuse, since they are dependent on their abusers and fear \n     being abandoned or institutionalized.\n       (10) Of the 598 battered women's programs surveyed--\n       (A) only 35 percent of these programs offered disability \n     awareness training for their staff; and\n       (B) only 16 percent dedicated a staff member to provide \n     services to women with disabilities.\n       (11) Problems of domestic violence are exacerbated for \n     immigrants when spouses control the immigration status of \n     their family members, and abusers use threats of refusal to \n     file immigration papers and threats to deport spouses and \n     children as powerful tools to prevent battered immigrant \n     women from seeking help, trapping battered immigrant women in \n     violent homes because of fear of deportation.\n       (12) Battered immigrant women who attempt to flee abusive \n     relationships may not have access to bilingual shelters or \n     bilingual professionals, and face restrictions on public or \n     financial assistance. They may also lack assistance of a \n     certified interpreter in court, when reporting complaints to \n     the police or a 9-1-1 operator, or even in acquiring \n     information about their rights and the legal system.\n       (13) More than 500 men and women call the National Domestic \n     Violence Hotline every day to get immediate, informed, and \n     confidential assistance to help deal with family violence.\n       (14) The National Domestic Violence Hotline service is \n     available, toll-free, 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, with \n     bilingual staff, access to translators in 150 languages, and \n     a TTY line for the hearing-impaired.\n       (15) With access to over 5,000 shelters and service \n     providers across the United States, Puerto Rico, and the \n     United States Virgin Islands, the National Domestic Violence \n     Hotline provides crisis intervention and immediately connects \n     callers with sources of help in their local community.\n       (16) Approximately 60 percent of the callers indicate that \n     calling the Hotline is their first attempt to address a \n     domestic violence situation and that they have not called the \n     police or any other support services.\n       (17) Between 2000 and 2003, there was a 27 percent increase \n     in call volume at the National Domestic Violence Hotline.\n       (18) Improving technology infrastructure at the National \n     Domestic Violence Hotline and training advocates, volunteers, \n     and other staff on upgraded technology will drastically \n     increase the Hotline's ability to answer more calls quickly \n     and effectively.\n\n     SEC. 202.

They often do not have access to money, transportation, \n     or shelter services. They must overcome issues such as \n     distrust of adults, lack of knowledge about available \n     resources, or pressure from peers and parents.\n       (5) A needs assessment on teen relationship abuse for the \n     State of California, funded by the California Department of \n     Health Services, identified a desire for confidentiality and \n     confusion about the law as 2 of the most significant barriers \n     to young victims of domestic and dating violence seeking \n     help.\n       (6) Only one State specifically allows for minors to \n     petition the court for protection orders.\n       (7) Many youth are involved in dating relationships, and \n     these relationships can include the same kind of domestic \n     violence and dating violence seen in the adult population. In \n     fact, more than 40 percent of all incidents of domestic \n     violence involve people who are not married.\n       (8) 40 percent of girls ages 14 to 17 report knowing \n     someone their age who has been hit or beaten by a boyfriend, \n     and 13 percent of college women report being stalked.\n       (9) Of college women who said they had been the victims of \n     rape or attempted rape, 12.8 percent of completed rapes, 35 \n     percent of attempted rapes, and 22.9 percent of threatened \n     rapes took place on a date. Almost 60 percent of the \n     completed rapes that occurred on campus took place in the \n     victim's residence.\n       (10) According to a 3-year study of student-athletes at 10 \n     Division I universities, male athletes made up only 3.3 \n     percent of the general male university population, but they \n     accounted for 19 percent of the students reported for sexual \n     assault and 35 percent of domestic violence perpetrators.\n\n     SEC. 302.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The health-related costs of intimate partner violence \n     in the United States exceed $5,800,000,000 annually.\n       (2) Thirty-seven percent of all women who sought care in \n     hospital emergency rooms for violence-related injuries were \n     injured by a current or former spouse, boyfriend, or \n     girlfriend.\n       (3) In addition to injuries sustained during violent \n     episodes, physical and psychological abuse is linked to a \n     number of adverse physical and mental health effects. Women \n     who have been abused are much more likely to suffer from \n     chronic pain, diabetes, depression, unintended pregnancies, \n     substance abuse and sexually transmitted infections, \n     including HIV/AIDS.\n       (4) Health plans spend an average of $1,775 more a year on \n     abused women than on general enrollees.\n       (5) Each year about 324,000 pregnant women in the United \n     States are battered by the men in their lives. This battering \n     leads to complications of pregnancy, including low weight \n     gain, anemia, infections, and first and second trimester \n     bleeding.\n       (6) Pregnant and recently pregnant women are more likely to \n     be victims of homicide than to die of any other pregnancy-\n     related cause, and evidence exists that a significant \n     proportion of all female homicide victims are killed by their \n     intimate partners.\n       (7) Children who witness domestic violence are more likely \n     to exhibit behavioral and physical health problems including \n     depression, anxiety, and violence towards peers. They are \n     also more likely to attempt suicide, abuse drugs and alcohol, \n     run away from home, engage in teenage prostitution, and \n     commit sexual assault crimes.\n       (8) Recent research suggests that women experiencing \n     domestic violence significantly increase their safety-\n     promoting behaviors over the short- and long-term when health \n     care providers screen for, identify, and provide followup \n     care and information to address the violence.\n       (9) Currently, only about 10 percent of primary care \n     physicians routinely screen for intimate partner abuse during \n     new patient visits and 9 percent routinely screen for \n     intimate partner abuse during periodic checkups.\n       (10) Recent clinical studies have proven the effectiveness \n     of a 2-minute screening for early detection of abuse of \n     pregnant women. Additional longitudinal studies have tested a \n     10-minute intervention that was proven highly effective in \n     increasing the safety of pregnant abused women. Comparable \n     research does not yet exist to support the effectiveness of \n     screening men.\n       (11) Seventy to 81 percent of the patients studied reported \n     that they would like their healthcare providers to ask them \n     privately about intimate partner violence.\n\n     SEC. 502. PURPOSE.\n\n       It is the purpose of this title to improve the health care \n     system's response to domestic violence, dating violence, \n     sexual assault, and stalking through the training and \n     education of health care providers, developing comprehensive \n     public health responses to violence against women and \n     children, increasing the number of women properly screened, \n     identified, and treated for lifetime exposure to violence, \n     and expanding research on effective interventions in the \n     health care setting.\n\n     SEC. 503.

FINDINGS.\n\n       ``Congress finds that:\n       ``(1) There is a strong link between domestic violence and \n     homelessness. Among cities surveyed, 44 percent identified \n     domestic violence as a primary cause of homelessness.\n       ``(2) 92 percent of homeless women have experienced severe \n     physical or sexual abuse at some point in their lives. Of all \n     homeless women and children, 60 percent had been abused by \n     age 12, and 63 percent have been victims of intimate partner \n     violence as adults.\n       ``(3) Women and families across the country are being \n     discriminated against, denied access to, and even evicted \n     from public and subsidized housing because of their status as \n     victims of domestic violence.\n       ``(4) A recent survey of legal service providers around the \n     country found that these providers have responded to almost \n     150 documented eviction cases in the last year alone where \n     the tenant was evicted because of the domestic violence \n     crimes committed against her. In addition, nearly 100 clients \n     were denied housing because of their status as victims of \n     domestic violence.\n       ``(5) Women who leave their abusers frequently lack \n     adequate emergency shelter options. The lack of adequate \n     emergency options for victims presents a serious threat to \n     their safety and the safety of their children. Requests for \n     emergency shelter by homeless women with children increased \n     by 78 percent of United States cities surveyed in 2004. In \n     the same year, 32 percent of the requests for shelter by \n     homeless families went unmet due to the lack of available \n     emergency shelter beds.\n       ``(6) The average stay at an emergency shelter is 60 days, \n     while the average length of time it takes a homeless family \n     to secure housing is 6 to 10 months.\n       ``(7) Victims of domestic violence often return to abusive \n     partners because they cannot find long-term housing.\n       ``(8) There are not enough Federal housing rent vouchers \n     available to accommodate the number of people in need of \n     long-term housing. Some people remain on the waiting list for \n     Federal housing rent vouchers for years, while some lists are \n     closed.\n       ``(9) Transitional housing resources and services provide \n     an essential continuum between emergency shelter provision \n     and independent living. A majority of women in transitional \n     housing programs stated that had these programs not existed, \n     they would have likely gone back to abusive partners.\n       ``(10) Because abusers frequently manipulate finances in an \n     effort to control their partners, victims often lack steady \n     income, credit history, landlord references, and a current \n     address, all of which are necessary to obtain long-term \n     permanent housing.\n       ``(11) Victims of domestic violence in rural areas face \n     additional barriers, challenges, and unique circumstances, \n     such as geographical isolation, poverty, lack of public \n     transportation systems, shortages of health care providers, \n     under-insurance or lack of health insurance, difficulty \n     ensuring confidentiality in small communities, and decreased \n     access to many resources (such as advanced education, job \n     opportunities, and adequate childcare).\n       ``(12) Congress and the Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development have recognized in recent years that families \n     experiencing domestic violence have unique needs that should \n     be addressed by those administering the Federal housing \n     programs.\n\n     ``SEC. 41402.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is passing the \nViolence Against Women Act of 2005, VAWA. This act is the backbone of \nour country's fight against domestic violence and sexual assault, and \nits passage could not be more timely, as October is Domestic Violence \nAwareness Month.\n  Sadly, domestic violence remains one the most common violent crimes \nin the United States. In fact, the American Psychological Association \nestimates that one in three women will experience a physical assault by \nan intimate partner during adulthood. While Congress has taken steps to \ncurb domestic violence, significant progress must still be made to \nensure that women and children are safe in their homes.\n  I am from one of the fastest growing States in the Nation, and \nNevada's rapid growth poses a unique set of challenges in dealing with \nthe increasing levels of domestic and family violence; however, \nprogress is being made. According to the Violence Policy Center, Nevada \nranks second in the Nation for the number of murders of women by men. \nAlmost all of these women knew the perpetrator, and in most cases, it \nwas a husband or boyfriend. In 2004, domestic service providers in \nNevada aided more than 25,000 primary victims of domestic violence. \nThese services were made possible because of legislation such as VAWA.\n  Originally enacted in 1994, VAWA was the beginning of a national \ncommitment to the victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. We \ncontinued the commitment in 2000 with the first reauthorization of VAWA \nwhich added much needed provisions for victims of rape, violence on \ncollege campuses, elder abuse, stalking, legal assistance in civil \ncases, and transitional housing for victims. I am pleased that the 2005 \nreauthorization of VAWA will address the needs of immigrants, Native \nAmericans, children, and youth. Since the act's original passage, our \ncommitment has yielded extraordinary progress nationwide. Domestic \nviolence has dropped by almost 50 percent. Incidents of rape are down \nby 60 percent. The number of women killed by an abusive husband or \nboyfriend is down by 22 percent, and more than half of all rape victims \nare stepping forward to report the crime. Additionally, over a million \nwomen have found justice in our courtrooms and obtained domestic \nviolence protective orders.\n  I must, however, make clear my dismay at the last-minute inclusion of \na controversial and ill-advised amendment to this legislation allowing \nfor the collection of DNA evidence from\n\n[[Page S11055]]\n\npeople who are arrested or detained. I believe authorizing the \ncollection of DNA evidence without probable cause is an invitation to \nracial profiling, infringes on privacy rights, and may well be \nunconstitutional. This provision has no place in this important \nlegislation, and I would urge in the strongest terms that it be removed \nin conference.\n  Despite the incredible strides made to end domestic violence, there \nis still much work to be done. We cannot lose sight of the horror which \nso many victims experience every day, but which rarely appears on \nnetwork news. Domestic Violence Awareness Month is an opportunity to \nraise that awareness. It is especially important to recognize the \ntragedy that is domestic violence in the aftermath of Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita. Many domestic violence shelters and rape crisis \ncenters in the gulf coast region were destroyed by these storms. For \nthis reason, I worked to obtain an additional $9 million in the \nSenate's Justice Department appropriations bill. It is my hope that \nthese funds will be included in conference and will not only rebuild \nthe damaged facilities but will aid the coalitions that work every day \nto end domestic and sexual violence and will prove our commitment to \ntheir cause.\n  This legislation addresses the housing crisis that currently exists \nfor victims fleeing their homes, provides more economic stability for \nvictims by taking measures to improve their employment, and creates \ninitiatives to educate and prevent domestic violence from occurring in \nthe first place. The Senate's unanimous passage today of VAWA 2005 \ndemonstrates the Senate's commitment to this important quest.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, because the Violence Against Women Act \nauthorization expires today, it is necessary that we pass legislation \nto reauthorize this bill immediately. As a result, the Senate does not \nhave an opportunity to debate and vote on all the amendments that \nSenators may wish to offer to this bill.\n  One such amendment that the Senator from Oklahoma, Dr. Coburn, had \nintended to offer would address the issue of HIV and sexual assault and \nseek greater testing for HIV disease among sexual assault defendants.\n  I would ask the Senator from Oklahoma, who is a practicing physician, \nto comment on the merits of this proposal and why it is so important.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Biden and all those who \nhave worked hard on this bill. I have a few comments on my amendment \nabout protecting victims of rape and sexual assault from being further \nvictimized by HIV/AIDS.\n  As a practicing physician, I am deeply concerned about both the \nphysical and emotional well-being of those who have been traumatized by \nrape and sexual assault. That is why I believe that it is necessary for \nthe reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act to include timely \nHIV tests of those accused of rape and sexual assault.\n  There are countless stories of women and children who have been \nvictims of rape and sexual assault who have been denied access to this \npotentially life-saving information. In some circumstances, rape \ndefendants have even used HIV status information as a plea bargaining \ntool to reduce their sentences.\n  Let me explain why this is important.\n  Treatment with AIDS drugs immediately following exposure to HIV can \nsignificantly reduce the chance of infection. However, because of the \ntoxicity and long-term side effects, these drugs should not be \nadministered without first knowing if HIV exposure has occurred. \nVictims cannot rely solely on testing themselves because it can take \nweeks, sometimes months, before HIV antibodies can be detected, \nTherefore, testing the assailant is the only timely manner in which to \ndetermine if someone has been exposed to HIV.\n  The American Medical Association, AMA, supports this policy because \n``early knowledge that a defendant is HIV infected would allow the \nvictim to gain access to the ever growing arsenal of new HIV treatment \noptions. In addition, knowing that the defendant was HIV infected would \nhelp the victim avoid contact which might put others at risk of \ninfection.''\n  In addition to the AMA, groups such as the Children's AIDS Fund and \nWomen Against Violence support this policy.\n  The Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1994 already allows victims to \nrequest a court order to have alleged perpetrators tested for HIV only \nin Federal assault cases. In October 2000, the House of Representatives \noverwhelmingly approved a bill, 380 to 19, that would have provided \nthis right and protection to all those who were the victims of sexual \nassault, but, unfortunately, the Senate never took up this bill. But \nnow is our chance.\n  It would be a cruel hoax if the Senate approved the Violence Against \nWomen Act of 2005 without including this amendment that ensures those \nwomen who have already been victimized by sexual assault are not \nfurther victimized by our legal system and HIV/AIDS.\n  I propose an amendment that would reduce the overall amount of \nfunding under this act for a State or local government by 10 percent \nunless the State or local government demonstrates that with respect to \na defendant against whom an information or indictment is presented for \na crime in which by force or threat of force the perpetrator compels \nthe victim to engage in sexual activity, that the defendant be tested \nfor HIV disease if the nature of the alleged crime is such that the \nsexual activity would have placed the victim at risk of becoming \ninfected with HIV; and the victim requests that the defendant be so \ntested. The defendant must undergo the test not later than 48 hours \nafter the date on which the information or indictment is presented, and \nthat as soon thereafter as is practicable the results of the test are \nmade available to the victim.\n  My initiative would not force States to provide this protection, but \nsimply reward those States that do. This right, in fact, already exists \nin some States but too many women and children are still denied this \ninformation that could literally be the difference between life and \ndeath.\n  Do I understand from the Senator from Delaware that constitutional \nlanguage, ensuring that indicted perpetrators of sexual assault, who \nhave placed the victim at risk of becoming infected with HIV disease, \nare tested for HIV disease, will be included in the final legislative \nlanguage agreed upon by the House and Senate conference?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Senator for his commitment to include \nlanguage in the final reauthorization and for his commitment to reduce \nviolence and protect those who are the victims of sexual assault.\n  I would also like to recognize the tireless efforts of Deidre Raver \nof New York who was raped at the age of 19 and has been an effective \nand compassionate advocate for other survivors of sexual assault. \nEarlier this month, DNA evidence linked a man on death row in \nCalifornia to the 1988 murder of Deidre's sister, Rachel. My thoughts \nand prayers are with Deidre and her family at this time and I am \nhopeful that this discovery will finally bring some closure to her \nfamily's long ordeal.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nat the desk be agreed to, the committee-reported substitute, as \namended, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee \non Banking be discharged from further consideration of S. 392 and the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n\n[[Page S11056]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 392) to authorize the President to award a gold \n     medal on behalf of Congress, collectively, to the Tuskegee \n     Airmen in recognition of their unique military record, which \n     inspired revolutionary reform in the Armed Forces.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be read a \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand any statements relating to the measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 392) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 392\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt overruled his \n     top generals and ordered the creation of an all Black flight \n     training program. President Roosevelt took this action one \n     day after the NAACP filed suit on behalf of Howard University \n     student Yancy Williams and others in Federal court to force \n     the Department of War to accept Black pilot trainees. Yancy \n     Williams had a civilian pilot's license and had earned an \n     engineering degree. Years later, Major Yancy Williams \n     participated in an air surveillance project created by \n     President Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n       (2) Due to the rigid system of racial segregation that \n     prevailed in the United States during World War II, Black \n     military pilots were trained at a separate airfield built \n     near Tuskegee, Alabama. They became known as the ``Tuskegee \n     Airmen''.\n       (3) The Tuskegee Airmen inspired revolutionary reform in \n     the Armed Forces, paving the way for full racial integration \n     in the Armed Forces. They overcame the enormous challenges of \n     prejudice and discrimination, succeeding, despite obstacles \n     that threatened failure.\n       (4) From all accounts, the training of the Tuskegee Airmen \n     was an experiment established to prove that so-called \n     ``coloreds'' were incapable of operating expensive and \n     complex combat aircraft. Studies commissioned by the Army War \n     College between 1924 and 1939 concluded that Blacks were \n     unfit for leadership roles and incapable of aviation. \n     Instead, the Tuskegee Airmen excelled.\n       (5) Overall, some 992 Black pilots graduated from the pilot \n     training program of the Tuskegee Army Air Field, with the \n     last class finishing in June 1946, 450 of whom served in \n     combat. The first class of cadets began in July 1941 with 13 \n     airmen, all of whom had college degrees, some with Ph.D.'s, \n     and all of whom had pilot's licenses. One of the graduates \n     was Captain Benjamin O. Davis Jr., a United States Military \n     Academy graduate. Four aviation cadets were commissioned as \n     second lieutenants, and 5 received Army Air Corps silver \n     pilot wings.\n       (6) That the experiment achieved success rather than the \n     expected failure is further evidenced by the eventual \n     promotion of 3 of these pioneers through the commissioned \n     officer ranks to flag rank, including the late General \n     Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., United States Air Force, the late \n     General Daniel ``Chappie'' James, United States Air Force, \n     our Nation's first Black 4-star general, and Major General \n     Lucius Theus, United States Air Force (retired).\n       (7) Four hundred fifty Black fighter pilots under the \n     command of then Colonel Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., fought in \n     World War II aerial battles over North Africa, Sicily, and \n     Europe, flying, in succession, P-40, P-39, P-47, and P-51 \n     aircraft. These gallant men flew 15,553 sorties and 1,578 \n     missions with the 12th Tactical Air Force and the 15th \n     Strategic Air Force.\n       (8) Colonel Davis later became the first Black flag officer \n     of the United States Air Force, retired as a 3-star general, \n     and was honored with a 4th star in retirement by President \n     William J. Clinton.\n       (9) German pilots, who both feared and respected the \n     Tuskegee Airmen, called them the ``Schwartze Vogelmenshen'' \n     (or ``Black Birdmen''). White American bomber crews \n     reverently referred to them as the ``Black Redtail Angels'', \n     because of the bright red painted on the tail assemblies of \n     their fighter aircraft and because of their reputation for \n     not losing bombers to enemy fighters as they provided close \n     escort for bombing missions over strategic targets in Europe.\n       (10) The 99th Fighter Squadron, after having distinguished \n     itself over North Africa, Sicily, and Italy, joined 3 other \n     Black squadrons, the 100th, the 301st, and the 302nd, \n     designated as the 332nd Fighter Group. They then comprised \n     the largest fighter unit in the 15th Air Force. From Italian \n     bases, they destroyed many enemy targets on the ground and at \n     sea, including a German destroyer in strafing attacks, and \n     they destroyed numerous enemy aircraft in the air and on the \n     ground.\n       (11) Sixty-six of these pilots were killed in combat, while \n     another 32 were either forced down or shot down and captured \n     to become prisoners of war. These Black airmen came home with \n     150 Distinguished Flying Crosses, Bronze Stars, Silver Stars, \n     and Legions of Merit, one Presidential Unit Citation, and the \n     Red Star of Yugoslavia.\n       (12) Other Black pilots, navigators, bombardiers and \n     crewman who were trained for medium bombardment duty as the \n     477th Bomber Group (Medium) were joined by veterans of the \n     332nd Fighter Group to form the 477th Composite Group, flying \n     the B-25 and P-47 aircraft. The demands of the members of the \n     477th Composite Group for parity in treatment and for \n     recognition as competent military professionals, combined \n     with the magnificent wartime records of the 99th Fighter \n     Squadron and the 332nd Fighter Group, led to a review of the \n     racial policies of the Department of War.\n       (13) In September 1947, the United States Air Force, as a \n     separate service, reactivated the 332d Fighter Group under \n     the Tactical Air command. Members of the 332d Fighter Group \n     were ``Top Guns'' in the 1st annual Air Force Gunnery Meet in \n     1949.\n       (14) For every Black pilot there were 12 other civilian or \n     military Black men and women performing ground support \n     duties. Many of these men and women remained in the military \n     service during the post-World War II era and spearheaded the \n     integration of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n       (15) Major achievements are attributed to many of those who \n     returned to civilian life and earned leadership positions and \n     respect as businessmen, corporate executives, religious \n     leaders, lawyers, doctors, educators, bankers, and political \n     leaders.\n       (16) A period of nearly 30 years of anonymity for the \n     Tuskegee Airmen was ended in 1972 with the founding of \n     Tuskegee Airmen, Inc., in Detroit, Michigan. Organized as a \n     non-military and nonprofit entity, Tuskegee Airmen, Inc., \n     exists primarily to motivate and inspire young Americans to \n     become participants in our Nation's society and its \n     democratic process, and to preserve the history of their \n     legacy.\n       (17) The Tuskegee Airmen have several memorials in place to \n     perpetuate the memory of who they were and what they \n     accomplished, including--\n       (A) the Tuskegee Airmen, Inc., National Scholarship Fund \n     for high school seniors who excel in mathematics, but need \n     financial assistance to begin a college program;\n       (B) a museum in historic Fort Wayne in Detroit, Michigan;\n       (C) Memorial Park at the Air Force Museum at Wright-\n     Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio;\n       (D) a statue of a Tuskegee Airman in the Honor Park at the \n     United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, \n     Colorado; and\n       (E) a National Historic Site at Moton Field, where primary \n     flight training was performed under contract with the \n     Tuskegee Institute.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The President is authorized \n     to award to the Tuskegee Airmen, on behalf of Congress, a \n     gold medal of appropriate design honoring the Tuskegee Airmen \n     in recognition of their unique military record, which \n     inspired revolutionary reform in the Armed Forces.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') \n     shall strike a gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and \n     inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n       Under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the \n     Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the \n     gold medal struck under section 2, at a price sufficient to \n     cover the costs of the medals, including labor, materials, \n     dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses.\n\n     SEC. 4. NATIONAL MEDALS.\n\n       Medals struck pursuant to this Act are national medals for \n     purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 5.
