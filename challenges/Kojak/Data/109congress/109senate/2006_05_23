Mr. President, last week and up to our vote yesterday \nhas been, I think, a very productive week for the Senate. We had 17 \nrollcall votes: 11 by Republicans, 6 by Democrats. We had 8 voice votes \nevenly divided: 4 by Democrats, and 4 by Republicans. We moved through \nsome very contentious issues. I think the debate was of a high caliber.\n  I thank the Democratic leader, who is on the floor of the Senate, for \nhis cooperation, and I thank all Senators for their cooperation and I \nam looking forward to similar activity. I think we are poised to \ncomplete action on this bill this week as contemplated.\n  We have maintained a delicate perhaps even tenuous coalition in \nsupport of the bill reported by the Judiciary Committee as we have \nworked through the underlying contentious issue as to how to handle 11 \nmillion undocumented immigrants with a view not to creating a fugitive \nclass of Americans, remembering our roots as a nation, that we are a \nnation of immigrants, and recognizing the contribution which the \nundocumented immigrants, although here illegally, the contribution \nwhich they make to our economy.\n  We have faced a significant resistance to the bill on the ground that \nit constitutes amnesty. As I have contended before, it is not amnesty. \nWe can't repeat that too often to remind people that amnesty is when \nyou forgive transgression or forgive a wrong or forgive a crime. The \nundocumented immigrants will have to pay a fine. They will have to pay \nback taxes. They will have to go through criminal background checks. \nThey will have to learn English. They will have to hold a job for a \nprotracted period of time. And the reality is that they will earn their \ncitizenship.\n  We have worked through some difficult amendments. Some could have \ngone either way without destroying the delicate coalition, and others \nwould have perhaps been killer amendments which would have fractured \nthe bill, which has not happened.\n  For those who are opposed to the bill or want to limit immigrants, \nthe Bingaman amendment reduced the number of future guest workers from \n350,000 to 200,000.\n\n  We had a very spirited and contentious debate on an amendment by \nSenators Cornyn and Kyl which would have precluded H-2C guest workers \nto self-petition. Then Senator Kennedy\n\n[[Page S4924]]\n\ncame back with a modification which opened up self-petitions which, in \nmy view, is indispensable if we are not to put the immigrants at the \nmercy of the employer and provide the background for unfair treatment \nby employers to hang the sword of Damocles over the heads of the \nundocumented immigrants.\n  We had a very spirited debate on what to do about English, whether it \nis the national language or the common and unifying language or how to \ncategorize it.\n  In my view, there was not a great deal of difference between the \namendments offered by Senator Inhofe and Senator Salazar. We do know \nthat we are looking for English to be a unifying factor. There is in \nthe law today a series of procedures where other languages are printed \nfor balance in a variety of contexts, but I think ultimately we will \nwork that through on a satisfactory basis.\n  There was an amendment by Senator Kyl to strike the provisions that \nthe green card by H-2C workers would be a path to citizenship. That was \na very important amendment not to adopt but to keep that path open \nconsistent with the remainder of the bill.\n  The amendment to allow undocumented immigrants to receive credit for \nSocial Security even though those payments were made during the time of \nillegal status, I think, was decided properly, although a close vote, \n50 to 49. So that survived.\n  Yesterday, we rejected the amendment offered by Senator Chambliss on \na very complicated matter as to how we deal with the prevailing wage or \nadverse effect, and I think we are moving forward.\n  The amendment by the distinguished Senator from California is now on \nthe floor. There is a great deal to recommend in favor of it, in a \nsense, because it would open up more generously the path to \ncitizenship. But I believe if it were to be adopted it would fracture \nthe very tenuous and delicate coalition which we have on this bill.\n  I compliment the Senator from California for her work on this bill. \nShe has been a major contributor in the Judiciary Committee generally, \nand she brought forward the agriculture provisions which have been \nadopted. She is an effective fighter and, as always, the presenter of \nimportant and constructive ideas.\n  I am constrained to oppose the amendment because I think if we were \nto allow everybody who has been in this country since January 1, we \nwill destroy the coalition, and we have made a distinction for those \nhere longer than 5 years from those here 2 to 5 years on a principle \nbasis--that those who are here longer and who have roots ought to be \naccorded greater consideration. We have drawn a line on January 7, \n2004, because that was the date the President made a speech on \nimmigration and people who came to the United States in illegal status \nafter that date were on notice, you might say, maybe constructive \nnotice, if they didn't know about it exactly, but they were on notice \nthat they would not be accorded the same status as those who have been \nhere earlier. We have used that as a cutoff date.\n  My view is that we are working on legislation which is of great \nimportance to our country. We face a real test as to whether we will \nretain our principle of a welcoming nation to immigrants who earned \ntheir status to become citizens.\n  I think we have worked through the Judiciary Committee where we had a \nvery difficult markup, and one marathon session to meet the timetable \nestablished by the majority leader.\n  The bill has been vigorously debated on both sides. I think there has \nbeen some concession of significance from the votes to those who are \nopposed to having an expansive view of guest workers and an expansive \nview according to immigrant status to move toward citizenship.\n  We have a great deal more work to do. I am confident, or optimistic \nor perhaps even hopeful that we will pass this bill in the Senate, and \nthen we will look forward to the conference with the House of \nRepresentatives which has evidenced a very different view. But we have \nworked through with the House, with Chairman Sensenbrenner, difficult \nissues on the PATRIOT Act and other matters, and our bicameral system \nhas worked for America. We will move ahead to forge legislation which \nis principled but recognizing that there are different points of view, \nand accommodating as many views as we can. Where there is a basic \ndisagreement, we vote to express the will of the body.\n  I have spoken a little longer than usual, but I wanted to summarize \nwhere we are on the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/23/senate-section/article/S4924-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4924-S4936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM ACT OF 2006\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I thank the President. I also want to thank the \nchairman of the committee. He has been a very good chairman.

Mr. President, let me state why I think the Hagel-\nMartinez compromise is not workable. The Hagel-Martinez compromise \nessentially creates three tiers of people in this country in \nundocumented or illegal status. The first is 6.7 million who have been \nhere more than 5 years; the second is 1.6 million who have been here \nless than 2 years; and the third is 2.8 million who have been here from \n2 to 5 years. People here less than 2 years are subject to immediate \ndeportation. Someone has to find them, go into their workplace or their \nhomes, pick them up, and deport them. Then one has to consider the \nlikelihood that in about 3 days, which is often the case in California, \nthey will come back to their families and their job.\n  The second is the 2.8 million who must leave, touch back, get in a \nguest worker program or some other visa program, come back, be in this \ncountry, and then, after a period of time, get an employer to sponsor \nthem for a green card or leave. They have a kind of mandatory \ndeparture. The guest worker program they would be eligible for is the \nH-2C program, which we reduced in size from 325,000 to 200,000 in an \nearlier amendment. The cap of the program is removed for them. \nTherefore, what is created for this group is a 3 million-person guest \nworker program, but they cannot earn a path to legalization unless they \nhave an employer who will petition for them. They are limited in the \ntime they can stay in the country, and they must return.\n  My sense, based on the reality of the largest immigration State in \nthe Union, is that these two tiers in Hagel-Martinez simply will not \nwork. We will have large-scale fraud. The people here slightly less \nthan 2 years will present fraudulent documents to show they have been \nhere for at least 2 years. That is what happens now. There is a wide \nmarket in fraudulent documents for the undocumented. And those here \nless than 5 years will shortly realize that when they have to go back \nthey face a precarious situation of whether they can come back legally. \nIf they can't come back legally, I hazard a guess they will come back \nand find a way to come back illegally. That is a major problem.\n  What we have tried to do is create a program, based on McCain-\nKennedy, and to an extent on Hagel-Martinez, saying let's be realistic, \nlet's understand what the situation is, that there is no way it is good \nto create another illegal class of up to 4.4 million people. It does \nnot make sense to spend the time trying to seek out people living \nclandestinely.\n  It is much better to create the process for earned legalization which \nhas some meaning and substance, and tests that individuals must pass. \nSo we have created a three-step test for something we would call an \norange card. That orange card is like this chart. I picked a\n\n[[Page S4929]]\n\ncolor that had no political connotation. This is a biometric card. It \nhas the personal identifiers. It has the photo. It has the \nfingerprints. It has a number. Once someone has the orange card, that \nnumber, essentially, places them in a line. The line would begin with \nthose people here the longest. They have the lowest numbers. Therefore, \nwhen the current green card line of 3.3 million people is expunged--\nestimated to take 6 to 11 years--the people here the longest in the \nundocumented status are the first to receive their green card.\n  In the meantime, this would be the identifier. It is biometric. It \nenables an individual to move in and out of the country, and the \nindividual reports electronically every year with their work history. \nThey will pay a $50 processing fee. They will pay a total $2,000 fine \nby the time they reach green card status. They will show they are \ntrying to learn English. They will present their work history. To me, \nit makes better sense because it is able to be managed.\n  The Hagel-Martinez amendment is not able to be managed \nelectronically. Therefore, we have 4.4 million people, plus the \nremainder of the 10 to 12 million people that you have to handle. It is \nextraordinarily complicated and difficult to do that.\n  The system was created with good intentions, but I don't believe it \nis workable. I believe it is subject to fraud. I believe the most \ndifficult part of it is the guest worker part for those who have been \nhere 2 to 5 years. Under Hagel-Martinez, if you are here for 4 years \nand 9 months, you are 3 months shy of earning legalization. These 3 \nmonths cost you the ability to get on a clear path to legalization. \nWith those stakes and no formal documentation that proves when you \ncross the border, it is only logical to assume that people are going to \ntry to falsify dates in order to qualify for the higher tier. This \nbecomes the bureaucratic nightmare.\n  Then there is the problem for the 2-to 5-year person, of returning to \ntheir own country, getting into a legal program and coming back. I \npointed out this makes the guest worker program 3 million people \nbecause the 200,000 cap is waived, and therefore the 2.8 million come \ninto that program. That is way too many guest workers for any one time.\n  Then there is the mandatory departure part of the guest worker \nprogram, which essentially says an individual, once in the country, can \nonly be here for 6 years and then must return to their own country \nunless an employer will sponsor them for a green card. This in itself \nmight appear to be a good thing, but I want to spend a minute on it. \nYou are dependent on your employer for your legal status after that \npoint. This is a huge burden for an employer to bear. It also means \nthat for some employers that may not be good employers, they have a \nmethod to exploit an individual by threatening that, unless they do \ncertain things, they will not recommend them for the earned \nlegalization program and for their green card.\n  We know exploitation does happen. I believe the best step is clearly \nto put forward a process for everyone in this country, a process that \nallows you to electronically submit your data, fingerprints, photo, and \nwork history. That is then verified. You then come in. If the \nverification of your criminal history is adequate, if you pay the fine, \nand if you are willing to sign up for the orange card, then you receive \nit. Therefore, you have your biometric identifier, and you can be \ntracked, if necessary. You are free to leave the country and come back. \nIt is a much sounder path to legalization.\n\n  I hope this will be the program that eventually is accepted.\n  I now yield time to the Senator from Iowa, my distinguished \ncolleague, Mr. Harkin. I believe he has asked for 5 minutes, or such \ntime as he may consume.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Up to 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I commend and compliment my distinguished colleague from \nCalifornia for presenting this amendment.\n  I wonder if I might engage in a little colloquy with the author of \nthis amendment. I am proud to join her as a cosponsor because this is \nthe way we have to go.\n  I was interested in the pie chart that showed the 4.4 million, if I \nadded it correctly, the people here less than 2 years and those here 2 \nyears to 5 years. All of those people have to leave the country?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Under Hagel-Martinez?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Some will leave and can't come back and some will \npetition to come back?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask my friend, how are they going to deal with \nfamilies? Many of these people who have been here 2 to 5 years, maybe \nsome less than 2 years, may have gotten married, maybe they brought \ntheir spouse along with them, and there are children. I have come \nacross some myself. What will happen to these children who have been \nborn here who are American citizens?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is exactly the point. It is a theoretical plan.\n  For those who live in big immigration States, who live this problem \ndaily, who see the people and their families--many have bought homes, \npay taxes, their children are born here and go to school here--it \ncreates a dynamic which puts the Federal Government again in the place \nof having to find and deport 1.6 million people; and then if the 2.8 \nmillion don't follow the mandatory departure section of the program, \nthey are subject to deportation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I could pursue that a minute longer, again, \ncontemplating the breakup of families, I ask my friend from California, \nwouldn't that also then make it even more difficult, harder or less \nlikely that these people would come forward. If they know their \nfamilies may be split up or they might have to leave their children \nbehind and in the care of someone else, why would they come forward?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The Senator is exactly right. The dynamic to add to \nthat is, you create a work differential because these people will \ncontinue to be clandestine, embedded in the cultures of our country, \nand find ways to work, and employers, as they have in the past, will \nhire them. Then we will be faced with carrying out a program that has \nnever worked and that is employer-sanctioned.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleague from California for offering this \namendment.\n  Quite frankly, the amendment offered by Senator Feinstein is the only \nway I see that we can get out of the mess we are in, so to speak, with \nall of the undocumented people here, in a way that is pro-family, pro-\nworker, pro-American, pro-national security.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from California meets all of \nthose requirements. It will cost a heck of a lot less, just in terms of \ndollars.\n  While I respect the efforts by Senators Hagel and Martinez and others \nto craft some sort of compromise, the fact is the Hagel-Martinez bill \nwill be difficult, costly to implement, will tend to separate families \nand will not be in the best interests of our country.\n  Quite frankly, as the Senator from California just pointed out, we do \nnot even know if it is workable. How are you going to find these \npeople? As the Senator so aptly pointed out, people who have been here \njust shy of 2 years, by a month, aren't they going to find some \ndocumentation, forging rent receipts, and things like that, to make it \nseem as though they have been here at least 2 years? And those who have \nbeen here 3 to 5 years, won't the same thing happen there also?\n  The Hagel-Martinez compromise is totally unworkable. By contrast, the \napproach taken by Senator Feinstein to create a new kind of an orange \ncard--because this is a unique group of people--this orange card is \nrealistic, and it is enforceable, and it is fair. It would require \nundocumented immigrants, as the Senator said, to register immediately \nwith the Department of Homeland Security. Once they have passed a \ncriminal and national security background check, they could apply for \nan orange card.\n  As the Senator said, they would have to pay a $2,000 fine, any back \ntaxes owed, learn English and American civics, and pass extensive \ncriminal and security background checks. Then, after working for at \nleast 6 years, orange card holders could apply for legal permanent \nresidence, but, again, as the\n\n[[Page S4930]]\n\nSenator pointed out, they would have to get in back of all the green \ncard holders who are existent right now. So, again, this is a tough \napproach, but it is workable. It will work. It is fair. And, as I said, \nit will cost a lot less money and a lot less manpower to implement.\n  I think, as the Senator from California said, we just have to deal \nwith reality, what is real. Twelve million undocumented immigrants, \nmany who have lived here for many years, have children, family members \nwho are U.S. citizens. They are working. They are contributing to \nsociety. They may be undocumented. They may be living in the shadows. \nBut, make no mistake about it, they are de facto members of the \nAmerican economy and the American society. They are integrated into the \nfabric of our national life. They are filling jobs that in many cases \nwould otherwise go unfilled.\n  In essence, they are a part of our American family. And they are not \ngoing away. In fact, we would face huge problems if they did. Just last \nweek, I say to my friend from California, a delegation from the \nMarshalltown, IA, Chamber of Commerce was in town. Several of them \npointed out that immigrants play an indispensable role in the \nMarshalltown economy. As one put it: If you rounded up and kicked out \nall the immigrants, our city's economy would come to a screeching halt.\n  I say to my friend from California, I was in Denison, IA, on Friday. \nThere is a Job Corps center there. It is a small-town community in \nwestern Iowa. They have a couple meatpacking plants there. So we have a \nlot of Latinos who come in from Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, \nGuatemala, places like that. The mayor took me aside and he said: I \nwant to talk to you about immigration. I didn't know which side he was \ncoming from. He said: I just wanted to let you know how important it is \nto Denison that you resolve this in a fair and equitable manner. He \nsaid: We have people here who have bought homes that were abandoned. \nPeople have left town because the town was kind of dying out. They \nbought these homes. They fixed them up.\n  Then he told me something very interesting. He said: A lot of Latinos \nhave taken over small businesses on Main Street. They are operating \nthese small businesses that were going out of business. He said: If you \nwant an answer to Wal-Mart, here is your answer to Wal-Mart. He said: \nThey are actually running businesses on Main Street in Denison. He \nsaid: I know for a fact that many of them are undocumented aliens. He \nsaid: We cannot afford to lose them.\n  So it is not just in the big cities, I say to my friend--Los Angeles \nand San Francisco--but in the small towns and small communities of \nrural Iowa that would be drastically affected by the Hagel-Martinez so-\ncalled compromise.\n  Most of these new immigrants have found work, but they have not found \nfreedom. This spring, at United Trinity Methodist Church in Des Moines, \nIA, I met with a group of new immigrants, and I asked how many of them \nwere undocumented. I looked around. They didn't know whether to raise \ntheir hand, and finally they decided, OK, they would. I would say \nprobably a third of them were undocumented. They are living in the \nshadows. They live in fear. Many pay taxes. They make Social Security \npayments, but they receive nothing in return.\n  They want to become loyal, contributing American citizens, to pursue \nthe American dream. But, instead, they are living an American nightmare \nof anxiety and exclusion and exploitation. One young girl there was 18 \nyears old, just graduating from high school, who wants to go on to \ncollege. They have no money. Her folks work. They have a modest income. \nWe know what college tuitions are like. She came here as a 3-year-old \nwhen her folks fled the strife in El Salvador. She is now 18. She is \nundocumented. She has no papers. She cannot get any loans to go to \ncollege. She cannot get any college aid or anything else to help her \nthrough. She just wants to be a good American citizen. What about her? \nWhat are we going to do about people like that?\n\n  So it is time to find a constructive and positive way to bring these \npeople out of the shadows and into the sunshine. The Feinstein \namendment does it. It establishes a legal framework, where people can \nlearn English. They have to learn English. They have to pass security \nbackground checks, pay the fines and penalties, and can earn the right \nto eventually become U.S. citizens.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield 2 additional minutes to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from California.\n  Again, the orange card program will increase participation by \ndecreasing fear. More people will come forward because fewer families \nwill be separated. They will become full participants. It is pro-\nfamily, pro-work, pro-American, pro-national security.\n  Let me close by saying one personal thing. My mother came to this \ncountry as an immigrant. I have the documentation when she came to this \ncountry. Was she legal? Well, I don't know. She came on a boat with a \nlot of other people--steerage class. They landed in Boston. They could \nnot get into New York because of a storm. They landed in Boston. She \nhad $7 in her pocket and a one-way train ticket to Des Moines, IA. Yet \nshe became a fully contributing member of our American community. Later \non she became a citizen.\n  So when I see our new immigrants, and I look into their face, I see \nthe face of my mother. Why do we have an immigration problem in \nAmerica? Because people want to come here. They want to work. They love \nAmerica. They love our freedoms. They love our society and the \nopportunities that it presents.\n  This is not the time to go to some convoluted thing such as the \nHagel-Martinez amendment, which is going to make the mess even messier. \nIt is going to make it even worse. Let's clear it up once and for all, \nin a fair and equitable manner. And the only way to do that, I submit, \nis with the Feinstein amendment.\n  I thank the Senator from California for coming up with this \namendment. I am proud to be her cosponsor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 6\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to reserve the remainder \nof my time. But I would like to also thank the Senator from Iowa. I \nthink he showed, particularly speaking from the heartland of our \ncountry--a much smaller State than California--how much a local economy \ndepends on this workforce. I think that is really important to \nunderstand.\n  I remember speaking--and I would like the Senator to know this--with \nDoris Meissner. She was the head of the U.S. Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, and I think a very good commissioner. She said: \nWhatever you do, make it simple. Make it enforceable. That is the key \nwhere we go astray with this because you cannot enforce it, basically. \nGood luck finding all of these people subject to immediate deportation. \nIt is impossible. You cannot deport 1.6 million people. And then to \nexpect the other 2.8 million are going to go home and touchback within \n3 years is an unrealistic expectation.\n  So I hope somehow people will actually read the bill and understand \nthe devil is in details of the language as to whether it can be carried \nout. I think the Senator from Iowa said it very eloquently, and I thank \nhim for that.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time begin to run on \nthe other side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, may I be clear as to what I just asked \nunanimous consent for: that the Presiding Officer allows the time \nagainst the amendment to run, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. I appreciate it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, currently, 10 to 12 million workers are in \nthis country illegally living in the shadows. Of those, approximately \n24 percent or 2.5 to 3 million undocumented immigrants are living in \nCalifornia.\n  Many of these people are longtime residents, hard workers, and with\n\n[[Page S4931]]\n\nAmerican-born children. They are the parents of children in your \nschool. They are members of your community whom you know and respect.\n  Any comprehensive immigration reform bill must address the plight of \nundocumented workers currently in the country. Unfortunately, the \ncurrent provision in the bill is not rational and could leave millions \nof individuals without relief and forced to hide.\n  Under the three-tier process created by the Hagel-Martinez \ncompromise, undocumented immigrants here less than 2 years are subject \nto deportation, and those here from 2 to 5 years must return to their \ncountry and seek reentry under a guest/worker program.\n  It is estimated that these tiers would apply to nearly 5 million \npeople--that means approximately a million residents of California \nwould either face voluntary departure or deportation.\n  Families would be broken apart and industries disrupted as workers \nare forced to leave or go into hiding. California cannot afford and \nmost of its residents do not support the convoluted Hagel-Martinez \napproach.\n  That is why I was pleased that my colleague, Senator Feinstein, has \nproposed a much more practical and humane approach in her orange card \nprogram.\n  Under the program, all undocumented immigrants who are in the United \nStats as of January 1, 2006, would be eligible to get on a path to \nlegality. They would be required to pass criminal and national security \nbackground checks, demonstrate an understanding of English and U.S. \nhistory and Government, have paid their back taxes and pay a $2,000 \nfine.\n  Moreover, orange card holders would have a continuing obligation to \nwork, pay their taxes, and not to engage in criminal activity.\n  The Feinstein orange card program establishes a realistic approach to \ndealing with the 10 to 12 million undocumented workers currently in the \ncountry. In conjunction with her AgJOBS amendment, Senator Feinstein \nhas addressed two of the most important aspects of the comprehensive \nimmigration reform bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Feinstein amendment. It is a \nworkable solution to a difficult problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly on the overall \nbill and the progress we are making to date. And then I want to \naddress, briefly, the Feinstein amendment.\n  I have great regard for the Senator from California. She is one of \nthe top authorities in the Senate on immigration. She has dealt with \nthis topic for many years, and in a very practical way she has dealt \nwith it, and in a very knowledgeable way she has dealt with it.\n  We are making great progress on getting a comprehensive, bipartisan \nimmigration bill through the U.S. Senate. Everybody is not going to \nagree with this bill at the end of the day, but it has been a delight \nto see the body work and to see us go on amendments--a Republican \namendment might pass or fail, a Democrat amendment might pass or fail. \nWe are really legislating and building a coalition, and I think \nbuilding a vote total that, at the end of the day, will pass a strong \nbill. I think that is to the credit of the country, and I think it is \nto the credit of the body.\n  I oppose the Feinstein amendment, even though I have great respect \nfor my colleague from California and her knowledge and ability and the \npractical impact of this on her State. I have opposition to it because \nI think it slows us down and possibly really disrupts us from being \nable to get a comprehensive bill through the body. We have worked to \ncraft a delicate compromise that--it is my hope--could pass \nsubstantially in cloture, get well over 60 votes on final passage.\n  A key part of that coalition and building has been the Hagel-Martinez \ncompromise, that makes the distinctions between if you have been here \nmore than 5 years or if you have been here less than 2 years. That has \nbeen something where a number of people have said: OK, it is difficult \nto work in practice, but it makes some sense to me. It also makes some \nsense on the amount of roots you have put into this country. It makes \nsome sense to me about if you have just come in the last 2 years and \nyou are just trying to jump in over the line as things change.\n  If you break that compromise, I think you break the momentum in \npassing the bill, and I would not doubt that you break the ability for \nus to pass the bill. I think the Senator from California has some real \nissues that she raises. I think they are important issues she raises. I \nthink there are key things for us to consider. But at the end of the \nday, I think it causes the bill to fail, and I do not think that is a \nuseful thing for us to do--having invested the quantity of time we have \nin this bill, having the importance of this bill, and having it as the \nNo. 1 topic across the country--for us now to adopt an amendment that I \nbelieve has the clear possibility of failing the whole bill and pulling \nthe whole bill under.\n  For those reasons, with high regard for the Senator from California \nand her work, and with real recognition of the practicality of the \nissues she is dealing with, I oppose the Feinstein amendment. I hope \nthat my colleagues will oppose it, and we can move forward toward \nclosing the debate with a strong vote on final passage.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I would like to speak for 5 minutes in \nopposition to the Feinstein amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Following on the remarks of the Senator from Kansas, I \nhave to agree with an awful lot of what he said. We came to this bill \nin a situation where it was a good concept. It had some obvious, \npositive qualities to it, but it was also a bill that was not gaining \nthe favor of the vast majority of the Members of the Senate. In order \nfor it to be successful, we had to tweak it. We had to find a way in \nwhich we could thread the needle, strike a balance, a way in which we \ncould somehow bring more people to the table in understanding what it \nis that we were trying to do.\n  We came together and found a way of doing so by simply not treating \neveryone who was here the same. We talk about a group of 11 million \npeople in our country illegally today. It was apparent that all of \nthose people were not in the same situation. Some have been here for a \nnumber of years, well established, sometimes owning a home, certainly \nhaving a steady job, children who were probably by now United States \ncitizens, having been born here. For the sake of family unity, we felt \nit was important to treat people who had been here a longer period of \ntime differently than more recent arrivals.\n  Senator Hagel and I came up with a concept of having a 5-year \ndividing line where those who have been here more than 5 years would be \ntreated one way and those who had been here less would be treated a \nslightly different way. The requirement was that those who had been \nhere less than 5 years would be divided in two different ways--those \nwho have been here less than 5 years who might have come here with the \nexpectation that there would be some immigration bill. The date was \nselected around the time the President first spoke on this issue of \ncomprehensive reform. We settled on the idea that those who had been \nhere 2 years or less would not be able to benefit from this bill, but \nthat those who had been here between 2 and 5 years should be given an \nopportunity. We would require that they reenter the country, that they \nwould have a legal entry into the country, but understanding that all \nthe other categories or steps that were appropriate for those who had \nbeen here 5 years they would also have to meet before obtaining a path \nto regularization, to being here legally, and then, ultimately, to live \nthe American dream to its fullest extent by becoming citizens of this \ncountry.\n  Not every immigrant who crossed the southern border intended to \nbecome an American. We could not treat everyone the same. People who \nhave been here 10, 15 years certainly have a very different situation \nthan those who have been here 3 years. A lot of times single men will \ncome to work for a period of time, having no intention of being here \nfor an extended visit.\n  At the end of the day, what we have to understand is that we are now \nat the crossroads where this bill is about to be completed. This bill \nis moving along in a very positive way with support from both sides of \nthe aisle, which\n\n[[Page S4932]]\n\nmakes an even stronger statement. As we move forward to do that, this \namendment will take us a step back. This would bring us back to a time \nwhen we didn't have consensus, to a time when we were not all pulling \nin the same direction, and to a time when we didn't have what we have \ndemonstrated, the support of as many as 66 Members of this body to \ndefeat some of these amendments that would have taken the bill in a \ndifferent direction, that would have taken us from comprehensive reform \nto something different.\n  So for those folks who have been here 2 to 5 years, we want to give \nthem a path to regularizing themselves in this country. But also we \nhave to understand that their situation is different than those who \nhave been here for a long time.\n  I appreciate the effort of the Senator from California to do what I \nknow in her heart she believes is fair. I do understand the \ndifficulties. I don't want to be Pollyannish about it. This is a very \ndifficult concept to implement. When the time comes, we must try. We \nare putting a lot of employment enforcement into this bill which will \nmake it possible for this to be worked out. Without any idea that this \nis going to be easy to do, I do believe that there is a practical \nreason. It was a way for us to reach a resolution of how to deal with \nthis country's population of illegal immigrants, which is a group of \npeople the size of those people who live in the State of Pennsylvania.\n  I believe with ample protections to all, understanding the \ndifficulties that may come about in the implementation, that we have to \ngo forward and move ahead with the concept that has brought this body \ntogether, the concept that had the favor of the President. The \nPresident, when he spoke on this a week ago, clearly stated that, in \nfact, he favored the idea of creating a difference between the groups \nof people as they have arrived in this country and the length of time \nthey have been here.\n  I urge Members of the Senate not to support the current amendment but \nto stick with the concept that has worked so far, the concept that has \npulled us together. I believe if we do that, we will be very close to \nfinal resolution of this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add the \nnames of Senators Durbin and Obama as cosponsors of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. My understanding is Senator Kennedy has 10 minutes. \nWould the Senator like to use that time now?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That would be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \nher amendment. It does, for the reasons she has outlined and that I \nwill address briefly, seem to be a constructive and positive way to go. \nIt effectively moves us back to what was originally the legislation \nthat Senator McCain and I introduced. I was enthusiastically in support \nof it because it achieves what we are trying to do in terms of earned \nlegalization. In terms of simplicity and legality for those people who \nare here, that is the preferable way to go.\n  Since that time, as the Senate has worked its will, the Martinez-\nHagel amendment has come in and, as has been outlined, establishes a \ntier system. It recognizes that those who are here for over 5 years \nwill be able to have the earned legalization which many of us support--\nstrong bipartisan support. Those who are here for just 2 years will be \ndeported, and those from 2 to 5 will have to return and follow a \ndifferent pathway in terms of earning citizenship. That is \nadministratively more complicated and difficult and puts additional \nburdens on Homeland Security.\n  One of the basic concepts behind the legislation was to try to move \npeople out of the shadows. This is going to move us back into creating \na situation where a number of people will be back in the shadows. It \ndoes move us in a direction that I would not have hoped we would move. \nBut frankly, this is the legislative process. The legislative process \nhas brought us to where we are today. The underlying legislation is a \ngood product and an important product which will mean a significant and \nimportant change in the opening of opportunity for people who are here, \nwho want to work hard and pay a fine, pay their back taxes, play by the \nrules and become a part of the American dream.\n  I am enthusiastic for the underlying legislation which includes the \nHagel-Martinez amendment. I will say that the Feinstein amendment is \nbasically, in fact, what Senator McCain and I had originally hoped for. \nIt is difficult for someone like myself to argue against it. It makes \nsense. But as legislative proceedings go, at least as far as I am \nconcerned, you are sort of stuck with where you are in terms of the \nprocess.\n  I thank the Senator from California for again raising an issue which \nis a matter of enormous importance. And her reasons are excellent, as \nshe outlined in her comments. I am sympathetic to that. If the \nSenator's amendment is not successful, we still have a very strong \nbipartisan document which will deserve to move ahead in this process.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains under my control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the pending amendment. It \nis interesting how causes line up. I find myself critical of the Hagel-\nMartinez compromise. I also find myself in agreement with the diagnosis \nof the Senator from California that the tiered method of trying to \ndivide up the undocumented population will result in rampant fraud, \njust as it did in the post-1986 amnesty. But while I agree with her on \nthe diagnosis, I don't agree with her prescription. The prescription, \nthe alleged cure for the diagnosis, is that basically we throw up our \nhands and say that we cannot enforce the law. We can't secure our \nborders. We can't verify eligibility to work at the work site. We can't \nsanction employers who cheat. So we have to let anyone and everyone who \nhas come to the United States, either in violation of the law or \nlegally and overstayed, get basically the best gift that America can \nconfer, and that is legal permanent residency and American citizenship \nand to jump in line ahead of those who have waited patiently outside \nthe country and revisit the mistakes of 1986 when amnesty was tried.\n  I have two articles from the New York Times, one dated June 18, 1989 \nand one dated November 12, 1989. I ask unanimous consent that these be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibits 1 and 2.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. The June 18 article says:\n\n       The most sweeping effort to halt illegal immigration in \n     American history, the 1986 overhaul of immigration law, may \n     have cut the flow of illegal aliens less than expected and \n     may have actually encouraged unlawful entry in several ways.\n\n  It quotes a professor Wayne Cornelius, director of the Center for \nU.S.-Mexican Studies at the University of California in San Diego:\n\n       We found no evidence that the 1986 immigration law has shut \n     off the flow of new undocumented migrants.\n\n  The article, dated November 12, 1989, includes a quote from the \njunior Senator from New York, who was then serving in the House of \nRepresentatives. It says:\n\n       Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who \n     was an author of this Special Agricultural Worker provision, \n     said that in retrospect the program seemed ``too open'' and \n     susceptible of fraud. But he argued that the budget decisions \n     had made the battle to combat fraud more difficult.\n\n  In other words, alluding to the fact that notwithstanding the policy \ndecisions made by Congress in 1986, that, in fact, it was the failure \nto actually finance and implement the policy for work site verification \nand employer\n\n[[Page S4933]]\n\nsanctions that contributed to the ineffectiveness of the 1986 amnesty.\n  I hope we will learn from the mistakes of the past and are not \ncondemned to relive them with this bill. But I do agree with my \ncolleagues, Senator Kennedy, Senator Specter, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Martinez and others, that while the \nSenator from California is absolutely correct in her diagnosis, this \nsets us up for a repeat of massive fraud. The prescription she \nrecommends is not well advised.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 18, 1989]\n\n         1986 Amnesty Law Is Seen as Failing To Slow Alien Tide\n\n                           (By Roberto Suro)\n\n       Houston, June 17.--The most sweeping effort to halt illegal \n     immigration in American history, the 1986 overhaul of \n     immigration law, may have cut the flow of illegal aliens less \n     than expected and may have actually encouraged unlawful entry \n     in several ways.\n       Two years after it began to take effect, experts around the \n     country are starting to draw conclusions about the law's \n     effect. As thousands of people continue to enter the country \n     illegally every day, the first arguments are being entered in \n     a debate over whether the legislation has achieved its goals, \n     and whether it ever will.\n       Some in Congress seek more effective enforcement of the \n     law; others want to focus on the poverty and turmoil in the \n     third world that force people out of their homelands. \n     Meanwhile, the Immigration and Naturalization Service has \n     proclaimed the law a clear success, and the Bush \n     Administration has yet to put its own stamp on immigration \n     policy.\n       ``We have found no evidence that the 1986 immigration law \n     has shut off the flow of new undocumented migrants,'' said \n     Wayne Cornelius, director of the Center for U.S.-Mexican \n     Studies at the University of California at San Diego.\n\n\n                           a decade of Study\n\n       The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, whose \n     measures began to take effect in May 1987, was the first \n     nationwide response to a wave of illegal immigration that \n     began in the mid-1960's and created a resident population of \n     illegal aliens variously estimated between 6 million and 12 \n     million people.\n       After a decade of study and argument in Washington, the \n     1986 law emerged as a mixture of humanitarian and restrictive \n     measures. Unlike the two previous efforts to counter similar \n     waves of illegal immigration in the 1930's and 1950's, there \n     was no resort to mass deportations. The law offered legal \n     status to illegal aliens who had lived in the United States \n     continuously since Jan. 1, 1982, and it imposed penalties on \n     employers who knowingly hired illegal aliens. It also allowed \n     migrant workers to enter the United States during harvest \n     season.\n       ``The legislation bought time for everyone and made the \n     problem more manageable for a while,'' said Leonel J. \n     Castillo, who was Commissioner of Immigration and \n     Naturalization during the Carter Administration and is now \n     president of Houston International University. ``It seems, \n     however, that time has passed more quickly than expected, and \n     so it is important to see where we stand, because I think we \n     will be dealing with the issue again soon.''\n\n\n                           torrents of people\n\n       According to indicators used by the immigration service to \n     estimate traffic across the southern border, this year there \n     will be 1.7 million to 2.5 million crossings. The most recent \n     statistics signal that the flow may have increased in April \n     and May.\n       Separate surveys of illegal aliens conducted by researchers \n     based in Mexico, Texas and California all found that \n     immigration by first-time travelers, as against those who had \n     previously been to the United States, has been on the rise \n     for at least a year. Experts also agree that the flow had \n     dropped off through most of 1987. As a result, immigration \n     experts say they have identified a ``wait and see'' response \n     to the law among potential immigrants that may be producing a \n     new wave of illegal immigration.\n       Doris Meissner, an expert on immigration for the Carnegie \n     Endowment, a Washington research organization, said, ``There \n     is evidence that many potential immigrants waited for a while \n     to see how the law worked and have since begun moving again. \n     If so, we should see the flow across the border accelerating \n     any day.''\n\n\n                           a magnet of sorts\n\n       The 1986 law allowed 3.1 million previously illegal aliens \n     to obtain legal status here. Recent studies show that many \n     thousands of people crossed the border surreptitiously to \n     take advantage of the program, some of them with falsified \n     documents and personal histories. The mass of newly legalized \n     immigrants is also acting as a magnet for illegal aliens who \n     want to come to the United States to join friends and \n     relatives.\n       A plan to strengthen the Border Patrol was never fully \n     carried out, and experts reach widely differing verdicts on \n     the effectiveness of the sanctions against employers who hire \n     illegal aliens.\n       Representative Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat \n     who was instrumental in shaping the law's final compromises, \n     said, ``The legislation has had some effect but not close to \n     what it should have been.'' He complained that the Reagan \n     Administration favored passage of the law but never gave the \n     immigration service the resources to enforce it. ``So far, \n     the law really has not been given a fair test,'' he said.\n       The current debate over immigration policy is likely to \n     affect not only future law but also foreign policy. After \n     hearings last month on the law's effect, Representative Bruce \n     A. Morrison, a Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of the \n     House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration, \n     Refugees and International Law, said, ``Looking at what's \n     happened the past few years it is increasingly obvious that \n     most of the reasons for illegal immigration are in the \n     countries people are leaving, and that unless those \n     conditions change we may be able to reduce the flow somewhat, \n     but no enforcement scheme will stop the tide.''\n\n\n                           a lonely assertion\n\n       At those hearings Alan C. Nelson, Commissioner of the \n     I.N.S., argued that a steady decline in the number of people \n     apprehended trying to cross the border ``continues to \n     demonstrate that the law is working and employer sanctions \n     are having the intended effect of reducing illegal \n     immigration.''\n       But the immigration service is now virtually alone in \n     asserting that the sanctions have substantially cut the flow \n     of illegal immigrants. Mr. Nelson has said repeatedly that \n     the number of people apprehended on the border has dropped at \n     a rate of 40 percent a year since the law went into effect. \n     But many scholars dispute Mr. Nelson's statistics. Some \n     researchers believe sanctions on employers have cut the flow, \n     but not by 40 percent, and other experts argue the sanctions \n     have had no effect at all.\n       The effects of the law are illustrated in the experiences \n     of two recent illegal immigrants.\n       A 30-year-old woman from El Salvador said that in February \n     1988 she left home to live illegally in Texas in part because \n     ``my cousin got papers under the amnesty, and so she was able \n     to help me with money and a place to stay and generally in \n     getting around.'' But as a result of the law, she said, \n     ``there is no way to get a good job, because they always ask \n     for your papers.''\n       The woman, a secretary in El Salvador, cleans houses in \n     Houston, and although she would like better work here, she \n     said she had no desire to return to the poverty and political \n     violence of her homeland. ``Yes,'' she said, ``it is more \n     difficult to get here and earn money now, but people still do \n     it.'' Like other illegal aliens interviewed, she asked not to \n     be identified.\n\n\n                            a family asunder\n\n       In the case of another woman from El Salvador, the law had \n     contradictory effects. She arrived here in 1981, qualifying \n     for the amnesty, but her five children, now 10 to 18 years \n     old, arrived too late to be legalized. ``It is a great worry \n     for me,'' she said, ``because my two oldest have graduated \n     from American high school. Their home is with me here, but \n     they cannot get real jobs. What is their future?'' According \n     to the immigration service, 3.5 million to 4 million illegal \n     aliens live in the United States on an established basis, as \n     against 6.5 million to 7 million before passage of the 1986 \n     law.\n       The drop is accounted for by the number of applicants for \n     the amnesty programs. In effect, the amnesty divided illegal \n     immigrants into those who were suddenly legalized and those \n     who were not, but it did not physically separate these \n     people.\n       The immigration service expects that a vast majority of \n     amnesty applicants will receive permanent status as legal \n     residents. If they then become citizens after a five-year \n     waiting period, they will be able to get legal status for \n     their spouses and children.\n\n\n                           the men were first\n\n       In the meantime, however, the law has created a new and \n     growing category of illegal alien: the relatives of amnesty \n     applicants. Noting that nearly 70 percent of the amnesty \n     applicants are men, Nestor Rodriguez, a sociologist at the \n     University of Houston, said: ``Usually, the men were the \n     first to migrate, and so more of them qualified for the \n     amnesty. Many woman and children who followed along later did \n     not qualify, and certainly the men who were here alone and \n     got papers are now bringing in their families illegally.''\n       The effect of the amnesty on illegal immigration goes \n     beyond relatives, however.\n       ``Illegal immigrants have a long history of following well-\n     established routes,'' said Mr. Castillo, ``and the amnesty \n     program gave those routes a little more solidity. Now, \n     instead of relying on other illegals, a new arrival is likely \n     to know people here who are legal and can offer help with all \n     kinds of things. It's my guess that it will take a generation \n     to break those ties.''\n       Mr. Cornelius of the University of California at San Diego \n     conducted extensive surveys of three rural Mexican \n     communities and has concluded, ``There has been no \n     significant return flow of illegals who suddenly found \n     themselves jobless in the United States.'' In the short term \n     at least, he said, the 1986 law ``may have kept more Mexicans \n     in the United States than it has kept out'' because it \n     granted some kind of amnesty to about 3.1 million people.\n       Although immigration experts agree that the prohibition on \n     hiring undocumented workers has made it more difficult for \n     illegal aliens to find work here, they differ widely on how \n     much the sanctions on employers have reduced the flow across \n     the border.\n\n[[Page S4934]]\n\n                        arrest rates are debated\n\n       Much of the debate over the rate of illegal immigration \n     centers on statistics for the apprehension of aliens along \n     the Southern border because the immigration service uses \n     these figures to support its assertion that the sanctions \n     have been effective.\n       Almost all experts dismiss the immigration service view \n     that proof of decreased flow lies in the 40 percent drop in \n     apprehensions each year since 1986. The agency's critics say \n     the number of Border Patrol agents assigned to watch the \n     border also decreased markedly in that time, and so fewer \n     apprehensions were inevitable.\n       Also, it is argued that since 1986 the agents remaining on \n     the border have spent more time tracking down drug smugglers, \n     another reason why a decline in apprehension would not \n     necessarily mean there was a drop in the flow of illegal \n     aliens. Yet other researchers insist that a substantial part \n     of the decline in apprehensions is explained by the fact that \n     most of the 3.1 million amnesty applicants can move across \n     the border as they have for years but do it legally.\n       Chart of breakdown of legalization applicants and \n     agricultural workers by gender, type of work, age, and state \n     they applied in.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 12, 1989]\n\n             Migrants' False Claims: Fraud on a Huge Scale\n\n                           (By Roberto Suro)\n\n       Houston, Nov. 11, 1989.--In one of the most extensive \n     immigration frauds ever perpetrated against the United States \n     Government, thousands of people who falsified amnesty \n     applications will begin to acquire permanent resident status \n     next month under the 1986 immigration law.\n       More than 1.3 million illegal aliens applied to become \n     legal immigrants under a one-time amnesty for farm workers. \n     The program was expected to accommodate only 250,000 aliens \n     when Congress enacted it as a politically critical part of a \n     sweeping package of changes in immigration law.\n       Now a variety of estimates by Federal officials and \n     immigration experts place the number of fraudulent \n     applications at somewhere between 250,000 and 650,000.\n       The Immigration and Naturalization Service has identified \n     398,000 cases of possible fraud in the program, but the \n     agency admits that it lacks both the manpower and the money \n     to prosecute individual applicants. The agency is to begin \n     issuing permanent resident status to amnesty applicants on \n     Dec. 1, and officials said they were approving 94 percent of \n     the applicants over all.\n       Evidence of vast abuse of the farm worker amnesty program \n     has already led to important changes in the way immigration \n     policies are conceived in Congress. For example, recent \n     legislation to aid immigration by refugees from the Soviet \n     Union was modified specifically to avoid the uncontrolled \n     influx that has occurred under the agricultural amnesty \n     program.\n       Supporters of the farm worker amnesty argue that it \n     accomplished its principal aim of insuring the nation a \n     cheap, reliable and legal supply of farm workers and that it \n     made an inadvertent but important contribution in \n     legitimizing a large part of the nation's illegal alien \n     population.\n       Critics point to cases like that of Larry and Sharon Marval \n     of Newark. Last year they pleaded guilty to immigration fraud \n     charges after immigration service investigators alleged that \n     the Marvals were part of an operation that helped about 1,000 \n     aliens acquire amnesty with falsified documents showing they \n     had all worked on a mere 30 acres of farmland.\n       The amnesty for farm workers was a last-minute addition to \n     the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which sought \n     to halt illegal immigration with a two-part strategy. \n     Under a general amnesty, illegal aliens who could prove \n     they had lived in the United States since before Jan. 1, \n     1982, were given the chance to leave their underground \n     existence and begin a process leading to permanent \n     resident status. And to stem further illegal immigration, \n     the employment of illegal aliens was made a crime.\n       The agricultural amnesty program was adopted at the \n     insistence of politically powerful fruit and vegetable \n     growers in California and Texas who wanted to protect their \n     labor force. In several respects, the provisions for the \n     program were much less strict than the general amnesty \n     program, which drew 1.7 million applicants. Instead of having \n     to document nearly five years of continuous residence, most \n     agricultural worker applicants had to show only that they had \n     done 90 days of farm work between May 1, 1985, and May 1, \n     1986.\n       Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who \n     was an author of this Special Agricultural Worker provision, \n     said that in retrospect the program seemed ``too open'' and \n     susceptible to fraud. But he argued that budget decisions had \n     made the battle to combat fraud more difficult.\n       ``There has not been enough diligence in tracking down the \n     fraud,'' he said, ``because funding for the I.N.S. has been \n     cut by the White House in each of the last three budgets, \n     even though everyone agreed when the bill passed that greater \n     I.N.S. manpower was essential to make it work.''\n       Congress rarely raises the immigration service budget above \n     Administration requests.\n       Aside from its budget problems, the immigration service has \n     repeatedly come under fire this year in Congress and in an \n     audit by the Justice Department for what was termed \n     mismanagement and administrative inefficiency.\n       John F. Shaw, Assistant Immigration Commissioner, agreed \n     that ``manpower restrictions'' at the agency were a major \n     factor in the fraud in the agricultural amnesty program. He \n     said much of the fraud ``shot through a window of \n     opportunity'' when the agency was frantically trying to deal \n     with many new burdens of the 1986 immigration law.\n       Mr. Shaw said law-enforcement efforts had been limited to \n     the people who sold false documents to applicants for the \n     farm worker amnesty. The immigration service has made 844 \n     arrests and won 413 convictions in cases alleging fraud in \n     the amnesty program. The people involved ranged from notaries \n     public to field crew leaders. ``It was a cottage industry,'' \n     Mr. Shaw said.\n       The immigration service can revoke legal status if it finds \n     the applicant committed fraud, but even this effort is \n     limited. Only applications that appear linked to a fraud \n     conspiracy are held for review, as when an unusually large \n     number of applicants assert that they have worked in same \n     place. Some 398,000 aliens have fallen into this category \n     since the application period ended last Nov. 30, but it is \n     likely that many of them will get resident status.\n       Mr. Shaw said the fraud conspiracies often involved farms \n     that actually did employ some migrant labor. So it is \n     frequently impossible to separate legitimate from illicit \n     claims.\n       Given the limited law-enforcement effort, no precise count \n     of fraud in the agricultural amnesty program is possible. But \n     some rough estimates are possible based on information from \n     the aliens themselves. An extensive survey conducted in three \n     rural Mexican communities by the Center for U.S.-Mexican \n     Studies at the University of California in San Diego found \n     that only 72 percent of those who identified themselves as \n     applicants for farm worker amnesty had work histories that \n     qualified them for the program. A similar survey conducted by \n     Mexican researchers in Jalisco in central Mexico found that \n     only 59 percent qualified.\n       But fraud alone does not explain why the program produced \n     more than five times the applicants Congress expected. Frank \n     D. Bean, co-director of the Program for Research on \n     Immigration Policy at the Urban Institute in Washington, said \n     the miscalculation in the Special Agricultural Worker program \n     reflected longstanding difficulties in tracking the number of \n     temporary illegal migrants from Mexico.\n       ``It is at least plausible that a very large percentage of \n     the S.A.W. applicants had done agricultural work in the U.S. \n     even if they did not meet the specific time requirements of \n     the amnesty,'' Mr. Bean said.\n       Mr. Shaw of the immigration service, and other critics of \n     the law, believe there were more fundamental flaws. ``It was \n     a weak program and it was poorly articulated in the law,'' he \n     said.\n       Unlike almost all other immigration programs, which put the \n     burden of proof applicant, the farm amnesty put the burden on \n     the Government. Consequently, aliens with even the most \n     rudimentary documentation cannot be rejected unless the \n     Government can prove their claims are false.\n       Stephen Rosenbaum, staff attorney for California Rural \n     Legal Assistance, a nonprofit service organization for farm \n     workers, argued that there was no other way to structure an \n     immigration program for an occupation ``that does not produce \n     a paper trail.'' He noted that farm workers are paid in cash \n     and neither the employers nor the workers keep detailed \n     records.\n       ``You can argue the wisdom of a farm worker amnesty, but if \n     you have one, you have to recognize the immense logistical \n     problems involved in producing evidence,'' he said.\n       The immigration service at first tried to apply the \n     stringent practices common to other immigration programs, \n     like rejecting applicants with little explanation when their \n     documents were suspect. But three lawsuits brought in \n     Florida, Texas and California over the last two years forced \n     the agency to follow the broader standards mandated by \n     Congress.\n       The burden-of-proof issue arose again earlier this year \n     when the House of Representatives approved legislation that \n     would have made any person who could prove Soviet citizenship \n     eligible for political refugee status.\n       A legislator with a powerful role on immigration policy, \n     Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, eliminated \n     the provision because of concerns raised by the farm worker \n     amnesty program, an aide said. Mr. Simpson, who is on the \n     Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee \n     Affairs, substituted a series of specific circumstances that \n     had to be met for a Soviet citizen to be considered a \n     refugee, like denial of a particular job because of religious \n     beliefs.\n       Immigration experts believe that the agricultural amnesty \n     program will probably color policy debates over other \n     categories of aliens whose qualifications will be difficult \n     to document, like the anti-Sandinista rebels of Nicaragua.\n       ``One certain product'' of the agricultural amnesty \n     program, Representative Schumer said, ``is that in developing \n     immigration policies in the future, Congress will be much \n     more wary of the potential for fraud and will do more to stop \n     it.''\n\n\n[[Page S4935]]\n\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to make a couple of \ncomments.\n  I very much appreciate my service and Senator Cornyn's service on the \nsame committee and have great respect for him and also for Senator \nMartinez who has introduced the Hagel-Martinez plan with the best of \nmotives. Senator Cornyn said we shouldn't throw up our hands. I am not \nthrowing up my hands. I want strong borders. I voted for a fence. I \nbelieve we should put National Guard on the borders. We provide 12,500 \nadditional Border Patrol, 2,500 border inspectors, over $1 billion of \nequipment for the border. We should have our border enforced. We should \nget the help of Mexico to enforce it.\n  Secondly, with this plan, there is no jumping in line ahead of anyone \nwaiting legally for a green card.\n  The line begins for the orange card recipients, if such should ever \nbe, when that line is expunged. What we do is recognize the reality, \nlearn from the streets, understand what happens, and then try to build \na comprehensive solution to deal with the real world--border control, \nincrease practical numbers of visas, as well as providing a path for \nearned legalization for those people who are here now.\n  That path has several hurdles. It will weed out those who should not \nreceive an orange card from those who should. It is an electronic \nprocess. It is doable, and it is practical. It recognizes that if you \nleave 4.4 million undocumented immigrants subject to deportation, \nwhether it is this year or 4 years down the pike, you create another \nillegal pool of workers in this country, which I think destroys the \ncomprehensive approach.\n  Therefore, I just want to say that this orange card has specific \nrequirements that have to be met over a 6-year period of work, of \nlearning to speak English, of paying a fine, of paying taxes, of work \nhistory. That has to be met on an annual basis, submitting work history \nreceipts on an annual basis. The program financially takes care of \nitself with the fines and fees. I believe it is a practical, humane way \nto go which can, in fact, with the other components of the bill, create \na comprehensive solution to immigration reform which has a chance to \nstop illegal immigration into our country.\n  I am concerned that should Hagel-Martinez become the law, we are back \nwhere we started with a huge group of people subject to deportation at \none point or another. We know that creates the underground labor pool, \nwhich then creates the incentive for an addition to that underground \nlabor pool. I believe the orange card proposal we have before the \nSenate now does not do that. But the devil is in the details of all of \nthis. We will see.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Less than 1 minute 50 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield whatever time I have to the \nSenator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to say one other thing. A \nlot of people come to me in desperate circumstances for private bills. \nI have tried to meet some of the families. What I have seen in these \nfamilies is truly amazing. I have seen a legacy of work over a period \nof time that is amazing for any human being. I have actually seen \nfamilies whose children are valedictorians of their high school class. \nI have seen them hide, but they pay their taxes, and they own a home. \nSome are even supervisors of companies.\n  If you look around America, the meatpacking industry, the chicken-\nprocessing industry, virtually all of the manufacturing and production, \nyou will see these people as a dominant part of that workforce. I look \nat the great bread basket that is California, the largest agricultural \nState in the Union, and I know at least 600,000 of our workforce are \nundocumented and illegal. I know they come here because of the absence \nof any hope or opportunity or ability to make a decent living where \nthey were living before.\n  I think this whole dialog we are having puts an enormous obligation \non Mexico to begin to understand the needs of their people and do \nsomething to help them become economically more upwardly mobile because \nthis is certainly the main problem that leads to the cross-border \nimmigration that is illegal into our country. So we have tried to solve \nthis with a comprehensive bill. I think it makes sense. It says to \neverybody that you have to earn this legalization. You have to get out \nthere and work for at least 6 more years. You have to report in, but \nyou have a card which identifies that you are in an adjusted status, \nyou are not subject to deportation. You can raise your children. You \ncan volunteer for community activities. You can become a constructive \nmember of society. I believe that is worth a lot.\n  Enabling people to live to their fullest is worth a lot. I hazard a \nguess that there is not one person who is going to go home because of \nwhat we do in a bill. They are going to stay, they are going to \ncontinue, but the lifestyle is going to be clandestine, and they are \nnever going to be able to reach their full potential. This amendment \nallows them to do so. I urge the Senate to vote yes.\n  I yield the floor and the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is with reluctance that I oppose the \namendment offered by the Senator from California because if this \namendment were to be adopted, I believe the very delicate and fragile \ncoalition we have for this bill would fail. We are going to be looking \nfor a cloture vote tomorrow, and if we were to go back to before the \ntenuous agreement that has been worked out to date with the three \nsubdivisions--those here 5 years or more, those here 2 to 5 years, and \nthose here less than 2 years--I think our efforts at cloture would fail \nand the prospects for failure of the bill would be very high.\n  We have structured the bill on a matter of principle, that those who \nare here the longest have the most roots and deserve the most \nconsideration. The top tier was those who have been here 5 years or \nmore. Selecting the date of January 7, 2004, as a cutoff date was done \nbecause that was the date of the President's speech on immigration \nreform. And anybody who came to the United States was on notice that \nthey would be treated differently.\n  Under ideal circumstances, if we didn't have a tenuous coalition and \nwe didn't have a conference prospectively with the House, I would be \nvery sympathetic and inclined to support what the Senator from \nCalifornia has done. The reality is that it is going to be very \ndifficult to find people who are here and not turn them into a fugitive \nclass. The theory is that those people will not be able to find jobs \nand that they will, therefore, return.\n  But this legislation is on the edge of the ledge as it is. To keep \nthe coalition intact--and I think that was the thrust of what Senator \nKennedy had to say, if I understood him, and I think others in the \ncoalition are of the same mind--it is with reluctance that I oppose \nwhat the Senator from California has said. As a nation of immigrants, \nit would be nice to include everybody on the path to citizenship, but \nwe face a lot of opposition, realistically, on the charge of amnesty, \nwhich I have dealt with on the floor. The bill is not amnesty; it is \nearned citizenship.\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Under the previous order, all time having expired, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 4087, as modified.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Death of Senator Lloyd Bentsen\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was just notified a few minutes ago that \nLloyd Bentsen died. For those of us who have had the pleasure of \nserving with Lloyd Bentsen, this is a sad day. There was no one who \nbetter represented the Senate than Lloyd Bentsen. He looked like a \nSenator, he carried himself so well, and he acted like a Senator. He \nlegislated like a Senator. He died at age 85. He was sick for a number \nof years. He was a person who had a great political record. He served \nin the House of Representatives for three terms, and he served in the \nSenate--he could have served as long as he wanted--and became Secretary \nof the Treasury during the Clinton administration. He, of course, ran \nfor Vice President and he ran for President.\n  For me personally, he was such a guiding light. I can remember when I \nwas elected to the Senate, and I was trying to get on the \nAppropriations Committee. I met in his hideaway.\n  This speaks about the way Lloyd Bentsen conducted his life. I was \ntelling him why it would be good for me. I had been through a tough \nrace. It was the most noted race in the cycle at that time. I was \ntalking to him a lot about why it was important for me to get on the \nAppropriations Committee. He ended the discussion very quickly.\n  He said: It doesn't matter if it is good for you. I believe it is \ngood for the Senate.\n  That was how he conducted his life. He was someone we all looked to. \nAs a new Senator, I could talk to him with reverence. I can remember \nvisiting with him when he was Secretary of Treasury. He told me how \nmuch he missed the Senate and how lonely it was down there and how he \nmissed the collegiality of the Senate.\n  The State of Texas has had great Senators, but no Senator has ever \nbeen a better Senator than Lloyd Bentsen.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, with the consent of the majority leader, I \nask unanimous consent that the time for the recess begin now, 12 \nminutes early.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, there will be no objection. We are making \nreal progress and have begun discussing how we will handle the rest of \nthe day and tomorrow as well. There is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senate stands in recess until 2:15 p.m.\n  Thereupon, at 12:19 p.m., the Senate recessed until 2:15 p.m. and \nreassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer (Mr. \nVoinovich).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island be given 10 minutes to speak on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to discuss S. 2611, the immigration \nbill we are debating this week. It has been a difficult debate with \nseveral difficult votes, but I believe this is one of the most \nimportant pieces of legislation we will address this year.\n  The status of immigrants in this country, including legal aliens, \nguest workers, and illegal aliens, has a profound impact on our \neconomy, our labor force, and the quality of life of all of the \nNation's residents. Clearly, our immigration system in terms of both \nits punitive measures and its benefits offered is in need of overhaul. \nThe bill before us is not perfect, but it is a realistic approach to \ndealing with an issue that is important to so many Americans.\n  Rather than measures that sound good but are ineffective, this \nlegislation is truly comprehensive immigration reform. It includes \ntough enforcement provisions directed at those who seek to come here \nillegally in the future and those who would hire illegal aliens. It \ncontains provisions for guest workers that balance the needs of \nemployers and the average American worker, and it offers a path to \nlegalization to those who entered this country illegally but who have \nsince been working hard and obeying the rules.\n  One of the most important sections of this bill relates to \nenforcement. Clearly, the continuous flow of illegal immigrants across \nour southern border in particular in search of higher paying jobs in \nthe United States strains our Nation's labor market and resources such \nas hospitals and schools and law enforcement.\n  I note that while illegal immigration has been a significant problem \nsince the 1980s, the problems have only worsened in the past 6 years. \nThe 9/11 Commission gave the Bush administration a grade of C-minus on \nborder security. The administration has simply lost control of the \nborder. In the past decade, between 700,000 and 800,000 illegal \nimmigrants have arrived in this country annually. Over 70 percent of \nthese individuals are from Mexico or South America or from Central \nAmerica. During the same period from 1995 to 2005, the number of Border \nPatrol agents increased from 4,876 to 11,106.\n  However, while the number of border agents increased dramatically \nduring the Bush administration, the number of apprehensions at the \nborder declined 31 percent from the last 4 years of the Clinton \nadministration. In addition, approximately one-half of the 11 million \nillegal aliens in this country live in the 46 nonborder States, yet the \naverage apprehension rate during the\n\n[[Page S4937]]\n\nBush administration is 25,901 individuals per year in interior States \naway from the border.\n  But apprehending individuals illegally crossing the border only \npartially solves the problem. The reason so many try to enter this \ncountry is the search for jobs. We must work to cut off the supply of \njobs by making it too costly for employers to hire illegals. Again, \nthis administration has performed poorly in this area. In fiscal year \n2004, the last year in which data is available, the Justice Department \nonly obtained 46 convictions for employer violations of illegal \nimmigrant employment laws. Audits of employers suspected of utilizing \nlabor have dropped from a peak of 8,000 per year under President \nClinton to less than 2,200 in fiscal year 2003 under President Bush. \nThe number of cases resulting in fines has declined from a peak of 900 \nunder President Clinton to a total of 124 in fiscal year 2003. I would \ntherefore say that the first step to improve enforcement would be to \nactually enforce the laws that are already on the books.\n  In addition, I believe the bill adds many useful enforcement \nmeasures. I would like to highlight a few that I feel are most \nsignificant.\n  I am particularly pleased with the focus on technology. This bill \nrequires the Department of Homeland Security to create a virtual fence \nalong the borders using unmanned aerial vehicles, cameras, sensors, \ntethered aerostat radars, and other surveillance equipment. This bill \nalso requires the Department of Homeland Security to work with other \nagencies such as the Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation \nAdministration to develop plans for sharing assets and implementing \nsurveillance strategies.\n  In addition, this bill includes provisions which replace and extend \nexisting fencing along the U.S.-Mexican border. While I realize that \nbuilding additional fences may be an attractive option, ultimately I \nbelieve this approach would be expensive and ineffective. History has \nproven that fences simply drive the illegal immigration flow to cross \nby land through more inhospitable terrain, increasing the number of \ndeaths, or to enter by boat through our largely unprotected ports and \nshores.\n  For example, once a triple fence was built in the San Diego area, \napprehensions dropped dramatically, but they increased 342 percent \nduring the same period in Tuscon, away from the fence. In addition, \nduring that period, it is estimated that 1,954 people died attempting \nto cross the Sonoran Desert to reach Tucson.\n  I also believe that wall is a symbol of distrust which can only \nweaken our relations, particularly with Mexico. It is a country we need \nto cooperate with to reduce the flow of illegal aliens.\n  For these reasons, last week I voted against the Sessions amendment \nto add 370 more miles of triple-layer fencing and 500 miles of vehicle \nbarriers along our southern border. I believe the funding could be \nspent in more effective ways using new technologies.\n  This bill also improves enforcement of employers who might unlawfully \nhire illegal aliens. First, it reduces the number of documents that can \nbe used to prove legal status. It also increases verification and \nrecordkeeping requirements. Most importantly, it establishes an \nelectronic employment verification system.\n  Under this program, employers must electronically verify new hires' \nemployment authorization within 3 days through the Social Security \nAdministration and the Department of Homeland Security databases. All \nemployers will have to participate in the system within the next 5 \nyears. The bill also provides for punitive measures for employers who \ndo not participate. Such a system will help standardize enforcement, \nmaking it more certain that employers hiring illegals will be found out \nand therefore providing a deterrent effect.\n  I believe the measure I have discussed, along with others in the \nbill, will help control the stream of illegal aliens entering this \ncountry.\n  As we all are aware, one of the most controversial aspects of this \nbill is that it provides a path to legalization for approximately 11 \nmillion illegal immigrants living in this country. I believe that while \nthis is a difficult decision, it is a necessary one.\n  Logic and history dictate that these individuals will certainly not \nreturn to their native countries voluntarily. In addition, it is not \npossible to apprehend and return all of them involuntarily. If \napprehensions continue at the present rate and new illegal immigration \nceases, it would still take 228 years for this country to be free of \nillegal immigrants.\n  In the meantime, a significant segment of our population is living in \nthe shadows and in constant fear of being caught working for low wages, \noften in terrible conditions, without health care, without a way to \nredress any crimes against them. So many being forced to live this way \nlowers the standard of living for all of us--by decreasing job \nopportunities, lowering wages and the standards of working conditions \nfor the American workforce, and burdening our hospitals and law \nenforcement agencies. It is not just a problem for the illegal \npopulation, it is a problem for all of us. And it is time we address \nit. This bill does address it, and I believe in a fair way. It is not \nwhat opponents have called amnesty. These people are not illegal one \nday and enjoying the rights and benefits of legal residency the next \nwithout any sacrifice or work on their part. I would like to take a \nmoment to put these provisions I am about to discuss in a historical \ncontext.\n  For the vast majority of our Nation's history, there were few, if \nany, requirements for immigrants entering this country. The first \nrestrictive immigration laws, other than those racially based, were not \npassed until the late 1880s and did not substantially change for \nseveral decades, including during the height of European immigration in \nthe early 1900s. These laws excluded convicts, polygamists, \nprostitutes, persons suffering from loathsome or contagious diseases, \nand persons liable to become public charges. The 1917 literacy \nrequirement required individuals to be able to write out 40 words in \nsome language, not necessarily English.\n  These requirements, I would say, were not particularly strenuous. The \nINS, once established in 1891, actually ran its own schools and \nsupplied textbooks to help immigrants learn English and civics. There \nwas no requirement to work or have marketable skills. For the most \npart, if you arrived and were relatively healthy, you were admitted. So \nby these standards, the requirements for earned adjustment are much \nmore significant.\n  First, in order to receive the most benefits from this bill, an \nindividual must prove he or she has already lived in this country for 5 \nyears--time to become a part of the community and, it should be noted, \nthe residency requirement since 1802. These individuals will also have \nto prove they worked 3 of the past 5 years and then must work \ncontinuously for the next 6 years. They must pay all unpaid back income \ntaxes. They must demonstrate an understanding of the English language \nand an understanding of the history and government of this country. \nThey must submit to fingerprinting and background checks and meet the \nhealth and security requirements of every other alien entering the \ncountry. Also, they are placed at the ``back of the line'' of \napplications for adjustment, and, as we all know, that wait is several \nyears. They also have to pay a $2,000 fine as well as other processing \nfees.\n  Those who have been in this country since January 7, 2004, and have \nbeen employed since that time may apply for status called deferred \nmandatory departure which would allow them to remain in this country \nfor an additional 3 years.\n\n  During that time, these individuals can apply for immigrant or \nnonimmigrant status, but ultimately they must leave the country in \norder to be admitted under that legal status. These hurdles are high \nand a far cry from amnesty. They strike the proper balance in punishing \nthose who came here illegally and addressing the problems of some \nillegal aliens in the country.\n  One of the original provisions of S. 2611 about which I had \nsignificant reservations was the originally proposed H-2C guest worker \nprogram. It would create a new visa category--providing visas for \nhundreds of thousands of low-skilled workers each year. I understand \nthe argument that this new program is a way to regulate and hopefully \nslow the flow of illegal aliens who will continue to cross our borders, \nbut I was\n\n[[Page S4938]]\n\nconcerned about immediately implementing the program as it was \noriginally drafted.\n  I believe, however, that it has been vastly improved by the amendment \nprocess here on the floor. Senators Dorgan and Stabenow were the first \nto note the flaws in this program during debate on their amendment to \neliminate the program, an amendment which was tabled. Further \namendments, however, fix many of these flaws.\n  I wish to commend Senator Bingaman for his amendment, which passed, \nthat reduces the number of H-2C visas allotted annually to 200,000 and \neliminates the provision that would allow this number to automatically \nincrease in future years. This amendment provides some needed \nlimitation on the H-2C program until we see how all the provisions of \nS. 2611 are working.\n  I also wish to commend Senator Obama for offering his amendment, \nwhich was accepted and which provides adequate requirements for the \nwages offered to H-2C visa workers. One of the greatest challenges of \nallowing low-skilled workers in this country is balancing their needs \nwith the needs of the American labor force. Over the past 32 months, \nreal average hourly earnings have fallen by 1.2 percent. Without \nadequate protections, an influx of workers who will accept lower wages \nrisks bringing down the wages and working conditions of everyone. I \nalso worry that companies will use this visa program as a recruiting \ndevice for cheap labor rather than truly offering opportunities to \nindividuals who want a better life in the United States. Senator \nObama's amendment will work against those dangers, and I am pleased it \nwas included.\n  I must state that I continue to have one concern about this program--\nthe bilateral agreement. For our immigration system to truly work, it \nis critical that the United States have cooperation regarding \nenforcement with countries and citizens flocking to this country. I \nwas, therefore, pleased to find that S. 2611 requires the United States \nto enter into bilateral agreements on numerous issues, including taking \nback aliens removed from the United States, document forgery, \nsmuggling, human trafficking, and gang membership. However, this bill \ndoes not state that these bilateral agreements must be completed before \nthe H-2C program is established. I believe a delay in concluding \nbilateral agreements may undercut the purpose of the H-2C program.\n  I will continue to monitor the situation, and I believe it is an \nissue Congress may have to address again in the near future.\n  Let me conclude very briefly by pointing out that there is a category \nof residents here, the Liberian community, who have been here legally \nsince the late 1980s. For years, I have been endeavoring to provide \nrelief so that these individuals, who are important and decent members \nof communities all across this country, could reach permanent status in \nUnited States and aspire to citizenship. I am pleased to note that in \nthis bill, there is a means to do that. They can avail themselves of \nthe mechanism others will use for their pathway to citizenship. It is \nlong overdue.\n  I am disappointed that we could not specifically rectify this problem \nyears ago and recognize their contributions as legal residents here \nunder temporary protective status. But I am pleased that this \nlegislation will go a long way to give the Liberian community a pathway \nto citizenship.\n  I am pleased to support this legislation. I commend the sponsors and \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee and Senator Kennedy for their \nwork.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the following \nfirst-degree amendments be in order: First, Senator Leahy on No. 4117, \nwith 20 minutes equally divided; Senator Grassley on title III, with 20 \nminutes for Senator Cornyn, 5 minutes for Senator Kennedy, 5 minutes \nfor Senator Obama, 5 minutes for Senator Kyl, and 10 minutes for \nmyself; Senator Lieberman, No. 4036, with the time agreement to be \ndetermined; Senator Durbin on a humanitarian waiver amendment, with \ntime to be determined; Senator Kennedy, No. 4106, with the time \nagreement to be decided.\n  I further ask, following those amendments, the next first-degree \namendments be in order: McConnell, 4085; Gregg, 4114; Hutchison, 4101; \nBurns, 4124; Chambliss, 4084; Cornyn, 4097; Sessions, 4108; Kyl, 4134.\n  Provided further that it be in order to have first-degree amendments \noffered by the Democratic leader or his designee between each of the \npreceding Republican amendments.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that if cloture is invoked on the \nbill and if any of the above listed amendments have not been offered \nprior to the expiration of time under rule XXII, it be in order to call \nthat amendment prior to third reading of the bill. I further ask \nconsent that it be in order any time during the consideration of these \namendments to consider a managers' amendment which has been cleared by \nboth managers and notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII.\n  I think I specified on Senator Leahy's amendment 4117 that the 20 \nminutes equally divided would be followed by a tabling motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, the Senator is referring to \nthe Leahy-Coleman-Kennedy-Sununu-Lieberman-Chafee amendment. He had not \nmentioned a motion to table. He has a right to make a motion to table \nat any time. On the Leahy-Coleman-Sununu-Chafee-et al. amendment, I \nhope the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee would at \nleast listen to this debate, of our efforts to protect these child \nsoldiers before the Senator moves to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I always listen with great care to \nanything the very distinguished Senator from Vermont has to say, but in \norder to get consent to this unanimous consent agreement, it was found \nto be necessary to insert the language, which I did.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have no objection to that. I just want to make my point. \nWe are trying to protect these women who have been raped and mutilated \nand these children forced into involuntary servitude and others who \nhave stood up when the United States has asked them to help defend us.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Does that last comment come out of Senator Leahy's time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is when I reserved my right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We intend to notify the Senate what these Democratic \namendments will be. They will be interspersed as rapidly as we can. We \nwill do that, hopefully, before the end of the afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4117\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this bipartisan amendment I offer is on \nbehalf of the distinguished Presiding Officer, Senator Coleman, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Lieberman, Senator Chafee, Senator Harkin, Senator \nBingaman, and Senator Sununu.\n  We have had unintended consequences because of changes made in \nimmigration laws after September 11. Rightly so, they were modified to \nprotect national security, but we made them so broad that many people \nhave been prevented from entering our Nation, people who do us no harm.\n  The PATRIOT Act and the subsequent REAL ID Act modified definitions \nof ``terrorist activity'' and ``material support'' in order to block \nentry into the United States of individuals who assist terrorist \norganizations. On its face, that made sense. No one wants terrorists or \ntheir supporters to come here as refugees.\n  But the new law failed to recognize that many foreigners, including \nchildren, are forced against their will to give food, shelter or other \nassistance to terrorist groups.\n  It also defined ``terrorist organization'' so broadly that groups \nthat are\n\n[[Page S4939]]\n\nnot engaged in activities against civilians--freedom fighters that the \nU.S. Government once provided training and other material support to--\nlike the Montagnards in Vietnam--are covered by this broad definition.\n  Our amendment would bring American laws once again into line with \nAmerican values. It would give U.S. officials the ability to separate \nthe victims from the aggressors, and it will bring our immigration laws \ninto harmony with our government's foreign policy.\n  We can prevent the entry of those who would do America harm without \nclosing our borders to genuine refugees who urgently need our help.\n  Let me give a few examples. A 13-year-old girl is kidnapped, she is \nforced to become a member of the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda, \nbecome a soldier, basically a sex slave of one of the commanders. She \nis ineligible for admission as a refugee under current law. That is \nwrong. In fact, it is immoral.\n  The same goes for people who provide material support to FARC, the \nterrorist group in Colombia. The support they gave was digging graves \nfor other victims of the terrorists or giving them food, or otherwise \nbeing shot themselves.\n  Or a Liberian woman who was kidnapped by a rebel group and forced to \nserve as a sex slave. She was also forced to cook and do laundry for \nthe rebels, so she is considered to have given material support and she \nis barred. That makes no sense.\n  People who are barred for supporting a terrorist organization--which \nis broadly defined as any group of two or more people fighting a \ngovernment--includes refugees who our own government has long \nsupported.\n  The Vietnamese Montagnards, who supported the United States 35 years \nago, are barred. Members of the Karen Tribe fighting against the \nBurmese junta are barred. Some anti-Castro Cubans are barred.\n  Afghans who fought with the Northern Alliance, and even the NATO \nsoldiers who trained them, are barred. We never intended to do that.\n  After 8 months of interagency inertia, the Secretary of State \nrecently issued a waiver for one group of Burmese refugees who live in \na refugee camp in Thailand. The use of the waiver authority was long \noverdue and I welcomed the Secretary's action. But the waiver was too \nlimited, and will help only a minority of those deserving help, who are \nwaiting to be resettled here.\n  When the waiver was issued, the State Department asserted that it did \nnot plan to extend it to other groups in the near future.\n  Infighting between executive branch agencies is preventing people who \nhave been victimized in the most brutal ways from obtaining asylum.\n  The bipartisan amendment that we offer today modifies the law so that \nbefore the overly broad definition of a terrorist organization is \napplied to a group of two or more individuals, the Secretary of State \nmust determine that the group engages in terrorist activity which poses \na threat to U.S. nationals or the national security of the United \nStates.\n  That is the right balance. It protects U.S. security, and it provides \nsanctuary for victims of repression.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains for the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has not yet called up the \namendment, so there is no time running.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is not bad. Mr. President, I did not do that \nintentionally, but I think it may be protecting the distinguished \nPresiding Officer. I now call up amendment No. 4117.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk shall report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for himself, Mr. \n     Coleman, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Harkin, \n     Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Sununu, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4117.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend section 212 of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n           regarding restrictions on the admission of aliens)\n\n       On page 65, line 24, strike ``f'' and insert the following;\n       (f) Terrorist Organizations.--\n       (1) Definitions.--Section 212(a)(3)(B)(vi) (8 U.S.C. \n     1182(a)(3)(B)(vi)) is amended by striking subclause (III) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(III) that is a group of two or more individuals, whether \n     organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which \n     engages in, the activities described in subclauses (I) \n     through (VI) of clause (iv), and that the Secretary of State, \n     in consultation with or upon the request of the Attorney \n     General or the Secretary of Homeland Security, has determined \n     that these activities threaten the security of United States \n     nationals or the national security of the United States.\n       ``(vii) Applicability.--Clause (iv)(VI) shall not apply \n     to--\n       ``(I) any active or former member of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States with regard to activities undertaken in the \n     course of official military duties; or\n       ``(II) any alien determined not to be a threat to the \n     security of United States nationals or the national security \n     of the United States and who is not otherwise inadmissible on \n     security related grounds under this subparagraph.''.\n       (2) Temporary admission of non-immigrants.--Section \n     212(d)(3)(B)(i) (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(3)(B)(i)) is amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(i) The Secretary of State, after consultation with the \n     Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, or \n     the Secretary of Homeland Security, after consultation with \n     the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, may conclude \n     in such Secretary's sole unreviewable discretion that \n     subclause (IV)(bb), (VI), or (VII) of subsection (a)(3)(B)(i) \n     shall not apply to an alien, that subsection \n     (a)(3)(B)(iv)(VI) shall not apply with respect to any \n     material support an alien afforded to an organization (or its \n     members) or individual that has engaged in a terrorist \n     activity, or that subsection (a)(3)(B)(vi)(III) shall not \n     apply to a group, or to a subgroup of such group, within the \n     scope of that subsection. The Secretary of State may not, \n     however, exercise discretion under this clause with respect \n     to an alien once removal proceedings against the alien are \n     instituted under section 240.''.\n       (g)\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that of the time \navailable to the Senator from Vermont, 4 minutes be reserved for the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer and he be allowed to use that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I hope Senators will support this \namendment. It has strong bipartisan support. It speaks to the moral \ngoodness of our Nation. It ensures that the waiver in current law is \navailable to asylum seekers who were forced to join terrorist groups or \nto provide material support against their will.\n  Completely innocent victims of ethnic and other forms of violence and \nrepression are being denied asylum for engaging in the very activity \nthey were forced to engage in, even though they pose no threat to U.S. \nsecurity--child soldiers, sex slaves of people who were among the worst \nviolators of human rights. Those victims are being excluded by our \ngreat, good Nation.\n  They deserve our compassion. Let us bring our laws back in line with \nour values.\n  I hope we will adopt this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from Minnesota on the \nfloor. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment by \nSenators Leahy, Coleman, Lieberman, Sununu, Kennedy, Bingaman, Chafee, \nand Harkin.\n  The distinguished Senator from Vermont has laid out a general \nprinciple we are dealing with here. I would like to make a couple \nobservations, if I may.\n  I would actually like to read from an article in the New York Times \nof April 3--just a couple sentences.\n  In Sierra Leone there was a woman who was kept captive in her house \nfor 4 days by guerillas. The rebels raped her and her daughter and cut \nthem with machetes. Under America's Program for Refugees she would be \neligible to come to safety in the United States, but her application \nfor refugee status has been put on indefinite hold because American law \nsays she has provided material support to terrorists by giving them \nshelter.\n  The same story has been repeated in Liberia. Women who have been \nkidnapped, raped, forced to be sexual slaves, by the definition of \n``material support,'' gave material support. The law makes no exception \nfor duress.\n  In the State of Minnesota, we have individuals who have worked in \ngroups that have been supported by the United States--Hmongs in \nSoutheast Asia resisted the Laos military; Liberians who\n\n[[Page S4940]]\n\ngave de minimis aid under duress; Burmese; Somalians; Cubans resisting \nCastro; Colombians intimidated by the FARC guerrillas--and, again, they \nare in a similar circumstance as we have talked about. But the way the \nlaw is written, they would be denied the opportunity because of the \ndefinition of both ``material support'' and ``terrorist group.''\n  I think some of my colleagues have concerns about this. I know they \nhave raised some questions. We have tried to look at those concerns. \nOne of them is: What is the reason for this? There is a waiver \nprovision in this legislation. The problem is that the labor provision \nis extremely, extremely limited. I believe one of them was negotiated \nfor about 8 months. It does not cover asylum seekers in the U.S. who \nhave been subject to atrocities, who under duress were forced to give \nminimal support but by definition of the law gave ``material support.''\n  So as a result--what I do not think was intentional--when we looked \nat the REAL ID legislation, we revised some of this. I do not think \nthere was an intentional effort here. Sometimes, though, we suffer from \nthe law of unintended consequences. The unintended consequences of the \nbroad definition of ``terrorist organization'' and ``material support'' \nis to deny asylum, to deny entry to individuals who I think under all \ncircumstances across the board--Democrat and Republican, liberal and \nconservative--it would be agreed that opportunity is the right thing to \ndo, such as for the Vietnamese Montagnards, the Karen National Front \nfighting the Burmese junta, the Afghan Northern Alliance that has had \nU.S. support.\n  So what we have here, we believe, is a technical problem that can be \ncorrected. If somebody is a member of a terrorist organization, they \nare not going to be allowed entry into this country. But that is not \nwhat this is about. That is not what we are dealing with here. I hope \nmy colleagues would take a close look at this amendment and understand \nit is the right thing to do, the compassionate thing to do, the \nreasonable thing to do, and one that we will be proud of doing when we \nare finished.\n  There are a lot of folks who have fought for freedom in ways that we \nbelieve they are freedom fighters, a lot of folks who have been subject \nto great abuse, horrific abuse, and yet, somehow, the way things have \nbeen defined or appear to be threats to this country, they do not have \nthe opportunity others have. They are not threats to our security. The \nright thing to do is to support the Leahy-Coleman amendment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record editorials from the New York Times and the Washington Post, \nand an op-ed from the Los Angeles Times in support of this amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 3, 2006]\n\n                         Terrorists or Victims?\n\n       In Sierra Leone there is a woman who was kept captive in \n     her house for four days by guerrillas. The rebels raped her \n     and her daughter and cut them with machetes. Under America's \n     program to resettle refugees, she would be eligible to come \n     to safety in the United States. But her application for \n     refuge has been put on indefinite hold--because American law \n     says that she provided ``material support'' to terrorists by \n     giving them shelter.\n       This law is keeping out of the United States several \n     thousand recognized refugees America had agreed in principle \n     to shelter. By any reasonable definition, they are victims, \n     not terrorists.\n       A Liberian woman was kidnapped by a guerrilla group and \n     forced to be a sexual slave for several weeks. She also had \n     to cook and do laundry. These services are now considered \n     material support to terrorists. In Colombia, the United \n     Nations will no longer ask the United States to admit dozens \n     of refugees who are clearly victims, since all their \n     predecessors have been rejected on material support grounds. \n     One is a woman who gave a glass of water to an armed \n     guerrilla who approached her house. Another is a young man \n     who was kidnapped by paramilitary members on a killing spree \n     and forced to dig graves alongside others. The men, many of \n     whom were shot when their work was finished, never knew if \n     one of the graves would become their own.\n       The law makes no exception for duress. It also treats any \n     group of two or more people fighting a government as \n     terrorists no matter how justified the cause, or how long ago \n     the struggle. So the United States has turned away Chin \n     refugees, for supporting an armed group fighting against the \n     Myanmar dictatorship, which has barred them from practicing \n     their religion. The United States has acknowledged that the \n     law would also bar Iraqis who helped American marines find \n     Jessica Lynch.\n       The law does not formally reject these applicants but \n     places them on indefinite hold. No one accused of material \n     support has ever had that hold lifted. The Department of \n     Homeland Security can supposedly waive the material support \n     provision but has never done so.\n       Clearly, Congress needs to add an exception for duress, \n     allow the secretary of state to designate armed movements as \n     nonterrorist, and allow supporters of legitimate groups to \n     gain refuge. These changes would pose no risk of admitting \n     terrorists to the United States and would keep America from \n     further victimizing those who have already suffered at the \n     hands of terrorist groups.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 28, 2006]\n\n                        How Not To Treat Friends\n\n       Congress tightened a law last year on refugee admissions in \n     order (it thought) to keep terrorists and their supporters \n     out of the country. The effect has been to bar friends and \n     allies.\n       One example: Many Vietnamese Montagnards fought alongside \n     U.S. forces during the Vietnam War and were then murderously \n     oppressed by the Vietnamese government. During the war, the \n     United States helped arm a Montagnard group called the United \n     Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races, which continued \n     to struggle for autonomy after the war ended. This group \n     ceased to exist in 1992, when a band of nearly 400 fighters \n     disarmed and were resettled in North Carolina. Under \n     Congress's irrational new rules, however, the group has \n     become, legally speaking, a terrorist organization, and 11 \n     Montagnards still stuck in Cambodia would be denied refugee \n     status because in the past they had offered the group \n     ``material support.''\n       The Montagnards are not the law's only, or even principal, \n     victims. Thousands of ethnic victims of the Burmese military \n     regime, living in camps in Thailand, expected after long \n     waits to receive refugee status; now they're stuck in limbo. \n     So are large numbers of Colombians who were forced to support \n     the leftist rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of \n     Colombia. Liberians, Somalis and anti-Castro Cuban dissidents \n     are also being branded terrorists and kept out.\n       Misguided law now prevents the admission of a member or \n     backer of any group of ``two or more individuals'' that \n     ``engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in,'' \n     activities as commonplace as using an ``explosive, firearm or \n     other weapon or dangerous device.'' The law treats a \n     Montagnard who once aided a U.S.-backed group no differently \n     from an al-Qaeda operative. The administration has the \n     authority to override this absurdity in certain instances, \n     though not all. But it has not used this limited power, and \n     even the need for a waiver is galling. America should not be \n     ``forgiving'' people who did not, in fact, support terrorism. \n     These are victims--exactly the sort of people refugee and \n     asylum programs are meant to protect.\n       An amendment being offered to the supplemental \n     appropriations bill by Sens. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), Norm \n     Coleman (R-Minn.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) would solve \n     the problem cleanly. It would clarify that only associates \n     and supporters of groups certified by the government as \n     terrorist organizations should be denied refugee status and \n     that those forced to aid terrorists are not themselves \n     terrorists. Congress did not mean to create this problem. \n     Fixing it should not be controversial.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 17, 2006]\n\n                              Fix This Law\n\n       If Congress doesn't quickly fix a major problem it created \n     in the law governing the admission of refugees, tens of \n     thousands of human rights victims will soon begin paying the \n     price. Congress, we assume, never meant to rewrite federal \n     law so that victims of totalitarian regimes and those forced \n     to serve human rights abusers are kept out of the United \n     States. Yet an accumulation of legal changes in recent years, \n     culminating in the Real ID Act last year, has done just \n     that--paralyzing America's traditionally generous refugee \n     admission program. The United States is supposed to admit up \n     to 70,000 refugees this year, though it probably will take \n     around 55,000 under the best of circumstances. Yet human \n     rights advocates estimate that between 10,000 and 20,000 \n     people may be barred because of irrationally broad legal \n     definitions of terrorism, support for terrorism and terrorist \n     groups--definitions that make no distinction between this \n     country's enemies and those it ought to protect.\n       The law makes ineligible for admission members or \n     supporters of any group that contains ``two or more \n     individuals, whether organized or not, [which] engages in, or \n     has a subgroup which engages in'' activities as broad as \n     using an ``explosive, firearm or other weapon or dangerous \n     device.'' It makes no exception for people compelled to \n     support a group--for example, Colombian peasants forced to \n     aid the leftist rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of \n     Colombia. Nor does\n\n[[Page S4941]]\n\n     it exempt someone who took up arms--or sheltered or fed \n     someone who did--against the murderous Burmese government.\n       The result is that people around the world whose struggles \n     America backs find themselves ineligible for refugee status \n     here. The problem is most acute for Colombians and large \n     numbers of people of the Karen and Chin ethnic groups whom \n     the Burmese military junta has brutally repressed. But \n     Liberians, Somalis and Vietnamese Montagnards have also \n     gotten caught up in the problem. Even some Cuban dissidents \n     who once helped anti-Castro forces may be found ineligible. \n     The Bush administration has acknowledged that members of \n     Afghanistan's Northern Alliance would be barred under the law \n     as well; they, after all, fought alongside our troops.\n       The government has the power to waive the exclusion in some \n     cases, but it hasn't managed to use it yet. Its power is \n     limited, in any event; it can forgive people for their \n     support for terrorism but not for their membership in \n     terrorist groups. Even if it were broader, its categories are \n     all wrong. These people aren't terrorists and shouldn't be \n     labeled as such.\n       Fixing the law would not be hard. At a minimum, Congress \n     needs to make it clear that not every armed, non-state group \n     is a terrorist organization. Not all such groups attack \n     civilians; some are U.S. allies fighting legitimate military \n     struggles against evil governments. What's more, the law \n     needs to recognize that people forced to aid terrorists are \n     victims of terror, not terrorists themselves. Time is running \n     out. Congress must act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Mar. 29, 2006]\n\n                        Terrorist or Terrorized?\n\n                            (By George Rupp)\n\n       In his second inaugural address, President Bush made a \n     stirring commitment to oppressed people yearning to be free: \n     ``When you stand for your liberty, we will stand with you.''\n       For half a century, one of the best expressions of that \n     bond has been the federal Refugee Resettlement Program. This \n     State Department-administered program seeks to offer a safe \n     harbor to those fearing persecution by tyrannical \n     governments. But thousands of people whose lives are at risk \n     for standing up for freedom will this year be denied help \n     because of a Kafkaesque interpretation of who is deemed a \n     terrorist.\n       The laws governing eligibility for refugee status have long \n     denied it to anyone who commits a terrorist act or who \n     provides ``material support'' to terrorists. These laws were \n     strengthened after 9/11. The problem was created by recent \n     legislation that expanded the definition of terrorists. There \n     are real-life consequences from such myopic ``reform.''\n       In Colombia, for example, the leftist guerrilla group FARC \n     often kidnaps civilians and demands ransom from their \n     relatives. FARC also requires the payment of a ``war tax'' \n     from Colombians in the regions it controls, upon threat of \n     serious harm. Nearly 2,000 Colombians who faced such \n     circumstances as paying a ransom or ``tax''--and who later \n     fled the country and were determined by the United Nations to \n     be refugees--have been denied U.S. resettlement on the basis \n     of the ``material support'' provision.\n       In Liberia, a female head of a household was referred to \n     the U.S. resettlement program by the Office of the United \n     Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as a person \n     particularly vulnerable to attack. Rebels had come to her \n     home, killed her father and beat and gang-raped her. The \n     rebels held her hostage in her own home and forced her to \n     wash their clothes. The woman escaped after several weeks and \n     made her way to a refugee camp. The Department of Homeland \n     Security has decided that because the rebels lived in her \n     house and she washed their clothes, she had provided \n     ``material support'' to the rebels; the case has been placed \n     on hold.\n       A Sierra Leonean woman's house was attacked by rebels in \n     1992. A young family member was killed with machetes, another \n     minor was subjected to burns and the woman and her daughter \n     were raped. The rebels kept the family captive for days in \n     their own home. Homeland Security has placed the case on hold \n     for ``material support'' concerns because the family is \n     deemed to have provided housing to the rebels. Under this \n     interpretation, it does not matter whether the support \n     provided was given willingly or under duress.\n       Unfortunately, the actions of Homeland Security go far \n     beyond barring the affected refugees from entering the U.S. \n     They become permanently tainted by suspicions of terrorism \n     and find themselves shut out by other nations that resettle \n     refugees. And the governments now providing these people with \n     temporary asylum might even force them back to the nations \n     they fled.\n       U.S. policy toward authoritarian governments has been \n     turned on its head: The victims of terrorism are being denied \n     protection and sanctuary. The secretary of Homeland Security \n     has the authority to determine that the ``material support'' \n     provision shall not apply to certain individuals or groups. \n     Yet the department has failed to issue guidance, causing mass \n     confusion and holding up decisions on refugee cases. Neither \n     the administration nor Congress seems able to fix the problem \n     for fear of being labeled weak on terrorism.\n       Yes, we must remain vigilant against terrorists. But in \n     order to implement Bush's commitment to stand with those \n     seeking liberty at great personal risk. Homeland Security \n     Secretary Michael Chertoff or Congress must rectify the \n     injustice that treats victims of coercion as supporters of \n     terrorism.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor to briefly discuss amendment No. \n4177. It pertains to title III and I believe will be called in short \norder. It is a bipartisan effort to create the kind of employment \nverification system that will ensure that American workers are \nprotected. It is an amendment that I worked on with Senator Grassley, \nas well as Senator Kennedy. And as I indicated, it will be offered \nshortly.\n  One of the central components of immigration reform is enforcement. \nThis bill contains a number of important provisions to beef up border \nsecurity. But that is not enough. Real enforcement also means drying up \nthe pool of jobs that encourages illegal immigration. That can only \nhappen if employers do not hire illegal workers. Unfortunately, our \ncurrent employer enforcement system does little to nothing to deter \nillegal immigrants from finding work.\n  Just a few statistics: Overall, the number of workplace arrests of \nillegal immigrants fell from 17,552 in 1997 to 451 in 2002, even as \nillegal immigration grew during that time. Moreover, between 25 percent \nto 40 percent of all undocumented immigrants are people who have \noverstayed their visas. They are not folks who will be stopped by a \nwall. Rather, the only way to effectively deter overstays is to reduce \ntheir access to employment.\n  When Congress last passed an immigration bill in 1986, we did not \nprovide any meaningful way for employers to check legal eligibility to \nwork. Currently, employees can prove their legal status by showing a \nvariety of documents, and employers are supposed to record their \ninspection of such documents by filling out an I-9 form for each \nemployee. As a consequence, the market for fraudulent documents--fake \nSocial Security cards, driver's licenses, birth certificates--has \nexploded.\n  Unfortunately, with more than 100 million employees in more than 6 \nmillion workplaces, and only about 788 Wage and Hour investigators, \nemployer sanctions have basically become a nuisance requirement to \nmaintain records, not a serious risk of penalty. As a result, the \nnumber of ``intent to fine'' notices issued to employers for hiring \nundocumented workers dropped from 417 in 1999 to just 3 in 2004. I want \nto repeat that. There were three employers in the entire United States \nin 2004 who were fined for hiring undocumented workers.\n  Now, understandably, employers cannot always detect forged documents. \nAnd employers who reject workers with questionable documents risk \nemployment discrimination suits. That is why we need a better \nalternative. We need an electronic verification system that can \neffectively detect the use of fraudulent documents, significantly \nreduce the employment of illegal workers, and give employers the \nconfidence that their workforce is legal.\n\n[[Page S4942]]\n\n  When Congress first considered comprehensive immigration reform in \nApril, the legislation on the floor addressed this problem by creating \na national employment eligibility verification system. Senators \nGrassley, Kyl, and I all thought this was a good idea in theory, but we \nhad concerns with the design of the system.\n  Senators Grassley and Kyl proposed that a verification system be \nimplemented nationally within 18 months. Senators Kennedy and I \nproposed that the system be phased in over 5 years but that it also \nincluded additional accuracy and privacy standards, as well as strict \nprohibitions on the use of the system to discriminate against legal \nworkers.\n  Over the past few weeks, we have been in discussions to try to \nnegotiate a compromise. I am pleased that we have reached an agreement \nby which all employers would have to participate by 18 months after the \nDepartment of Homeland Security receives the appropriations necessary \nto receive the funds needed to fund the system. All new employees hired \nwould have to be run through a system. A series of privacy and accuracy \nstandards would protect citizens and legal immigrants from errors in \nthe system and breaches of private information. To make sure that \nemployers take the system seriously, we strengthen civil penalties for \nemployers who hire unauthorized workers, and we establish criminal \npenalties for repeat violators.\n  I think we worked in a constructive, bipartisan manner to design an \nemployment verification system that is fair to legal workers and tough \non illegal workers. I think it is a good amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the Leahy \namendment and just warn my colleagues that this is not a benign \namendment but is one of the most serious amendments that has been \nproposed to this legislation and, if it is adopted, literally would \nallow us to take somebody from the Taliban into the United States.\n  There is already a law that provides full waiver authority to the \nSecretary of State to allow entry into this country for someone who \nhappened to be caught up in terrorist activity, albeit innocently--the \nvillager who is forced to give rice and water to a Taliban member. \nThere is nothing that prevents the Secretary of State from allowing \nthat person to come into this country.\n  This is literally a solution looking for a problem. And it is \npernicious because it literally allows entry into this country of \nmembers of the Taliban because the Taliban is not a designated \nterrorist organization or a person who assists an organization which \nthreatens other countries and peoples but not the United States.\n\n  Under the specific language of the amendment, there are three \nspecific exceptions. One is the Secretary of State, in consultation \nwith or upon the request of the Attorney General or Secretary of \nHomeland Security, has determined that these activities threaten the \nsecurity of United States nationals or the national security of the \nUnited States. So you can threaten the security of Israel or Sri Lanka \nor India or some other country and support that terrorist organization \nbut be permitted to come into the United States. What sense does that \nmake?\n  There is no problem here that cannot be dealt with under existing \nlaw. Show me where in existing law the Secretary of State does not have \ncomplete and unfettered authority to waive the provisions of the law. \nThis is a law about terrorists, people who provide material support to \nterrorist organizations not being allowed into the United States. I \nknow the good intentions of the sponsors of the amendment, but the fact \nis, some villager who is forced to provide aid and comfort to a \nterrorist organization can get entry into the United States without \nthis language which opens a huge loophole. Never in the past have we \nsaid it is OK to let a member of the Taliban come in simply because the \nTaliban is not a designated organization.\n  You might ask: Why, with all of the other terrorist organizations, \nisn't the Taliban a designated organization? Of the 42 groups in the \nworld that have been certified by the Secretary of State, it is not. \nThe reason is because it is a serious matter to designate someone. For \nexample, once they are designated, then giving anything of value to \nthat group constitutes a Federal felony punishable by 15 years in \nprison. And as a result, the failure to designate the Taliban would be \nthe type of group that if you give material support or aid to would \npermit you entry into the United States. Because the Department of \nState is conservative with these certifications and they have \nsubstantial collateral consequences, not every group that would fall \ninto the category of a terrorist group is going to be designated, and \nthe Taliban is a perfect example.\n  I urge my colleagues, simply because your heart yearns to help \nsomeone who might have been forced under a concept of duress to support \na terrorist organization or an organization like the Taliban that is \nnot designated as a terrorist organization, don't adopt this amendment \nunder the mistaken view that there is no other remedy. There is a \nremedy. Clearly, under circumstances of duress, that remedy can be \ninvoked.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this very dangerous amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes 52 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this is the third version of this \namendment that has been circulated on this bill. It may well be that an \nearlier version of this basic idea would merit support from Senators, \nbut in its present form, it is not worthy of support because it \nredefines what is material support. What constitutes material support \nis a complex issue. Before the Senate passes on it, there ought to be \nan analysis and hearings. The Judiciary Committee has had a whole \nseries of hearings but none on this subject.\n  The amendment further narrows the definition of what constitutes a \nterrorist organization. There, again, it is a complicated subject. It \nought to be analyzed and considered at a hearing so that Senators have \na record basis for making a determination as to whether it ought to be \nadopted. These are hardly the kinds of complex issues which can be \ndecided without a record, without a hearing, and without analysis.\n  The Senator from Arizona has cited the Taliban, but there are many \nother citations that could be given. Kurdish terrorists in Turkey might \nbe admitted under this amendment because they pose no threat to the \nUnited States of America. Basque terrorists in Spain might be admitted \nbecause they pose no threat to the United States of America. Hamas, \nwhich poses a deadly threat to Israel, might be admitted to the United \nStates because they arguably pose no threat on the face of it to our \nnational security. So we have an amendment which is very broad and \nchanges really fundamental definitions, in redefining material support. \nIn the collateral field of what is a material witness, the definition \ntakes enormous analysis, which I have seen in the criminal law. And to \nnarrow the definition of what is a terrorist organization, so that \norganizations which would be considered terrorist without this \namendment but not terrorist under this amendment, is just not the sort \nof thing that ought to be done by the U.S. Senate without a full \nhearing, without analysis and a record basis for making such a broad, \nimportant distinction.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 12 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, no one has any intention or desire to \npermit terrorists into this country. It is setting up a straw man to \nsay something would let the Taliban in here. This amendment is not \nabout the Taliban, incidentally. Our government supported them very \nstrongly through our\n\n[[Page S4943]]\n\nCIA and others, as the press has reported, during the Soviet Union \ndays. But this amendment is not about terrorists. It is about genuine \nrefugees who have been victims of the very brutality that is now \npreventing them from receiving asylum in this country.\n  I will give a practical example. We trained and supported the \nVietnamese Montagnards. We trained and equipped them. We asked them to \nfight with us. Now we deny them asylum because they risked their lives \nto do what we asked them to do. The Burmese, who are fighting a brutal \nregime, our government supports them. Many are refugees. But even \nthough they have not been designated a foreign terrorist organization \nand our government supports them, they are inadmissible. There are \ncases of women and children threatened with torture and death and \nforced to provide food, shelter or become the sex slaves of members of \nterrorist groups. Our law bars them from asylum.\n  We are giving them discretion. I cannot believe that President Bush \nor Secretary Rice is going to misuse this discretion to allow in \nterrorists.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes and 52 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I agree with Senator Leahy on one \nimportant point. That is, he does not intend to offer an amendment to \nlet terrorists into the United States. But his amendment does. Senator \nLeahy's intentions are pure because I know Senator Leahy. But the most \nrevealing part about Senator Leahy's last rebuttal was that he didn't \ndeny my basic contention that it redefines what is material support, \nwhat constitutes material support, or the complexity of that issue.\n  Senator Leahy does not deny that it narrows the definition of what \nconstitutes a terrorist organization, nor does he deny that on the face \nof his language, Kurdish terrorists who are terrorizing Turkey might \ncome into the United States or Basque terrorists who are terrorizing \nSpain might come into the United States or the example of Hamas \nterrorizing Israel might come into the United States. The fact is that \nthe existing law is adequate to keep out such individuals, and \nsupporters of this amendment have not met the burden of showing that \nthe law should be changed in the way they have proposed.\n  Secretary Rice recently exercised the waiver to pave the way for the \nresettlement of 9,300 ethnic Karen refugees housed in a camp in \nThailand who backed the Karen National Union. So we have, under \nexisting law, methods for recognizing that some individuals may be \nacting under duress, that they may not be terrorists. That is the kind \nof an analysis which can best be made by the Secretary of State, as \nopposed to the very different concept of litigating such matters. And \nwhen you are dealing on the floor of the Senate with redefining \nmaterial support, redefining what is a terrorist organization, that \nsimply is not the way to legislate.\n  I have great respect for Senator Leahy. He and I have worked together \nto craft this immigration reform bill. He and I have structured the \nhearing list and could have had a hearing on this, had it been deemed \nimportant and had it been deemed necessary to correct a major problem, \nbut it wasn't because existing law is satisfactory to address the \nproblem of individuals providing material support under duress. It is \ndifficult for me to oppose Senator Leahy, the ranking member of the \ncommittee, with whom I have worked so closely. But I do not want to sow \nconfusion in this very important matter on the floor of the Senate by \nredefining very basic concepts in a few minutes in a way which is not \nintelligible.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 58 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 1 minute to Senator Kyl.\n  Mr. KYL. I am not sure if the group that the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee referred to is the same one I will refer to here, \nbut to illustrate the fact that the Secretary of State has unfettered \nauthority to grant these waivers and has in fact done so in the past, \nactually there was a large group of refugees from Burma who were \nrecently permitted asylum in the United States, even though they had \nprovided, allegedly, material support to terrorism. This is an \nauthority which can be exercised, which has been exercised.\n  Secondly, I urge my colleagues who are in support of this underlying \nlegislation on immigration reform, it is a controversial enough piece \nof legislation for the Senate to consider. Amending it in the way that \nthe chairman has described, without the necessary careful consideration \nof what the ramifications would be if this language is too broad, I \nurge that this be done in another way and another time rather than in \nthis bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in my capacity as manager of the bill, it \nis my intention to move next to the Grassley amendment under title III. \nWe will stack votes later because we have a whole series of amendments. \nI think our time can be most effectively used. So at this time I move \nto table the Leahy amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  I withdraw the motion to table.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I was going to say, if the chairman will yield, that if we \nmove to table now, we would have to vote now. I would have no objection \nif the chairman would give me some idea when those votes might be.\n  Mr. SPECTER. To respond to my colleague, I would say sometime around \nthe dinner hour when we see how the debate goes. We have a great many \namendments, and we know when we start to vote it takes much longer than \nthe designated time. I would say somewhere in the 6 o'clock range.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would note to the distinguished chairman, \none of the reasons I agreed to this schedule, to come here and do this \ndebate now, was that there would be a vote now. I am going to be off \nthe Hill for a period of time around dinnertime, and I would like to be \nhere to vote on my own amendment. Could we agree on a time certain, \nlike 5:30, for the tabling motion on the Leahy-Coleman-Sununu \namendment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would be prepared to have the vote \noccur as soon after 5:30 as we finish amendments. I think we may be \nable to have two more amendments in the next hour and a half. I think \nwe can accommodate the request of the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I won't make a unanimous consent request. I \nwill rely on the expertise and long experience of the chairman of the \ncommittee to get that vote in before 5:30.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I must.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am not making a unanimous consent request. I am saying I \nam relying on the representations of the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. May I say, I think that is a wise reliance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I believe the matter that is before the \nSenate now is the title III provisions. Under our agreement, I think I \nhad 5 minutes to speak, am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment has not yet been formally \ncalled up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Once the amendment is pending, the Senator has \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4177\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The amendment as to title III has been filed. I am \nready to take that up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa (Mr. Grassley) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4177.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nObama, Baucus, and Kennedy be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this amendment represents a bipartisan \neffort to create an effective, workable\n\n[[Page S4944]]\n\nemployment verification system. Without a workable verification system, \nthere is no point in having a bill dealing with immigration.\n  The amendment balances the needs of workers, employers, and \nimmigration enforcement. The amendment would replace the current paper \nI-9 process with a new electronic verification system. This new system \nwould allow employers to verify the legal status of their workers \nwithin 3 days of being hired. If the system cannot verify a worker's \nemployment authorization, the employer would be notified and the worker \nmust be discharged. If the system fails to operate as intended and a \nlegitimate worker is erroneously discharged, the worker could be \ncompensated by the Government for lost wages.\n  I understand that some of my colleagues believe that further changes \nare needed with respect to this provision, which would allow a worker \nwho loses his job through no fault of his own to recover lost wages. I \nwill continue to work with them, as chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee with jurisdiction over the provisions in this amendment, on \nthis issue and the questions they have in subsequent conference with \nthe House of Representatives. I believe this amendment must move \nforward, so I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. President, as the Senator pointed out, this really represents a \nvery strong, bipartisan effort to make sure we get a key feature of \nthis immigration reform correct. I wish to express my personal \nappreciation to those who have worked so hard and so well, including \nSenators Grassley, Kyl, Obama, and Baucus and their staffs, who have \ndevoted an enormous amount of time to this issue. It is incredibly \nimportant. We are talking about worksite enforcement, which we all \nagree is a core goal and challenge. If that doesn't work, this \nlegislation, to a great extent, will be very ineffective. But what we \nhave worked out--the inclusion we have in this amendment--I think \neffectively guarantees that it will work out.\n  The core goal is to establish the worksite enforcement system as \nquickly as possible, which will succeed in preventing undocumented \nimmigrants from obtaining employment. I believe everybody agrees that \nthe heart of the system must be the new electronic verification system \nthat allows employers to compare a worker's name and identification \ndata to a central database that confirms or disconfirms the worker's \neligibility to work in the United States. Yet the Basic Pilot upon \nwhich this electronic system will be based did not work well. It has \nerror rates of 10 to 15 percent. In a national system, that would mean \nmillions of Americans would be told every year they do not have the \nright to work in this country. The GAO has told us that the error rate \ncould increase as the system is expanded to a national level.\n  So the core challenge is how to establish a universal verification \nsystem as quickly as possible, while minimizing the risk that we end up \nthrowing millions of American workers out of work or putting thousands \nof employers out of business. The stakes are high. While all our other \ndecisions have profound consequences for millions of immigrants, what \nwe do in title III will directly affect also the working conditions for \nAmericans, so it is enormously important to get it correct.\n  I am pleased to say that our negotiations with all of our colleagues \nhere produced an agreement we can be proud of. We agreed to an \nambitious schedule for implementation. Every employer in the country \nwill be required to participate in the system beginning 18 months after \nfunding for the system is appropriated. At the same time, we agreed on \na number of due process and procedural steps to minimize the risk that \nU.S. citizens and legal immigrants are wrongly harmed by the system--\nproblems which workers and employers are equally eager to avoid.\n  Mr. President, we may have differences about this legislation and \nabout different provisions, but I think everybody agrees that if it \ngoes into effect, we want to make sure it is the best possible system \nwith the best possible protections. I think this amendment which has \nbeen worked out with the leadership of my colleague and friends, \nSenators Grassley, Baucus, Kyl, and Obama, is the best we could \npossibly recommend. We urge the Senate to accept it.\n  I will withhold whatever time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that I have 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I heard the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts and the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Grassley, talk about this amendment as if this were an agreed-\nupon amendment. I understand there has been a lot of work put into this \namendment. I rise to voice objections to the amendment for a number of \nreasons I would like to discuss.\n  This is critical. I agree with Senators Grassley and Kennedy that \nthis is the linchpin of this bill. If we don't get this right, then we \nmight as well pitch it in because the fact is that employment and the \nprospects for employment are the magnets that attract illegal \nimmigrants into the country or people who come legally and overstay in \nviolation of our immigration laws.\n  I think it is important that the very Cabinet member--Secretary \nChertoff--who is going to be responsible for enforcing this immigration \nreform has called this amendment a poison pill. He expressed concerns \nabout the fact that, as currently written--and I understand it is one \nthing to pass a piece of legislation and expect to improve it in the \nconference committee, but I think it is absolutely critical that our \ncolleagues understand what it is they are being asked to vote on. The \nNo. 1 concern I have is that it would create a carve-out, until such \ntime as whatever process is developed would produce a rate of 99-\npercent accuracy, in terms of confirming eligibility of prospective \nemployees to work legally in the United States. A nonanswer would be \nessentially treated as an approval, and that individual would be then \nauthorized to work permanently in the United States.\n  Once we pass this legislation, if it is passed, and it goes to \nconference and the differences are worked out and it is signed by the \nPresident, we all know this is merely an authorization. This is not an \nappropriation. In other words, the money to pay for this, to make it \nhappen, is a matter of the appropriations process. That is not what we \nare doing here. Once the money is appropriated, then we are going to \nhave to see the Department of Homeland Security issue a request for a \nproposal and ask contractors to bid on creating the database and the \nsystem whereby we can verify eligibility of prospective employees. So \nwhat we are talking about is a system that is going to take months, if \nnot years, to implement. But even after it is implemented, until such \ntime as it has a 99-percent accuracy rate, essentially what we are \nsaying is the same old broken illegal immigration system of hiring \npeople who are not authorized to work in the United States is OK.\n  The second problem I point out with this amendment is it creates \nliability on the part of the Federal Government. If, for example, \nsomeone submits their credentials and they are refused a job because \nthey are not qualified to work in the United States, what this does is \ncreate a litigation system that will prove a disincentive for employers \nand the Department of Homeland Security to actually even check \nsomeone's qualifications as to whether they can work legally in the \nUnited States. This was the issue the Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security, Mr. Chertoff, took great issue with. He says, as a \nformer judge, you are going to have determinations made, lawsuits \nfiled, and then you are going to have appeals, and perhaps these \nappeals will take years to finally resolve, and the costs of hiring \nlawyers and the costs to the Government are going to stack up.\n  What is the easiest way for the Government and that individual at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to avoid incurring those additional \ncosts? It is going to be to give the prospective\n\n[[Page S4945]]\n\nemployee a pass and say: OK, you are fine. It proves a powerful \ndisincentive for checking out the eligibility of that prospective \nemployee.\n  Finally, this system would apply to future employees only. This \namendment would limit the period of time in which employers could \nsubmit the credentials of this prospective employee to only 3 days. If, \nfor example, they overlooked the matter and didn't do it for 4 days, \nthey would be prohibited for all time from checking whether this \nindividual could legally work in the United States.\n  So I ask, why would we create a system that is designed to fail? That \nis what this amendment, unfortunately, would do, notwithstanding the \nhard work that has been put into it. I believe the placeholder in title \nIII is vastly superior to this so-called agreement, which is obviously \nnot agreed to--certainly not by the Cabinet member who is responsible \nfor the Department of Homeland Security and certainly not by this \nSenator and others who have had a chance to look at this.\n  Each day, approximately 1,300 migrant workers enter the United States \nto work illegally. The vast majority come here not to commit crimes or \ncause harm but to work. They are looking only to provide for their \nfamilies, and we certainly all understand that. But they pay smugglers \nthousands of dollars and risk their lives crossing the border. They \ntake this risk because they know that once they get into the United \nStates, it won't be difficult to find employers willing to hire them in \nthis black market of human labor. Until the Federal Government removes \nthe magnet of illegal employment, it will not regain control over our \nbroken immigration system.\n  Restricting employment of undocumented workers as a way to reduce \nillegal immigration is not a new concept. In 1981, the bipartisan \nSelect Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy recommended \nlegislation making it illegal to hire undocumented workers. In 1997, \nthe bipartisan U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform stated that \neliminating the employment magnet is the linchpin to a comprehensive \nstrategy to deter unlawful immigration. The U.S. Commission on \nImmigration Reform went on to conclude that the most promising option \nfor verifying work authorization is a computerized registry based on \nthe Social Security number. Yet, 25 years later, after 25 years of \nconsensus, current employment verification laws are unworkable and \nunenforceable.\n  Today the Federal law only requires that employers confirm that \nemployees produced paper documents. There is no general requirement \nthat employers ensure that the paper documents are, indeed, reliable or \notherwise take steps to combat fraud.\n  An employer--and this is the problem with the law as it currently \nstands, not necessarily with employers who are not FBI agents and who \nare not asking to conduct independent investigations or somehow a \nforensic examination of the authenticity of these documents, but under \nthe law today an employer must review some combination of more than 20 \ndifferent documents to determine whether a new worker is legal.\n  In 1996, Congress called for reduction in the number of documents, \nbut 10 years later, the Government has yet to implement those \nregulations. As a result, document fraud and identity theft makes it \neasy for unscrupulous employers to look the other way and hire \nundocumented workers. Yet increasing penalties alone will not work \nbecause ambiguities in the law prevent employers from knowing what \ntheir obligations are with respect to their workforce.\n  Until there is a way for employers to truly know whether their \nworkforce is legal, it will be difficult for them to comply and \ndifficult for the Government to prosecute those who fail to comply. The \nresult is the Government has all but given up enforcing laws governing \nthe work site. The Government has all but given up.\n  In 2003, the Department of Homeland Security dedicated only 90 full-\ntime employees to work site enforcement--90, for a country of almost \n300 million people.\n  In 2004, the Department of Homeland Security issued only three--yes, \nthree--notices of intent to fine employers for violating the work site \nenforcement laws.\n  In 1992, by contrast, the Department issued more than 1,400 notices \nof intent to fine. So we went from 1,400 notices of intent to fine for \ncheating for hiring workers who could not legally work in 1992 to 3 in \n2004. So over the past 12 years, those enforcement efforts have \ndeclined at a rate of 99.8 percent.\n  In the absence of any enforcement whatsoever, many employers \nflagrantly violate our laws. Just a few weeks ago, the Department of \nHomeland Security arrested several managers at the largest pallet \nservices company in the United States. The Government has charged those \nmanagers with conspiring to transport, harbor, and induce illegal \naliens to reside in the United States. On the day of their arrest, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security also took into custody 1,187 \nundocumented workers.\n  According to the records, more than 50 percent of the employee \nrecords had faulty Social Security numbers, and the Social Security \nAdministration had told the company more than a dozen times that they \nhad more than 1,000 employees without accurate Social Security numbers.\n  I wish I could say the allegations against this company are an \nisolated event, but they are not. The truth is, many employers make no \neffort whatsoever to comply with the law.\n  A recent Government Accountability Office report reviewed employer \ntax filings for the years 1985 through 2000 and found that one employer \nsubmitted a single Social Security number--a single Social Security \nnumber--for more than 2,580 different employees in a single tax year. \nOverall, 8,900 employers--just .2 percent of all employers--accounted \nfor more than 30 percent of the total number of incorrect Social \nSecurity number submissions.\n  Get this, Mr. President: Of the 84.6 million records placed in the \nSocial Security earnings suspense fund for tax years 1985 to 2000, \nabout 9 million had Social Security numbers that consisted of nothing \nbut zeros. Obviously, the employer knew they were submitting a bogus \nnumber, and 9 million submitted nothing but zeros. But in the absence \nof any enforcement of the law, any incentive to clean up those numbers, \nany incentive for employers to comply with the law, any infrastructure \nthat allows people to check to determine whether this is a person who \ncan legally work, this is the kind of fraud that occurs.\n  For 3.5 million records, employers used the same Social Security \nnumber to report earnings for multiple workers in a single tax year.\n  The truth is, the Government is decades behind the private sector \nwhen it comes to document integrity. Maybe what we ought to do is issue \na contract and outsource this to MasterCharge and Visa. Maybe they can \ndo a better job.\n  The fact is, this is embarrassing and intolerable and inexcusable \nconduct on the part of the Federal Government. But there is also reason \nfor hope. There is a model that is already in place. Since 1996, the \nFederal Government has run an electronic verification system called \nBasic Pilot. Currently, about 6,000 employers participate in this \nsystem. Members of Congress, for example, are required to use this \nelectronic verification system. And it works. That system should be \nexpanded, and that system should be enforced.\n  We simply must require electronic verification by all employers, not \njust the ones covered by the current law or those who decide to do it \non a voluntary basis. Electronic verification has been tested for more \nthan 10 years, and an independent review of the program found that 96 \npercent of participating employers believed that the electronic \nverification system is an effective tool for employment verification.\n  Reports have also shown that the Department of Homeland Security and \nthe Social Security Administration have made considerable progress in \nimproving the accuracy of data. According to a 2004 report, there is a \n99.8-percent confirmation rate for U.S.-born employees.\n  I can assure you, Mr. President, and my colleagues that without work \nsite enforcement, we will be back here again in 10 years trying to \nfigure out what to do with the next wave of illegal immigrants. We \ncannot afford piecemeal enforcement. We have to secure our border, we \nhave to work with\n\n[[Page S4946]]\n\nlocal and State law enforcement agencies to deal with enforcement in \nthe interior, and we have to have an ability to verify on an accurate \nand expedited basis whether someone can work here legally in the United \nStates. We don't yet have that. This bill does not yet provide it.\n  My hope is that we will get serious, finally, once and for all, in \nholding employers accountable, those who cheat and who provide that \nmagnet that attracts so many people to come into this country \nillegally.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. May I inquire how \nmuch time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I don't have time, so I ask unanimous \nconsent for 2 minutes to address this issue, particularly some of the \nissues Senator Cornyn made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Senator Cornyn has been working very \nfaithfully with us on this issue, so I don't take exception to anything \nhe said except to clarify from my position what I want to accomplish.\n  First, I don't ever pretend to make perfect legislation. The English \nlanguage doesn't allow that, even if that is the good intent. We have \nhad several variations of the amendment that is before us and on which \nwe will be voting. I have always made an attempt to do things through \nmy committee in a bipartisan way. This is a bipartisan amendment. If \nthere is an issue with this amendment that it may not be the linchpin \nfor the verification we want, we are going to have an opportunity in \nconference to fine-tune this amendment. I want the Senator from Texas \nto know that I am open to that, and I hope--I haven't talked to my \ncosponsors, but I hope the cosponsors are also open to it because \neverybody indicated their intent to make sure the verification system \nworks.\n  With that in mind, I hope this amendment will be adopted so we can \nmove this process forward, and anything that needs to be done with this \namendment, including all of the objections that have been raised, will \nbe taken care of in conference.\n  I think we have a good compromise, so I am not starting out with the \nidea that we have to correct it, but we are going to try to address all \nthese concerns because this is a very key part of any immigration bill \nthat we pass.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Iowa, before he \nyields the floor, yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If I have time, I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will give him a minute of my time by unanimous consent, \nif that will help.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I guess the question I have for the \nSenator is, if this amendment fails, there is a provision in the \nunderlying bill that would go to the conference committee; isn't that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is correct.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I understand the obligation of the Senator from Iowa, as \nchairman of the Finance Committee, to try to work on a bipartisan \nbasis, and I know he is committed to do that, and that is what this \namendment represents. But I want to make clear that in the absence of \nthis amendment being adopted, we still have a title III provision that \ncan go to conference committee and be the subject of further \nnegotiations.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, if the Senator will allow me to continue to use \nsome of his time, I hope we would agree on this at least: If somebody \nis not employed because of a mistake that the Federal Government made, \nthat we have a responsibility to make sure that person is made whole; \nthat nobody should lose a job or not get a job because of a mistake \nmade by some Federal bureaucrat. With that in mind, we ought to be able \nto move forward.\n  I think I heard the Senator from Texas say that is his motivation, \nthat he would want to make sure nobody was harmed economically, not \ngetting a job because of a mistake that the Federal Government made.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to Senator \nGrassley for his good work in this area. I do agree with him that we \nneed to make sure, if there is a false positive--in other words, if \nsomeone should not be excluded from employment but the system says they \nshould be and they are--that they ought to have some recourse.\n  My hope is that we would create a way for that record, if it is \nerroneous, to be corrected without everybody hiring a lawyer and going \nto their respective corners and then meeting in a courtroom and \nlitigating the issues that could perhaps be worked out without that \nkind of experience.\n  I also want to make sure, as I know the Secretary of the Department \nof Homeland Security told both Senator Grassley and myself, that we \ndon't unintentionally create some disincentive for people to hold \nemployers accountable for hiring people who aren't qualified to work. I \nthink we can certainly work to that end to try to balance it so it is \nnot a disincentive to work site verification and sanctions against \nemployers who cheat, but at the same time it is also fair to the \nemployees.\n  The other problem is, this amendment and what we have done so far on \nthis bill does not require the issuance of a secure Social Security \ncard or employment authorization document. We had numerous witnesses \ntestifying to the need for such a secure card. I believe employers \nwould welcome the ease of being able to rely on a single document that \ncould be literally swiped through a card reader, such as a debit card \nor a credit card at a convenience store.\n  This bill, as amended by this amendment, would retain the complicated \ndocument scheme that has led to widespread document fraud and identity \ntheft. And as I said, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity has stated his objections to this amendment. I realize he is \nnot a Senator; he doesn't get to vote. But I do think we ought to \nconsult with and respect the views of those who are going to have the \nresponsibility to actually make this system work.\n\n  It concerns me that 20 years after the 1986 amnesty and the promise \nof work site enforcement that the agency responsible for enforcing \nthose laws is telling Congress the new system would not work. My hope \nis that we would find a way to make it work. There may be some--I am \nnot one of them--who don't want there to be enforcement, who don't want \nthe system to work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. My hope is that we would all work together in good faith \nto make that happen. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are looking for stacked votes at 5:30, \nas mentioned during the discussion with Senator Leahy. If we cannot get \nanother debate completed on another amendment before 5:30, we will only \nhave the two votes. But if it is possible to have Senator Lieberman \ncome to the floor or Senator Durbin, it would be appreciated by the \nmanagers to try to move the bill along. We now have 5 minutes for \nSenator Kennedy, 5 minutes for Senator Obama, and 5 minutes for Senator \nKyl.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have just conferred with the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, and we are going to yield all \ntime back on--we had time listed, as I announced a little while ago, \nfor 5 minutes for Senator Obama and 5 minutes for Senator Kyl, but \nSenator Obama has spoken and Senator Kyl spoke on the preceding \namendment. Let's yield all time back.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. All time back.\n  Mr. SPECTER. And now we will proceed to Senator Kennedy's amendment \nNo. 4106.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we consider the Kennedy amendment\n\n[[Page S4947]]\n\nunder a 30-minute time limit, equally divided, with no second-degree \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4106\n\n   (Purpose: To enhance the enforcement of labor protections for the \n                United States workers and guest workers)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator offering an amendment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. I call up amendment No. 4106 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4106.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is as printed in the Record of Monday, May 22, 2006, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Immigrant workers are among the most vulnerable in our Nation. While \nperforming society's most difficult and dangerous work, they face abuse \nby employers, the denial of basic rights, and economic exploitation. In \nnegotiating the McCain-Kennedy bill, we took great care to include \nprotections that will halt these alarming trends and ensure fair wages \nand working conditions for guest workers. We also took great care to \nprotect American workers and ensure that the guest worker program does \nnot diminish American labor standards.\n  However, history shows us that it is not enough to pass good labor \nlaws if we do not also make a strong commitment to enforcing these \nlaws. Beyond anything we have provided in the bill, the most important \nstep we could take to help American workers and immigrant workers alike \nwould be to improve our enforcement of the critical labor protections \nthat have been a part of U.S. law for decades.\n  We have laws on the books that protect the safety of American \nworkers. Yet each year in the United States over 5,700 workers are \nkilled on the job, and 4.3 million others have become ill or injured. I \nmust say that prior to the time we passed the OSHA law, that has more \nthan doubled. We reduced that by more than 50 percent in recent years \nbecause of that legislation. That is 16 deaths and 12,000 injuries and \nillnesses each day, today.\n  We have laws on the books that prohibit child labor. Yet there are \nabout 148,000 illegally employed children in the United States today. \nWe have laws on the books that give workers a voice on the job to \nprotect their fundamental right to organize and join a union. Yet each \nyear in the United States more than 20,000 workers are illegally \ndiscriminated against for exercising these rights in the workplace.\n  These appalling statistics persist because our efforts to seek out \nand punish employers who violate the law are laughably inadequate. We \nfind and address only a minuscule fraction of the number of violations \nthat occur each year. Even when we do try to enforce the law, the \npenalties for breaking it are so low that employers treat them as a \nminor cost of doing business. The average fine for a serious OSHA \nviolation last year was $883. The average fine for a child labor \nviolation was $718. And violation of workers' rights to organize are \nremedied with back pay awards that come years too late. So such minor \nsanctions provide no incentives for employers to comply with the law.\n  We need to provide real penalties, not slaps on the wrist, for the \nemployers that violate the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Occupational \nSafety and Health Act, and the National Labor Relations Act.\n  The Kennedy amendment bolsters our enforcement of these important \nlaws. It updates the penalties under the Fair Labor Standards Act by \nincreasing the back pay remedy for willful violations and increasing \nthe maximum penalty for violations of the minimum wage, overtime, and \nchild labor protections. It would also update the OSHA civil penalties \nwhich have been unchanged since 1990. It would provide a maximum \npenalty of $50,000 when a worker's death is caused by willful \nviolations of the law, and make it a felony when an employer kills or \ninjures an employee through such willful violations.\n  But these increased fines and penalties, while important, are not \nenough. We also need to take stronger steps to ensure that current laws \nare being enforced and violations are being detected and remedied.\n  Vigilant enforcement is particularly important in occupations with \nhigh percentages of immigrants who often see large numbers of \nviolations of health and safety and wage and hour laws. It can be \ndifficult to enforce the law in such occupations where workers often \ndon't know their rights or are afraid to report violations.\n  That is why we need targeted enforcement efforts to ensure that guest \nworkers' rights are protected and our high American labor standards are \nbeing maintained for all workers in this country. The Kennedy amendment \nwill serve this important goal by requiring that 25 percent of all fees \ncollected under the guest worker program be dedicated to enhance \nenforcement of the Fair Labor Standards Act, OSHA, and the labor \nprotections of the immigration bill in industries that have the highest \npercentage of violations and the highest percentage of guest workers.\n  Another key step in protecting both American and immigrant workers is \nto end the economic incentives that employers have under the current \nlaw to abuse undocumented workers. The Supreme Court's decision in the \nHoffman Plastic case was a major setback for American workers. By \nruling that undocumented workers are not entitled to back pay when \ntheir rights are violated, the Supreme Court left millions of workers \nwithout meaningful recourse when they are fired for trying to organize \na union.\n\n  Unfortunately, this terrible decision has been applied to other labor \nlaws as well, making undocumented workers even more vulnerable to \nexploitation because their employers can violate their rights with \nrelative impunity.\n  This decision also hurts American workers in several ways. It \nencourages employers to hire undocumented workers by making them less \nexpensive and easier to intimidate. Businesses take advantage of the \nsituation by hiring undocumented workers and cutting legal corners. \nUnder the Hoffman case, unscrupulous employers are rewarded for this \nunlawful behavior.\n  Congress should not allow employers to use immigration laws as a \nshield for unlawful and abusive behavior. All workers should be \nentitled to the protections of our labor laws regardless of their \nimmigration status.\n  Finally, our workplace standards will not be effective until workers \nhave the security, knowledge, and means to enforce them. The best way \nto provide workers with these resources is to give them the ability to \nfreely and fairly choose a union. The right to organize and join a \nunion is a fundamental right recognized in the United Nations \nDeclaration of Human Rights. Yet the United States violates that \nfundamental principle every day because our laws don't adequately \nprotect the right to organize. When workers attempt to form a union, \nemployers intimidate them, harass them, and retaliate against them. \nEmployees who stand up for their rights are fired.\n  The Kennedy amendment provides stronger protections that allow \nworkers to organize freely and require employers to negotiate fairly. \nIt allows workers to get court orders to stop employers from firing or \nthreatening union advocates and strengthens the penalties in current \nlaw for mistreatment of workers who support a union.\n  It is long past time to give workers these basic protections. \nCongress passed laws such as the Fair Labor Standards Act, the National \nLabor Relations Act, and the Occupational Safety and Health Act in \norder to establish the minimum standards necessary to preserve basic \nhuman rights. But we must provide meaningful enforcement if we want \nthese to be meaningful laws. The Kennedy amendment ensures vigilant \nenforcement of these critical labor protections to preserve the health, \nthe safety, and the well-being of all Americans. I hope it will be \nincluded in the underlying legislation.\n\n[[Page S4948]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have charts which are fairly indicative \nof the points I made earlier.\n  Penalties for violating workers' rights are shamefully low. On the \nfirst one, $718 is the average fine for child labor violations, and \n148,000 children are being exploited in the labor force. There is very \nlittle enforcement in the first place against these violations. And \neven when there is one, the average fine is $718. When you have a \nserious OSHA violation, the average fine is $883.\n  If you look at the far side, it is a $1,000 minimum fine for bribery \nat a sporting event.\n  Here we are exploiting children, here we have the possibility of \nserious injury to workers, and here we have the minimum fine for \nbribery at a sporting event being higher.\n  It is illustrative of the inadequacy of current enforcement. More and \nmore immigrant workers are dying on the job.\n  This is a very interesting chart. It shows the total number of \nimmigrant workers who are dying on the job. These are significant \nnumbers. You see they are increasing every year. It is explainable. \nThis illustrates 2002, 2003, and 2004 for Hispanic fatalities and the \nnational fatality rate. We see what happens. Here are the Hispanic \nfatalities.\n  Obviously, in the workplace the Spanish are being assigned to more \ndangerous jobs. There is not enforcement to make sure they are being \nprotected on the jobs as they should be. As a result, they are paying \nwith their lives, in many of these instances, and the numbers are \ncontinuing to go up.\n  We need strong enforcement. That is what our amendment does.\n  This chart shows that Fair Labor Standards Act enforcement has \ndeclined while the workforce has grown. This is the increase in the \nUnited States covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act. It has \nincreased. This is from 1975 to 2004--112 percent.\n  The next is the increase in U.S. workers covered by the Fair Labor \nStandards Act; a 36 percent reduction in compliance actions being \ncompleted.\n  We are not getting enforcement and protection. As all of us know, the \nfacts show and the GAO and other studies show when you have compliance \nand when you have enforcement, the result is saving workers' lives--\nHispanic lives, migrant lives, American workers' lives.\n  We have to have justice in the workplace. We want to ensure that we \nare going to upgrade as we are moving to a new phase--bringing new \npeople into the workplace. We want to upgrade the penalties to make \nsure that we are going to have compliance. This is consistent certainly \nwith the other thrust of the legislation. It is important that workers \nwho are going to have protections that we believe are essential to \npermit them to produce and to meet their responsibilities but to do it \nin a climate that is as devoid of exploitation and danger as possible. \nTo do that we need compliance in enforcement. That is what this \namendment is really about.\n  I suggest the absence a quorum and retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes and 32 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Cornyn be \nrecognized for 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to amendment 4106 by \nthe distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. The amendment enhances \nenforcement of labor protections for United States workers and guest \nworkers, it is argued, by increasing penalties in violation of the Fair \nLabor Standards Act, increase civil and criminal penalties in violation \nof the Occupational Safety and Health Act, strengthens enforcement of \nviolations for unfair labor practices, and designates how fees \ncollected under the H-2C program should be allocated, including 25 \npercent to the labor law enforcement fund, and it would, arguably, \nprovide protections for whistleblowers.\n  The main problem I have with the amendment is it is beyond the scope \nof this bill and beyond the language included in the underlying \ncompromise which we have been told time and time again is fragile or \ndelicate, as those who have supported that compromise have sought to \ndefeat amendments such as this argue to change it.\n  This is obviously an amendment designed to increase the role of \ngovernment, a role that is not called for. The problem is, the irony \nis, we may end up providing more protections for foreign workers than \nare provided for American citizens who currently work and reside \nlegally in the United States. We ought to be cautious about doing that.\n  Certainly we all agree--not all of us, but I agree--we need to \nprovide some means for a guest worker or temporary worker program, and \nthat those foreign workers who are authorized to work legally in the \nUnited States for a period of time should be given the protection of \nthe laws that generally apply to workers who already work legally in \nthe United States. But to increase penalties and so-called labor \nprotections to a degree that exceeds that provided to American workers, \nto me, seems uncalled for.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against amendment 4106.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has no time remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4142\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I call up my amendment numbered 4142.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To authorize the waiver of certain grounds of inadmissibility \n    or removal where denial of admission or removal would result in \n hardship for a spouse, parent, or child who is a citizen or permanent \n                            resident alien)\n\n       On page 183, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 235. WAIVER OF CERTAIN GROUNDS FOR INADMISSIBILITY OR \n                   REMOVAL BASED ON HARDSHIP TO CITIZEN OR \n                   PERMANENT RESIDENT ALIEN SPOUSE, PARENT, OR \n                   CHILD.\n\n       (a) Waiver.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law and \n     except as provided in subsection (b), the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security (in the sole and unreviewable discretion of \n     the Secretary) or the Attorney General (in the sole and \n     unreviewable discretion of the Attorney General), as \n     applicable, may waive any ground of inadmissibility or \n     removal of an alien under, or arising from, an amendment made \n     by a provision of section 203, 208, 209, 214 or 222 of this \n     Act if the denial of admission or removal of such alien would \n     result in an extreme hardship to a spouse, parent, or child \n     of such alien who is a citizen or an alien lawfully admitted \n     for permanent residence.\n       (b) Exception for Terrorists.--No waiver may be made under \n     subsection (a) under or\n\n[[Page S4949]]\n\n     arising from an amendment referred to in that subsection with \n     respect to a ground of inadmissability or removal under a \n     provision of law as follows:\n       (1) Section 212(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act.\n       (2) Section 237(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this amendment would authorize the \nAttorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant a \nhumanitarian waiver to an immigrant if deportation would create extreme \nhardship for an immediate family member of the immigrant who is a U.S. \ncitizen or a legal permanent resident.\n  The Senate is considering a bill that takes a comprehensive approach \nto solving the problem of illegal immigration. One aspect of the bill \nis strengthening enforcement of our immigration laws. I support that. \nWe need to strengthen enforcement to restore integrity to our \nimmigration system. No one will believe we are serious about \nimmigration reform unless enforcement is a critical element.\n  But as we make our laws tougher, we must make certain we hold true to \nAmerican values. We should treat people fairly. We shouldn't separate \nfamilies if it would cause extreme hardship to American citizens.\n  I am concerned that some of the enforcement provisions in this bill \nare so broad they may have unintended consequences. These provisions \nhave the potential to sweep up long-term legal permanent residents and \nseparate them from their American families.\n  Let me give one example which will surprise most Members of the \nSenate. It illustrates the need for this amendment. Under current \nimmigration law, a legal permanent resident convicted of an \n``aggravated felony'' is subject to mandatory detention and \ndeportation. The definition of aggravated felony in the Immigration and \nNationality Act is very broad. It includes nonviolent crimes such as \nshoplifting. Section 203 of this bill would expand the definition of \naggravated felony even further. It would now be an aggravated felony to \naid or abet the commission of many nonviolent crimes.\n  Under this provision, a teenager who is a lawful permanent resident \nand has lived in this country most of her life, could be subject to \nmandatory detention and deportation if she drives a friend home from \nthe mall after the friend shoplifts a DVD.\n  Let's take another example. The bill greatly expands the definition \nof document fraud to include potentially innocent activities such as \nomitting immaterial information from an immigration application. The \nbill would make such an omission a ground for deportation for the first \ntime, so we are creating a new avenue for deporting people who are \ncurrently in the United States legally.\n  For example, a lawful permanent resident who inadvertently fails to \ninclude information about her parent's birthplace and address on her \ncitizenship application could be convicted of document fraud and \ndeported.\n  My amendment would follow very closely what Senator Kyl and Senator \nCornyn accomplished last week. The Senate approved a Kyl-Cornyn \namendment that under very strict circumstances will allow a \nhumanitarian waiver for undocumented immigrants who apply for legal \nstatus under this bill. We are following to the word the Kyl-Cornyn \namendment for the cases of legal immigrants who might be deportable as \na result of changes in the law made by this bill.\n  In my Chicago office, 80 percent of the casework relates to \nimmigration. I can tell you we encounter case after case that would \nbreak your heart. In so many cases, people who have lived and worked in \nthe United States for a long period of time and have immediate family \nmembers who are Americans are falling between the cracks of the law.\n  Most often, when we present these cases to Homeland Security they say \nthat they are powerless to do anything because our immigration laws \nallow so little flexibility.\n  Every Member of the Senate has heard the pleas of a constituent or a \nfriend or someone who has faced this kind of a dilemma. In most cases, \nwe have no ability to help them.\n  My amendment would follow the Kyl-Cornyn amendment and create a very \nlimited waiver that would apply only in the most compelling cases--\nwhere deportation of an immediate family member would cause extreme \nhardship to an American citizen or legal permanent resident. The waiver \nwould not be automatic. The burden would fall on the immigrant to prove \nthat extreme hardship would occur if he or she were deported.\n  In every case, the Government has complete discretion to deny the \nwaiver. To quote my amendment, the decision to grant a waiver would be \nin the ``sole and unreviewable discretion'' of the Attorney General or \nSecretary of Homeland Security--the identical language used in the Kyl-\nCornyn amendment. This same strict standard was enacted last week by \nthe Senate in the Kyl-Cornyn amendment by a vote of 99 to 0.\n  The Kyl-Cornyn waiver would apply in cases where undocumented \nimmigrants are seeking legal status. The waiver in my amendment would \napply in cases where an immigrant who was previously in legal status is \nsubject to deportation only because of a change in the law made by this \nbill.\n  Shouldn't we give the same chance to a legal immigrant facing \ndeportation that we give to an undocumented immigrant seeking legal \nstatus? Deportation is very serious. For an immigrant, it means \npermanent exile from family and home. And in some situations, it may \neven be a matter of life and death.\n  I think it is appropriate that we build on the good work of Senators \nKyl and Cornyn. Their standard is tough, but it is fair, and it \ncertainly is not an easy standard to meet.\n  It is also important to note that the discretionary waiver in my \namendment is limited only to new penalties that are a consequence of \nthis bill. In other words, it only applies to deportations that are a \ndirect result of the changes in law made by this bill.\n  I should also point out that in no circumstances would this waiver \napply to cases involving suspected terrorists. The text of the \namendment makes that explicit.\n  We already give the Government broad discretion to apprehend, detain, \nand deport undocumented immigrants. My amendment would give the \nGovernment limited discretion--very limited discretion--to show mercy \nin only the most compelling cases.\n  The supporters of this amendment include the U.S. Conference of \nCatholic Bishops, Catholic Charities USA, Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, \nAmerican Jewish Committee, League of United Latin American Citizens, \nNational Council of La Raza, Hispanic National Bar Association, Service \nEmployees International Union, National Immigration Forum, American \nImmigration Lawyers Association, Asian American Justice Center, Mexican \nAmerican Legal Defense and Education Fund, Human Rights Watch, and \nNational Immigration Law Center.\n  Mr. President, I will close by saying this: most Members of the \nSenate would be surprised to learn that under this bill a young person \nwho is guilty of aiding a shoplifter could be deported from the United \nStates. In light of this, you can see why there ought to be a very \nlimited option for the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney \nGeneral to grant a humanitarian waiver to an immigrant if it would \ncause extreme hardship to an immediate relative who is an American. We \nfollowed the same standard in the Kyl-Cornyn amendment, which was \nadopted earlier, and I hope my colleagues will support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, at this point, I withhold the remainder of my time and \nyield to the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to address \nthe amendment. I guess if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, \nI appreciate the Senator from Illinois suggesting that this follows the \ncourse set by the earlier amendment that had to do, as it turns out, \nwith an entirely different class of individuals than the ones this \namendment addresses. So I do not believe it is a similar sort of \namendment.\n  For this reason, this morning, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to \nreject the Feinstein amendment, which basically would have undone this \ndelicate compromise, this fragile compromise we have been told has to \nbe maintained\n\n[[Page S4950]]\n\nat all costs. That amendment would have simply opened the door to \namnesty for 12 million people who are here and not require anyone--no \nmatter how short a time they have been here--to do very much of \nanything distinguishable, at least from the 1986 amnesty.\n  The difference between what the Senate voted for earlier, which the \nSenator from Illinois references, is that those individuals had already \nhad their day in court and been ordered deported but had simply gone \nunderground. We recognized an extreme hardship exception there in an \neffort to try to work across the aisle with the Senator from \nMassachusetts and others, and the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain. \nThose individuals, by the way, still had to meet the other criteria \nunder the bill, the so-called 2-year and 5-year standards.\n  The problem I have with this amendment is it has absolutely no \nstandards to guide the discretion. As it says in the amendment, the \n``sole and unreviewable'' discretion of the Attorney General and the \n``sole and unreviewable'' discretion of the Secretary of the Department \nof Homeland Security. So we are left to wonder what standards would be \nactually applied by either the Attorney General or the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  Also, I believe, if taken at face value, this amendment would result \nin the waiver of grounds for inadmissibility for some 6 million \nindividuals--roughly half of those who are currently in the United \nStates--because, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, approximately 6 \nmillion people are currently in the country illegally who have an \nAmerican citizen child or American citizen spouse.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment, although I do \nthink this is one of those areas where the conference committee--after \nthe Senate passes its version of the bill and the House is working with \nus to try to come up with a final form--certainly can build on and try \nto work on to put some meat on the bone that is left undone by this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes one second.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator from Texas \nto reconsider his position because we followed the language of his \namendment exactly in limiting this waiver to cases where deportation of \nan immigrant would cause ``extreme hardship to a spouse, parent or \nchild'' of the immigrant who is an American citizen or lawful permanent \nresident.\n  We also followed his language exactly in committing the decision \nwhether to grant a waiver to ``the sole and unreviewable discretion'' \nof the Attorney General or Homeland Security Secretary. In every case, \nthe government would have complete discretion to deny the waiver. No \ncourt could review the denial of a waiver. That is an extremely high \nstandard. It is one that would apply only in very limited \ncircumstances.\n  And I say to the Senator, consider for a moment, if you would, that \nthe group of people that would be affected by the Kyl-Cornyn amendment \nare those who are in the United States in undocumented status, who have \nreceived final orders of deportation and have not left the United \nStates. I think the Senate took a wise, bipartisan course in saying \nthat even those people should be viewed in some circumstances as \ndeserving of another chance--but in very limited circumstances.\n  Now we are talking about a different class of people in my amendment. \nThese are people who are here legally. They are not undocumented. They \nare legal permanent residents. Then, because of new changes in the law \nthat this bill would make--not the old standards but new standards in \nthe law--they might be subject to deportation. And we say, in those \ncases, where you have people who are here legally, who may be subject \nto deportation because of changes in the law made by this bill, we will \ngive to the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security \n``sole and unreviewable'' discretion to decide whether there is a \nhumanitarian case for not deporting them. I think it is fair to treat \nthose who are currently here legally at least as well as those who are \ncurrently not here legally.\n  The Senator's earlier amendment dealt with that class that is here \nundocumented, and I supported him. I thought it was a very wise and \nhumane thing for him and Senator Kyl to do. But I would ask him to \nconsider. Shouldn't those who are here in legal permanent status \nreceive at least as much consideration, if this new law establishes \nsome means by which they could be deported, so in the case where there \nis extreme hardship to their American immediate family members, the \nSecretary would have this authority to grant them a waiver?\n  I say to the Senator, we use your identical language. And I did that \neven though I might have wanted to put it in different words. I thought \nto myself, let's stick to the standard that was established in the Kyl-\nCornyn amendment. So I hope the Senator from Texas will reconsider.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time, if the Senator has \nany comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes thirty-eight seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to Senator Cornyn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would just say that the way I read this \namendment--and I have only seen it in the last few minutes--it would \nresult in a waiver for approximately 6 million people illegally here in \nthe United States, as we speak.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CORNYN. It would be based on the fact of alleged extreme hardship \nthrough a spouse, parent, or child of such alien who is a citizen. The \nfact is, a total of 6 million illegal aliens in the United States \ncurrently, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, have an American \ncitizen child or spouse.\n  It would also, as I read this, purport to waive removal for \naggravated felons and would result in a green card for this class of \nindividuals, irrespective of payment of taxes, any requirement they \nlearn English, or paying a fine--which we have been told are the \nessential ingredients of earned legalization.\n  So this is really a backdoor way of undermining the compromise we \nhave been told is very delicate and fragile and should not be messed \nwith. So I would think those Senators who believe that is actually true \nwould vote against the Durbin amendment because it does seek to \nundermine that compromise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, may I say to the Senator from Texas, \n``aggravated felony,'' as defined by this bill, could include aiding or \nabetting shoplifting. So in that extraordinary case, where someone is a \nlegal permanent resident and is about to be deported because of changes \nwe are making in the law, this amendment would give one last chance to \nthat person to go to the Secretary of Homeland Security and say: \nPlease, don't ask me to leave the country because I drove the car when \nmy girlfriend shoplifted a DVD. It would cause extreme hardship to my \nmother and father, who are American citizens. And the Secretary can \nsay: No. And it is not reviewable by a court. He will be deported. But \nit at least leaves that last option. These are people who are currently \nlegally in the United States whom we are trying to protect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4106\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nGeorgia to speak on the Kennedy amendment No. 4106.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman.\n  I rise to oppose the Kennedy amendment. I come to the floor as \nchairman\n\n[[Page S4951]]\n\nof the subcommittee on occupational safety in the HELP Committee. I \ncome to the floor because the issue this amendment addresses has \nnothing to do with immigration. It affects immigrants and \nnonimmigrants. It affects employment. It amends the Occupational Safety \nand Health Act, the National Labor Relations Act, and the Fair Labor \nStandards Act. It is a massive increase in fines and penalties. It \nchanges many penalties from civil to criminal. There has not been a \nsingle hearing or anything else.\n  The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts knows full well that we \nhave just completed 6 months of hard work on the Mine Safety Act, which \nthis Senate today will pass unanimously in response to the terrible \ntragedy at the Sago mines. He knows how much time and effort went into \nthe hearings and the studies to see to it what OSHA needed to do and \nwhat we needed to do. To summarily come to the floor on an immigration \nbill and amend the OSHA laws and the Fair Labor Standards Act, the \nNational Labor Relations Act, to throw in massive penalties, massive \ncriminal fines--in fact, just to give you an example, it dramatically \nincreases criminal and civil penalties, with up to as much as 5 years \nin jail for a workplace accident. Arbitrary provisions such as this \nhave no business on the floor of the Senate being tacked on to a bill \nthat deals with a major pressing problem in an entire other area.\n  Just to add the piece de resistance, this amendment, as I read it, \noverturns the Supreme Court ruling in Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. \nv. the National Labor Relations Board. What that would, in effect, do \nis force employers now to go pay back compensation to illegal \nimmigrants who were working in the workplace and put the Justice \nDepartment as their designated attorney when they are not even here \nlegally in the first place. Now, if that action is the right thing to \ndo, it certainly needs to be done in civil debate and through the \ncommittee process and not as a last-minute attachment to a bill that is \nin itself controversial and in itself comprehensive.\n  So with all due respect to the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts but with respect for the integrity of the committee \nsystem, I submit this amendment should not be adopted, and I will \noppose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, with respect to the Kennedy amendment No. \n4106, my record is plain that I believe in strict enforcement of the \nFair Labor Standards Act, strict enforcement of OSHA, and strengthening \nenforcement against unfair labor practices. But this amendment \nrepresents a sweeping change to the Fair Labor Standards Act and to \nOSHA. In particular, it increases certain penalties five- and tenfold. \nIt increases civil fines under OSHA and criminal penalties under OSHA \nwithout any record as to whether such increases are necessary. There \nhave been no hearings on this bill.\n  It would increase an OSHA criminal penalty from 6 months to 10 years \nand in another place strike a 1-year penalty and insert a 10-year \npenalty on a first conviction. Those are very significant changes. As \nmuch as I favor strict enforcement of the Fair Labor Standards Act and \nOSHA and strict enforcement against unfair labor practices, there has \nbeen no hearing on this amendment, and, therefore, I reluctantly oppose \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know we had this debate about an hour \nago. I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is true that we have increased \nsignificantly and dramatically the penalties in the Mine Safety Act \nbecause they were a slap on the wrist. They didn't even rise to the \nlevel of a business penalty. All we are doing basically is changing the \nmaximum penalties, when we see the loss of life and the most grievous \nkinds of injuries to American workers. That is what we are doing. They \nhaven't been raised since 1990, over 16 years. Why shouldn't we be able \nto at least take that to conference? That is all this is doing, trying \nto make sure that all the laws to protect American workers and to \nprotect guest workers are going to be fairly and equitably enforced.\n  I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Senator Kyl was unnecessarily detained \nand did not have his time on Grassley No. 4177. I ask unanimous consent \nfor 1 minute for Senator Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will be voting against the Grassley \namendment. I compliment the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, and his staff, for \nworking hard at producing what is a big step forward in ensuring that \nwe can determine the eligibility of workers to be hired. Unfortunately, \nit doesn't complete the job. That is such a critical component of this \nlegislation that I cannot support it until additional changes are made.\n  My vote is not intended to be pejorative in any way toward those who \nworked very hard to put this together, and many of my ideas are in that \namendment. I appreciate their effort. But there is still a long way to \ngo, and, in some respects, this is a metaphor for a lot of this bill. \nThere has been a lot of progress made, but there is a long way to go.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are now ready to vote on four \namendments. I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided before each amendment is called.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I further ask unanimous consent that the first rollcall \nvote on Leahy No. 4117 be the regular 15 minutes and that each \nsucceeding of the stacked votes be 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I want to put my colleagues on notice that we will \nstrictly enforce this time because we have four votes, and it is going \nto take quite some time. There is more business to be conducted after \nthe votes are concluded.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of the bill at 8:30 a.m. tomorrow morning, Senator \nMcConnell be recognized to offer his amendment No. 4085; provided \nfurther that the time until 9:30 be equally divided between Senator \nMcConnell and Senator Reid or his designee; provided further that at \n9:30, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the McConnell \namendment with no second degree in order prior to the vote; I ask \nconsent that following that vote, the Senate proceed to a vote on \ninvoking cloture; further that there be 2 minutes for debate equally \ndivided between the stacked votes after the first vote and the time \nfrom 9:20 to 9:30 on Wednesday be equally divided between Senators Dodd \nand McConnell. The order of the votes will be Leahy No. 4117, Grassley \nNo. 4177, Kennedy No. 4106, and Durbin No. 4142.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Leahy amendment No. 4117.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania is going to speak to correct one part of the record, but \nboth Senator Coleman and I want to make sure the record is correct and \nSenators know what they are voting on. Some Senators, in speaking in \nopposition to the Leahy-Coleman amendment, suggested that members of \nHamas, the Kurdish PKK, or the Basque separatist group might obtain \nrefugee status in the U.S. because those terrorists organizations do \nnot specifically target the United States. That is totally incorrect. \nThey are not allowed in with this. Hamas, the Basque separatists, the \nKurdish PKK are already listed as terrorist organizations by our \ngovernment. Members of the Taliban are also barred. These individuals \ncould not obtain entry with this amendment. It was wrong to \nmisrepresent the amendment that way. It is inflammatory to say the \nLeahy-Coleman amendment would aid members and supporters of designated \nterrorist organizations. It does not. It does not. It does not. This \namendment in no way changes current law as suggested, but it would do \nsomething for those people who have been raped, tortured, or forced \ninto helping terrorist organizations.\n\n[[Page S4952]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have opposed the Leahy amendment \nbecause it redefines what constitutes material support for a terrorist. \nIt redefines and narrows the definition of what is a terrorist \norganization. Those are complex subjects. There could have been \nhearings in the Judiciary Committee where the Senator from Vermont is \nthe ranking member. I was wrong about Hamas when I made that \nrepresentation. But as to the Kurdish terrorists, we did not identify \nPKK but other Kurdish terrorists in Turkey. I did not refer to the \nBasque ETA but to other Basque terrorists in Spain. When you have these \nfar-reaching changes, there should have been hearings. There is \nadequate recourse under existing law for the Secretary of State to \ngrant waivers for those providing material support to terrorist \norganizations, as she did recently for 9,300 ethnic Karen refugees to \ncome out of Thailand.\n  I move to table the Leahy amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I understand we are going to have another \nrollcall vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Parliamentary inquiry: Are these 10-minute rollcall votes \nnow?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next votes are 10-minute rollcall votes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We should be able to finish in 40 or 45 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4177\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes equally divided on the \nGrassley amendment. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 made it \nunlawful for employers to knowingly hire or employ someone who is not \nauthorized to work in the United States; and it required employers to \ncheck the identity and work authorization documents of all new \nemployees.\n  The current employment verification process relies on a paper form \nknown as the ``I-9.'' To complete this form, employers must examine one \nor more documents from a list of nearly 30 different documents. If the \ndocument provided by the employee appears to be genuine, the employer \nhas met his obligation.\n  The employer is not allowed to solicit additional documents and the \nemployee is not required to produce additional documents. In fact, an \nemployer's request for more or different documents, or a refusal to \nhonor documents that appear to be genuine, can potentially be treated \nas an unfair immigration-related employment practice. This obviously \nputs employers in a very difficult situation. If he accepts the \ndocument, he may be hiring an illegal worker. If he does not accept the \ndocument, he may be sued for employment discrimination.\n  The easy availability of counterfeit documents has made a mockery of \nthe current I-9 process. Fake documents are produced by the millions \nand can be obtained easily and cheaply. Thus, the current system \nbenefits unscrupulous employers who do not mind hiring illegal aliens \nbut want to show that they have met their legal requirements, and it \nharms employers who don't want to hire illegal aliens but have no \nchoice but to accept documents they may suspect of being counterfeit.\n  The failure of the current process is evidenced by the millions of \n``no match'' letters generated each year by the Social Security \nAdministration. Each year, the Social Security Administration processes \nabout 250 million W-2s. It is able to match more than 95 percent of \nthese. However, nearly 9 million W-2s contain names and social security \nnumbers that do not match the Social Security Administration's records. \nIt is widely believed that many, if not most, of these no matches are \ndue to the employment of illegal aliens.\n  This problem must be addressed. We cannot control our boarders, or \ncreate an enforceable guest worker program, until we have a reliable \nand secure employment verification system.\n  I supported the creation of the Basic Pilot program in 1996 which \nallows employers to voluntarily check the employment status of their \nnew employees. At the time, it was a pilot in 6 states. In 2003, I \nauthored the law that provided all 50 states the option to use the \nBasic Pilot program. Unfortunately, those who are most likely to hire \nillegal workers are the least likely to use this system.\n  My amendment today would create a new worker verification system for \nemployers to use to determine if their workers are eligible to work in \nthe United States. While this new system is based on the Basic Pilot, \nthere are a number of important differences. The new system will be \nmandatory for all employers who hire any new employees beginning 18 \nmonths after Congress appropriates the funds needed to implement the \nsystem.\n  The system can be compared to a ``red light,'' ``green light,'' and \n``yellow light'' verification. The employer, in the course of hiring a \nnew worker, must submit certain information within 3 days of the \nhiring. The Secretary of Homeland Security, with the assistance of the \nCommissioner of Social Security, will turn around, in less than 10 \ndays, and provide a positive confirmation or a tentative non-\nconfirmation--that is a ``green light'' or a ``yellow light.'' If DHS \nprovides a tentative non-confirmation--a ``yellow light''--then the \nburden will be on the worker to resolve the matter. If the worker \ncontests the non-confirmation, DHS will have 30 days to provide a final \nresponse to the employer. If the final response is negative--a ``red \nlight''--the employer is required to discharge the worker.\n  The new system would be Internet based. However, the Secretary will \nalso provide access through a toll-free telephone number so that small, \nrural, and underserved areas can use the system as well. There are a \nnumber of important worker protections built into this new system. \nDuring the initial implementation of the system, if DHS cannot resolve \ntheir worker's status within 30 days, DHS will grant an automatic \ndefault confirmation. If the worker loses his job through no fault of \nhis own due to a mistake by the system, he can seek administrative and \njudicial review to recover lost wages. The system would also give \nworkers the ability to verify their own information prior to obtaining \nor changing\n\n[[Page S4953]]\n\njobs. This would give workers the ability to know their status before \napplying for a job and give them the opportunity to correct any \nmistakes.\n  Finally, until the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies that the \nsystem is able to correctly resolve 99 percent of all the cases \ninvolving eligible workers within 30 days, then the automatic default \nconfirmation will remain in effect. This safeguard is designed to \nensure that no eligible worker is denied a job due to bureaucratic \ndelays or excessive workloads at DHS or SSA. Once the system is \ncertified by the secretary, the automatic default confirmation is \nchanged to an automatic default non-confirmation. There have been some \nconcerns raised that once illegal workers are no longer able to use \nphony IDs and fake social security cards, they will attempt to steal \nsomeone else's identity. We have addressed this problem by allowing \nworkers--on a purely voluntary basis--to put a ``block'' on their own \nSSN. This would work much like a ``credit freeze'' or the ``do not \ncall'' list that already exists under current law.\n  A worker could block his own number to prevent someone else from \nusing it and then unblock his number whenever he needed to obtain or \nchange jobs. The amendment also provides important protections for \nemployers who use the system. They will no longer be forced to choose \nbetween questionable documents or an employment discrimination lawsuit. \nThey will be able to rely on the information provided by the system. \nThey will be protected from liability if they fire a worker based on \nthat information. Finally, the amendment provides safeguards to prevent \nthe unauthorized disclosure of information contained in the system. \nIndividuals and employers will not have direct access to Federal \ndatabases. Rather, they will submit information and only receive back a \nconfirmation or non-confirmation of that information. The amendment \nalso provides that the information in the system cannot be used for any \npurpose other than provided by law.\n  With respect to information sharing, the amendment contains important \nlanguage regarding the use of tax return information.\n  The protection of taxpayer information is a cornerstone of our \nvoluntary tax system. These protections are found in section 6103 of \nthe tax code and are designed to strike the balance between taxpayer \nprivacy and legitimate law enforcement. Several members raised this \nissue during the Judiciary Committee markup. I urged my colleagues to \ndefer any action in this area until the members of the Finance \nCommittee had an opportunity to review this issue.\n  Some of the proposals in the Judiciary Committee were very broad. In \nthis amendment, we have taken a more focused approach. We identified \nthe specific information that would be needed to identify potentially \nillegal workers and crafted an amendment to 6103 that permits such use \nwhile maintaining all of the privacy protections afforded by 6103.\n  Specifically, we allow the Social Security Administration to share \ntaxpayer identity information with DSH for the next 3 years. The \ninformation that can be shared would be for those employers who had \nmore than 100 employees with names and numbers that do not match, and \nemployers who used the same social security number for more than 10 \nemployees.\n  In addition, DHS would be able to request that SSA provide \ninformation to identify employers who are not participating in the \nsystem, and employers who are not verifying all of their new employees. \nThis information sharing would sunset after 3 years unless Congress \nextends this authority. We will closely monitor the use of this \nauthority to determine if it should be extended.\n  Relying on Social Security records to help enforce immigration law \nalso raises a critical issue with respect to the Social Security \nAdministration's ability to perform its primary functions. This \namendment addresses this concern by requiring DHS to reimburse SSA in \nadvance for the cost of any data it obtains.\n  Let me again point out that--unlike the House bill--this amendment \nonly applies to new hires, with some limited exceptions under the \ndiscretionary authority of DHS.\n  However, I would note that despite the high turnover rate seen among \nsome workers, many workers are employed by the same employer for many \nyears.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly one-half of all \nworkers have been employed by the same employer for 5 or more years. \nMore than one-quarter have been employed by the same employer for 10 or \nmore years.\n  Without verification for all employees, many illegal workers might \nnever be detected under a system that only checks new hires.\n  I understand that a requirement to verify all employees is viewed as \noverly burdensome. But, as mentioned earlier, the Social Security \nAdministration processes roughly 250 million W-2s each and every year \nand is able to verify more than 95 percent. It might turn out that the \nadditional burden of checking everyone would be very minimal. I suspect \nwe will have to revisit this issue in conference with the House--if we \nmake it that far.\n  In conclusion, let me urge my colleagues to support this amendment. \nIt represents a significant step forward in creating a more reliable \nand secure employment verification system.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Grassley and all who \nworked on this amendment. This is probably the single most important \nthing we can do in terms of reducing the inflow of undocumented \nworkers--making sure we can actually enforce in a systematic way rules \ngoverning who gets hired.\n  It is an amendment that has bipartisan support, as Senator Grassley \nindicated. It will increase fines. It will provide for an electronic \ndata system that is effective.\n  I urge all colleagues on my side of the aisle to vote for the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, notwithstanding my tremendous admiration \nand support for the chairman of the Finance Committee, Mr. Grassley, I \nmust oppose this amendment.\n  Secretary Chertoff of the Department of Homeland Security, who is \nresponsible for actually implementing this program, has called the \nrequirements of this amendment a poison pill. Why in the world would we \ndesign a verification system, which I agree is the linchpin of \ncomprehensive enforcement, that fails? Why would we design a system to \nfail in which the very person who is responsible for enforcing it calls \nit a poison pill? The administration does not support this amendment. I \nsuggest the underlying bill is a better bill with which to go to \nconference and work out our differences.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand that now before the Senate \nis the amendment I offered earlier, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. There are 2 minutes equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, when American workers go to work every \nday, they expect to go into a workplace that is safe and secure. \nAmerican families expect their husbands or their wives to come home to \nthem because they work in a place that is safe and secure. For the last \n16 years, we have not increased any of the penalties--the maximum \npenalties--on OSHA, the Fair Labor Standards Act--any of these \npenalties. This amendment does do so in a very reasonable and modest \nway.\n  We have just done that with mine safety, and later this evening we \nare going to pass mine safety, virtually unanimously. One of the \nimportant parts of the mine safety amendment is the increase in the \npenalty. We are doing for American workers and for future American \nworkers the same thing we have done for mine safety: We are making \nsure, through having penalties that are reasonable and responsible, \nthat we have safe working conditions. That is what the Kennedy \namendment does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who seeks \ntime in opposition?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I remind my colleagues this is a 10-\nminute vote. Time will be strictly enforced; 10 plus 5. I ask my \ncolleagues to stay on the floor for these last 2 votes. I yield the \nremaining time to the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, there have been no hearings on this \namendment. The Senator from Massachusetts knows full well the mine \nsafety bill has been heard for over 6 months. I have worked with him.\n  This amendment takes civil penalties and makes them criminal. I worry \nabout the worker going to work and getting hurt, but I worry about \ndestroying the incentive to employ anyone by imposing punitive, \narbitrary assessments on them, all because we sneak an amendment in at \nthe last minute on a bill that is on an entirely different subject. I \nurge everybody to vote with me, because I am going to move to table the \nKennedy amendment, and I encourage a yea vote.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

I yield 1 minute to the \nSenator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4142\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The next vote is on the Durbin \namendment. There is 2 minutes equally divided.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week, by a vote of 99 to 0, we \ncreated a humanitarian waiver for undocumented people in the United \nStates who are seeking to get on the pathway to legalization. We said \nwe would allow a nonreviewable look by the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity at the cases of certain undocumented immigrants who would \notherwise by ineligible for legalization.\n  This amendment says if you are currently legally in the United States \nand, as a result of changes in the law made by this bill, may be \ndeportable for failing to include a piece of information on an \nimmigration form, an immaterial omission, you also could qualify for \nthe same kind of humanitarian waiver, nonreviewable by a court.\n  It is the same standard for legal residents that last week we \napproved for the undocumented. I hope the Senators on both sides will \nsupport the amendment.\n  Mr. CORNYN. This amendment would waive deportation for aggravated \nfelons. It would result in a green card, irrespective of legalization, \nrequiring no payment of taxes, no requirement of learning English, and \nno fine.\n  I believe it would result in the legalization of roughly 6 million \nindividuals under this standard contained in this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Louisiana be allowed up to 30 minutes following me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, while S. 2611, the immigration bill, \ncontains important titles addressing border security and worksite \nenforcement, the bill, as everyone knows, also contains titles relating \nto amnesty for illegal aliens and the creation of a massive new guest \nworker program which will undermine true immigration reform, in my \nopinion.\n  The most problematic provisions of S. 2611 are as follows:\n  One, I want you to know I opposed amnesty 20 years ago. It did not \nwork then, and I do not believe it will work now.\n  Two, our first priority should be to secure our borders. Any \ndiscussion of amnesty takes away from that priority, in my judgment.\n  Three, supporters of these amnesty provisions say it is not amnesty \nbut what they call ``earned legalization.'' I am not here to argue \nabout semantics or labels. Whether you call it: ``amnesty,'' ``status \nadjustment'' or ``guest worker,'' the result is that individuals who \ncame here illegally will now be considered legal workers and on their \nway toward citizenship. That is the bottom line.\n  Four, under the so-called compromise that is working here, those who \nhave broken the law the longest are treated the best.\n  Five, those who can prove they have been here 2 to 5 years still do \nnot have to leave the country and are, hence, still treated better than \nthose waiting to enter legally.\n  Six, the bill has minimal requirements on proving that an illegal \nalien has worked or will work in the future. What few provisions there \nare seem very vulnerable to fraud.\n  Seven, this bill mandates that illegal workers are paid a higher wage \nthan many American workers in the same position with the same \nqualifications.\n  Eight, the supporters of this bill claim that back taxes will be paid \nfor past labor. But a close reading of the bill shows that these back \ntaxes will only be paid, if at all, 8 years down the road when applying \nfor a green card, not as a requirement to receive the H-2C visa.\n  Nine, this bill drastically increases the number of employment-based \ngreen cards issued annually. What will happen to the American worker \nwhen unemployment goes up and so many foreign workers, who are willing \nto work for less, have been given citizenship?\n  Ten, today, before the implementation of any reforms, the ability of \nour immigration officials to process applicants who are following the \nlaw is severely taxed. This bill will surely have a negative impact on \nthose foreign workers who have followed the rules and are waiting \npatiently in their home country to legally come to this country.\n  Eleven, while others say comprehensive immigration reform must \ninclude these amnesty provisions, I feel strongly they will only serve \nto encourage further illegal immigration in the years to come.\n  And my 12th reason, the bottom line is, this bill, in my judgment, \nrewards past lawbreaking and encourages future lawbreaking. I am \nwilling to bet that if this bill is enacted, we will only revisit this \nproblem 20 years--perhaps before 20 years--down the road. Only then, we \nmight be talking about 20 million to 30 million illegal immigrants.\n  Those are some of the reasons--and there are many others--why I will \nvote ``no'' on the final passage of this legislation.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for a \nprovision in S. 2611 that will level the playing field for minor league \nsports teams that depend on getting the best athletic talent. Under \ncurrent law, minor league players who have to use the H-2B visa \ncategory face severe visa shortages, while Major League players qualify \nautomatically for plentiful P-1 visas. This unfair discrepancy in the \nlaw needs to be remedied, and my amendment, which was accepted by the \nJudiciary Committee and is now in the underlying bill, provides a \ncommonsense solution.\n  By way of background, H-2B visas are intended for use by industries \nfacing seasonal demands for labor, such as the hospitality and \nagricultural industries. What many people do not know is that, in \naddition to loggers, hotel and restaurant employees, and many other \ntypes of seasonal workers, the H-2B visa category is also used by many \ntalented, highly competitive foreign athletes who are recruited by U.S. \nteams.\n  A chronic H-2B visa shortage over the last few years has posed \nchallenges for all industries using the H-2B visa category. In both \nfiscal years 2004 and 2005, the 66,000 visa cap was met early in the \nyear. While we were successful last year in crafting a temporary 2-year \nfix for the H-2B shortage, this fix will expire at the end of the \ncurrent fiscal year. I commend my colleague from Maryland, Senator \nMikulski, for offering an amendment to this bill that would extend the \ncurrent exemption of returning H-2B workers until 2009.\n  However, solving this problem goes beyond fixing the H-2B visa cap. \nMinor league players simply do not belong in the same visa category as \nseasonal workers. There is no reason why Major League players can \nqualify automatically for P-1 visas, which are granted to talented \nathletes, artists, and entertainers, while minor league players cannot. \nMy amendment would remedy this unfair situation.\n  The problem of requiring minor league athletes to use the H-2B visa \ncategory has posed a particular challenge to those of us in Maine who \nenjoy cheering on our sports teams. The MAINEiacs, a Canadian junior \nhockey league team that plays its games in Lewiston, ME, has faced \ntremendous difficulties obtaining the H-2B visas necessary for the \nmajority of its players to come to the United States to play in the \nteam's first home games.\n  Last year, due to uncertainty surrounding the availability of H-2B \nvisas at the end of the fiscal year, the team had to reschedule its \nseason home opener and cancel several early season games. This forced \nthe team to schedule make-up games for those normally\n\n[[Page S4956]]\n\nplayed in September. The problems created by the visa situation creates \nan unnecessary hardship for this team, in addition to threatening the \nrevenue the team generates for the city of Lewiston and businesses in \nthe surrounding area.\n  The Portland Sea Dogs, a Double-A baseball team affiliated with the \nBoston Red Sox, is another of the many teams that relies on H-2B visas \nto bring some of its most skilled players to the United States. \nThousands of fans come each year to see this team, and others like it \nacross the country, play one of America's favorite sports. Due to the \nshortage of H-2B visas, however, Major League Baseball reports that, in \n2004 and early 2005, more than 350 talented young, foreign baseball \nplayers were prevented from coming to the U.S. to play for minor league \nteams. These teams have been a traditional proving ground for athletes \nhoping to make it to the major leagues and players often move from \nthese teams to major league rosters.\n  The inclusion of these highly skilled athletes in the H-2B visa \ncategory seems particularly unusual when you consider that major league \nathletes are permitted to use an entirely different non-immigrant visa \ncategory--the P-1 visa. This visa is available to athletes who are \ndeemed by the Citizenship and Immigration Services to perform at an \n``internationally recognized level of performance.'' Arguably, any \nforeign athlete whose achievements have earned him a contract with an \nAmerican team would meet this definition.\n  CIS, however, has interpreted this category to exclude minor and \namateur league athletes. Instead, the P-1 visa is typically reserved \nfor only those athletes who have already been promoted to major league \nsports. Unfortunately, this creates something of a catch-22 for minor \nleague athletes--if an H-2B visa shortage means that promising athletes \nare unable to hone their skills, and to prove themselves, in the minor \nleagues, they are far less likely to ever earn the major league \ncontract currently required to obtain a P-1 visa.\n  A simple, commonsense solution would be to expand the P-1 visa \ncategory to include minor league and certain amateur-level athletes who \nhave demonstrated a significant likelihood of graduating to the major \nleagues. Major League Baseball strongly supports the expansion of the \nP-1 visa category to include professional minor league baseball \nplayers. In correspondence to me, the league has pointed out that, by \nmaking P-1 visas available to this group of athletes, teams would be \nable to make player development decisions based on the talent of its \nplayers, without being constrained by visa quotas. The P-1 category, \nthe league believes, is appropriate for minor league players because \nthese are the players that Major League clubs have selected as some of \nthe best baseball prospects in the world.\n  There is no question that Americans are passionate about sports. We \nhave high expectations for our teams, and demand only the best from our \nathletes. By expanding the P-1 visa category, we will make it possible \nfor athletes to be selected based on talent and skill, rather than visa \navailability. In addition, we would reduce some pressure on the H-2B \nvisa category making more of those visas available to the industries \nthat need them.\n  I am pleased that this important provision is included in S. 2611, \nand I thank the Judiciary Committee for their willingness to \nincorporate it into the underlying bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters endorsing my amendment from the \nLewiston MAINEiacs Hockey Club and Major League Baseball be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There: being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                Lewiston MAINEiacs\n\n\n                                             Hockey Club, LLC,\n\n                                      Lewiston, ME, April 7, 2006.\n     Re ``MAINEiacs'' amendment to enable American sports teams to \n         recruit talented players from abroad.\n\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Collins: I wish to express the Lewiston \n     MAINEiacs Hockey Club's support for your efforts with regards \n     to ``MAINEiacs'' amendment to enable American sports teams to \n     recruit talented players from abroad.\n       The Lewiston MAINEiacs Hockey Club is the sole U.S. based \n     franchise in the 18-member Quebec Major Junior Hockey League \n     (QMJHL). The QMJHL together with the Ontario Hockey League \n     (OHL) and the Western Hockey League (WHL) make up the \n     Canadian Hockey League which comprises a total of 58 teams. \n     Of those 58 franchises, 9 are located in the United States \n     (OHL-3, WHL-5, QMJHL-1).\n       The CHL is the largest developer of talent for the National \n     Hockey League (NHL). More than 70% of all players, coaches \n     and general managers who have played in the NHL are graduates \n     of the Canadian Hockey League.\n       The majority of players in the Canadian Hockey League are \n     Canadian, although each team is permitted to have a maximum \n     of 2 Europeans on their rosters. There is also an increasing \n     number of elite U.S. born players now playing in the league.\n       In January of 2004, the City of Lewiston purchased the \n     Colisee in order to complete the first round of renovations \n     to the facility which was in excess of two million dollars. \n     The Colisee has undergone a second phase of renovations in \n     excess of 1.8 millions dollars that entails a three-story \n     addition to the front of the building providing for new \n     offices, box office, pro-shop, food and beverage concessions \n     and a new private VIP suite that can accommodate more than \n     130 fans per game. The City of Lewiston contracted the day-\n     to-day management of the Colisee to Global Spectrum, a \n     subsidiary of Comcast-Spectacor, one of the largest and most \n     successful facility management companies in North America.\n       The results of the current visa laws have forced all U.S. \n     based franchises in the CHL to delay the commencement of \n     their regular season until or after October 1 of each year \n     due to the restrictions of the of the H-2B temporary work \n     visa regulations. This has caused significant hardship on \n     teams, their facilities and the 3 leagues. U.S. based \n     franchises are forced to try and make-up games that would \n     normally be scheduled in the month of the September later in \n     the season, putting both the teams and their fans at \n     disadvantage before the season even commences.\n       Under your leadership, should congressional legislation \n     make available P-1 visas to Major Junior players of the CHL, \n     the success of all 9 U.S. based CHL franchises would be \n     greatly enhanced by ensuring that all 58 teams have an equal \n     chance at attracting and developing the best available \n     talent.\n       It is the hope of the Lewiston MAINEiacs that your \n     colleagues in the Senate follow your leadership and endorse \n     your recommendations for the amendment to the immigration \n     reform bill to ensure the viability and success of not only \n     our franchise--but the 8 other U.S. based clubs in the \n     Canadian Hockey League.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Matt McKnight,\n     Vice President & Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Office of the Commissioner,\n\n\n                                        Major League Baseball,\n\n                                     New York, NY, April 27, 2006.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Re legislation for nonimmigrant alien status for certain \n         athletes.\n\n       Dear Senator Collins: I write to express Major League \n     Baseball's support as you redouble your efforts to make Minor \n     League players eligible for P-l work visas.\n       Unlike other professional athletes, baseball players need \n     substantial experience in the Minor Leagues to develop their \n     talents and skills to Major League quality. To get that \n     necessary experience, young players are signed by Major \n     League Clubs and assigned to play for Minor League affiliates \n     throughout the United States, such as Maine's own Portland \n     Sea Dogs.\n       Approximately 40 percent of these young players come from \n     foreign countries, and MLB must obtain H2-B visas in order \n     for them to enter the U.S. Under current law, however, these \n     visas are capped, and the demand for them is so great across \n     a wide range of industries, many Minor Leaguers are not being \n     afforded the opportunity to play here and develop into Major \n     League baseball players.\n       The lack of available visas prevented more than 350 young \n     baseball players from performing in the United States in 2004 \n     and 2005, and will prevent even more from doing so this year. \n     Additionally, over the past few years several Clubs have \n     shied away from drafting foreign (mostly Canadian) players \n     whom they otherwise might have selected in the annual First-\n     Year Player Draft, because of the risk of not being able to \n     obtain visas for those players. In fact, in 2004, signings of \n     Canadian players declined 80% over the previous year, and in \n     2005 only four of the twenty-five Canadian players who were \n     drafted were eventually signed by a Club. The resulting \n     impact on the quality of the product on the field is \n     significant, particularly for almost forty million Americans \n     who attend Minor League Baseball games each year.\n       Under your leadership, Congress can ensure that the best \n     baseball prospects from around the world will have the \n     opportunity to develop here in the United States, without the \n     constraint that the H-2B visa cap imposes. Minor League \n     Baseball shares our support of your efforts. The Major League \n     Baseball Players Association also supports allowing the best \n     young players to develop here in the United States.\n       Major Legue Baseball hopes that your Senate colleagues will \n     follow your leadership\n\n[[Page S4957]]\n\n     and pursue a legislatiye remedy to a problem that is \n     threatening to weaken Baseball's Minor League system.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert A. DuPuy,\n                              President & Chief Operating Officer.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a \nletter addressed to me from Mark J. Sprinkle in support of amendment \nNo. 4076, which was agreed to yesterday, amending S. 2611, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Senator: I returned home last night from my two weeks of \n     Annual Training (AT) with the National Guard. I was able to \n     meet many of the soldiers I will serve with in Iraq. They all \n     seem great and I look forward to working with them to \n     accomplish our mission of delivering fuel to units throughout \n     the country. We did some excellent training in Hawthorne. We \n     were able to see some examples of IEDs, work on convoy \n     procedures and tactics, and do innovative things like firing \n     M-16s from the windows of our moving trucks at targets 50 and \n     250 meters away. This training was enjoyable and it really \n     tied into what we'll be doing over there.\n       When I got home, I caught a replay of the Armed Services \n     Committee meeting regarding the role and mission of the \n     National Guard on the border. I agree with the comments of \n     Lt. General Blum of the NGB that the Guard will prove more \n     than capable and effective in helping to secure the border. \n     All people enjoy accomplishing tasks and helping others. I \n     think it would be a great feeling for an engineer to build a \n     road that will be there for decades and for a helicopter \n     medevac crew-member to rescue a sick or injured person in the \n     desert. It is a tremendous idea to use the Guard in this \n     capacity. It will help units stay sharp and prepared by \n     having them use the same skill sets that they will use in \n     fulfilling their missions during natural disasters and in \n     warzones. I also like the idea of having units rotate in \n     during their two week AT. That would be great training and it \n     sure beats sitting in an armory for 15 days. Your amendment \n     to reimburse states with federal funds is great and I hope \n     that governors will allow their units to assist the Border \n     Patrol in accomplishing their vital mission of securing the \n     border. Well Senator, just some thoughts and observations \n     from your local guardsman.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Mark J.

Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate briefly \nthis evening to visit with my colleagues about an issue that we all now \nknow about to some degree; and that, of course, is the very serious \nbreach of security that occurred within the VA earlier this month.\n  My office, like yours, is lighting up with phone calls from concerned \nveterans wanting to know how this could happen and what type of risk \nthey are facing.\n  So I thought I would take this moment, as the chairman of the \nVeterans Affairs Committee in the Senate, to visit with my colleagues \nabout it: No 1, to lay out the facts as we know them--they are limited \nbecause this is an ongoing investigation and, therefore, the FBI has \ndenied VA the right to talk in any great detail about this breach of \nsecurity--and, No. 2, to provide all of you with some context in which \nto think about this issue.\n  First, what we know is that the information was taken to the home of \na VA employee in violation of VA policy. We also know that the employee \nwho took the information was authorized to view it. So this was not a \ncase of unauthorized personnel looking at sensitive information. We \nalso know that the employee was the person who brought the loss of the \ninformation to the attention of VA officials.\n  So what we have is an employee, authorized to view information, who \ntook the information home, apparently to do work in violation of agency \npolicy, and then immediately informed the agency when the theft of the \ndata became apparent.\n  Certainly, the employee should face some consequence for his or her \naction. Obviously, he or she should have known not to remove that type \nof information from VA's protected data system. However, at this point, \nthe actual removal of the data does not appear to be a crime at all.\n\n  Of course, the FBI is still investigating whether any criminal \nbehavior occurred. At this point, they do not suspect any foul play on \nthe part of this longtime Federal employee. Rather, they only suspect a \nrandom act of burglary at the employee's home that, unfortunately, \ncompromised this very important information.\n  I must tell you that I struggle--a little--with the question of \nwhether VA, or any Government agency, should keep information like the \ntype that was lost without any real reason to do so. But I also know \nthat when Americans contact their Government or veterans file a claim, \nthey expect, in this day and age, that they will have their \ninformation. So there is a disconnect with what we expect and the \nsecurity we expect it to be held with or if that information should be \nheld at all.\n  So given the expectations of our consumers, in this case our \nconstituents, I think we need to make sure we have a uniform set of \nguidelines for training our employees all across Government, and that \nthen we work on putting in place a system with enough checks and \nbalances to be sure that no employee can abuse information data bases \nof any agency.\n  Frankly, this problem is not likely limited to VA. Many Federal \nagencies keep records on citizens that contain sensitive information. \nIt is not just IRS or HHS. There is information maintained by the \nDepartment of Education, that comes from the free application for \nFederal student loans or the Department of Agriculture, which provides \ncrop assistance plans and crop insurance and a variety of other kinds \nof things.\n  All of these agencies have names and addresses and Social Security \nnumbers. They must be secure. At the same time, we need employees who \ncan use that information for legitimate purposes to serve our \nconstituencies in a timely fashion.\n  All of this will require thoughtful balancing on the part of this \nCongress. We have to balance every doctor's need to see a veteran's \nmedical records with the legitimate concern that one too many nurses on \nthe floor have access to those records for no reason.\n  I hope what took place at the VA a few weeks ago is only an isolated \nincident of bad judgment by a dedicated employee seeking to do a little \nwork at home on his or her own time. But we must not ignore the fact \nthat it appears, at this time, that getting that information to his or \nher home was very easy. That cannot be tolerated because it may well \nhave been a breach of policy but not a violation of law.\n  So my committee will hold hearings this Thursday with VA officials to \nexamine what their policies and practices are with respect to sensitive \ninformation and how we can assure that a breach of security such as \nthis does not happen in the future.\n  We will also be asking the right questions about the security of \nveterans themselves and if VA is doing all they possibly can do at this \ntime now, along with the IRS and the Social Security Administration, to \nmake sure that veterans whose names were on that list--some 26 million, \nof which 19 million had critical information--be treated fairly and \nresponsive to assure, if we can, the protection of their information \nbase.\n  It is fundamentally important that our Government and the Veterans' \nAdministration respond as quickly as they can. And there is every \nindication, at least at this moment--which our hearing, I trust, will \nbear out--that they are moving in the right direction to assure that.\n  This may have been the largest breach of ID in our Nation's history. \nWe need to make sure, as a Congress and as a Senate, that this cannot \nhappen in the future and that there are exacting guidelines to assure \nthis will not occur. In a day of electronic data and access that is \nunique and sometimes very easy, we need to make sure we are current \nwith all of our needs, without providing names and information that is \nnot necessarily needed to be held by our Government.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4958]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/23/senate-section/article/S4957-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4957-S4958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BREACH OF SECURITY WITHIN VA\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, I know the debate today and for the past \nseveral days has been focused on immigration. The Presiding Officer has \nbeen active in the negotiations, and I commend him for his good work. \nIt has been a tough debate on a very important issue--an issue of \nsecurity, fairness, and justice. It is an issue of economics, and it \naffects all of our States. It affects what America stands for. We have \nspent an inordinate and appropriate amount of time on that subject.\n  Tonight, I come to the floor to speak about another issue very close \nto my heart and to the people of Louisiana, particularly with regard to \nthe closeness of the arrival of the hurricane season. It is hard to \nbelieve that we are about ready to face another hurricane season again. \nJune 1, a few days from now, is the first official day of the hurricane \nseason. It comes this year bringing a lot more fright and anxiety to \nthe gulf coast because we were hit by a powerful series of storms last \nyear that devastated parts of Florida and a great part of the gulf \ncoast from Mississippi through the whole of south Louisiana, into the \ncity of New Orleans and the metropolitan area, and then on into Texas.\n  And two of those storms were the worst to hit the United States of \nAmerica. The devastation and the amount of damage is still climbing. A \nreport I saw today was that the damage is now $150 billion and \nclimbing. Hurricane Andrew, which was the greatest storm to hit the \nUnited States and to hit your State, Mr. President, was $40 billion. We \nare now at $150 billion and climbing. We have lost, of course, over \n1,300 people. People were killed by the storms and the flooding that \nensued from the multiple breaks in the levees that have put a major \nAmerican city and region--not just New Orleans, but St. Bernard Parish \nand Plaquemines, which often get left out of the debate. They are two \nof the parishes that lie south of New Orleans, as they hold the \nMississippi River, if you will, that splits their parishes in half. It \naffected the southwestern part of our State as well.\n  That doesn't get mentioned as much as it should--little towns such as \nCreole and big towns such as Lake Charles took a tough hit, and \nparishes such as Vermilion and little towns such as Erath, where almost \nevery home was destroyed or very damaged.\n  Having said that, it added insult to injury that this particular \ncoast that got battered so badly by these storms is also America's only \nenergy coast. This is the only energy coast in America, the only four \nStates that right now will allow drilling of oil and gas off their \nshores to provide for the economic vitality of this Nation and to \nprovide the oil and gas necessary to run the electric grid in this \ncountry and the transportation systems in this country, and to run \nenergy from lights to the entire energy grid.\n  I have been on this floor many times in my time in the Senate--now \nalmost 10 years--to talk about this subject. I thought I would take a \nfew minutes tonight, because we are approaching hurricane season, to \nremind the Senate that while immigration is a very important issue, and \nwe want to bring closure to that this week, I hope that very soon we \nwill get back to another issue of great interest and security for the \nNation, and that is the issue of energy security. It starts, in my \nview, with providing some more understanding and more help to those \nStates that are providing the oil and the gas for this Nation, as we \nseek to open up new places to drill in the Gulf of Mexico, which has \nbecome known as a section of the gulf called lease-sale 181. I hope \nthat bill will be considered. It came out of the Energy Committee that \nthe occupant of the chair and I serve on. I think that bill will come \nto the floor for some discussion.\n  As that bill moves to the floor and we move to the focus on energy \nand energy security, I want to take a few minutes to talk about this \ngulf coast area and how much we contribute and how, without some stream \nof revenue--whether we get it from lease-sale 181 or from other \noffshore drilling--to secure the wetlands that we are losing at an \nalarming rate, to provide some energy-related protection of this \ninfrastructure, to provide for the restoration of these wetlands this \nenergy coast will continue to be at risk.\n  If my colleagues and the people in Congress think that $150 billion \nis a lot of money, just wait until we go through a couple more \nhurricane seasons to really feel the effect of underinvestment over \ntime, to a point where it is almost criminal. Let me repeat--an \nunderinvestment over time that borders on being criminal.\n  I have some new charts, since I have used all my old ones up for 10 \nyears of this debate. This is a satellite photograph from USGS of all \nof the pipelines and flow lines in the United States off of the shore. \nI have come down here so many times to say that the offshore oil and \ngas industry could not even exist if it were not for the partnership, \nwhich we have done thus far proudly and willingly--but that is wearing \nthin--we have done it proudly and supported the oil and gas industry \nfor now almost 45 years off of our shores. You can see this is the \nLouisiana coastline. This is the Mississippi coastline. This is Texas.\n  This is all of the pipelines and flow lines connecting thousands of \nwells that are in the Gulf of Mexico bringing oil and gas to a nation \nthat is thirsty for oil and needing gas, because the supply is so low \nand the consumption is so high and the prices are going up. The four \nStates that are putting their shoulder to the wheel every day are \nAlabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. This is the picture that \nproves it.\n  This is out on this map about 200 miles of activity. So for some \npeople who have said the drilling is so far off your coast that the \npeople of Louisiana don't have anything to do with it, let me explain \nthat you cannot access grids and rigs and oil and gas without \npipelines, gadgets, widgets, drills, well heads, and supply boats. It \nis impossible. Every single widget, gadget, and supply boat either \ncomes by boat or helicopter out of one of these many ports that have \nproudly supported this industry. You can see the line stops at the \nMobile Bay. The reason is because Florida, which consumes more energy \nthan almost any State relative to its lack of production--consumes but \nhas not produced. Florida is not the only State. I could show you a \nchart of California and Michigan and New York--States that consume a \nlot of energy but have not been willing to produce it in any way, \neither by nuclear, by wind, or by strict conservation--except for \nCalifornia; I will give them credit for conservation measures. But \nother States won't do conservation or production.\n  I don't know if you can see this thin line. Last year, the industry \nwent ahead, because of this policy, and laid a pipeline all the way to \nFlorida to provide gas to Florida. But we have to drill it off of \nAlabama's coast and then send it to Florida free of charge.\n  I am going to show you another chart that says the same thing, but it \nis a little different. When I say that the gulf coast is America's only \nenergy coast, this is another way to look at it. Every one of these \ngreen blocks--this goes out 200 miles into the gulf--were active leases \nprior to 2003. That is the green. They are active leases issued in \n2003, which were the last lease-sales; 185, 187, and 189 are the light \nyellow. And then the red have been withdrawn from leasing. Not many. \nThe active leases issued in 2004.\n  Basically, the green and yellow are leases. From these leases are \nproduced, for the Federal Treasury--I remind everybody that we are \nrunning a serious deficit. So besides contributing oil and gas, we also \ncontribute a lot of money to the Treasury. We are sending to the \nFederal Government every year $6 billion. It was $2 billion when I got \nhere; now it is $6 billion. Before I leave, it will probably go up to \n$15 billion, assuming I can get here another term. So $6 billion goes \nfrom the royalties by passing all of the communities here that build \nthe widgets, gadgets, supply boats--over all the heads of the workers \nthat drill, over all their homes that are underwater and ruined, over \nall of the wetlands that are being infringed upon, and in a fairly \ncritical way.\n\n  Although we have made a lot of changes in our environmental laws, the \nproblem is that a lot of these canals were drilled in the 1930s and \n1940s. I am sorry, I wasn't born to try to help protect them then. But \nlike my daughter said the other day, I am born now. We tried our best \nin the last couple of years, with the little money Louisiana had to do \nsome of this work, but we\n\n[[Page S4959]]\n\ncannot possibly do this work on our own. We should not have to, Mr. \nPresident, because we send to the Federal Treasury--which is much \nwealthier than the State of Louisiana and Mississippi and Alabama, \nthree of the poorest States in the Union--and even Texas has a lot of \npoor and lower middle-income people. We are subsidizing the National \nGovernment, giving them the oil, giving them the gas, and then giving \nthem all the money. It just has to stop.\n  We need some money to restore our coast, to build levees, and to \nprotect the infrastructure that is at risk. We were very fortunate that \neven with this powerful storm, most everybody in the industry has \nworked very hard to create very good technology so that these rigs and \nplatforms can withstand a lot of wind pressure and strong waves. Every \ntime a storm comes, the industry, because it is innovative, gets better \nand better. But there were some close calls with these platforms. They \nare still not completely up in the gulf.\n  I will show you one more chart. When people say what about gas, this \nis oil and gas. I will show you what the gas trunk looks like. This is \nbillion cubic feet flow levels. The areas do not include LNG imports. \nThis is just what we drill ourselves. If we put imports here, I don't \nknow what it would look like because nobody wants to put a liquefied \nnatural gas plant anywhere except where? Texas, Louisiana, and \nMississippi again. Everybody has siting problems with liquefied natural \ngas that comes imported. Here we step up again and are building some of \nthe largest liquefied natural gas plants so we can get gas from other \nplaces. Agriculture in every State, particularly the Midwest, needs \nthese gas prices to come down. They are having a great deal of \ndifficulty in the Midwest. They are having a great deal of difficulty \nin Illinois and in New Jersey and in Delaware.\n  The chemical industry runs on very slim margins. So who comes to the \nrescue? Louisiana and Mississippi, all the gas coming through here to \ntry to keep everybody happy and working. And we cannot get one penny \nfrom these royalties in any significant way.\n  Well, it is not true that we have not gotten one penny. What is true \nis that Senator Domenici, with his great leadership, recognized this \nand has been a wonderful help and supporter. Last year, in the Energy \nbill, he gave us, for the first time, a billion dollars. We were \ngrateful. But it is a billion dollars over a few years. We have to \ndivide it among the States. It sounds like a lot, but it doesn't go \nvery far. We need a long-term commitment so that we can count on money \nyear after year to do what we need to do in this community.\n  I want to show one more that is even more dramatic. I am going to get \nto this for Texas and Mississippi and Alabama. But this shows the oil \nand gas wells inside the coastal zone. This is how many wells we have. \nIf you would see our whole State, you could not believe it. Most of \nthis land is private land, unlike the Western States that came into the \nunion with a lot of Federal land. This is private land. So private \nlandowners get a royalty. That is fine. The State gets some money. \nWhile it looks like a lot of money the State would be getting, these \nwells were drilled decades ago, in many cases. Some of them are still \nproducing, but some of them are not.\n\n  Outside this coastal zone--this is our 3-mile line--outside this \ncoastal zone, according to the law which I am trying to change, we get \nno revenues from these wells.\n  The final chart is pretty frightening, actually. This is a chart of \nthe hurricane tracks from 1955 to 2005. This is how many hurricanes \nhave hit the gulf coast and the east coast from 1955 to 2005. The blue \nline is the track of Hurricane Rita, and the yellow line is the track \nof Katrina. Both of these storms were at some point in their track \ncategory 5 storms. Within 3\\1/2\\ weeks, they hit the east side of \nLouisiana and then right to the Louisiana-Texas line.\n  For the State, it was terrible to have two very big storms hit, but \nas a Senator, I have to tell you, I said a thanksgiving that it didn't \nhit Houston straight-on because if it had hit Houston and Galveston and \nput that energy sector out--Katrina had done a great deal to put out \nPort Fourchon, which is the only energy port in the Nation right on the \ncoast--I don't know what would have happened to the lights in America. \nMaybe they would have all gone off. But nobody seems to care about \nthat.\n  I promise my colleagues, as sure as I am standing here, there will be \na series of storms that plow into this gulf coast. The water is getting \nwarmer. I don't know how many times people have to write articles, give \nspeeches, or write books about the fact that global warming is \nhappening. One can argue about its causes, but nobody can argue that it \nis actually happening. When the waters warm, any scientist will tell \nyou these storms are going to pick up in intensity and in frequency.\n  I need to ask the Congress: What more will it take? What more will it \ntake before we act to give the gulf coast a portion of their revenues \nto protect themselves so that we can protect everyone else? What more \nhas to happen? How many more storms? How much more loss of property? \nHow many more close calls before we have to shut down the rigs and the \npipelines and put America's lights out and put our economy at even \ngreater risk?\n  I go to my office and I ask my staff: Is there some other chart we \ncan come up with that could show people the danger? Is there some other \nspeech I can give?\n  I might not be making myself clear, so I am asking the Senate \ntonight, as we wind down the immigration bill and as we think about \nmoving to lease sale 181 or maybe a mini Energy bill because we have \nlots of problems in the energy sector, lots of challenges, can I please \nask one more time: Can we please get some funding out of the new \nrevenues that are being generated off America's only energy coast to \ngive the people of the gulf coast some resources so they can protect \nthemselves a little better?\n  If somebody tries to tell me, Senator, why don't you just have \neverybody move, if I have to hear one more person say we have to get \neverybody to move or we have to move out of New Orleans--New Orleans is \nnot even on the coast. We are not on the coast. Miami is on the coast. \nSavannah is on the coast. Gulfport is on the coast. Beaumont is on the \ncoast. New Orleans is not on the coast. We are 100 miles from the \ncoast. But if these wetlands continue to erode at the rate they are \ngoing, we are going to be talking about Little Rock as a coastal city. \nI know I am exaggerating a little bit, but I promise the Senate that \nthis coastal erosion is moving at such a rapid rate that not only is \nNew Orleans at risk, Baton Rouge is at risk, Lafayette is at risk, Lake \nCharles is at risk, and then we have Galveston, Beaumont, and Houston.\n  We just cannot move everybody back 200 miles from the coast. In fact, \nthe last time I looked at this data, all along the coast of the United \nStates and growing mostly in Florida, people are moving to the coast. \nWe may be the only State where people are actually moving away from the \ncoast, but the coast is moving to us. We are not moving to the coast to \nbuild condominiums or golf courses. We can't build a golf course in a \nwetland, and we can't put a big skyscraper up in the wetlands.\n  We moved little communities so that we could construct a fishing \nindustry for the Nation. We run the great ports that benefit the whole \ncountry, and we run the oil and gas industry that benefits the Nation. \nWe are not on the coast sunbathing and building condos. But if the \ncountry wants everybody along the coast to move, then I suggest some \nagency come up with an evacuation and relocation plan that can proceed \nto move tens of millions of Americans because that is exactly what we \nare going to have to do because two-thirds of all Americans live within \n50 miles of a coast. But New Orleans is not 50 miles from a coast.\n  The Netherlands has a much better plan. I am going to save that \nspeech for another time. There are countries--not America--in the world \nthat use their technology, use their resources, use their brains, and \nuse the money they get from oil and gas by placing it into good levees, \ngood dikes, good engineering, and they protect their people as best \nthey can. We cannot stop these storms. Nobody can stop them. But a \nsmart country, a country with good policies, mitigates and protects and \nputs up smart barriers and learns to work with the water and the wind \nmuch better than we are doing.\n\n[[Page S4960]]\n\n  With this chart in the background, I conclude by saying, let us move, \nafter immigration, to an energy subject. Let us take the opportunity \nSenator Domenici is going to give us to bring lease sale 181 up for \ndebate. I will show where it is. Lease sale 181 is going to be a new \narea, which sits on the border of Alabama and Florida, that we are \ngoing to try to open.\n  I know, Mr. President, this is a sensitive subject for Florida \nbecause I have worked with you and Senator Nelson.\n  The Presiding Officer and Senator Nelson have been outstanding in \ntheir advocacy of trying to balance the needs of Florida and their \ntourism industry, which we have as well, with the needs for the gulf \ncoast.\n  As we can see on this map, there is plenty of room to give a buffer \nto Florida that is reasonable and allow for more drilling. That is the \nidea. It has to be reasonable and provide some additional areas to get \nsome oil and gas far enough off the coast so it will not affect the \nbeaches because Florida does have a tourism industry based on beaches. \nOur tourism industry is not based on beaches. We only have two beaches, \nand they are only 7 miles long, and we can't hardly get to them. But we \nhave great wetlands and we are proud of them. We have a lot of \necotourism, pirogues, canoes, hunting and fishing, which is \nextraordinary in our State, and we are proud of that, just as Florida \nis proud of its beaches.\n  Mr. President, you heard me say this to you privately many times. \nHalf the people of Louisiana have grown up on the beaches of Florida. \nWe don't have that much money. We can't go that far. So we manage to go \nto the Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida beaches. We are happy for the \nday or two spent on a beach in Florida. We are happy for it. But there \nis a reasonable compromise to be had.\n  I have been proud to work with many of my colleagues to try to come \nup with a way to open up this drilling, provide revenue sharing for \nthese States on the gulf coast that have given so much and that want to \ncontinue to give and benefit the Nation, and finally to give our people \nsome hope.\n  It has been a struggle to build the levees through the years. We \nneeded to repair the levees that broke. The hope that we could give to \nour people all along the gulf coast as hurricane season starts June 1--\nhurricane season starts June 1. Millions of people living along this \ncoast are reading the reports that this hurricane season might be worse \nthan last. Wouldn't it be wonderful for the Congress of the United \nStates to say this is a security issue for America, that this means a \ngreat deal to us, and we are going to act now to provide some hope to \nthe people of the gulf coast?\n  We have lived in this area a long time, and we are going to stay \nliving here. We have been living here for over 300 years. We were a \ncolony before there was a country. We were living here, and we are not \nleaving. Whether the country helps us or not, we are going to stay here \nand keep doing our job. It has gotten to the point where it is so \ngrossly unfair. We have to find a solution so that the people who live \nhere can have hope that the country they live in actually cares about \nthem, not just about how fast they can get out to the rigs to turn on \nthe oil and gas for everybody else, but maybe we would care enough \nabout their homes that have been flooded and the children's schools \nthey can't go to or their churches that got flooded and help them to \nrebuild their homes, their schools, their churches so they can continue \nto work out on these rigs and send the oil and gas to New York and to \nIllinois and to Florida.\n  We will build smartly, we have built smartly, and we will build even \nmore in that way, but we cannot abandon this coast because if we did, \nwho would keep the rigs working? Who would keep the pipelines open? Who \nwould navigate the ships up the port?\n  Mr. President, I have taken all or maybe more of my 30 minutes, and I \nappreciate the time. Again, when we get to lease sale 181, let's try to \ncome together and come up with a reasonable solution, one that works \nfor the Nation, one that works for the gulf coast States, and one of \nwhich we can actually be proud.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/23/senate-section/article/S4960-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to U.S. Marine \nCorps LCpl Robert Louis Moscillo of Salem, NH, for his service and his \nsupreme sacrifice for his country.\n  Robert, also called Bobby by family and friends, was a 2003 graduate \nof Salem High School where he played baseball and was on the wrestling \nteam. On January 22, 2005, he answered a call to serve our country \nduring these tense and turbulent times by enlisting in the U.S. Marine \nCorps. He successfully completed recruit training, marine combat \ntraining, combat engineer school, and the Martial Arts Program with a \nTan Belt and was assigned to the 1st Combat Engineer Battalion, 1st \nMarine Division, I Marine Expeditionary Force, Camp Pendleton, CA, \nwhere he served as a combat engineer. In February 2006, Bobby deployed \nto Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and the following month \nwas promoted to the rank of lance corporal.\n  Tragically, on May 1, 2006, this brave 21-year-old marine was killed \nin action by an improvised explosive device explosion while conducting \ncombat operations against enemy forces in the vicinity of Fallujah in \nthe Al Anbar province of Iraq. His awards and decorations include the \nSea Service Deployment Ribbon, Iraq Campaign Medal, Purple Heart, \nCombat Action Ribbon, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and the \nNational Defense Service Medal.\n  Patriots from the State of New Hampshire have served our Nation with \nhonor and distinction from Bunker Hill to Baghdad--and Bobby served in \nthat fine tradition. Daniel Webster said, ``God grants liberty only to \nthose who love it, and are always ready to guard and defend it.'' Bobby \nwas one of those proud and dedicated volunteers who believed in \nfighting for our country and guarding our precious liberty, and for \nthat we will always owe our sincere gratitude. His service and \nsacrifice are a shining example of the highest caliber of person this \ncountry can produce. This athletic and spiritual young man realized a \ncalling and chose to employ his youthful energy and considerable \ntalents for his country. He understood that the freedoms and \nopportunities provided by this Nation need continuous defense and that \nthey are among the most precious gifts he can give to his family and \nloved ones.\n  My heartfelt sympathy, condolences, and prayers go out to Robert's \nparents, Frank and Donna, and his family and friends who have suffered \nthis grievous loss. Robert was, and forever will be, a strong and \nintegral part of his family and will be missed by all. Because of his \ndevotion and sense of duty, the safety and liberty of each and every \nAmerican is more secure. May God bless LCpl Robert Louis Moscillo.\n\n\n                  Army Master Sergeant Robert H. West\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the life of a \nfellow Coloradoan: Army MSG Robert H. West. Master Sergeant West was \nkilled last week near Baghdad in service to this Nation. He was 37 \nyears old, and lived with his wife and daughter in Arvada, CO.\n  Master Sergeant West arrived for his second tour of duty in Iraq just \n3 months ago. He was there to train Iraqi police officers, shouldering \nthe difficult burden of helping to build lasting peace and democracy in \nIraq at a very personal level. Master Sergeant West felt that his \nfirsthand experience as a drill instructor made him a better fit to \ntrain Iraqis than many of the young U.S. soldiers serving in Iraq with \nhim. Master Sergeant West's family was not happy about his decision to \nreturn to Iraq, but he did so with confidence and courage, telling his \naunt, ``I'm a trained professional, it'll be all right.''\n  One of the hallmarks of Master Sergeant West's life was his \ncommitment to excellence in everything he did. As a\n\n[[Page S4961]]\n\nhigh school football player he spent countless hours in the weight \nroom, and helped lead Elyria Catholic High School's football team to \nback-to-back Ohio State championships in the mid 1980s.\n  After graduating high school in 1987, Master Sergeant West joined the \nArmy in 1988, eventually rising to become a tank commander and drill \ninstructor. In this capacity, Master Sergeant West spent countless \nhours molding wide-eyed, inexperienced young men and women from around \nthe country into strong, confident soldiers. It was this experience \nthat gave him the confidence to return to Iraq to work with that \ncountry's growing police force.\n  In Iraq, Master Sergeant West was assigned to an armored cavalry \ndivision, where he conducted house-to-house searches looking for \ninsurgents. During one of these patrols, an improvised explosive device \nwas detonated near his Humvee, and he was killed.\n  Master Sergeant West's wife Jeannie and their daughter Shelby must \nknow that Robert's service to this Nation, and his sacrifice on behalf \nof all of us, does not go unnoticed or unappreciated. Robert's service \nand sacrifice are a profound reminder that the liberty and freedoms we \nenjoy do not come without a sometimes very personal and terrible cost. \nAs a country and community, we are all humbled by his commitment and \noffer our grateful support during his family's time of unimaginable \ngrief.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/23/senate-section/article/S4961-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4961-S4962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DEATH OF JUDGE EDWARD R. BECKER\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the country, the judiciary, and the Senate \nhave lost a patriot, a great man of character and integrity, a gifted \njudge, and a trusted friend with the passing last week of U.S. Circuit \nJudge Edward Becker.\n  Edward Roy Becker was born on May 4, 1933, in his beloved \nPhiladelphia.\n  He practiced law there for more than a decade, until President \nRichard Nixon appointed him to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania in 1970.\n  President Ronald Reagan elevated Judge Becker to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit in 1981. The Third Circuit considers \nappeals from Federal district courts in Delaware, New Jersey, \nPennsylvania, and the Virgin Islands.\n  Judge Becker eventually served as the Third Circuit's chief judge for \n5 years before taking senior status on his 70th birthday in 2003.\n  Edward Becker lived for nearly all of his 73 years in his boyhood \nhome in the Frankford section of Philadelphia.\n  He read legal briefs while riding the train to the courthouse, where \nhe was known for what the New York Times described as a lack of \ngrandiosity rarely found in a Federal court.\n  With an uncanny ability to play virtually any song by ear on the \npiano, Judge Becker accompanied Supreme Court Justices at their annual \nsing-a-longs that the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist hosted for \nthe law clerks.\n  When part of Independence National Historic Park, which he could see \nfrom his chambers window, was closed after the September 11 terrorist \nattacks, Judge Becker supported the efforts of a citizens' coalition \nwhich succeeded in getting the street reopened in 2003.\n  Judge Becker was not just any Federal judge.\n  After more than 35 years on the bench, he was certainly a senior \nmember of the Federal judiciary.\n  But he served not only the cause of justice but also the institution \nof the judiciary in such capacities as the board of directors of the \nFederal Judicial Center and the executive committee of the Judicial \nConference of the United States.\n  His many and varied writings covered topics ranging from the federal \nsentencing guidelines and rules of evidence to the sixth amendment's \nconfrontation clause and even law journal footnotes.\n  Imagine that, an entire law journal article about law journal \nfootnotes.\n  Judge Becker made his judicial mark in many ways. Judges write \nopinions that follow or apply principles established by the Supreme \nCourt. Judge Becker did that as well but also wrote landmark opinions \nestablishing rules or principles that would later be adopted by the \nSupreme Court.\n  His 1985 opinion in United States v. Downing, for example, adopted a \nstandard regarding expert witness testimony.\n  The Supreme Court cited Judge Becker's opinion in Downing when it \nadopted the same standard 8 years later in its famous Daubert v. \nMerrill Dow Pharmaceuticals decision.\n  Judge Becker was also known for his knowledge and expertise in \nhandling complex litigation.\n  He served on the board of editors for the ``Manual for Complex \nLitigation'' and handled many such cases during his years on the bench.\n  In 1996, for example, he wrote the opinion in Georgine v. Amchem \nProducts concluding that the factual and legal issues in a lawsuit \nagainst asbestos manufacturers were too complex to allow certification \nof the suit as a class action.\n  Judge Becker's expertise in the area of complex litigation in \ngeneral, and asbestos cases in particular, led to his role in our \nongoing struggle here in the Senate with the asbestos crisis.\n  He provided invaluable counsel and assistance to the Judiciary \nCommittee, and his enormous wisdom, credibility, and integrity helped \nguide many complex discussions and negotiations. Every party to those \ndiscussions knew that Judge Becker was a straight shooter, a completely \nhonest broker.\n  Judge Becker could have considered his a strictly judicial role, \nlimited to handling the cases that came before him, but Judge Becker \nlooked past the walls of his courtroom at the judiciary as an \ninstitution, the justice system, and the country. He wanted to see the \ngrand principles of justice and fairness actually work in people's \nlives.\n  Judge Becker was not afraid to wade into other choppy waters in the \ninterest of the judicial branch.\n  Joined by several leading appeals court judges including now-\nAssociate Justice Stephen Breyer, Judge Becker sought in 1989 to make \nsome sense out of what had become an almost absurd process for hiring \njudicial law clerks.\n  Judges were interviewing students barely finished with their first \nyear of law school. Judge Becker believed that the trend disrupted the \nstudies of law students and demeaned the judiciary's reputation. This \nwas classic Judge Becker. He did not have to tackle such a touchy \nsubject.\n  Previous efforts to change the law clerk hiring system had failed, \nand the problem was worse than ever. But he cared so much for the \nintegrity of the judiciary, and for the individuals who served in it, \nthat he tackled it nonetheless. And he did it with the straightforward, \nno-nonsense, commonsense practicality that characterized everything he \ndid.\n  Judge Becker both loved and was beloved by his colleagues.\n  He organized a panel of current and former Third Circuit judges to \ntestify on behalf of their colleague Judge Samuel Alito upon his recent \nnomination to the Supreme Court. That panel was diverse, opinionated, \nand completely united in support of their colleague.\n  Judge Becker and Flora, his wife of nearly 50 years, kept in close \ntouch even with retired colleagues and with colleagues' spouses after \nthey died.\n  In addition to Flora, Judge Becker is survived by his children--Jon, \na teacher in Brooklyn; Susan, a Federal prosecutor in Philadelphia--and \nCharles, a lawyer in Philadelphia--and several grandchildren.\n  Our colleague, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, was a close \nfriend of Judge Becker for more than 50 years. He has said that Judge \nBecker was one of the greatest Philadephians in that great city's \nhistory. That is high praise indeed, considering the pantheon of \npatriots coming from the birthplace of the Constitution.\n  Judge Becker embodied so much that is great about this country. He \ncared deeply about principles of fairness and justice. He wanted those \nprinciples actually to work. He was both part of a collegial judicial \nbody and a unique individual with his own personality and character.\n  He would go to baseball games but take legal briefs with him to read.\n  His colleague, Judge Marjorie Rendell, once described Judge Becker as \n``the perfect combination of Mensa and mensch.''\n\n[[Page S4962]]\n\n  One of the historic preservationists who worked with Judge Becker to \nreopen the street in front of Independence Hall said of Judge Becker: \n``He was one step below the Supreme Court, but he's such an everyday \nman.''\n  Proverbs 16:19 offers a maxim that fits Judge Becker to a tee: \n``Better it is to be of a humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide \nthe spoil with the proud.''\n  By his character, personality, and wisdom, Edward Roy Becker made \nanyone who knew him better for the experience.\n  The judiciary, the country, and yes, the Senate, are better because \nthis good man walked and worked with us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/23/senate-section/article/S4962-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee took an important step on the issue of global climate change \nby passing a resolution, introduced by Chairman Lugar and Ranking \nMember Biden, that expresses the need for the United States to address \nglobal warming through the negotiation of fair and effective \ninternational commitments. While it remains to be seen whether the full \nSenate will take up and pass the resolution, I am encouraged by the \ngrowing awareness in Congress of the need to face the facts on global \nclimate change. Just last week, a report was released by a nonprofit \ngroup, Christian Aid, which suggests that climate change could lead to \nmillions of deaths in Africa. In my role as chairman and ranking member \nof the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on African Affairs, I have \npaid significant attention to the challenges faced by the continent of \nAfrica, and as we look to the future, we must address the consequences \nour global energy habits will have on less developed nations, in \naddition to the consequences on our own constituents. I applaud the \nleadership of Chairman Lugar and Ranking Member Biden on Senate \nResolution 312 and I hope that the Senate will move quickly to adopt \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/23/senate-section/article/S4962-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On June 9, 2005, Dwan Prince, a gay man, was attacked by his neighbor \nSteven Pomie near his Brooklyn, NY, home. During the attack, Pomie \nshouted antigay slurs as he punched and kicked Prince in the head until \nhe was unconscious. According to police, Pomie knew that Prince was a \ngay man prior to the attack.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/23/senate-section/article/S4962-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/23/senate-section/article/S4962-4", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/23/senate-section/article/S4962-5", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:22 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1736.

A bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nprovide free credit monitoring and credit reports for veterans and \nothers affected by the theft of veterans' personal data, to ensure that \nsuch persons are appropriately notified of such thefts, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, yesterday we learned that personal \ninformation, including names, dates of birth, and social security \nnumbers of as many as 26.5 million Americans--overwhelmingly veterans--\nmay have been compromised. I know we are all shocked and concerned that \nso many of America's veterans could be in jeopardy of identity theft.\n  The case is unique in many ways. This is not the result of computer \nhacking or private companies failing to protect data. This data was \nstolen from the home of a Department of Veterans Affairs employee.\n  We have been told that the FBI, local police, and the VA Inspector \nGeneral are all investigating. That aspect of this case should be left \nto them. There are other issues associated with security practices that \nmust be explored by the VA and the appropriate oversight and \ninvestigatory bodies of Congress.\n  But we in Congress have another responsibility. We must act now to \nhelp veterans secure their own identity and protect their credit. As we \nread in this morning's papers, experts tell us that this is the largest \nbreach of Social Security numbers in history. A criminal\n\n[[Page S4969]]\n\ncan use this information to do grievous harm and perpetrate fraud on a \nmassive scale.\n  Mr. President, this isn't a private company that is responsible for \nthis breach. It's the Department of Veterans Affairs of the United \nStates Government and we have a moral obligation to make sure that we \nprotect the identity and credit of every American veteran.\n  That is why today I am introducing the Veterans Identity Protection \nAct of 2006--to ensure the government assumes its rightful \nresponsibility to protect the identity security of so many Americans.\n  This legislation will require the Department of Veterans Affairs to \nprovide 1 year of credit monitoring to each affected individual. After \nthat year, this legislation requires the VA to provide one free credit \nreport to each person in addition to the free credit report already \nprovided by the Fair Credit Reporting Act. As a result, after the full \nyear of credit monitoring, those affected by this theft will have \naccess to four free credit reports over the course of 2 additional \nyears.\n  The legislation provides $1.25 billion in budget authority in the \nfirst year to pay for these programs. The total cost over 3 years is \nestimated at $2.5 billion. That is a lot of money and I would urge the \nVA to negotiate reduced costs with the service providers. To be sure, \nthis is no insignificant sum and the VA has many needs, but I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in recognizing that this is not an optional \ncourse of action. It is something we have to do to protect American \nveterans. It is also an expense that the VA cannot realistically fund \nout of its strapped budget. We will need an emergency appropriation to \nfund this security initiative--but let us begin to do right by our \nveterans.\n  Mr. President, I believe that caring for America's veterans is a \ncontinuing cost of war. I also believe that the United States \ngovernment has a moral obligation to protect the identity security of \nthose who are in jeopardy because of mistakes or the lax security \npractices of government employees.\n  America's veterans put their lives on the line for all of us \nthroughout history. Those who served in peace and in war, from Iwo Jima \nand Normandy to Baghdad and Kabul, shouldn't be forced to bear the \nadditional cost and worry of protecting their security identity because \nthe government put them at risk. We must act.\n  Mr. President, thank you.\n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 2983. A bill to provide for the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment to coordinate Federal housing assistance efforts in the \ncase of disasters resulting in long-term housing needs, to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr President, there are countless examples of times \nwhen FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, did more harm than \ngood in the aftermath of the 2005 hurricanes. While they could not \navoid some of the problems and better planning could have helped avoid \nothers, FEMA's lack of expertise in one area in particular has been \nespecially problematic: disaster housing. Today, I am introducing the \nNatural Disaster Housing Reform Act of 2006 to put long-term disaster \nhousing in the hands of the agency with the appropriate expertise: the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Develpment, HUD. Congressman Baker \nintroduced this legislation in the House of Representatives. I \ncongratulate him on his leadership.\n  I am not introducing this bill simply to gang up on FEMA. One could \nargue that the Agency is an easy target. Let me assure my colleagues \nthat this is not my intention. I simply believe that for future \ndisasters, the Federal Cabinet Agency with the expertise in housing \nshould run disaster housing assistance.\n  HUD has housing expertise. FEMA does not. HUD oversees 1.2 million \npublic housing units. It administers the section 8 rental assistance \nprogram for 2.1 million families. They provide supportive housing for \n320,000 senior citizens and people with disabilities. HUD also has a \nnetwork of more than 3,000 public housing agencies in cities and \ncounties across the country, so it has the infrastructure already in \nplace to meet emergency housing needs. In all, HUD provides housing \nassistance to over 3.3 million households nationwide. FEMA is simply \nnot equipped to deal with the housing needs of hundreds of thousands of \npeople after mass disasters like Katrina and Rita.\n  FEMA's expertise lies in disaster preparedness and response, as well \nas short-term recovery needs: emergency shelter and financial \nassistance, infrastructure rebuilding, and financial support to \ncommunities. In smaller disasters that do not impact as widespread an \narea, FEMA can provide short-term housing assistance either by putting \npeople up in hotels or giving them trailers to live in. But the \ndisplacement of hundreds of thousands of people over a wide area and \nthe need to provide all of those people with housing assistance proved \ntoo much for FEMA. Its administration of the hotel program was marked \nby confusion and unrealistic termination deadlines that were constantly \nextended, causing additional anxiety for displaced victims who did not \nneed more uncertainty. At such a time, an agency should not provide \nadditional housing problems--it should provide housing solutions.\n  The travel trailer program is extremely costly and inefficient. The \ncheapest trailer cost between $16,000 and $20,000 to purchase. Over the \n18-month life of assistance, including installation and maintenance, \nthe travel trailers cost $59,800. That's $3,300 per month for the \ntravel trailers--the low-end option. Mobile homes cost $76,800 over 18 \nmonths. Compare this to the roughly $500 average monthly cost of a HUD \nsection 8 rental voucher. These vouchers could be provided on an \nemergency basis at a far less than FEMA programs. HUD programs are also \neasily accessible. Everyone who was displaced by Katrina and Rita ended \nup near one of the 3,000 public housing authorities that administer HUD \nprograms.\n  The bill also contains provisions that my colleague from Louisiana, \nSenator Vitter, included in his bill S. 2771, the Disaster Housing \nFlexibility Act of 2006. That bill amends the Stafford Act to allow \nhurricane victims to receive modular housing if the President \ndetermines that such housing is more cost effective. I am pleased to \ninclude these provisions in the legislation I am introducing today.\n  Mr. President, hurricane season starts next week. Across the Federal \nGovernment, agencies are getting ready. This legislation will help us \navoid repeating some of the mistakes of the past in the event of \nanother storm. This bill will create a more efficient, effective and \nresponsive Federal housing assistance program for future disasters. \nDisaster victims need this efficiency and certainty, not a repeat of \nFEMA's woeful performance during Katrina.\n  I thank the Chair and ask unanimous consent that my entire statement \nand a copy of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2983\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the Land Between the Rivers National \nHeritage Area in the State of Illinois, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nestablish the Land Between the Rivers National Heritage Area in \nsouthern Illinois. I am pleased that my colleague, Senator Obama, is an \noriginal cosponsor of this legislation.\n  The unique landscape of southern Illinois helped to shape the history \nof our Nation, from the Revolutionary War through the Civil War, from \nwestward expansion to trade along the rivers. Designating this area a \nNational Heritage Area will help to provide assistance in both the \nconservation and historic preservation of southern Illinois and many \nareas that influenced events in our Nation's history.\n  The name ``Land Between the Rivers'' was a phrase first used by \nNative Americans to describe the area covered by this bill. It includes \n17 counties in the southernmost region of Illinois located between the \nMississippi and the Ohio Rivers and between the Mississippi and Wabash \nRivers. Native Americans arrived in southern Illinois about 10,000 \nyears ago and formed the largest settlement north of the Mayan/Aztec \ncivilization.\n  The arrival of the Europeans, including French, British and Spanish \nexplorers, began a period of settlements and fortifications in the \narea. The Spanish first explored the Mississippi River in 1542, \nfollowed by the French in 1673.\n\n[[Page S4971]]\n\nThe French founded Cahokia in 1699 and Kaskaskia in 1703. While the \nBritish occupied much of the area after the French and Indian War and \nthe Treaty of Paris in 1762, British control of the area lasted only \nuntil the onset of the Revolutionary War. In 1778 and 1779, George \nRogers Clarke and a group of about 200 men forced the British out of \nthe area and captured the British occupied Fort Cahokia and Fort \nSackville at Vincennes.\n  Southern Illinois's central location made the area a hotbed of racial \nissues as well as a pivotal point militarily, socially and politically \nduring the Civil War. As the southernmost slavery-free location, \nsouthern Illinois, and particularly Cairo and the surrounding area, was \nthe destination of numerous runaway slaves. As the Civil War \napproached, thousands of African-Americans fled to southern Illinois, \nseeking the help of southern Illinois abolitionists such as Benajah \nGuernesy Roots. During the Civil War the Union Army maintained its \nsouthernmost point of operations in southern Illinois with BG Ulysses \nS. Grant headquartered in Cairo. Southern Illinois is also the home to \nnumerous victories of the Union Army along the Mississippi River. The \ninland Union Navy came through to defeat the Confederate forces \nculminating in the capture of Vicksburg in July 1863.\n  Finally, this area of southern Illinois has tremendous historical \nsignificance in the transport of trade goods along the Mississippi \nRiver. The oldest Illinois town, Shawneetown, was once the most \nimportant entry port on the Ohio River. Steamboat transport flourished \nin the early part of the 19th century with more tonnage on the \nMississippi and Ohio Rivers than on the Atlantic coast. Towns such as \nChester, Elizabethtown, Cairo, Metropolis, and Golconda were created \nduring the steamboat era.\n  The legislation I am introducing today, would call for Southern \nIllinois University Carbondale to be designated as the management \nentity for the Land Between the Rivers National Heritage Area.\n  The unique natural history of southern Illinois combined with its \nhistorical and cultural features are making it an important \ncontribution to tourism in Illinois. Creating the Land Between the \nRivers National Heritage Area will provide the ability to connect the \nentire region into one cohesive historic unit in which the places and \nevents of the past can be united to provide the full story of southern \nIllinois's influence in the shaping of our Nation.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2985\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Land Between the Rivers \n     Southern Illinois National Heritage Area Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) southern Illinois has a cohesive, distinctive, and \n     important landscape that distinguishes the area as worthy of \n     designation as a National Heritage Area;\n       (2) the historic features of southern Illinois reflect a \n     period during which the area was the strategic convergence \n     point during the westward expansion of the United States;\n       (3) the geographic centrality of southern Illinois ensured \n     that the area played a pivotal military, social, and \n     political role during the Civil War, which resulted in the \n     area being known as the ``Confluence of Freedom'';\n       (4) southern Illinois is at the junction of the ending \n     glaciers and 6 ecological divisions;\n       (5) after the expeditions of Lewis and Clark, the land \n     between the rivers became known as ``Egypt'' because of the \n     rivers in, and the beauty and agricultural abundance of, the \n     area;\n       (6) Native Americans described the area in southern \n     Illinois between the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers as the \n     ``Land Between the Rivers'';\n       (7) a feasibility study led by the Office of Economic and \n     Regional Development at Southern Illinois University \n     Carbondale that was revised in April 2006 documents a \n     sufficient assemblage of nationally distinctive historic \n     resources to demonstrate the feasibility of, and the need \n     for, establishing the Land Between the Rivers National \n     Heritage Area; and\n       (8) stakeholders participating in the feasibility study \n     process for the Heritage Area have developed a proposed \n     management entity and financial plan to preserve the natural, \n     cultural, historic, and scenic features of the area while \n     furthering recreational and educational opportunities in the \n     area.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Con. Res. 96\n\n       Whereas the phrase ``In God We Trust'' is the national \n     motto of the United States;\n       Whereas, from the colonial beginnings of the United States, \n     citizens of the Nation have officially acknowledged their \n     dependence on God;\n       Whereas, in 1694, the phrase ``God Preserve Our Carolina \n     and the Lords Proprietors'' was engraved on the Carolina cent \n     and the phrase ``God Preserve Our New England'' was inscribed \n     on coins that were minted in New England during that year;\n       Whereas, while declaring the independence of the United \n     States from Great Britain, the Founding Fathers of the Nation \n     asserted: ``We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all \n     Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator \n     with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.'';\n       Whereas those signers of the Declaration of Independence \n     further declared: ``And for the support of this Declaration, \n     with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, \n     we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and \n     our sacred Honor.'';\n       Whereas, in 1782, one of the great leaders of the United \n     States, Thomas Jefferson, wrote: ``[C]an the liberties of a \n     nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm \n     basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these \n     liberties are the gift of God? That they are not to be \n     violated but with His wrath?'';\n       Whereas the distinguished founding statesman, Benjamin \n     Franklin, when speaking in 1787 at the Constitutional \n     Convention, declared: ``Our prayers, Sir, were heard, and \n     they were graciously answered. All of us who were engaged in \n     the struggle must have observed frequent instances of a \n     Superintending providence in our favor. To that kind \n     providence we owe this happy opportunity of consulting in \n     peace on the means of establishing our future national \n     felicity. And have we now forgotten that powerful friend? or \n     do we imagine that we no longer need His assistance. I have \n     lived, Sir, a long time and the longer I live, the more \n     convincing proofs I see of this truth--that God governs in \n     the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the \n     ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can \n     rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the \n     sacred writings that `except the Lord build they labor in \n     vain that build it.' I firmly believe this; and I also \n     believe that without his concurring aid we shall succeed in \n     this political building no better than the Builders of Babel. \n     . . .'';\n       Whereas the national hero and first President, George \n     Washington, proclaimed in his first inaugural address in \n     1789: ``[I]t would be peculiarly improper to omit in this \n     first official act my fervent supplications to that Almighty \n     Being who rules over the universe, who presides in the \n     councils of nations, and whose providential aids can supply \n     every human defect, that His benediction may consecrate to \n     the liberties and the happiness of the people of the United \n     States a government instituted by themselves for these \n     essential purposes, and may enable every instrument employed \n     in its administration to execute with success the functions \n     allotted to his charge.'';\n       Whereas one stanza of the ``Star Spangled Banner'', which \n     was written by Francis Scott Key in 1814 and adopted as the \n     national anthem of the United States in 1931, states: ``O \n     thus be it ever when free-men shall stand, Between their \n     lov'd home and the war's desolation; Blest with vict'ry and \n     peace, may the heav'n-rescued land Praise the Pow'r that hath \n     made and preserv'd us as a nation! Then conquer we must, when \n     our cause it is just, And this be our motto: `In God is our \n     trust!' And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave \n     O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!'';\n       Whereas, in 1861, the Secretary of the Treasury, Salmon P. \n     Chase, while instructing James Pollock, Director of the Mint \n     at Philadelphia, to prepare a motto, stated: ``No nation can \n     be strong except in the strength of God, or safe except in \n     His defense. The trust of our people in God should be \n     declared on our national coins. You will cause a device to be \n     prepared without unnecessary delay with a motto expressing in \n     the fewest and tersest words possible this national \n     recognition.'';\n       Whereas the phrase ``In God We Trust'' first appeared on a \n     coin of the United States in the 1864;\n       Whereas, in 1955, the phrase ``In God We Trust'' was \n     designated as a mandatory phrase to be inscribed on all \n     currency and coins of the United States;\n       Whereas, on March 28, 1956, the Judiciary Committee of the \n     House of Representatives, in its report accompanying H.J. \n     Res. 396 (84th Congress), stated: ``It will be of great \n     spiritual and psychological value to our country to have a \n     clearly designated national motto of inspirational quality in \n     plain, popularly accepted English.'';\n       Whereas, on July 30, 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower \n     signed H.J. Res. 396 (84th Congress), making the phrase ``In \n     God We Trust'' the official motto of the United States; and\n       Whereas the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the formal \n     adoption of the national motto of the United States, ``In God \n     We Trust'', presents an opportunity for the citizens of the \n     United States to reaffirm the concept embodied in that motto \n     that--\n       (1) the proper role of civil government is derived from the \n     consent of the governed, who are endowed by their Creator \n     with certain unalienable Rights; and\n       (2) the success of civil government relies firmly on the \n     protection of divine Providence: Now, therefore, be it\n\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) commemorates the 50th anniversary of the national motto \n     of the United States, ``In God We Trust'';\n       (2) celebrates the national motto as--\n       (A) a fundamental aspect of the national life of the \n     citizens of the United States; and\n       (B) a phrase that is central to the hopes and vision of the \n     Founding Fathers for the perpetuity of the United States;\n       (3) reaffirms today that the substance of the national \n     motto is no less vital to the future success of the Nation; \n     and\n       (4) encourages the citizens of the United States to reflect \n     on--\n       (A) the national motto of the United States; and\n       (B) the integral part that the national motto of the United \n     States has played in the life of the Nation, before and after \n     its official adoption.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/23/senate-section/article/S4972-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4972-S4973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4108.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Employment Security Act of \n     2006''.\n\n     SEC. 302. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The failure of Federal, State, and local governments to \n     control and sanction the unauthorized employment and unlawful \n     exploitation of illegal alien workers is a primary cause of \n     illegal immigration.\n       (2) The use of modern technology not available in 1986, \n     when the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (Public \n     Law 99-603; 100 Stat. 3359) created the I-9 worker \n     verification system, will enable employers to rapidly and \n     accurately verify the identity and work authorization of \n     their employees and independent contractors.\n       (3) The Government and people of the United States share a \n     compelling interest in protection of United States employment \n     authorization, income tax withholding, and social security \n     accounting systems, against unauthorized access by illegal \n     aliens.\n       (4) Limited data sharing between the Department of Homeland \n     Security, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Social \n     Security Administration is essential to the integrity of \n     these vital programs, which protect the employment and \n     retirement security of all working Americans.\n       (5) The Federal judiciary must be open to private United \n     States citizens, legal foreign workers, and law-abiding \n     enterprises that seek judicial protection against injury to \n     their wages and working conditions due to unlawful employment \n     of illegal alien workers and the United States enterprises \n     that utilize the labor or services provided by illegal \n     aliens, especially where lack of resources constrains \n     enforcement of Federal immigration law by Federal immigration \n     officials.\n\n         Subtitle B--Employment Eligibility Verification System\n\n     SEC. 311.

To the maximum extent \n     possible, the Secretary shall work to ensure that Canadian \n     identification documents used as described in this paragraph \n     contain the same technology as United States documents and \n     may be accepted using the same document scanners. \n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the event that \n     such certified identity document includes information that \n     shows an individual to be a citizen of Canada, such \n     individual shall be permitted to enter the United States from \n     Canada. The Secretary shall ensure that, at all times, more \n     States are participants in this program than Canadian \n     provinces.\n       (e) Expedited Processing for Repeat Travelers.--\n       (1) Land crossings.--To the maximum extent practicable, the \n     Secretary shall expand expedited traveler programs carried \n     out by the Secretary to all ports of entry and should \n     encourage citizens of the United States to participate in the \n     preenrollment programs, as such programs assist border \n     control officers of the United States in the fight against \n     terrorism by increasing the number of known travelers \n     crossing the border. The identities of such expedited \n     travelers should be entered into a database of known \n     travelers who have been subjected to in-depth background and \n     watch-list checks to permit border control officers to focus \n     more attention on unknown travelers, potential criminals, and \n     terrorists.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 489, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 489) relative to the death of Lloyd \n     Bentsen, distinguished member of the United States Senate.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the distinguished elder statesman, Senator \nLloyd Bentsen, passed away today in his family home in Houston at the \nage of 85. He leaves behind his wife Beryl Ann and his three children, \nLloyd III, Lan and Tina, and seven beloved grandchildren. He also \nleaves behind almost four decades of dedicated public service on behalf \nof Texas and the American people.\n  Alternately described as elegant, courtly, smooth, and collegial, \nLloyd Bentsen of Rio Grande Valley was the picture of a Senator. A \nshrewd legislator with finely honed negotiating skills, he was able to \nwork with both sides of the aisle and gain the trust and cooperation of \nhis colleagues.\n  Senator Bentsen began his life in public service in 1942 when, fresh \nout of the University of Texas Law School, he enlisted in the U.S. \nArmy. The war was on, and he was eager to serve his country.\n  After a brief stint as a private in intelligence, the young Bentsen \nbecame a combat pilot. He began flying B-24 missions over an embattled \nEurope. By the time he was done, he had flown 50 missions and earned \nthe Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with three oakleaf \nclusters. He retired a colonel in the Air Force Reserves.\n  Still a young man in his early twenties, he returned to his hometown, \nwhere he practiced law for a year. He then became a county judge at the \nage of 25, and in 1948 he ran for Congress, where he served for three \nconsecutive terms. He took a 16-year hiatus from elected office to \nbecome a successful financier. Then, in 1970, Lloyd Bentsen ran for the \nSenate, where he rose to national prominence. In 1988, Democratic \nPresidential nominee Michael Dukakis selected the distinguished 67-\nyear-old as his running mate, and in 1993, President Clinton nominated \nSenator Bentsen to serve the Department of Treasury. He led that \nDepartment and he retired in 1994, nearly 30 years in public office.\n\n  Over his long career, Senator Bentsen earned the respect of his \ncolleagues and of the American people. He was an old-school gentleman \nwho could don his partisan hat and share a respite from the day-to-day \nbattles on the Senate floor. I came across a quotation of his, not as \nfamous as another but one which I think sums up his lifetime in public \nservice and one which is a valuable motto for us all:\n\n       It should be clear by now that serious problems cannot be \n     solved by public relations; they can only be solved by public \n     responsibility.\n\n  Lloyd Bentsen's words.\n  On behalf of the Senate and the American people, our hearts go out to \nthe Bentsen family. We join them in mourning the passing of a \nnoteworthy statesman. May God bless them, and may God bless America.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today we mourn the loss of a great \nTexan and a true American hero. Lloyd Bentsen passed away this morning, \nand I rise to pay tribute to the life and legacy of a great statesman.\n  Senator Bentsen served this Nation in numerous capacities. Everyone \nin Texas knew who Lloyd Bentsen was during all of the time that I was \nin my early years of public service. Many in this body also served with \nhim and knew him well. He put his stamp on Texas, and he put his stamp \non our country.\n  Lloyd Bentsen was born in Mission, TX, in 1921, in the southernmost \npart of our State. He attended public schools and graduated from the \nUniversity of Texas Law School in 1942. Upon graduation, he served in \nthe U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II. He flew more than 200 \nbombing missions to liberate Europe from the Nazi grasp. For his heroic \nservice, he was awarded the Air Medal with three oak leaf clusters, as \nwell as the Distinguished Flying Cross for valor in combat. He retired \nwith the rank of colonel from the Air Force Reserve.\n\n[[Page S5028]]\n\n  After the war, Lloyd Bentsen returned home to his native Rio Grande \nValley. There he began his career as a public servant. As everyone who \nworked with him will attest, Lloyd Bentsen was a natural. His first \noffice was county judge of Hidalgo County. He was then elected to \nrepresent Texas in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1948, serving 6 \nyears before leaving Congress to go into business. He moved to Houston \nand started a business that was very successful, and after some number \nof years in business, he decided he wanted to do what he liked doing \nbest, and that was to have an office and serve the public. He was \nelected to the Senate in 1970.\n  I have to say that is when I really got to know Lloyd Bentsen a \nlittle bit because I was a cub news reporter at KPRC-TV in Houston, and \nI covered that race. It was the battle of the titans. This was a race \nbetween George H.W. Bush and Lloyd Bentsen for the U.S. Senate seat in \n1970. I remember me and all the reporters saying at the time that this \nis what a Senate race should be. These are two high-quality \nindividuals. They are the kind of people you would want in public \nservice, and certainly the kind of people you would want elected to \npublic office. Lloyd Bentsen won that race for the Senate. But George \nH.W. Bush also had an illustrious career to follow.\n  Lloyd Bentsen stayed in the Senate and became a leader. He was here \nfor 22 years. Everyone in Texas knew him, but he was also a national \nfigure. Lloyd Bentsen ran for President in 1976. He was the Democratic \ncandidate for Vice President in 1988. His illustrious public career \nconcluded with his service to our Nation as Secretary of the Treasury. \nHe served under President Clinton from 1993 to 1994. It was then that I \nwas able to run for and win the seat that he had held.\n  I have to say that when I was covering that Senate race in 1970, it \nwould never have occurred to me that I would succeed the man who won \nthat seat. I do remember that he came to my swearing in ceremony, which \nI thought was very gracious of him, and I thought it was so nice of him \nto wish me well. He wanted also to make sure I felt comfortable here, \nwhich, of course, I did. I have gotten to know Lloyd and B.A. Bentsen, \nhis beautiful wife, who has been by his side all of these years--in the \ngood days of public service when he was one of our country's great \nleaders, and during the time that he was so ill for so long. I saw B.A. \nat his side every time I saw Senator Bentsen, either in Houston or \nAustin or someplace in Texas.\n  He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom on August 11, 1999. \nLater today, I will introduce a joint resolution with Senator Cornyn \nhonoring the life and legacy of Lloyd Bentsen.\n  When people think of Lloyd Bentsen, if you talk to anybody on this \nfloor who served with him, or if you talk to anybody in Texas who was \none of his friends, or someone he knew, they always describe him as a \ngentleman, a person of the highest quality, exactly the kind of person \nyou want in public service--someone with integrity, always there doing \nthe right thing as he saw it, and always spending the time to do a \ngreat job for our country.\n  Our thoughts and prayers go out today to B.A. Bentsen and to Lloyd \nBentsen III and Lan Bentsen, the two sons of this great American. We \nwill introduce a resolution later today to pay tribute to him. I want \nhis family to know that our thoughts and prayers in this Senate are \nwith him and with them today.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to join my voice with those of my \ncolleagues in celebrating the life, and mourning the death, of one of \nthe political giants of our time: Lloyd Bentsen fellow Texan, son, \nhusband, father, friend, honored veteran, lawyer, county judge, \nCongressman, businessman, Senator, and at the peak of his career in \npublic service, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury.\n  It is difficult to capture in one brief statement the weight and the \nimpact of one man's life. But we can all be confident that the legacy \nleft by Lloyd Bentsen is one of which his family, his State, and his \ncountry can be remarkably proud.\n  Perhaps one important way to capture the meaning of his influence is \nto listen to those who have known or served with him or those who have \nhad the honor of calling him a friend. Today, the chorus of their \nvoices reminds us.\n  Texas State Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn said: ``Sen. Lloyd \nBentsen was a true Texas icon and a friend. He put Texans above \npolitics. He lifted all Texans.''\n  His former aide, and State Representative Richard Raymond said: ``He \ndidn't pass the buck. That's one of the things that stuck with me.''\n  We should all be fortunate as to be remembered so fondly, and so \nwell.\n  It is clear that Lloyd Bentsen lived a life of purpose; he certainly \nwasted no time making his mark on our country. Born in Mission, TX, on \nFebruary 11, 1921, Bentsen received his law degree from University of \nTexas Law School at Austin.\n  He served as a pilot in the U.S. Army Air Forces from 1942 to 1945, \nand reportedly flew 35 B-24 missions during 18 months of heavy combat. \nHe was put in charge of 600 men at the young age of 23, and was \npromoted to the rank of major. For his heroic service, Bentsen was \nawarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Air Medal with three \noak leaf clusters. By the end of his military service, he had reached \nthe rank of colonel.\n  Bentsen returned from the war to serve as county judge in Hidalgo \nfrom 1946 to 1948; then was elected in 1948 to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, where he served three terms. He then went on to pursue \na career in business, which he did for 16 years in Houston before being \nelected to the U.S. Senate in 1971.\n  His career, of course, also notably includes his party's nomination \nfor Vice President in 1988 a remarkable achievement, to be sure, as was \nhis tenure as the 69th U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, where he served \nwith distinction from January 1993 to December 1994.\n  Mr. President, today our country both celebrates the life and mourns \nthe death of this distinguished American, a great Texan, who dedicated \nhis life to public service. He was a powerful voice for the people he \nserved, and he will be deeply missed.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my sadness in \nlearning of the passing of our esteemed former colleague from Texas, \nSenator Lloyd Millard Bentsen, Jr. I am certain that I join all of our \ncolleagues in grieving the loss of this great American, and especially \nthose of us who had the honor to have served in this body with him.\n  Lloyd Bentsen was a good and a great man, and I had the opportunity \nto work with him closely many times over the 16 years we served here \ntogether. When I joined the Finance Committee in 1991, Senator Bentsen \nwas the chairman. As a new member of the committee, I appreciated the \nway Chairman Bentsen ran Finance in a bipartisan and fair way that \nreflected positively on the long and distinguished history of that \npanel and the spirit of which continues until today.\n  Many of us knew Senator Bentsen as a man of his word, and as a superb \ncommunicator. He was not a man of many words, but when he spoke, people \neverywhere stopped to listen. He spoke slowly and with great meaning, \nand he connected with those who heard him, whether they were a group of \nschoolchildren from Texas, his colleagues from his long years of \nservice in the House and the Senate, the financial markets that \nlistened to his every word as chairman of the Finance Committee and as \nSecretary of the Treasury, or the world's financial leaders, with whom \nhe consorted as the President's main economic spokesman.\n  Lloyd Bentsen was a hero, to his family, his constituents, his State, \nand to his country. As a young man, he served as a combat pilot in the \nEuropean theater during World War II, and he flew 35 missions in B-24s. \nLloyd was awarded the Air Medal with three Oak Leaf Clusters and the \nDistinguished Flying Cross. By the time he left military service, was \npromoted to a full colonel in the Air Force Reserve.\n  Lloyd Bentsen's natural leadership ability was evident early in life. \nAs a young man he earned the rank of Eagle Scout, and he graduated from \nthe University of Texas Law School by the time he was 21 years old. He \nthen joined the Army Air Corps and rose from a private to the rank of \nmajor and was given command of a squadron of\n\n[[Page S5029]]\n\n600 men at the age of 23. Our friend and colleague was truly a \nremarkable man.\n  After serving our country so valiantly during the war, Lloyd returned \nto his native Rio Grand Valley in Texas where he became a county judge \nand then ran successfully for the House, where he served for three \nterms. In 1955, he decided to leave public service temporarily and \nbegan an impressive career in business and finance in Houston, which \nended in 1970 when he decided to run for the Senate.\n  Mr. President, Lloyd Bentsen was one of the modern giants of the \nSenate. Of course, I did not always agree with him, or him me. However, \nI respected him. He was respected on both sides of the aisle, and by \nall who came to know him.\n  Many words come to my mind when I think of Senator Bentsen. He was \nbright. He was fair. He was serious. He was dedicated. He was \ndignified. The State of Texas and all America have lost a great son.\n  My heart goes out to Lloyd's wife, Beryl, and to their children, \ngrandchildren and other family members. May they find peace and joy in \ntheir memories and in knowing of the great contribution Lloyd gave to \nhis country.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I join my colleagues in tribute to my dear friend and \ntremendous public servant, Congressman, Senator, and Secretary Lloyd \nBentsen, on his recent passing. His tenure in Federal service is \nnotable and well documented three terms in the House of Representatives \nand four terms in the Senate representing the people of Texas and 2 \nyears as Secretary of the Treasury under former President Bill Clinton.\n  I remember Lloyd as a giant in the Senate leadership when I first \ncame to this body in 1990. He wielded the gavel at the Finance \nCommittee and had already ascended to national recognition as a \nformidable Vice Presidential nominee in 1988. He was a Senator who \nworked hard every day to benefit the people of Texas and of this \ncountry.\n  As a distinguished World War II veteran, Lloyd was always supportive \nof our veterans and fulfilling their urgent needs. He fought to \npreserve and protect women's rights, including the Equal Rights \nAmendment. He understood the needs of America's entrepreneurs and \nbusiness owners and carried his acumen in economic policy from the \nSenate into the Clinton administration.\n  Millie and I remember Lloyd and his wife B.A., from our years in the \nSenate together, with fondness. We join others in extending to his \nfamily our warmest wishes in this difficult time. We say farewell to a \ntrue statesman. This Nation is richer for his life and poorer for his \nloss.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 489) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am going to take some time tonight to \ninform my colleagues about some of the problems with the legislation \nbefore us. It is worse than you think, colleagues. The legislation has \nan incredible number of problems with it. Some, as I will point out \ntonight, can only be considered deliberate. Whereas on the one hand it \nhas nice words with good sounding phrases in it to do good things, on \nthe second hand it completely eviscerates that, oftentimes in a way \nthat only the most careful reading by a good lawyer would discover. So \nI feel like I have to fulfill my duty. I was on the Judiciary \nCommittee. We went into this. We tried to monitor it and study it and \nactually read this 614-page bill, and I have a responsibility and I am \ngoing to fulfill my responsibility.\n  I think the things I am saying tonight ought to disturb people. They \nought to be unhappy about it. It ought to make them consider whether \nthey want to vote for this piece of legislation that, in my opinion, \nshould never, ever become law.\n  I would also just point out I will be offering tomorrow, or soon, an \namendment to deal with the earned-income tax credit situation that is \nraised by this legislation, focusing on the amnesty in the bill and \nwhat will happen after amnesty is granted, before they become a full \ncitizen. The Congressional Budget Office has concluded that the earned-\nincome tax credit will pay out to those who came into our country \nillegally $29 billion over 10 years. The earned-income tax credit has \nbeen on the books for some time. It is a good bit larger than most \npeople think. The average recipient of it receives $1,700. Lowerincome \npeople get a larger amount. Over half the people who we expect will \nreceive amnesty are without a high school degree. They are receiving \nlower wages. They will be the ones who will particularly qualify for \nthis. This is a score that has been given to us by the group that is \nsupposed to score it--$29 billion will be paid out.\n  If they go all the way and become a citizen they will be entitled to \nthis like any other citizen, and they will be entitled to get it under \nmy amendment. But I do not believe we should award people who have \nentered our country illegally, submitted a false Social Security \nnumber, worked illegally--I do not believe we should reward them with \n$29 billion of the taxpayers' money. That is a lot of money.\n  I will also be offering a budget point of order, I or one of my \ncolleagues will, in the next day or so. We have been working on that. \nWe asked for a report. The Congressional Budget Office has concluded \nthat the budget point of order lies in the first 10 years of this bill. \nIt also concludes that it lies under the long-term provisions of the \nbudget points of order for expenditures in the outyears. They didn't \ngive us those numbers, but they said, without much work--they didn't \nhave to do much work--the numbers are going to be much worse in the \noutyears. It clearly would be a detriment to the Government and these \nfigures would exceed the budget, and a budget point of order would lie.\n  At the Heritage Foundation, Mr. Robert Rector, who is the expert who \ndealt with welfare, studied this. He was the architect of welfare \nreform who has done so much to improve America's welfare system and \nimprove incomes for low-income families. It really worked beautifully. \nHe was the architect of it. He says this bill represents the greatest \nincrease in welfare in 35 years. With the provisions and benefits that \nwill be in it, he estimates that year 10 through year 20, the cost \ncould be $50 to $60 billion a year to the taxpayers because it takes \nsome time for the people who are adjusting and becoming citizens and/or \nlegal permanent residents to really begin to make the claims.\n  CBO admits the numbers are going to surge in the outyears. He says it \nis $50 billion a year. If that is so--and he is not exaggerating the \nnumbers, because that is based solely on the amnesty provisions, not \nthe provisions that will allow 3 times to 4 times as many people to \ncome into the country legally in the next 20 years as come in today, \nand many of them will go on welfare because that whole system is not \nbased on identifying people with skills and educational levels that \nwould indicate they would be more than low-wage workers--so it could \nreally be more than that. But $50 billion a year over 10 years is $500 \nbillion. That is a half a trillion dollars, and that is why Mr. Rector \nsaid this legislation is a fiscal catastrophe. This is a man whose \nopinions and ideas and research this Congress, and particularly the \nRepublicans, utilized to hammer away, time and time again, year after \nyear, to get welfare reform.\n  It finally happened. It worked just like he said. The predictions of \ndisaster made against his recommendations proved to be false.\n  He is saying that about this. So this is not a technical point of \norder. It represents an attempt to save the fiscal soundness of the \nbudget of the United States.\n  I want to take some moments here to deal with some problems with the \nlegislation. The American people are suspicious of us. They were \npromised in 1986, after years of urging the Government, the President \nand the Congress, promised to fix our borders and end illegal \nimmigration. In exchange for that they acquiesced and went along with \namnesty in 1986. They said there were a million, 2 million here who \nwould claim it. It turned out 3 million claimed amnesty after 1986. \nThat ought to give us some pause about the projections that we would \nhave. We have 11 million people here now and only 8 or so will seek \namnesty under it. That ought to give us some pause there. It may well \nbe above the number.\n  So the American people are suspicious and they are dubious and they \nare watching us carefully, and they should. Let me tell you some of the \nthings that are in the legislation that indicate a lack of respect for \nthe American people, really. Some of these are some of the reasons I \nsaid the other day the Senate should be ashamed of itself, the way we \nare moving this bill.\n  My staff, working up some of these comments, came up with a title--\nmaybe at my suggestion--``Sneaky Lawyer Tricks'' that are in the bill. \nI will let you decide if that is a fair description of what is in it. I \nwill go down through some of the matters that are important. There are \nothers I could complain about for which we will not have time.\n  First, the legislation talks about title IV of the bill. That title \nIV of the\n\n[[Page S5031]]\n\nbill defines the new H2-C program as a temporary guest worker program. \nThose are in big print in the bill: Temporary guest workers.\n  That sounds like a temporary worker, doesn't it? It sounds like a \nguest, like somebody who stays in your bedroom for a weekend, a guest, \ntemporary guest.\n  Interesting, section 408 sets out the temporary guest worker visa \nprogram task force. So a little further down it has what is called a \ntemporary guest worker visa program task force. So you would think they \nare writing in this section, would you not, something about the task \nforce. But this, down in that section, this task force establishes the \nnumber of H2C visas that may be issued annually and subsection (h) is \nwhere the writers of the bill hid the provision that actually \ntransforms these so-called temporary workers into legal, permanent \nresidents. OK? So all the big print, ``temporary guest workers,'' \n``temporary guest worker task force,'' and then you read in that \nsection down there that it effectively converts them from temporary \nworkers to legal permanent residents, granting them a green card.\n  It is tucked away in a title that has nothing to do with substance of \nthat matter. So I am pleased that my staff and others who have been \nreading the bill have discovered that. It wasn't discovered early on in \nthe process.\n  Family members of H-2C visa holder need not be healthy. Under current \nlaw, aliens must prove that they are admissible and meet certain health \nstandards. Many times, visa applicants must have a medical exam to show \nthat they do not have a communicable disease. They have to be up-to-\ndate on immunizations, and cannot have mental disorders. Spouses and \nchildren of H-2C visa holders, however, are not required to have a \nmedical exam before receiving a visa. I have an amendment to fix this \nthat I hope is accepted.\n  The work requirement for a blue card can be satisfied in a matter of \nhours. Under the AgJOBS component of the substitute, illegal alien \nagricultural workers who have worked 150 ``workdays'' in agriculture \nover the last 2 years will receive a ``blue card,'' allowing them to \nlive and work permanently in the U.S. However, because current law \ndefines an agricultural ``workday'' as 1 hour of work per day--the bill \nlanguage restates that definition on page 397--an alien who has worked \nfor as little as 150 hours--there are 168 hours in a week--in \nagriculture over the last 2 years will qualify for a blue card.\n  Blue card aliens can only be fired for just cause, unlike an American \ncitizen worker who is likely under an employment at will agreement with \nthe agricultural employer.\n\n       No alien granted blue card status may be terminated from \n     employment by any employer during the period of blue card \n     status except for just cause.\n\n  Because blue card aliens are not limited to working in agriculture, \nthis employment requirement will follow the alien at their second and \nthird jobs as well. The bill goes as far as setting up an arbitration \nprocess for blue card aliens who allege they have been terminated \nwithout just cause. Furthermore, the bill requires the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to pay the fee and expenses of the arbitrator. \nAmerican citizens do not have a right to this arbitration process, why \nare we setting up an arbitration process for blue card aliens paid for \nby the American taxpayer.\n  Regarding free legal counsel, the AgJOBS amendment goes further than \npaying for arbitrators, it also provides free legal counsel to illegal \naliens who want to receive this amnesty. The AgJOBS amendment \nspecifically states that recipients of ``funds under the Legal Services \nCorporation Act'' shall not be prevented ``from providing legal \nassistance directly related to an application for adjustment of status \nunder this section.'' Interestingly, page 414 of the bill requires the \nalien to have an attorney file the application for him. Not only will \nAgJOBS give amnesty to 1.5 million illegal aliens, it would have the \nAmerican taxpayer pay the legal bills of those illegal aliens. This is \nunbelievable and unacceptable. We should not be rewarding illegal \naliens who break our laws with free legal counsel and a direct path to \ncitizenship.\n\n  Under this bill a temporary worker is eligible for a green card if \nthey, in part, maintained their H-2C status. In order to maintain this \nstatus the ``temporary'' worker may not be unemployed for a period of \n60 continuous days. This means that a temporary worker only has to work \n1 day in every 59 days to maintain status. This employment requirement \nonly requires that they work about 1 day every 2 months.\n  In this bill, an alien who has been here between 2 and 5 years is not \neligible for asylum if they have persecuted others on account of race, \nreligion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or \npolitical opinion. However, an alien here more than 5 years who has \npersecuted others on account of race, religion, nationality, membership \nin a particular social group, or political opinion gets amnesty under \nthis bill. There is no specific ineligibility for such conduct. Since \nit is included under the ``mandatory deferred departure'' section, a \ncourt will interpret this to mean we purposefully left it out of the \n``earned amnesty.'' I cannot imagine why the drafters of this bill \nwould allow persecutors to benefit from amnesty.\n  The bill's future flow ``guest worker'' program in title IV leaves no \nillegal alien behind--it is not limited to people outside the United \nStates who want to come here to work in the future, but includes \nillegal aliens currently present in the United States that do not \nqualify for the amnesty programs in title VI, including aliens here for \nless than 2 years. Under the bill language, you can qualify for the new \nH-2C program to work as a low-skilled permanent immigrant, even if you \nare unlawfully present inside the United States today. The bill \nspecifically says:\n\n       In determining the alien's admissibility as an H-2C \n     nonimmigrant . . . paragraphs (5), (6)(A), (7), (9)(B), and \n     (9) (C) of section 212(a) may be waived for conduct that \n     occurred before the effective date. . . .\n\n  By waving these grounds of inadmissibility, the new H-2C program is \nspecifically intended to apply to illegal aliens who were already \nremoved from the United States and illegally reentered.\n  The bill tells DHS to accept ``just and reasonable inferences'' from \nday labor centers and the alien's ``sworn declaration'' as evidence \nthat the alien has met the amnesty's work requirement. Under the bill, \nthe alien meets the ``burden of proving by a preponderance of the \nevidence that the alien has satisfied the [work] requirements'' if the \nalien can demonstrate employment ``as a matter of just and reasonable \ninference.'' An alien can present ``conclusive evidence'' of employment \nin the United States by presenting documents from social security, IRS, \nemployer, or a ``union or day labor center.'' The bill then states \nthat:\n\n       It is the intent of Congress that the [work] requirement . \n     . . be interpreted and implemented in a manner that \n     recognizes and takes into account the difficulties \n     encountered by aliens in obtaining evidence of employment due \n     to the undocumented status of the alien.\n\n  If these lax standards can't be met, the bill makes sure that the \nalien can get what they need by allowing them to submit ``sworn \ndeclarations for each period of employment.'' Putting these together \nthe alien must prove it is more likely than not that there is a just \nand reasonable inference that the alien was employed. I don't know what \nthis means other than DHS will have to accept just about anything as \nproof of employment.\n  Regarding in-State tuition for illegal aliens, current law provides \nthat:\n\n       [A]n alien who is not lawfully present in the United States \n     shall not be eligible on the basis of residence within a \n     State (or a political subdivision) for any postsecondary \n     education benefit unless a citizen or national of the United \n     States is eligible for such a benefit (in no less an amount, \n     duration, and scope) without regard to whether the citizen or \n     national is such a resident.\n\n  The DREAM Act would eliminate this provision and allow illegal alien \ncollege and university students to be eligible for in-state tuition \nwithout affording out-of-state citizen students the same opportunity. \nThus, the University of Alabama could offer in-state tuition to illegal \nalien students while requiring citizens residing in Mississippi to pay \nthe much higher out-of-state tuition rates.\n  Allowing all illegal aliens enrolled in college to receive in-state \ntuition rates means that while American citizens from 49 other states \nhave to pay out-of-state tuition rates to send their kids to\n\n[[Page S5032]]\n\nUVA, people who have illegally immigrated to this country might not. \nOut-of-state tuition rates range from 2 to 3\\1/2\\ times the in-state \nresident tuition rate.\n  Regarding Federal financial aid for illegal aliens, while the Pell \ngrants provision was removed from the bill, Stafford student loans and \nwork study remains in.\n  Under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, legal \npermanent residents and certain other eligible non-citizens are \neligible to compete with American citizens for certain types of higher \neducation assistance.\n  The DREAM Act makes illegal aliens eligible for several types of \nhigher education assistance offered under the Higher Education Act--\nincluding Stafford student loans and work study programs.\n  There is another matter, another sleight of hand I suggest.\n  Amnesty both for legal aliens who have been here for more than 5 \nyears, and those in the next category who are here from 2 to 5 years, \ndon't really require that those aliens have to be continuously present \nin the United States. That is what it says in plain language.\n  It starts off that you have to be continuously present in the United \nStates. But, once again, is that what it really means?\n  The bill allows these aliens to depart and to return after a brief \ndeparture. This allows illegal aliens who broke our laws by entering \nthe United States and who have left and returned illegally perhaps \nmultiple times--and each time violating our laws by entering the United \nStates--to qualify for this amnesty.\n  I am not sure how these departures and illegal entries can be \nconsidered innocent since the illegal aliens broke U.S. laws by \nreentering. But it will absolve them from any of these multiple \nviolations. That is a huge loophole.\n  This is even more important. An alien may not have had deep roots in \nour country. They may have spent a lot of their time away from our \ncountry. But they heard about this amnesty, and if they can get in the \ncountry, then they will say they have been here continuously, perhaps.\n  Somebody says: No. We found out you were back home.\n  He says: That was brief. I want my amnesty.\n  We object. I am going to take you to court, or you prove it, or I say \nI have been here. That is what I say. It is going to be very difficult \nto prove that.\n  There are provisions in the bill that deal with U.S. worker \nprotections. The bill purports to protect U.S. workers from the flood \nof cheap labor that might occur by requiring employers to prove to the \nDepartment of Labor that good-faith efforts have been taken, first, to \nrecruit U.S. workers for a job before they go out and hire someone from \noutside of our country. They ought to at least find out if there are \nAmerican workers who want the job.\n  Then they are supposed to notify the Secretary of Labor and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security when one of these H-2C workers is \n``separated from employment.''\n  I am quoting that--``separated from employment'' requires notice.\n  We heard defenders of the bill say: Well, if you are not continuously \nworking, they will notify the Department of Labor and you have to leave \nthe country.\n  Have you heard that? You have to be continuously working, you can't \nbe not working, or else you are not entitled to the benefits of this H-\n2C provision. The separation from employment notification is supposed \nto help the Department of Labor and Homeland Security know which people \nhave been out of work, and if they are out of work under the bill for \nmore than 60 days, their visas are supposed to be revoked.\n  OK. That is supposed to be a provision that makes sure people who \ncome here are really working. Sounds good. But under the provisions of \nthe bill, the term ``separation from employment''--you can find that on \npage 236. As defined, the term means virtually zero.\n  As defined, ``separation from employment is anything other than \ndischarged for inadequate performance, violation of workplace rules, \ncause, voluntary departure, voluntary retirement, or expiration of a \ngrant or contract.''\n  Furthermore, it does not include those situations where the worker is \noffered--even if they do not take it--another position by the same \nemployer.\n  Is that what I just read to you? It is hard to believe--that you are \nsupposed to notify them, except you don't need to notify them if they \nhave left work, if they left work because they were discharged for \ninadequate performance, fired, or violation of workplace rules, or for \njust cause, or involuntary departure, involuntary retirement, or \nexpiration of the contract. You don't have to notify them about those \nthings.\n  What would you notify them for, pray tell? That is ``flabber'' \nwritten. I submit whoever wrote this bill--it was not the Senators, I \ncan assure you of that--ought to be ashamed of themselves.\n  That was a deliberate evisceration of what on the surface sounds like \na legitimate provision, totally unenforceable. There is no way under \nthis provision DHS or the Department of Labor will be provided \ninformation about people who have been terminated from employment.\n  Protections for U.S. workers--that is one of the goals the bill says \nit reaches. Under the bill, employers must prove that hiring an H-2C \nworker will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of \nworkers in the United States, and that they did not and will not cause \nseparation from employment of a U.S. worker employed by an employer \nwithin the 180-day period beginning 90 days before this H-2C petition \nis filed.\n  Employers must also prove that they made good-faith efforts to \nrecruit U.S. workers before they can hire an H-2C worker. That sounds \ngood but, once again, things are not what they seem.\n  As defined on page 263 of the bill, a U.S. worker includes not only \ncitizens, it includes legal alien workers. And, amazingly, it also \nincludes aliens who are ``otherwise authorized under this act to be \nemployed in the United States.''\n  In other words, this provision provides protection for those who have \nbeen given legal status under amnesty, over and above, and provides \nthem the same protection we provide to American citizens who are \nsupposed to be given some protection against the flood of foreign \nlabor.\n  You have heard the deal. You have heard it said that the people who \ncome to get amnesty--this is almost humorous--have got to pay their \ntaxes. That is part of some sort of punishment. They make it sound \nlike, in some way, you earned the right to be forgiven of your crime by \npaying your taxes.\n  Everybody is supposed to pay their taxes. For heaven's sake, we are \nall supposed to pay taxes. This is nothing but doing what you would \nexpect any American to do. But under the bill, things are, once again, \nnot quite what their sponsors have said, or what the language might \nlead you to believe. You have to read it carefully.\n  Under the bill, an illegal alien who is getting amnesty only has to \npay back taxes for the period of employment required in the INA, \nsection 245(B)(A)(1)(d).\n  This is on page 347 of the bill, if people would like to look. These \nare actually just 3 of the 5 years between April 5, 2001, and April 5, \n2002.\n  So the plain language of the bill doesn't require them to pay all \ntheir back taxes at all. They get an option to pick and choose which 3 \nyears they want to pay their taxes. Presumably, they can forget and not \npay the taxes for the high years. How silly is that?\n  This is really important. I think most Americans are pretty \nsophisticated. They know how the system works and the massive numbers \nwe are talking about--the burden of proving payment of back taxes is on \nthe Internal Revenue Service, pages 351 and 411. They have to prove it. \nHow are they going to prove it? The IRS must prove that they owe the \ntaxes. How will the IRS know if an illegal alien has worked off the \nbooks thereby avoiding paying any taxes?\n  This is really an utter joke. It is a promotion put forth by those in \nsupport of the bill that I have heard repeatedly--that somehow it is \nsupposed to make us believe that people have earned their right to be \nforgiven for violating the law, and they only have to pay back 3 of the \nlast 5 years in taxes.\n  What about American citizens? Do you think you can go down to Uncle\n\n[[Page S5033]]\n\nSam, Mr. President, and have 5 years of income and then be able to pick \nand choose which years you pay and you only pay 3 out of your last 5 \nyears? Why don't we let every American citizen have this benefit? Why \ndo we only give it to people who entered the country illegally? You \ntell me.\n  What about background checks? The bill requires the Department of \nHomeland Security to do them on illegal aliens. That is going to be \nexceedingly difficult. They are required to do it within 90 days. They \nhave to protect our homeland. They have to handle all these provisions. \nI don't think it can ever be done. That may sound like something \nimportant is going to happen, that all the people here illegally will \nhave their backgrounds checked promptly, but the truth is that is not \ngoing to get done in that timeframe.\n  How about fines? Let me state who they want to fine. A Federal agent, \ntrying to do his duty to enforce the law and investigate fraudulent \ninformation provided by an illegal alien in their amnesty application, \nfor law enforcement purposes, what happens to them if they take the \namnesty application and actually examine it and find out it is \nfraudulent? What do they do? The agent would be fined $10,000. That \nfine, I note, is five times the amount the alien is able to post, \n$2,000, to get his amnesty from his illegal acts.\n  There is no reason in the world Federal law enforcement officers \nshould be barred from investigating and utilizing amnesty applications \nto prosecute criminal activities in America. There is no reason this \nought to be protected other than it looks to me that some clever lawyer \nhas realized if they can get this in the bill people can file false \namnesty applications all day and no one will ever be able to \ninvestigate. Isn't that horrible? That is what it looks like to me. Is \nthat a sneaky lawyer trick? I ask you to make that judgment. It does \nnot sound good to me.\n  Page 363 of the bill. Look it up.\n  How about the employers? They get tax amnesty. Employers of aliens \napplying for adjustment of status--amnesty--``shall not be subject to \ncivil and criminal tax liability relating directly to the employment of \nsuch an alien.'' That means a business that hired illegal workers does \nnot have to pay the taxes they should have paid. Why? This encourages \nemployers to violate our tax laws and not pay what they owe the Federal \nGovernment. They are excusing these employers and giving them amnesty \nfrom not withholding taxes. That is a very bad thing. Every American \nbusiness knows they have to pay their withholding taxes.\n  What about two small businesses, one hiring illegal aliens not paying \nSocial Security, not paying withholding to the Government, and paying \nsome low wage, and another one across the street doing all the right \nthings, hiring American citizens, perhaps paying higher wages and \nwithholding money and sending his Social Security money to the Federal \nGovernment, what message does that send to the good guy, to give \ncomplete amnesty to the guy who has manipulated the system and gotten \naway perhaps with tens of thousands of dollars in benefits that his \ncompetitor did not get?\n  You cannot play games with the law like this. You cannot pick and \nchoose people and allow them unilaterally to not have to pay their \ntaxes.\n  What about illegal alien protection? The alien and their families who \nfile applications for amnesty ``shall not be detained, determined \ninadmissible, deported, or removed until their applications are finally \nadjudicated, unless they commit a future act that renders them \nineligible with amnesty.'' With tens of millions of applications, this \namnesty, this provision essentially guarantees an illegal alien years \nof protection in the United States, even if they do not qualify for the \namnesty.\n  We hear they have to pay the fine, the $2,000 fine, but it is not due \nright away. For those in the amnesty program, illegal aliens are \nsupposed to pay a fine of $2,000. However, the way the bill is written, \nmany illegal aliens may not have to pay the fine for 8 years. The bill \nsays that the $2,000 fine has to be paid ``prior to adjudication.'' It \nis not required at the first. If it is left the way it is, the illegal \nalien can live, work and play in our country and not pay a cent of his \nfine for years. Perhaps they may even decide they do not want to pay it \nat all. This puts a financial burden on local taxpayers for the health, \neducation, and the infrastructure costs that are not reimbursed for \nabout 5 or 10 years.\n  There are a number of other items. However, it is late; I will make \nthese remarks part of the Record and will not belabor these points.\n  It is clear the people who drafted this legislation had an agenda and \nthe agenda was not to meet the expectations of the American people. The \nagenda was to create a facade and appearance of enforcement, an \nappearance of toughness in some instances. When you get into the meat \nof the provisions and get into the bill and study it, tucked away here \nand there are laws that eviscerate and eliminate the real effectiveness \nof those provisions. It was carefully done and deliberately done. This \nis a bill that should not become law. It is a bill that will come back \nto be an embarrassment to our Members who have supported it. I wish it \nwere not so. I know how these things happen. You do not always have \ntime to do everything you want to do. You try to do something you think \nis right, but ultimately in a bill as important as this one that has \ntremendous impact on the future of our country and our legal system and \nour commitment to the rule of law, we ought to get it right. We ought \nnot to let this one slide by. It is not acceptable to say, let's just \npass something and we will send it to the House and maybe the House of \nRepresentatives will stand up and stop it and fix it. That is not \nacceptable for the great Senate of the United States.\n  I strongly believe we are not ready to pass the bill. We are not \nready to give it final consideration. I strongly believe it is a \nhorrendous violation of the Committee on the Budget and that it is, as \nMr. Rector said, a fiscal catastrophe if passed, and as such we ought \nnot to waive the Budget Act but pull the bill from the floor and fix \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/23/senate-section/article/S5033-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 8:30 A.M TOMORROW\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
